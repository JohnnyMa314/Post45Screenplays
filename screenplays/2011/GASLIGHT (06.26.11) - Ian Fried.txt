           FADE IN:

           EXT. NORTH SEA -- NIGHT

           Gale force winds shoot horizontal sheets of icy rain 
           across an impossibly large sea squall.

           SUPER-TITLE:  “NORTH SEA, THE COAST OF ENGLAND, 1899.”

           Pulling through the tempest, a BARQUENTINE RUSSIAN 
           IMMIGRATION SHIP wrestles over and under enormous swells 
           of churning ocean water.

           BOOM!  

           A hot fork of blue lightning stabs at the vessel’s 
           violently flapping canvas sails, igniting them in a flash 
           of brilliant sparks.

           EXT. CROW’S NEST, SHIP -- NIGHT

           Perched above the vessel’s decks, a SAILOR watches as 
           tall curtains of orange flame quickly climb up the sails 
           toward him.

           Out of options, he thrusts himself from the nest, 
           plunging down through the flames and into the briny 
           depths.

           EXT. DECK -- NIGHT

           It’s pandemonium.

           Tall black waves of salt water crash into the ship from 
           every direction, heaving silver fish tangled in kelp over 
           the splintered wooden deck.

           A square-jawed FIRST MATE barks in Russian at FOUR 
           DRENCHED SAILORS scrambling to man the sails, but it’s no 
           use.  

           Filled with worry, the First Mate quickly turns to enter 
           the ship.

           INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS -- CONTINUOUS

           The man sops his way through the creaky flooded hallways, 
           slipping over the floors on his way to the CAPTAIN’S 
           CABIN.

           The First Mate quickly enters -
                                   6/27/11

           INT. CAPTAIN’S CABIN -- NIGHT

           A gas lamp weakly flickers light over a lacquered desk 
           spread with MARITIME CHARTS, NAVIGATIONAL INSTRUMENTS and 
           an opened SHIP’S LOG -

           Which the CAPTAIN’s lifeless body is hunched over, quill 
           still in hand.

           Disturbed, the First Mate pulls the Captain’s stiff, 
           glass-eyed body from the desk, regarding what he finds in 
           stunned horror -

           The Captain’s remains have been gruesomely slashed to 
           marbled ribbons of red and yellow flesh.

           Shaken, the First Mate immediately removes a RIFLE hung 
           over the desk.

           INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS -- CONTINUOUS

           Weapon pointed, the First Mate quickly searches the dim, 
           water-soaked hallways for the Captain’s killer. 

           After a few tense moments, the First Mate sees an ominous 
           SHADOW play over a far wall.  He sprints toward it, 
           rounding a corner to LOCKED DOUBLE-DOORS. 

           He quickly unseals the doors, revealing...

           INT. SHIP’S HOLD -- CONTINUOUS

           ...a wet, murky, cavernous space filled with scores of 
           sickly, boil-covered IMMIGRANTS.  

           A few drowned, bloated corpses slide across the floors as 
           the ship continues wobbling back and forth.

           The First Mate shakily points his rifle about, SCREAMING.

                                 FIRST MATE
                               (in Russian)
                        Someone has murdered the Captain!  
                               (cocking his gun)
                        Whomever’s responsible is to make 
                        himself known at once!

           Teeth chattering, he passes over the sallow, wrinkled 
           faces of peasants desperately clawing at his clothing, 
           pleading their innocence.

           Just then -

           The double doors at the other end of the hold SLAM SHUT!
                                                            (CONTINUED)
                                   6/27/11
           CONTINUED:

           Stunned, the First Mate’s weapon slips from his hands, 
           disappearing into the inky water. 

           He slowly turns to face the doors, when -

           A PHANTOM silhouetted in shadow slinks out of the 
           darkness toward him.

           The First Mate’s eyes widen in terror at the sight of the 
           wraith, mouth quivering.  He stumbles back, attempting to 
           SCREAM, just as -

           A SPLATTER of dark blood splashes across his face!

           The immigrants watch on in horror, as long shadows cast 
           by the phantasm descend upon the sailor’s felled remains.

           Another shock of blue lighting gives way to an ear-
           splitting clap of THUNDER.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LONDON (AERIAL) -- EARLY MORNING

           Long sheets of rain soak an industrialized sprawl of 
           gargoyle guarded belfries and crumbling rooftops.

           Pockets of dense, choking fog creep across BIG BEN’s 
           glowing clock-face, filtered through thousands of amber 
           gas lamps flickering at street level.  

           Just beyond the city, VARIOUS SHIPS bob and sway, 
           lurching across the chilly water toward the rotten wooden 
           docks of the city’s harbor.

           Somewhere in the distance, a CHURCH BELL tolls.

           SUPER-TITLE:  “LONDON, ENGLAND.”

           EXT. ALLEYWAY, EAST END -- EARLY MORNING

           The sun’s yet to rise.  It’s misting, dew clinging to 
           everything it touches.

           Half a dozen burly METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICERS in long, 
           wool trench coats and black custodian helmets anxiously 
           guard a BODY covered in a sheet.

           A stout LEADER OFFICER swats at a MOSQUITO, nervously 
           removing a pocket watch from his vest.

           The Lead Officer snaps the timepiece closed, the 
           CLATTERING of horse hooves signaling the arrival of a 
           POLICE CARRIAGE.

           Out steps CHIEF INSPECTOR DONALD “MONSTER HUNTER” SWANSON 
           (30s).  A serious man in a bowler hat, vest and 
           waistcoat.  A thin scar runs vertically down one eye.

           A hush breaks out across the other officers.  

           The Lead Officer goes to meet Swanson, a bit intimidated.

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Chief Inspector Swanson.  How good 
                        of you to come.

           The two men walk toward the crime scene.

                                 SWANSON
                        I understand you asked for me 
                        specifically?

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Seemed prudent - you being the 
                        closest to solvin’ the Whitechapel 
                        murders.  Given what my men’ve 
                        discovered, there can be little 
                        doubt of the Ripper’s return.

                                 SWANSON
                               (skeptically)
                        A bit premature, wouldn’t you say?

           The Lead Officer nods ahead.

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Found the poor thing in the 
                        alleyway not an hour ago.  Was 
                        walking home from church.

           The two men approach the BODY covered in a sheet.  

           A pair of officers slide the cloth away.

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Gruesome, this one is.

           A beautiful, maroon-haired woman with smooth creamy skin 
           has been murdered.  

           Her clothes torn and muddied.  Corpse wilted.  Two large, 
           symmetrically CIRCULAR WOUNDS bore deep into her neck.

           Swanson leans down, looking her over.  

           His eyes dart across her frame, soaking in every detail.  
           He notices roughly pressed GOLD COINS spilled around her 
           body.

                        Not a pence was purloined, sir.

           Swanson inspects one of the coins.

                                 SWANSON
                        This isn’t local currency.

           Swanson’s distracted by the other officers, who have 
           begun swatting at a swarm of MOSQUITOS.  

           He feels one BUZZ at his ear slaps it, looking down to 
           the corpse.

                                 SWANSON
                        Unusual.  No mosquitos on the 
                        body.

           Swanson peers into a corner of the alley.  A few yards 
           from the corpse, a much smaller OBJECT is covered in 
           another sheet.

                                 SWANSON
                        What’s over there?

           The Lead Officer swallows hard, crossing himself.

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Work of the devil, you ask me.

           Swanson goes to the object and pulls the sheet from it, 
           uncovering a grisly sight. 

           A large, brass-topped MASON JAR filled to the brim with 
           congealed blood lies beneath it.  Hundreds of mosquitos 
           desperately attempt to puncture its crystalline outsides.

           Swanson bats at the jar, momentarily dispersing the 
           insects long enough to read a HANDWRITTEN LABEL stretched 
           across it:  “LUCILLE WESTENRA.”

           The other officers look on in disgust.  

           Swanson lifts the jar to his face, which warps behind the 
           receptacle.

                                 SWANSON
                        Not a drop spilled.

           Two PHOTOGRAPHERS unexpectedly break through the men.  
           Photographic flash powder EXPLODES illuminating the 
           disturbing scene in a halo of white light.

           One of the photographers bolts away into an adjacent 
           alleyway.

           Swanson immediately shouts to the other officers.

                                 SWANSON
                        Don’t let them leave!

           He turns to the Lead Officer.

                                 SWANSON
                        See to it the body is taken to St. 
                        Mary’s with haste.

           Swanson climbs the stairs to his police carriage, turning 
           to the Lead Officer. 

                                 SWANSON
                        And Constable, do your part to see 
                        the other officers keep quiet.  

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Understood.

                                 SWANSON
                        Scotland Yard will be in touch.

           The Lead Officer and his men watch as Swanson’s police 
           carriage pulls away.  

           A loud CRACK of lightning fractures the sky, giving way 
           to another deluge of rain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           An ornate brick building overlooking the Thames River.

           Swanson ascends the stone steps leading up the edifice, 
           past a bronze plaque:  “SCOTLAND YARD: CRIMINAL

           INT. SWANSON’S OFFICE -- LATER

           An elegant study wrapped in cherry mahogany and neatly

           Swanson views another rendering he’s completed of Lucy 
           Westenra’s neck.

           There’s a loud KNOCK at the door.  Swanson switches off 
           his gramophone.

                                 SWANSON
                        Come in.

           In enters a large, thick chopped man in a bowler hat, 
           COMMISSIONER EDWARD BRADFORD (50s).  He doesn’t look 
           happy.

                                 SWANSON
                        Morning, Commissioner Bradford.  
                        How are we today?

           The man’s fatty jowls hang over his tight collar, 
           undulating as he speaks.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Been bloody better.

           Bradford slams a copy of the TIMES LONDON onto Swanson’s 
           desk.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Will be in the rest of the

           Swanson pulls the newspaper to his face, taking in the 
           headline:  “JACK’S BACK?: GHASTLY MURDER IN EAST END 
           RAISES QUESTIONS.”

           The front page sports a harsh black and white ambrotype 
           of the murder.

           Busy, Swanson dips a steel tip pen into an inkwell and 
           continues illustrating.

           Bradford removes a clay pipe from his vest and strikes a 
           match. 

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        You mind?

                                 SWANSON
                        By all means.

           Bradford draws heavily on the pipe, exhaling a long plume 
           of smoke.  Relief washes over him.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        You’re the best we’ve got old boy.  
                        New century coming.  Yard needs 
                        more men like you.

           Swanson keeps drawing, half listening.

                                 SWANSON
                        Something on your mind, 
                        Commissioner?

           Bradford takes another long pull from his pipe, hesitant.  

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        I want you to speak with him.

                                 SWANSON
                        Who?

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Patient 1167.

           Swanson’s pen stops, spurting a jet of ink across his 
           sketch.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        He’s the closest thing we’ve got 
                        to whatever’s out there.

                                 SWANSON
                        You can’t be serious?

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        I understand what you went 
                        through.  The sacrifices.  God 
                        knows.  
                                                            (CONTINUED)

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Swanson’s tone becomes gravely serious.

                                 SWANSON
                        No you don’t, Edward.

           Bradford exhales a breath of smoke.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Maybe you’re right.  I’ll give it 
                        to Abberline, then.  Next best.  

           He heads for the door.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        ‘Course we all remember how he 
                        bungled the Sweeny Todd inquiry.
                        No matter.  Just means more 
                        killin’ for whoever did this.

           Swanson raises a hand in protest.

                                 SWANSON
                        Stop.

           Bradford keeps his back turned, expectantly biting down 
           on the bit of his pipe.

                                 SWANSON
                        Where’s he being kept now?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CARFAX ABBEY -- AFTERNOON

           Swanson’s police carriage pulls past a spiked metal gate 
           to the face of an expansive, imposing VICTORIAN MANSION.  

           A NURSE wearing a lace white gown, apron and cap 
           approaches from its entrance.

                                 NURSE
                        Afternoon, Chief Inspector.  I’ll 
                        take you to Dr. Seward at once.

           INT. CARFAX ABBEY -- CONTINUOUS

           The manor’s opulent interior belies its harsh outsides.  

           Fine floral wallpaper over which Romantic oil paintings 
           have been hung.  Ornate tapestries sitting beneath lush, 
           velvety chaise lounges.  A fire roaring at one end.

           Swanson follows the nurse, confused.

                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                 SWANSON
                        This is the asylum?

                                 NURSE
                        Heavens no, sir.  The sanitarium 
                        sits below doctor’s quarters.

           They turn a corner, coming to the face of a large 
           lacquered door:  “OFFICE OF - DR. JOHN SEWARD, M.D.”

           The nurse opens the door...

           INT. SEWARD’S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

           ...interrupting DR. JOHN SEWARD (30s), tall and sickly - 
           clothed in an open dress shirt with its sleeves rolled.

           He’s in a state of pure ecstasy.  A clear rubber 
           tourniquet is tied around the doctor’s arm.  Milky, used 
           bottles of MORPHINE and spent needles clutter his desk.

           The doctor quickly pulls down his sleeves. 

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Bollocks, I said I’d not wanted to 
                        be disturbed!

           He rises to his feet, slicking back his hair, regaining 
           his composure at the sight of Inspector Swanson.  Seward 
           has a condescending, haughty way about him.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Apologies.  You must be the great 
                        Inspector Swanson.  

                                 SWANSON
                        Chief Inspector.

           Seward looks miffed.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        My mistake.  Please, have a seat.

           Seward clears the detritus from his desk and motions for 
           the nurse to leave, ushering Swanson to a chair.

                                 SWANSON
                        How much did Commissioner Bradford 
                        explain to you about my visit?

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Just that you had urgent business 
                        with a patient of mine.

                        You don’t read the papers?

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        I’m afraid my occupation leaves me 
                        little time for extracurriculars.

                                 SWANSON
                        A woman named Lucille Westenra was 
                        murdered early this morning.

           Seward falls back in his chair, emotional.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Lucy?

                                 SWANSON
                        You knew her?

           Seward contemplates the news, wild swings of emotion 
           flooding his morphine wracked body.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Ages ago.  We were to be wed.

                                 SWANSON
                        I’m sorry for your loss.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Ships passing in the night.  Part 
                        of life’s mysteries I suppose.

           Seward snaps to attention.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        And to whom will the pleasure of 
                        your company be received this day?

                                 SWANSON
                        Patient 1167.

           Seward sinks back into his chair.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        I’m afraid you’re wasting your 
                        time, Chief Inspector.  Lunatic’s 
                        barely spoken since arriving here.

                                 SWANSON
                        I’ve been asked by my superiors to 
                        make an attempt at questioning 
                        him.  A formality.  I’m sure you 
                        understand.

                        Surely you’ve a better use of your 
                        time?

           Swanson rises to his feet, buttoning his jacket.

                                 SWANSON
                        Orders are orders I’m afraid.

           Seward begrudgingly throws on a white doctor’s coat.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Follow me then.

           INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR -- UNDERGROUND -- CONTINUOUS

           The two men descend the spiral stone bowels of the 
           asylum, the flicker of gaslight dancing across each 
           brick.

           Swanson removes a silver finish pistol from his vest, 
           carefully checking it.  Satisfied, he tucks the weapon 
           back into his coat.

                                 SWANSON
                        It’s my understanding 1167 has 
                        been incarcerated at numerous 
                        facilities.  How long has he been 
                        here?

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        We inherited him two years ago 
                        from another hospital.  One ill-
                        equipped to deal with such a 
                        prolific serial murderer.  Seven 
                        he slaughtered, I believe it was. 

                                 SWANSON
                        Eight.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        At any rate, our own attempts to 
                        rehabilitate him ceased after the 
                        first month of his stay with us.

                                 SWANSON
                        For what reason?

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        The patient severely injured one 
                        of our orderlies.

           INT. EXPERIMENTATION PEN -- LOWER LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS

           A grimier area of cracked ivory tiling.  Grit weeping 
           from the walls.  A series of bundled lanterns sway 
           overhead like hellish chandeliers.

           The two men move beside a 

           LONG CORRIDOR

           of rusted metal bars, behind which an experiment is being 
           prepared.

           Swanson stops for a moment to watch.

           A series of large muscular ORDERLIES finish connecting 
           electrified leads to a riveted copper DUNK TANK filled 
           with water.  

           Suspended in chains above the tank is a raving psychotic, 
           R.N. RENFIELD (50s), bound tightly in a straightjacket.

                                 RENFIELD
                        Dr. Seward, the master of all life 
                        is at hand!  

           Renfield turns to the guards, wild-eyed.

                                 RENFIELD
                        I’m no lunatic you fools!  I’m a 
                        sane man fighting for his soul!

           Seward moves to Swanson’s side from behind the bars.

                                 SEWARD
                        Name is R.N. Renfield.  Once a 
                        successful solicitor in the firm 
                        of Hawkins and Thompkins.  
                        Returned from business abroad.  
                        Suffered a complete mental 
                        breakdown.  Zoophagous maniac.

                                 SWANSON
                        Come again?

                        Has a proclivity for eating live

                        Claims to absorb their life 
                        essence.

           The orderlies shove a bit into Renfield’s mouth to stop 
           his ravings.  They look to Seward, who gives his nod of 
           approval.

           Renfield is lowered into the tank, his body instantly 
           convulsing, mouth frothing.  Tiny brilliant fingers of 
           electricity dance across his body through the water.

                                 SWANSON
                        Good God, man.  Is that really 
                        necessary?

           Seward grins, receiving a chilling satisfaction from the 
           man’s suffering.

                                 SEWARD
                        In this case, 
                        psychopharmacological remedies for 
                        his condition have been thoroughly 
                        explored, I assure you.  Such is 
                        the peculiarity of the homicidal 
                        mind.

           Seward continues walking.  

                                 SEWARD
                        Follow me.  I keep your man in 
                        here.

           Swanson lingers before following.

           INT. PRISONER GALLERY -- LOWEST LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS

           The two men enter into a circular padded dungeon lit by 
           fluttering torches.  Lining the walls are a series of 
           darkened cages.  One lunatic to each.

           Seward points ahead.

                                 SEWARD
                        1167 is in that one.  I have other 
                        business to attend to above 
                        ground.  I predict your 
                        interactions will be brief.  

           Seward claps his hands together.

                                                            (CONTINUED)

                        See you shortly then.

           Swanson nervously watches Seward go - beads of sweat at 
           his temples.  

           He pulls in a deep breath, then approaches the cell 
           holding Patient 1167.  

           Swanson squints, hoping to make something out.  

                                 SWANSON
                        Hello?

           Nothing.  

           Just the DRIP-DROP-DRIP of water echoing across the walls 
           and chains CLINKING and CLANKING as they swing overhead.

           Swanson leans in closer.

                                 SEWARD
                        Jack?

           Something stirs inside the cell.  A large, shadowy figure 
           rises to its feet.  A gravelly voice calls out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Boss?

           The hulk of a man inside the cell steps from shadow into 
           light, revealing himself in full glory -

           PATIENT 1167 A/K/A JACK THE RIPPER (40s).  Ice blue eyes.  
           Two-hundred and fifty pounds of shirtless, greasy muscle.  
           Thick body hair connects to a bushy handlebar mustache.  

           Jack’s hand-carved the words “RIPPER” dozens of times 
           across his entire body.  Swanson nods to the marks.

                                 SWANSON
                        Those are new.

                                 JACK
                        Not much else to do ‘round here.

           Jack smiles, revealing a mouth filled with rotted teeth, 
           a few of which have been capped in silver.

                                 JACK
                        You look fatter.

           The glimmer of Swanson’s metal POLICE BADGE reflects in 
           Jack’s eye.

                        Made you a Chief then, have they?  
                        Glad I could help with that.

                                 SWANSON
                        There’s been a murder.  More 
                        likely to follow.  We need your 
                        help to avoid further bloodshed.

           Jack’s incredulous.

                                 JACK
                        My help?

           He erupts with overly gratuitous, uncontrollable 
           laughter.  Swanson waits for him to finish.

                                 SWANSON
                        My superiors believe you may be 
                        able to offer some perspec -

           Jack suddenly launches a ball of mucous into Swanson’s 
           face.

                                 JACK
                        There’s my bloody perspective.

           Swanson removes a handkerchief from his vest pocket and 
           wipes away the gob of sputum.  

           The interview is over.

           Swanson turns and walks away.

           The other inmates begin screaming, cackling around him.  
           Caged wild animals hooting and hollering.

           Jack hangs over his cell bars, smiling as he watches 
           Swanson go.

                                 JACK
                        That all then, Chief Inspector?

           EXT. CARFAX ABBEY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Seward shows Inspector Swanson down the stairs to a 
           police carriage, a nurse trailing them.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Again, my apologies we couldn’t be 
                        of more help.  I should think your 
                        failure to reach Patient 1167 will 
                        not reflect poorly on your 
                        standing as Chief Inspector.

                        You are, after all, not a 
                        physician.

           Swanson pulls himself into the carriage.

                                 SWANSON
                        Thank you for your time, doctor.

           INSIDE THE CARRIAGE

           Swanson’s tough exterior momentarily cracks.  His hands 
           are trembling.  

           He loosens his tie, sinking into his seat, exhaling a 
           mouthful of stress before addressing the coachman.

                                 SWANSON
                        Take me to the morgue.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ST. MARY’S HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON

           A dark shelf of bruised storm clouds tumbles toward the 
           city.  A fiery setting sun momentarily pierces the storm, 
           shooting pins of golden light onto the building.

           INT. MORGUE, ST. MARY’S HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Lucille Westenra’s body rests across a raised slab of 
           stone, a bed of melting ice sparkling beneath it.  Her 
           once supple skin is now weirdly wrinkled and sagging.

           Inspector Swanson is debating with the coroner, a puffy 
           beet-red drunkard, DR. THOMPSON MOORS (60s).  A PRIEST 
           stands in the shadows observing.

                                 DR. MOORS
                               (sternly)
                        As I explained earlier, Inspector, 
                        the body has been totally drained 
                        of its blood.  Therefore, her 
                        certificate of death shall read 
                        “Death by Exsanguination.”  I’ve 
                        no reason to debate with you 
                        ulterior modes of expiration.

                                 SWANSON
                        A debate is not what interests me, 
                        Dr. Moors.

                        I’d like to know what pathological 
                        clues there may be to explain how 
                        the blood was pulled from her 
                        body.  Not a single drop spilled 
                        during the process.

           Swanson points to the victim’s neck.  Concentric lesions 
           of purple and blue surround two gory wounds.

                                 SWANSON
                        And what about the unusual nature 
                        of the bruising?

           Moors waves Swanson off.

                                 DR. MOORS
                        Hemorrhaging likely the result of 
                        whatever weapon her attacker used.  
                        Nothing more.

           Swanson seems skeptical.  He points to the victim’s head.  
           Her once lustrous red hair has faded a silvery grey.  
           Large chunks have fallen out.

                                 SWANSON
                        Another thing strikes me as odd, 
                        doctor.  Is it usual for a body to 
                        decompose this way so quickly 
                        after death?  

           He nods to the ice.

                                 SWANSON
                        Despite it being so well 
                        preserved.

                                 DR. MOORS
                               (annoyed)
                        Inspector Swanson, there is 
                        nothing usual about the process of 
                        death.  Inanimate bodies continue 
                        to grow hair and nails long after 
                        expiration.  Such mysteries 
                        confound our understanding.  Rest 
                        assured, these events are hardly 
                        cause for concern.

           Moors checks his watch impatiently, then quickly signs a 
           DEATH CERTIFICATE he gives to the priest.

                                 DR. MOORS
                        It’s late.  I’ve a social function 
                        to attend.

           He turns to the priest.

                                 DR. MOORS
                        You may take receipt of the body 
                        for burial.  Do give our 
                        condolences to the bereaved.

           Dr. Moors moves to the exit.  He removes a polished flask 
           from his jacket and throws back a shot of scotch.

                                 DR. MOORS
                        A pleasant night.

           EXT. ST. MARY’S HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           The sun has just set.  Long sheets of rain spill down 
           from clouds twisting overhead.

           The priest closes the doors to his FUNERAL CARRIAGE, a 
           COFFIN visible inside.  He hoists himself on top of the 
           coach when Swanson approaches him.

                                 PRIEST
                        Off to North Hampton, then.  
                        Parents’ll be happy to see her 
                        brought home.

                                 SWANSON
                        Take care.  The roads will be 
                        dangerous from the storm.  

           He points to the coffin.

                                 SWANSON
                        We don’t want two bodies ending up 
                        in there.

           The priest hesitates for a moment, unsettled.

                                 PRIEST
                        Bothered me back there - seeing

                        only devil’s in the details.  

           He contemplatively looks off into the rain, pulling up 
           his coat collar.

                                 PRIEST
                        Find whoever did this, Inspector.  
                        God demands it.

           The priest draws back on the reins and his horses break 
           into a trot, pulling the carriage into the stormy night.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF LONDON -- NIGHT

           A monumental Gothic structure of spires and brick arches.  
           A bell tower tolls.  Wet leaves scurry across the lawn.

           INT. MEDICAL GALLERY, UNIVERSITY -- NIGHT

           A sparsely attended multilevel lecture hall of columns 
           and cracked marble lit by gas lamps and melting candles.

           Sitting at its lowest level is a morgue slab over which a 
           BODY covered in a sheet rests.  Hand drawn MEDICAL 
           SKETCHES line the walls.

           A blonde, bespectacled woman in a doctor’s coat, DR. 
           FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE (30s), addresses a GROUP OF 
           STUDENTS.  She’s calm, intelligent and precise.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Those few of you who regularly 
                        attend my lectures know, cholera 
                        has been of significant concern 
                        this year.

           Dr. Nightingale throws a sheet back to reveal a diseased 
           body dissected to illustrate its inner workings.  

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        In this case, contaminated water 
                        transmitted the disease to the 
                        patient.  Ironic, in that this 
                        particular individual died of 
                        severe dehydration.

           Stifled laughter from above.  The titters belong to a 
           fresh faced, arrogant pupil, TIMOTHY JOHNS (20s).

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        I’ve yet to impress you, Mr. 
                        Johns?  Perhaps you think my being 
                        a female physician somehow 
                        disqualifies me from making any 
                        meaningful contribution to the 
                        advancement of medical science?

                                 JOHNS
                        There’s a reason so few of us 
                        attend your lectures, Nurse 
                        Nightingale.

                        Nurse Nightingale?  Not doctor.  
                        Nurse.  

           The students go quiet.  

           Inspector Swanson cracks open a door unnoticed, watching 
           from the shadows.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Please continue, Mr. Johns.

                        battlefield.  Seen the horrors of 
                        war.  Men lying in uniforms, stiff

           Johns storms off, red-faced and fuming. 

           Nightingale looks to the rest of her students, smiling.

                        Class dismissed.

           The hall empties quickly.  Swanson steps into the light, 
           smirking.

                                 SWANSON
                        Same old Lady of the Lamp - 
                        Florence Nightingale.

           Nightingale turns to see Swanson.  There’s an excitement 
           in her eyes.  A sparkle that suggests a past romantic 
           history existing between the two.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE

                        Too long.  May I walk you home?

           INT. BELFRY -- NIGHT

           A cobwebbed space over which enormous IRON BELLS hang.  
           Thin slits of moonlight filter through wood planks onto 
           groups of leathery bats twitching from the ceiling.

           Bent over a desk is a DARK FIGURE dressed in a long, coal 
           black highwayman coat.  His face is hidden by an upturned 
           double collar and the shadow of a broad slouch hat.

           Unfurled across the desk are water stained MARITIME 
           CHARTS made of parchment.  Two empty GLASS MASON JARS sit 
           atop them.

           Using hands wrapped in bronze-tipped leather gloves, the 
           man finishes cleaning the jars to a spit polish shine, 
           carefully gluing separate blank labels to each.  

           He plunges a brown feather quill into an inkwell, hastily 
           scrawling two names across each label in delicate 
           cursive:  “JONATHAN HARKER” & “WILHELMINA HARKER.”

           The man sets the jars down, admiring his work.

           He opens a cracked leather medical bag revealing a bronze 
           geared DEVICE of pipes, cogs and rubber tubing.  

           He places the two jars inside the bag and snaps it 
           closed.

           A cold gust of wind whips through the belfry, the bats 
           hanging above screeching in protest as they scatter in 
           every direction.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOHO SQUARE, WEST END -- LATER, CONTINUOUS

           A street lined with canvas tents and bustling 
           storefronts.  Display cases filled with costume jewelry, 
           bushels of day old fruit, fresh meat dangling from hooks.

           The thick crowd of shoppers undulates down the street, 
           haggling prices, admiring the sights, etc.

           Swanson walks by Nightingale’s side as they both weave 
           through the crowd.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        My flat’s not far from here.  Pain 
                        in my ass to have to walk through 
                        this mess every night.

                                 SWANSON
                        Dangerous too.  Red-light’s not 
                        far from here.

           Nightingale tightens up.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Nothing I can’t handle.

           They continue moving.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        So - to what do I owe the pleasure 
                        of your company, Chief Inspector?

                                 SWANSON
                        I wondered if you might consider 
                        helping with a case of mine.  
                        Sensitive matter.  

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Straight to business then.  Is it 
                        the Leech Killer?  I’m sure I 
                        read.

                        shadows.

           Nightingale considers his proposal.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        In what capacity did you need my

                                 SWANSON
                        Consulting physician, of course.  
                        The coroner’s a useless drunkard.

           Nightingale laughs.

                                 SWANSON
                        Would be a change of pace.  
                        Something to break up the monotony 
                        of instructing, what was it,
                        “Undereducated, overprivileged 
                        little boys.”

           Nightingale gives him a soft smile.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        I could use a change of pace.

                        Then it’s settled.

           Interrupting them is an opulently dressed PROMOTER in 
           grease paint and a top hat.

           He screams to the crowd with an American accent, 
           dispensing garishly colored PAPER BILLS filled with 
           clowns and acrobats.

                                 PROMOTER
                        Come one!  Come all!  Behold, what 
                        you’ll surely agree is the 
                        Greatest Show on Earth!

           The man darts in front of Swanson, handing him a flyer:  
           “THE BARNUM & BAILEY CIRCUS!  HIPPODROME IN HYDE PARK!” 

                                 PROMOTER
                        Only six pence buys you eyefuls of

                                 PROMOTER
                        ...and his ravishing young lady.

           The showman takes Nightingale’s hand to plant a kiss.  
           She pulls back uncomfortably.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Piss off.

           Swanson waves off the theatrical huckster, laughing.

                                 SWANSON
                        You heard her.

           The actor moves past the couple, dissolving into the 
           endless crowd where he continues his show.

           EXT. RED-LIGHT DISTRICT, SOHO -- MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby red lanterns glow through a swirling fog.

           The same promoter’s distant calls echo further down the 
           street of squalid BROTHELS and packed TAVERNS.  

           A raven-haired woman with emerald eyes, WILHELMINA HARKER 
           (20s), approaches the face of an Oriental opium den.  Her 
           dress fluttering in and out of rising gutter steam.

           EXT. THE MIDNIGHT OIL -- NIGHT

           A traditionally robed ASIAN MAN with a Fu Manchu sits 
           between two bronzed Chinese guardian lions.  He puffs on 
           a long, grandiloquent silver and ivory opium pipe.

           Wilhelmina cautiously approaches him.

                                 WILHELMINA
                        Excuse me.  I’m looking for my 
                        husband.

           The man stays silent, eyes glazed, pupils fully dilated.  
           Fingers of dense vapor creep up from his lips.

                                 WILHELMINA
                        Jonathan Harker’s his name.  I’m 
                        his wife, Wilhelmina.  

           She’s distracted by shadows floating over the jade tinted 
           windows of the building.

                        Is he inside?  I’ve something 
                        urgent to discuss with him.  A 
                        friend of ours has met a terrible 
                        end.

           The watchman stoically sits on his stool in a drug 
           induced haze.  

           She moves past him, through a set of beaded curtains.

           INT. THE MIDNIGHT OIL -- CONTINUOUS

           Dim and shadowy.  All shiny lacquer, teal and bronze.  
           Hand-dipped orange wax candles melting inside chinaballs.  
           Chimes softly TINKLING.

           Rows of low cots sit adorned with silken oriental 
           pillows.  On each table, a bulbous assembly of glass 
           globes sit atop a gas burner.  

           An eclectic group of stoned addicts draw rich grey smoke 
           from the bulbs using serpentine tubes.

           Wilhelmina moves through the beds, coughing, barely able 
           to see as she whispers for her husband.

           Following a short search, she finds JONATHAN HARKER (30s) 
           slumped over in a shadowy corner. 

           Eyes closed.  Mouth agape.  His flesh tinged a sickly 
           yellow.

                                 WILHELMINA
                        Jonathan!?!

           She rushes to his side.  

                                 WILHELMINA
                        Jonathan, wake up!

           She desperately pulls the scruff of his checkered coat 
           collar.  His head falls to one side, revealing two 
           concentric wounds bore deep inside his neck.  

           Wilhelmina’s eyes fill with shimmering tears at the sight 
           of her lifeless, dead husband.

           She wipes them from her face, noticing an object sitting 
           comfortably ensconced in his lap - a MASON JAR filled 
           with dark fluid.

           Her eyes narrow.  She pulls the jar from his hands, 
           twisting it to view the label:  “JONATHAN HARKER.”

           A candle behind the jar illuminates its syrupy scarlet 
           contents.  

           Wilhelmina GASPS in stunned terror!

           The receptacle falls through her fingers, shattering onto 
           the floor, glossing everything it touches in thick red 
           blood.

           She stumbles backward into the smoky haze, 
           hyperventilating.  

           Opiated customers continue their routine in unconscious 
           silence.

           A DARK FIGURE slowly rises from one of the cots behind 
           her.

           Oblivious, she quickly turns, face blanching at the sight 
           of him in shadow.  

           In an instant, the figure unexpectedly lunges toward her, 
           sharp shadows descending.

           She draws in a large breath, preparing to scream, when -

           The wraith quickly stabs into her jugular with a 
           concealed object, interrupting her mid-shout.  Her voice 
           bubbles to a gurgle.  Eyes rolling milk white.

           EXT. RED-LIGHT DISTRICT, SOHO -- MOMENTS LATER

           Swanson and Nightingale are approaching the grungy edge 
           of the quarter.  

           A blood curdling SCREAM from ahead.  Loud, hysterical 
           SHOUTS.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Murder!  There’s been a murder!

           Swanson removes a silver-finished REVOLVER from his vest 
           and turns to Nightingale.

                                 SWANSON
                        Stay here.

           He bolts into a sprint, weaving past throngs of people to 
           the face of

           THE MIDNIGHT OIL

           where an uneasy CROWD of onlookers has gathered.  All 
           lower class - the ladies in corsets and the gentlemen in 
           their waistcoats and tattered top hats.

           Swanson pushes past them.

                                 SWANSON
                        Out of the bloody way!

           He moves through beaded curtains into the den.

           INT. THE MIDNIGHT OIL -- CONTINUOUS

           A ghostly haze hangs in the stagnant air.  The room has 
           been abandoned.  Wisps of delicate smoke twist from 
           deserted pipes.  

           Swanson points his weapon into the shadows.  

           He moves to a far corner.  Jonathan and Wilhelmina Harker 
           are slumped over.  Dead.  Two gleaming BLOOD JARS beside 
           them - one shattered. 

           THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

           There is someone above him.  Swanson tilts his gun to the 
           ceiling following along as it creaks.

           He moves to stairs set into the far wall.  A sign above 
           them in ebullient blue font:  “THE BLUE LAGOON.”

           INT. THE BLUE LAGOON -- CONTINUOUS

           A brothel wrapped in Far Eastern tapestries and dimmed 
           sapphire gas lamps.

           Swanson moves down a long hallway lined with varnished 
           doors.  All of them closed and locked.  MUFFLED MOANS of 
           ecstasy echo down the vestibule.

           There is a shattered lamp at the end of the hallway.  

           Swanson kicks down the door it belongs to, gun pointed.

           INT. CHAMBER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The lights are out. A solitary streak of silvery 
           moonlight cuts through the darkness.

           The stylus of a GRAMOPHONE eerily stutters at the end of 
           a spinning turntable.

           A Chinese PROSTITUTE in a glittery indigo and gold 
           Cheongsam shivers uncontrollably near her bed.  Covers 
           pulled to eyes glazed with terror.

           Swanson puts a finger to his lips.  

           He looks to her closet door and moves to it, gun cocked.  

           He throws the door open, preparing to fire.  Nothing but 
           a tangle of corsets and laced gowns.

           The terrified harlot whimpers beside him. 

           Swanson hears the CLANKING of a crystal chandelier 
           overhead.  He follows the woman’s eyes and turns to fire.

           The KILLER unexpectedly swings from the ceiling! 

           The material of his coal black coat unfurls like wrinkled 
           bat wings.  

           Two muddied boots SLAM into the Inspector’s chest, 
           shooting him back through a cloud of gunpowder and into a 
           plate glass window.

           OUTSIDE

           Glass rains down to the street.  Swanson struggles to 
           grip the brick ledge of razor sharp shards slicing 
           through his fingers.  

           Shocked GASPS break out from the crowd below.  Swanson 
           doesn’t dare look down.

           His hand slips.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        He’s about to fall!

           Swanson’s grip further loosens.  His eyes tighten, sharp 
           glass slicing into his fingers as he accepts his fate.

           Suddenly, two burly JOHNS in suspenders pop their heads 
           out of what remains of the window above him.  They 
           carefully pull the Inspector to safety.

           INSIDE

           The men lay Swanson’s bruised body onto a bed.  

           A medical bag at her side, Nightingale rushes into the 
           room along with several CONSTABLES.

           She opens her bag and quickly begins tending to his 
           injuries with a pad of silken gauze.  

                                 SWANSON
                        I’m fine.

           Her hand cups his cheek.

                        Next time, look before you leap.

           Swanson smiles.

                                 SWANSON
                        Was never very good at that.

           INT. THE MIDNIGHT OIL -- LATER, CONTINUOUS

           A half dozen Bobbies guard the door.  PHOTOGRAPHERS and 
           JOURNALISTS stumble over one, desperate to get a glimpse 
           inside.

           Swanson and Nightingale inspect the Harkers’ dead bodies.  
           Nightingale taps a gloved finger to the wounds on 
           Jonathan Harker’s neck.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        These are most unusual.

                                 SWANSON
                        Have you seen anything like it?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Actually, yes.  Not the puncture 
                        wounds mind you.  The bruising.

                                 SWANSON
                        What causes it?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Suction.  Indigenous tribes 
                        sometimes use something called 
                        “Banki” in an attempt to cure the 
                        sick.  Involves lighting a flame 
                        beneath a glass and using the 
                        suction to “pull” disease from a 
                        patient’s body.

                                 SWANSON
                        Banki?  Sounds like superstitious 
                        hogwash.

           Nightingale lifts up one of the BLOOD JARS.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        This is rather curious as well.

                        Doesn’t look like it.

                        How do you mean?

           Nightingale twists the jar to the light.  Clumps of 
           congealed blood settle to its bottom.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        It’s blood to be sure.  But this 
                        is heavy with disease.  

           She nods over to the bodies.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Aside from being dead, this couple 
                        looks healthy.  The blood in these 
                        jars belongs to someone very ill.

                                 SWANSON
                        Whose is it then?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        You tell me, Chief Inspector.

           Nightingale removes a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE from her bag.  
           She points to the jar.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Mind if I take a sample for 
                        analysis?

                                 SWANSON
                        By all means.

           An anxious Bobbie approaches Swanson.

                                 BOBBIE
                        Sorry to interrupt, Chief 
                        Inspector.

           He hands over a tattered piece of PARCHMENT filled with 
           detailed drawings of a colossal MOUNTAIN RANGE.

                        Taken from the Chinaman guarding 
                        the door, sir.  Said Jonathan 
                        Harker traded it to him for a 
                        night’s smoke.  Claimed it to be 
                        some sort of treasure map.

           Swanson further examines the map.  Inscribed in faded ink 
           across it:  “THE BORGO PASS.”

                                 SWANSON

           Large collections of ONLOOKERS scream and shout.

           Inspector Swanson and Dr. Nightingale exit the den.  

           Flash powder EXPLODES all around them from accordion 
           style cameras.  Reporters swarm from every direction.  

           A CINEMATOGRAPHER cranking a MOVIE CAMERA cries out.

                        with you?

           Swanson shoves the Tri-Lens film camera from his face.  

           A POLICE CARRIAGE clatters before them.  

           Swanson leads Nightingale

           INSIDE THE CARRIAGE

           night.  A thin band of gold sunlight rises, spreading 
           across the horizon.

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S WOOD -- EARLY MORNING

           Foggy and quiet.  Gothic, pointed flats carved from

           cobblestone bridge.

           INT. SWANSON’S STUDY -- EARLY MORNING

           The Inspector sits sleeping in a burgundy leather desk 
           chair.  Cluttered bookshelves and stacks of papers 
           surround him.

           His eyes flutter.  He mumbles.  An intense dream unfolds.

           (The images come in erratic bursts.  Speeding up and 
           slowly down alternately.  In Swanson’s POV.)

           - Walking down a long dark tunnel.

           - A moonlit man in a top hat and trench coat stands over 
           the body of a fallen young prostitute slashed to pieces.  
           Blood spreading at his feet.

           - A gleaming knife pulls out of the woman.  

           - Entrails spill onto the cobblestone.

           - The man in the top hat steps into gaslight.  Jack the 
           Ripper.  His face is splattered with blood.

           - Swanson cocks his revolver to fire.

           - The Ripper appears feet from Swanson’s face.  He 
           slashes his blue steel blade across it.

           - Swanson fires his weapon.  

           - A sepia cloud of gun powder sweeps across the 
           cobblestone.  It clears away.  Jack the Ripper is on the 
           ground, wounded.

           a torrent of bloody rain erupts from overhead. 

           - The sanguine rain floods the entire alley washing 
           everything away in an overwhelming rush of fluid crimson.  

           - Swanson’s screams echo down the alley at the tsunami of 
           blood racing toward him, its contents roiling with scores 
           of decomposed corpses.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Swanson leaps from his chair SHOUTING.  

                                 SWANSON
                        Emily!

           He takes a moment to calm himself, wiping clean his 
           sweaty brow.

           Swanson’s reflection plays across a sepia PHOTOGRAPH of a 
           beautiful YOUNG WOMAN with dark hair, his sister, EMILY 
           SWANSON (19) - the woman from his nightmare.

           Swanson’s eyes shut tight and he falls back into his 
           chair, exhausted.

                        “The body count continues to 
                        rise.”

           - At St. Mary Hospital Dr. Moors is pontificating, 
           surrounded by sickly bed-ridden patients.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        “Meanwhile, coroner Dr. Thompson 
                        Moors of St. Mary’s Hospital 
                        voices concern about the killer’s 
                        methods spreading illness across 
                        London.”

           - A teeming mass of people choke London’s streets.  

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        “As worries continue to mount, the 
                        question on everyone’s minds is:  
                        Will ‘Monster Hunter’ Swanson 
                        apprehend the Leech Killer?  Or, 
                        will the madman slip through his 
                        fingers just as Jack the Ripper 
                        did?”

           - From the rooftops, a shaky angle of the city twinkles 
           before the grainy picture burns out and dies.

           Patrons begin leaving.  A CONSTABLE finds Swanson sitting 
           at the back.

                                 CONSTABLE

           The Constable hands Swanson a wax sealed ENVELOPE.  Typed 
           font reads:  “OF URGENT IMPORTANCE.  1167 WISHES TO 
           DISCUSS YOUR CASE.  SIGNED DR. SEWARD.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PRISONER GALLERY - DAY

           Back turned, Jack is doing pull ups from a copper water 
           pipe hung above his cell.  The veins of his hulking arms 
           throb to keep his violent blood pumping.

           Swanson enters.  He passes a cell holding R.N. Renfield, 
           who is hopelessly mumbling to himself.

                                 RENFIELD
                        Won’t be long now...  Won’t be 
                        long now...  Won’t be long now...

           Swanson stops short of Jack’s cell.  Out of spitting 
           distance.

           Jack drops from the ceiling.  He turns to Swanson, 
           dripping with salty sweat.

                                 JACK
                        Glad you could make it, Boss.  
                               (re: his distance)
                        No need to be shy.  I don’t bite.  

           He winks.

                                 JACK
                        Not too hard anyway.

                                 SWANSON
                        Eight butchered women would 
                        disagree - my sister included.

                                 JACK
                        Aw, gettin’ personal on me then?

           He lifts two crossed fingers.

                                 JACK
                        On my best manners.  Swear it on 
                        me murdered mum.

           He explodes with unhinged laughter.  Swanson stays put.  

           Jack nods to the small glass cuts on Swanson’s face.

                        the chance and I’d fillet the 
                        bloomin’ bastard myself.  

           Jack smiles, pulling a finger down his own eye.

                                 JACK
                        No one cuts Boss but ‘ole Jackie 
                        boy.

                                 SWANSON
                        What do you want?

                                 JACK
                        Thought we’d have some tea.  Chat 
                        about your case over biscuits.  
                        Double event this time.  What a 
                        gruesome wag.

                                 SWANSON
                        How do you know about the 
                        killings?

           Jack’s eyes go wild.  He flicks his tongue excitedly 
           across his gleaming silver teeth.

                                 JACK
                        Walls’ll talk, you got the time to 
                        listen.  Heard they’re sayin’ he’s 
                        worse than me.
                               (winking)
                        We’ll put that to the test, won’t 
                        we?

           Jack licks his cracked lips.

                                 JACK
                        So - hear you got a lady workin’ 
                        with you.  Dr. Nightinfail was it?  
                               (scoffing)
                        Tramps as docs.  Bint meat’s for

                        Boss?

           Swanson turns to leave.

                                 JACK
                        Just havin’ a bit of fun with you.  
                        You’re the only friend’ve mine

                        anyhow.  

           Jack smiles with a mouth full of excitement.

                        London’s foggy boulevards can help 
                        you, Boss.  

           Swanson faces Jack.

                                 JACK
                        Not like me.  Huntin’ mankind 
                        ain’t like animals.  Most 
                        dangerous beast treadin’ the

                        - puttin’ us in charge.

           Jack’s amused.  Swanson doesn’t look impressed.

                                 JACK
                        What’s the matter, Boss?  ‘Aint it 
                        funny?  Typhoid and swans comin’ 
                        from the same God?

                                 SWANSON
                        You’re wasting my time.

           Swanson turns to leave one last time.

                                 JACK
                        He ain’t from ‘round here.  Your 
                        blood sucker.

           Swanson swivels to face Jack.

                                 SWANSON
                        What makes you so sure?

                                 JACK
                        We’re both from the same place.

                                 SWANSON
                        Where’s that?

                                 JACK
                        Hell.

           Jack runs his thick fingers across the bars of his cell.

                                 JACK
                        I used to pass time workin’ over

                                 SWANSON
                        Immigration ships?

                        You think he’s from abroad?

                                 JACK
                        Why not?  Heard the ‘lil sponger’s 
                        got a sickness too.

                                 SWANSON
                        Other than being psychotic?

                        Body’s dyin’ of somethin’ fresh.  
                        How long you think a bloke could

                                 SWANSON
                        With the outbreaks of cholera 
                        we’ve had in London lately?  Not 
                        long.

           The Inspector’s eyes narrow.  He considers Jack’s point 
           for a moment, then begins to leave.

           Jack turns, resuming his pull ups.  He shouts back to 
           Swanson.

                                 JACK
                        Visit again, Boss.  ‘Fraid I can’t

           EXT. MAYFAIR DISTRICT -- DAY

           Loud and bustling.  Dozens of horse-drawn carriages trot 
           past sleepy brick flats spewing thick veins of coal 
           smoke.

           INT. NIGHTINGALE’S FLAT -- DAY

           A breeze flutters through delicate lace curtains.  Opened 
           MEDICAL TEXTS litter the surface of a heavily varnished 
           desk.  

           A MICROSCOPE sits beside Nightingale, who is preparing a 
           glass slide.  Using a syringe, she squirts a dot of dark 
           blood onto a rectangle of glass.

           She places the blood sample on the microscope’s stage, 
           removes her glasses and takes a look.

           Her fingers adjust the rack and pinion, finding focus.

           She recoils at what she sees in stunned disbelief.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Good God.

           EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE -- DAY

           A newly built neoclassical mansion of golden bath stone 
           arches.  Three floors with two flanking service wings.

           ROYAL GUARDS in their scarlet coats and bearskin caps 
           patrol the magnificent grounds of endless green grass and 
           red rose bushes.   

           A POLICE CARRIAGE pulls to its entrance.  

           Out steps Commissioner Bradford puffing his pipe.  An 
           escort leads him inside.

           INT. MUSIC ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           A hall of sparkling ivory and gold leaf filled to the 
           brim with a panoply of riches.  Large pools of light 
           stream from story high gilt-bronze glass windows.

           QUEEN ALEXANDRINA VICTORIA (80) sits playing BEETHOVEN’S 
           “PATHETIQUE” at a luxuriously decadent mahogany piano.  A 
           starburst of jewels twinkle across her frail body.

           Commissioner Bradford kneels.  He waits for her to 
           finish.

           She turns to face him, awaiting a reaction - her aged 
           eyes glazed blue with cataracts.

           She reaches for Bradford.  They lock arms.  The Queen 
           draws up her long crushed velvet robes.

           They come to a wall lavishly appointed with REMBRANDT and 
           VERMEER oil paintings.

                                 QUEEN VICTORIA
                        The paintings are beautiful, 
                        aren’t they?  I can no longer see 
                        them, but my memory of each 
                        remains intact.  Sometimes I 
                        wonder if they are as splendid and 
                        rich as I remember them.  That is 
                        the role of our monarchy, 
                        Commissioner.  To maintain the 
                        memory of a Great Britain.  One of 
                        a nation strong and stoic.  Full 
                        of possibility.  A beacon unto the 
                        world.

           The Queen stops.  She turns to the Commissioner.

                        London’s streets cannot afford to 
                        continue to run with blood.  Not 
                        if we are to maintain that memory.  
                        I stand here to impress upon you

                        ...ghastly grotesque.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        I understand, your Majesty.  
                        Scotland Yard will not fail you.

                        See to it your man apprehends him 
                        with haste.

           Bradford nervously stares at London out of the colossal 
           glass windows of the hall, jowls tensing.

           EXT. WEST INDIA DOCKS -- LATE AFTERNOON, CONTINUOUS

           Slack tidal waters heave gently under a blanket of heavy 
           mist.

           A rickety marina dotted with the pointed masts of dozens 
           of ships.  Frothy, polluted salt water laps the barnacled 
           supports of the dock.  

           FISH-MONGERS with cleavers hack at wriggling fish, 
           spilling guts across the planks beneath their feet.

           Swanson walks toward a bearded man chewing the bit of a 
           hand carved wooden pipe - the HARBOR MASTER.  

           The man is reading a fresh copy of the TIMES LONDON.  The 
           headline reads:  “LEECH BAFFLES YARD!”

           Swanson clears his throat.  The Harbor Master looks up 
           from his paper, startled.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        Didn’t realize it was you, Chief 
                        Inspector.

                                 SWANSON
                        I’m here to inquire as to whether 
                        you’ve noticed anything unusual at 
                        the docks of late.

                        Do you understand?

           The man puts down his pipe.  His tone becomes more 
           serious.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        Anything to help, sir.

                                 SWANSON
                        I have cause to believe the killer 
                        you’ve read about may have come 
                        from abroad.  Have you had any 
                        problems recently with immigration 
                        vessels coming to port?

           The man picks up his pipe and strikes a match.  He takes 
           a deep pull and begins puffing.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        Follow me.

           They weave through the

                        Had a ship try to dock but a week

                        it was.  Men, women and children.

           The two men enter a larger covered

           DRY DOCK

           loaded with the destroyed remains of VARIOUS SHIPS.  
           Wooden corpses of once mighty vessels.  Each creaking as 
           they float in a mire of muddy water.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        All aboard looked to be gravely

                        Had to turn them away.  Same 
                        night, ship crashed on the rocks.  
                        No survivors.  Hoped to send 
                        correspondence to any family.  
                        Never found a passenger list.

           They stop at the smashed stern of a large BARQUENTINE 
           SHIP.  Its canvas sails and halyard ropes still weakly 
           fluttering in the breeze.  

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        Had her towed to the docks.

           Swanson moves around the ship to its masthead.  Baroque, 
           cracked gold lettering reads:  “THE DEMETER.”

                                 SWANSON
                        Did the captain of the ship 
                        mention anything before you turned 
                        him away?

           The Harbor Master hands Swanson a water stained CAPTAIN’S 
           LOGBOOK.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        You best read this.

           Swanson begins reading from its crinkled pages.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - The Demeter sails through a sleet-driven wind, over and 
           under the white tipped waves of an impossibly large 
           squall.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Captain’s Log.  The Demeter.  15th 
                        March, 1899.  We set sail at noon 
                        into a storm that seemed to come 
                        out of nowhere, carrying us out to 
                        see.

           - Enormous waves batter the bow, hot forks of blue 
           lightning relentlessly stab at the mast. 

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Second mate found dead.

           - A crew member discovers the Second Mate splayed out 
           across his cabin, throat torn, wide splatters of blood 
           drip from the mahogany paneling.

                        Nearing Gibraltar.  Storm 
                        continues.  Crew uneasy.  
                        Passengers falling ill.  Fever has 
                        begun to spread.

           - Dozens of passengers hack and shiver in the water 
           soaked cargo hold, small open lesions dotting their pale 
           skin.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Unrest among passengers.  They 
                        believe someone or something is 
                        aboard the ship with us.  Living 
                        in the shadows.  A phantom.

           - A sharp silhouette of a man with clawed fingers creeps 
           over the ship’s lantern lit sails.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        Turned away from port of London.  
                        Outlook grim.

           - The ship limps down the foggy coast, a large rogue wave 
           throws it into a series of jagged rocks, crushing its 
           wooden outsides to splinters.

                                 CAPTAIN (V.O.)
                        God help us.

           - Underwater, dozens of immigrant bodies float with the 
           current, long shafts of moonlight filtering above them to 
           the briny depths.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        Probably just fever playing with 
                        his mind, you think?

           Swanson pulls his head from the ship’s log.  He notices 
           Commissioner Bradford at the entrance.

                                 SWANSON
                        That’ll be all.

           Swanson goes to meet Bradford

           OUTSIDE

           and the two walk further down the docks away from the 
           shore.

                        That right?  How was her Majesty?

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Concerned.  We need a suspect,

                        We’re drawing nearer to one.  The 
                        murderer snuck aboard a Russian 
                        ship carrying immigrants.  “The

                        You retrieved a name?

                        I will soon.  He’s sick.  Won’t be 
                        long before someone comes forward.

           Bradford puts a hand to Swanson’s chest.  In it is a red 
           leather LEDGER.

                                 SWANSON
                        What’s this?

                        Datebook.  Found it on Jonathan 
                        Harker’s body.

           Swanson quickly flips through its contents.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Mr. Harker was meetin’ with a

                        Who’s that?

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Dr. Seward.  With some regularity.  
                        I suggest you return to Carfax.  
                        Have a chat.  Maybe go below.  
                        Long as you’re there.

           Desperate SHOUTS suddenly break from a nearby TRAWLING 
           SHIP preparing to dock.  

           Swanson and the Commissioner run to the

           TRAWLER

           which has something large caught in its wool fishing 
           nets.  

           Wheels with broken spokes, a passenger seat and a sealed 
           COFFIN - the remains of a FUNERAL CARRIAGE. 

           Swanson moves to get a closer look at the contents.  A 
           bloated grey BODY bobs helplessly tangled in the 
           meshwork. 

           It’s the PREACHER Swanson met at the morgue.  His throat 
           has been torn into a sinewy open maw. 

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Two FISHERMAN with crowbars pry open the closed CASKET.  

           Out pours seaweed and squirming crab.  

           Swanson and Commissioner Bradford peer inside.  

           Lucille Westenra’s body is no where to be found.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE CARRIAGE -- AFTERNOON

           Swanson thumbs through Harker’s datebook.  He flips to 
           its front.  

           The top of a calendar page reads:  “1899 - JAN 15TH - MET 
           WITH RENFIELD, SEWARD, HOLMWOOD AND MORRIS REGARDING 
           BUKOVINA.”

           Swanson lowers the book from his face in puzzlement.

                                                                CUT TO:

           SCREAMING inmates are being rounded up and straight 
           jacketed by orderlies wielding high powered WATER HOSES.

           Seward has a handkerchief at his mouth.  Swanson follows 
           him through the wet stone dungeon of the sanitarium and 
           its many corridors.

                        It’s come to my attention one of 
                        the victims, Jonathan Harker, was 
                        an acquaintance of Renfield’s.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Prior to losing his mind, Mr. 
                        Renfield found employment as a 
                        solicitor at Harker’s same firm.

                                 SWANSON
                        Harker’s date book mentioned a 
                        meeting they had only days before 
                        Renfield was committed.  It 
                        concerned a placed called 
                        Bukovina.  Are you familiar?

           Dr. Seward’s eyes narrow with concern.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Should I be?

                                 SWANSON
                        It’s deep in the Carpathian 
                        wilderness.  At the very heart of 
                        Romania.

                                 DR. SEWARD 
                        Inspector, if you’ve a point to 
                        make beyond a geography lesson, 
                        I’d appreciate you coming to it.

                                 SWANSON
                        Harker had a map on his person the 
                        night of his murder.  A map he 
                        told a Chinaman held the location 
                        of an enormous fortune.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        I’ll repeat myself.  If you’ve a 
                        point to -

                                 SWANSON
                        My point is, Harker’s date book 
                        references you too attended the 
                        Bukovina meeting.  

           Dr. Seward stops walking, annoyed.  Swanson looks him 
           square in the eyes.

                                 SWANSON
                        Is there anything you’d care to 
                        share regarding what was 
                        discussed?

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Our meeting concerned the 
                        acquisition of land abroad.  
                        Nothing more.  After all, the men 
                        were dually licensed solicitors.  
                        Jonathan Harker since became a 
                        hopeless opium addict.  I should 
                        very much think tales of 
                        mysterious countries and lost 
                        treasure are merely the deranged 
                        ramblings of a desperate man.

           They walk to the gate leading to the prisoner gallery.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Have you finished your 
                        interrogation of me, Chief 
                        Inspector?

                                 SWANSON
                        For now.

           Swanson moves into the

           PRISONER GALLERY

           and passes Renfield’s cell.  

           Renfield has been strung up by the long sleeves of his 
           soiled straight jacket.  A leather BRANK tightly wrapped 
           around his head and a silver bit shoved down his throat.

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        Seems he’s been rather naughty.

           Swanson walks to

           JACK’S CELL

           where the hulking behemoth sits waiting in the shadows.

                                 JACK
                        Evening, Boss.

           Jack sniffs the air.

                                 JACK
                        Come from the wharf then, have we?

                                 SWANSON
                        You were right.  He hid aboard an 
                        immigration ship.  Seems he 
                        infected the entire crew.

           Jack leaps from shadow into light.  A psychotic twinkle 
           in his eye.  His face covered in purple bruises.

                                 JACK
                        Our collaboration’s already bore 
                        fruit then, has it?  Rotten as it 
                        is.

                                 SWANSON
                        Who gave you those bruises?

                                 JACK
                        Result of the good doctor’s more 
                        adventurous methods.

           Jack puts a meaty finger to his temple.

                                 JACK
                        Where were we then?  Ah, yes, 
                        Leechy pullin’ his blood debt from 
                        those poor souls.

                                 SWANSON
                        What do you mean, blood debt?

           Jack smiles knowingly.  Swanson leans closer.

                                 SWANSON
                        Go on.

                                 JACK
                        You’ve somethin’ to trade me then 
                        have you, Boss?

                                 SWANSON
                        Looking for absolution, Jack?

                                 JACK
                        Absolutely not.  I want a chat 
                        with your second half.  The 
                        tastier one.  

           Jack smacks his lips.

                                 JACK
                        The doctor.

                                 SWANSON
                        That’s ludicrous.  I’d never allow 
                        it.

           Jack returns to the murky shadows.

                        Pity.  See you in hell then, Chief 
                        Inspector.

           Swanson becomes upset, his steeling demeanor momentarily 
           pierced.

                                 SWANSON
                        You’ll rot in here first, Jack.  
                        New century coming.  What 
                        mechanical tortures do you imagine 
                        Dr. Seward will have dreamt up by 
                        the time you’re gumming porridge 
                        and soiling pants?

                                 JACK
                        You’re frustratin’ me, Boss.

           Jack’s voice quiets to a whisper.

                                 JACK
                        Them letters I sent you.  Back 
                        when I was earnin’ my trade name.  
                        Tried to write ‘em in different 
                        ink first.  Saved some of the 
                        proper red stuff I bled from a 
                        cunny in a ginger beer bottle to 
                        write with.  Went thick as glue, 
                        it did.  Useless.  Tasteless.  So 
                        I sent you her face by post 
                        instead.

           Jack leans into the light, eyes ablaze with rage.  Foam 
           collecting at his mouth.

                                 JACK
                        Frustration’s what got me 
                        collectin’ pieces of those sluts 
                        to begin with!

           Swanson remains stoic.

           Jack nods to Swanson’s long eye scar.

                                 JACK
                        Branded.  Like cattle.  Leechy’ll 
                        do the same.  We’ll all be 
                        flatmates in the pit, you think?  
                        Seward as well?  Dr. Doper.  He’s 
                        got secrets worth killin’ for.

           Dr. Seward enters through a creaky metal gate.  Jack 
           calms down, slinking back into the shadows.

           Seward turns to Swanson, rubbing his clothed arm 
           uncomfortably.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        You’ve a visitor above ground.

           Seward leads Swanson away.  Jack’s shouts echo across the 
           gallery.

                                 JACK
                        Not a word more from me, Boss.  
                        Not without an even trade.

           EXT. CARFAX ABBEY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Nightingale waits patiently by a POLICE CARRIAGE.  A 
           young NURSE in a white uniform leads Swanson from the 
           entrance.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Commissioner Bradford said I’d 
                        find you here.  We’re late for our

                                 SWANSON

                        Found some unusual anomalies in 
                        that sample I took from The 
                        Midnight Oil.  There’s a Dutch 
                        professor at Oxford who -

           The nurse at Swanson’s side can hardly contain her 
           excitement.  She turns to Nightingale.

                                 NURSE
                        Sorry to interrupt.  Wanted to 
                        thank Dr. Nightingale.  For 
                        representin’ fellow sisters of the 
                        gown such as meself.

                        You flatter me.

           Nightingale removes a RED-CROSS LAPEL from her coat and 
           pins it to the nurse’s gown.  The woman blushes and 
           curtsies, rushing to return to the manor.

           Nightingale turns to Swanson.

           He’s distracted by a window above the manor.  Curtains

                        Let’s go.

           They both pull themselves into the carriage.  The COACH 
           DRIVER snaps his creaky leather reins and they trot off.

           INT. SWANSON’S CARRIAGE -- CONTINUOUS

           Swanson and Nightingale face each other.  Swanson appears 
           distracted, the gears of his mind twirling.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Pence for your thoughts?

                                 SWANSON
                        He’s hiding something.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Who?

                                 SWANSON
                        Seward, the asylum’s director.  
                        He’s knows more than he’s let on.

                        Who have you been visiting at that 
                        dreadful place?

           Swanson looks out the carriage window, into the gangrene 
           sky.

                                 SWANSON
                        This professor we’re visiting, 
                        what can you tell me about him?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Works at Oxford.  Specializes in 
                        eccentric disease.  He’s a sort of 
                        metaphysical physician.

                        You have confidence in his 
                        abilities?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        He’s second to none.  Hematology 
                        is his speciality.

                                 SWANSON
                        Hema-what?

                        He’s a blood doctor.

           Dr. Nightingale sweeps a bit of dust from her dress.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Funny, isn’t it?

                                 SWANSON
                        What’s that?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Never imagined we would be working 
                        together.  Not after things ended 
                        between us so...  
                               (finding the words)
                        ...abruptly.

                                 SWANSON
                        You departed to protect the world.  
                        I stayed to protect London.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Must you always deliver such a 
                        clinical assessment of things?

           He smiles.

                                 SWANSON
                        As a doctor, it surprises me you’d 
                        be uncomfortable with such an 
                        approach.

           Nightingale falls back into her seat, exasperated.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Useless.

           EXT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY -- LATE AFTERNOON

           A Ruskinian Gothic cathedral of steep needle spires 
           surrounded by trembling shrubbery.  

           Swanson and Nightingale pass the school’s blue and brass 
           seal: “DOMINUS ILLUMINATIO MEA (THE LORD IS MY LIGHT).”

           They continue past the lush contents of Oxford’s WALLED 
           GARDEN to a red-brick silo strangled by twisting thorns 
           of ivy. 
                                   6/27/11

           INT. LAB -- CONTINUOUS

           Hundreds of GLASS RECEPTACLES filled with every 
           conceivable shade of smooth vermillion blood are stacked 
           across the annular space to the ceiling.

           Complex CHEMISTRY SETS filled with colored liquids, 
           DISTILLING COLUMNS and CONDENSERS.  Detailed MEDICAL 
           ILLUSTRATIONS of cross-sectioned human anatomy.

           At the room’s center stands DR. ABRAHAM VAN HELSING 
           (50s), an eccentric, live wire of a man with a trimmed 
           goatee wearing an olive frock coat.

           Across his face are oversized spectacles with extra 
           lenses of various magnification.  

           Van Helsing is bent over a MONSTROUS MAN seated shirtless 
           on a wooden stool.  The man’s back is turned.

           Swanson and Nightingale quietly enter, watching the 
           doctor as he works.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                               (whispering)
                        Fascinating.

           Van Helsing uses a caliper to measure the grossly 
           asymmetrical appendages of the man.  The doctor speaks 
           with a Dutch accent.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Impressive.  A clear reduction in 
                        their size since we began.  Your 
                        current line of treatment shall 
                        continue as scheduled.

           Nightingale accidentally thumps into a table, unsettling 
           some equipment with a loud CLANK.

           Van Helsing lifts the lenses of his spectacles, 
           squinting.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Who goes there?

           Swanson and Nightingale step forward.

                                 SWANSON
                        Chief Inspector Swanson and Dr. 
                        Nightingale.  We had hoped to ask 
                        you a few questions.

                        We have an appointment.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        You’re late.

           Van Helsing looks down to his patient.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        You may dress now, Mr. Merrick.

           The patient twists to look at Swanson and Nightingale, 
           his features clarifying.  He is London’s infamous, 
           severely deformed JOSEPH MERRICK A/K/A THE ELEPHANT MAN.

                                 SWANSON
                        We’ll wait.

           INT. VAN HELSING’S OFFICE -- LATER, CONTINUOUS

           The Professor buzzes about his various experiments.  He 
           sips a steaming cup of amber tea, absentmindedly 
           sketching impressions on a sheet of paper.  

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Thank you for meeting with us, Dr. 
                        Van Helsing.  We understand you’re 
                        very busy.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        I understand you came from Carfax 
                        Abbey.

           Swanson attempts to hide his surprise.

                                 SWANSON
                        That’s correct.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Dr. Seward was an old pupil of 
                        mine.  He studied here at Oxford.

           Van Helsing continues writing.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Your telegram piqued my interest.  
                        Something about an illness unknown 
                        to all medical theory?

           Nightingale hands Dr. Van Helsing a small GLASS VIAL 
           filled with blood.

           Swanson moves before a series of deformed animals 
           suspended in formaldehyde jars.

                        Judging by the company you keep, 
                        I’d think you some sort of monster 
                        hunter.

           Van Helsing releases a loud chortle.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        You’ve had your head in too many 
                        penny dreadfuls, Chief Inspector.  
                        I deal in the exploration of the 
                        unexplained.  Biological and 
                        hypothetical.  The monsters I 
                        fight float on the air.  Silent 
                        wraiths who can hardly be seen.

           Van Helsing holds the vial between his fingers.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Shall we view your sample?

           MOMENTS LATER

           The group enters into a

           LIBRARY ROOM

           converted into an additional lab space.  An enormous iron 
           and brass MICROSCOPE takes up nearly the entire interior.  

           Across the walls a series of different sized sterling 
           silver MIRRORS have been affixed.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        And what is it you’d hoped to 
                        learn?

           Van Helsing holds a fresh BLOOD SLIDE trapped between two 
           panes of glass.  

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Anything you can teach us.

           Van Helsing places the sample onto the machine’s stage.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        From where did you say this sample 
                        was retrieved?

                                 SWANSON
                        A murder suspect.

           Van Helsing peers into the microscope’s eye piece.  His 
           normally squinted eyes expand in stunned horror.  
                                                            (CONTINUED)

           His teacup falls to the floor, shattering into a thousand 
           porcelain shards.

                        God help us all.

           Swanson and Nightingale shoot concerned looks to one 
           another.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        What is it, doctor?

           Van Helsing falls back into his chair filled with mixed 
           emotions.  He quickly twirls a lever.  

           An aperture pours golden sunlight from the ceiling onto 
           the microscope’s stage.  

           The visual contents of the blood slide bounce across the 
           mirrors of the room like laser light, reflecting and 
           magnifying then clarifying across a far wall.

           RED BLOOD CELLS elegantly drift over the bookcases.  Each 
           of them sickled shaped, withered and rotted.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Before you dances the monster that 
                        could topple London.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Have you ever seen such a thing?

           Van Helsing strokes his chin with worry.  

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Once before.

           He rises to his feet.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Come with me.  Both of you.

           INT. ANTECHAMBER -- UNDERGROUND -- MOMENTS LATER

           A dim and dusty Medieval vestibule of crumbling stone and 
           mortar.  

           Van Helsing leads Swanson and Nightingale by blazing 
           torch.

                        To protect research which demands 
                        more perilous investigative 
                        methods.

           Van Helsing tends to the combination lock.  

           The metal bolts release and the bulky door creaks open.

           INT. SECRET LAB -- UNDERGROUND -- CONTINUOUS

           Musty, humid and cavernous.  An extensive range of 
           vaulted brick passages snaked with leaky lead piping and 
           thick steel girders.

           Various pieces of LAB EQUIPMENT ring a pool of clear 
           turquoise water.  Above the water various IRON CAGES 
           filled with STRANGE ANIMALS have been hung.

           Van Helsing turns a knob.  With a GENTLE HISS a bank of 
           gaslights along the wall flares to life, illuminating the 
           space.

           Van Helsing moves to a large TERRESTRIAL GLOBE hewn from 
           stone and brass.  He rotates the sphere in search of a

                        As a younger man, I travelled the

                        One such expedition brought me 
                        through the wildest and least

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           (Each image appears faded and desaturated.  A moving 
           memory blanched by time.)

           - A younger Van Helsing carries a torch though an eastern 
           European hamlet, glass-eyed villagers disappearing into 
           their dwellings at the sight of him.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING (V.O.)
                        Villagers filled with fanciful 
                        tales led me to a crumbling castle 
                        perched atop a steep cliff.  

           - Van Helsing carefully approaches the crumbling mouth of  
           a decaying grey castle cloaked in fog.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING (V.O.)
                        Inside, lay an unimaginable 
                        horror.

           - Inside the grand halls of the castle, Van Helsing tends 
           to a pale, wrinkled, sickly old man dressed in velvety 
           black robes with a widow’s peak of silver hair.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING (V.O.)
                        Something that was once a man.  An 
                        elderly Romanian nobleman.  A 
                        descendant of the Sacred Order of 
                        the Dragon.  Vladimir Tepes III.  

           - An oil portrait of the diseased man as a youth stares 
           into Van Helsing by candlelight.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING (V.O.)
                        A leprous mystic if ever I saw 
                        one.  He’d been confined to his 
                        castle after contracting illness 
                        from a flying rodent.  

           - A woolly bat flaps its grotesquely large black wings, 
           spreading shadow across the grand halls of the castle.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING (V.O.)
                        Despite being a man of 
                        considerable wealth, he’d been

                        Tepes’ condition left him with 
                        something I call “hemolytic 
                        anemia.”

           - Millions of healthy red blood cells drift through an 
           ocean of plasma, quickly wilting purple and green before 
           dissolving away.

                        Fresh blood.  Nightly.  His own 
                        supply dying by the day.  Sadly, I 
                        was not armed with the knowledge 
                        or means to cure him.  I did 
                        however manage to procure a sample 
                        of his vital fluids in the hope of 
                        one day treating him.

           Van Helsing twirls around.

                        What you see around you is my 
                        attempt to remain vigilant, should 
                        his affliction ever spread beyond 
                        Romania.  Now I fear that dark day 
                        is upon us.

           An unnatural SHRIEK sounds from above.  The group looks 
           to the ceiling.

           Van Helsing uses a long IRON CLAMP to pull one of the 
           cages from the ceiling.  

           Inside SCREECHES a hairless, pink skinned animal covered 
           in lesions.

                        What was lately a rodent.  I’ve 
                        infected it with Tepes’ disease.

           Dr. Nightingale moves close.  The animal opens its 
           scarlet eyes and lunges for her ruddy face, claws 
           slashing.

           Van Helsing motions Swanson and Nightingale to another

           BRICK CHAMBER MENAGERIE

           Inside, dozens of additional cages are filled with all 
           manner of grotesquely malformed animals.  

           Bats.  Wolves.  Dogs.  Pale, crimson eyed, hairless, boil 
           covered and MOANING.

                        What have you been able to learn 
                        from all this, doctor?

           Van Helsing unfurls the fingers of his hand.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        One:  Subjects develop extreme 
                        allergies to sunlight shortly 
                        after exposure.  
                               (gesturing around)
                        It’s why these experiments must be 
                        conducted below ground.  Two:  An 
                        infected body hibernates if an 
                        alternate source of blood is not 
                        consumed once daily.  Three:  No 
                        conventional method of treatment 
                        can reverse the affects of the 
                        disease once a subject has become 
                        infected.

           Van Helsing removes a short cigar from his vest pocket.

           EXT. HIGHGATE CEMETERY -- AFTERNOON

           A HOSPITAL CARRIAGE threads itself through a labyrinth of 
           plant overgrowth, trotting past large ANGELIC BUSTS and 
           chipped GRAVESTONES.

           The coach rests itself ahead of a stone HOLDING CRYPT. 
           TWO MORTUARY ATTENDANTS disembark wielding hot torches.

           INT. CRYPT -- CONTINUOUS

           The two haggard attendants glide down dark corridors, 
           searching walls lined with cobwebbed caskets.

                                 ATTENDANT #1
                        We’re to transport Jonathan and 
                        Wilhelmina Harker to St. Mary’s 
                        for autopsy.

           Attendant #2 finds something.

                                 ATTENDANT #2
                        Here they are.

           Both men carefully slide TWO WOODEN CASKETS to the floor - 
           one headpiece carved with “J. HARKER” the other “W. 
           HARKER.”

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           The caskets are on the floor, where the men make a 
           shocking discovery -

           The lids of the caskets have been crushed to wooden 
           splinters - their contents are empty.

                                 ATTENDANT #2
                        Where’s the bodies?

           Attendant #1 looks upset.

                                 ATTENDANT #1
                        Another bleedin’ grave robbing.
                               (storming off)
                        That’s the fourth one this month!

           Attendant #2 is about to follow his partner, when he 
           hears something down the other end of the crypt.

           Swallowing hard, he pulls a torch ahead, expecting the 
           worst.

           After a few moments of anxious anticipation -

           A small rat scurries out of the shadows.

                                 ATTENDANT #1 (O.S.)
                        You coming, then?

                                 ATTENDANT #2
                        I’m coming.

           The attendant quickly leaves the crypt, too busy to 
           notice - 

           Two sets of REFLECTIVE GREEN HUMAN EYES calmly blinking 
           at the other end of the corridor, each pair watching the 
           attendant leave.

           EXT. BOTANICAL GARDENS, OXFORD -- DUSK, CONTINUOUS

           Swanson and Nightingale stroll through the magnificently 
           lush garden of harlequin flowers and stone statues.  A 
           shimmering silver pond of lily-pads ripples beside them.

                                 SWANSON
                        Bit of an alarmist, that Van 
                        Helsing is.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        It helps to be prepared.  There 
                        can be little doubt the sample we 
                        provided contains the disease in 
                        question.

           Dr. Nightingale moves to a blossoming rose.  She pulls 
           its cardinal bulb to her nose, inadvertently pricking her 
           finger on a thorn.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Now I’ve done it.

           Swanson uses a handkerchief to tend her bleeding finger.  
           She pulls close to him.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        What an unexpectedly pleasant 
                        reversal.

           Swanson shakes off Nightingale’s advances.  She pulls 
           away.

                        Dr. Seward met one of the victims 
                        about acquiring land in Bukovina.  
                        The same place Van Helsing 
                        mentioned treating that noble.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        You’re implying a frail man of ill 
                        health is the one responsible for 
                        throwing you from a building?

           Swanson’s brow furrows with frustration.

                                 SWANSON
                        This case has become something of 
                        a jigsaw.  Not all the pieces fit.

           Swanson removes Harker’s DATEBOOK from his pocket.  He 
           flips to the appropriate page and hands it to 
           Nightingale.

                                 SWANSON
                        Look at this.

           Something dawns on Nightingale.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        It appears several men attended 
                        this meeting.  Seward.  Renfield.  
                        Holmwood.  Morris.  Did you 
                        mention any of these names to Dr. 
                        Seward when you met?

                                 SWANSON
                        It wasn’t my intention to alert 
                        Dr. Seward of my suspicions of the 
                        other men.  They’re all somehow 
                        connected to what’s been 
                        happening.  I’m sure of it.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Holmwood.  Where have I heard that 
                        name?

                                 SWANSON
                        Sir Arthur Holmwood.  One of 
                        London’s wealthiest industrialist.  

           Nightingale unexpectedly pulls two TICKETS from the 
           datebook.  Inked across each in winding calligraphic 
           font:  “LE DAMNATION DE FAUST:  LYCEUM THEATRE.”

           She presents the tickets to Swanson.

           Jack is strapped into a spiked Medieval CHAIR OF TORTURE.   
           A rusted iron MASK OF INFAMY is cinched tightly around 
           his face.

           Hefty orderlies wielding ELECTRIC PROD POLES hover behind 
           Dr. Seward, who stands on the other side of protective 
           cell bars.  

           Seward speaks in a jittery voice.  He’s sweating and 
           disheveled.

                                 DR. SEWARD 
                        You’ve an iron constitution, Jack.  
                        Such an awful lot of 
                        correspondence you’ve had with the 
                        Chief Inspector.  If you remember, 
                        our agreement was that you’d lead 
                        him along a predetermined path.  
                        Now I find you twisting down a 
                        trail of your own design.  What is 
                        it you had hoped to gain from all 
                        this?  Your name in the TIMES 
                        again?  A transfer from these, our 
                        lovely accommodations?

           Jack stays silent.

           Seward moves toward the bars, agitated.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Answer me, Goddamn you!

           Jack sniffs the air.  A glinting silver smile breaks from 
           behind his mask.

                        survive in this place.

           Seward nods to his orderlies.  Two of them plunge 
           electric prod poles through the cell bars into Jack.

           Shocks of electricity SURGE through Jack. He convulses 
           uncontrollably.  Long runnels of blood slide from the 
           spikes of the torture chair, over its cast iron supports.

           Even Seward has difficulty watching.

           The orderlies finish.  Wisps of acrid smoke crawl from 
           Jack’s blood drenched shoulders.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        All men can be broken.  Even 
                        animals such as yourself.  
                        Strength of will be damned.  
                        Continue as you have, and I will 
                        see to it the paltry existence 
                        you’ve clung to here, is shattered 
                        beyond recognition.  Perhaps you 
                        can discuss the benefits of such 
                        an approach with your neighbor, 
                        Mr. Renfield?  

           Jack’s torturers are too pre-occupied to see his fingers 
           slide over and remove a loose spike on his chair.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        You should have gathered by now, 
                        he too has been made to see the 
                        light.

           Seward looks to his men.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Prepare to go again.

           EXT. COVENT GARDEN DISTRICT -- NIGHT

           A moody, cramped thoroughfare of slouching SHACKS.  
           HOMELESS fight with thick flocks of pigeons for crumbs.  

           The white stone columns of the LYCEUM THEATRE loom in the 
           distance.

           A prune-faced OLD GYPSY with blind pallid eyes sits 
           before a cart piled high with trinkets.  

           Chained beside her are two barking GREY WOLVES.  Both 
           occasionally snap at a swarm of velvety orange 
           BUTTERFLIES floating about her cart.

           A DARK FIGURE steps out of the shadows, his face obscured 
           by the upturned collar of his highwayman coat and hat.  

           He approaches the woman.  Her snapping wolves instantly 
           calm, crouching in hushed deference to the presence 
           before them.

           The gypsy smiles, speaking in a thick Romanian accent.

                                 GYPSY
                        They like you.

           The Dark Figure runs gloved leather hands across her cart 
           of trinkets, searching for something.  The sharpened 
           bronze tips of his fingers CLINKING and CLANKING.

           The old woman inhales a lungful of air, recognizing a 
           smell.

                                 GYPSY
                               (in Romanian)
                        It isn’t often I come across a 
                        fellow Romanian.

           She pulls a potted plant from behind her cart and twists 
           off a sprig of soft grey herbs.

                                 GYPSY
                        Transylvanian sage.  From the old 
                        country.  Stowed away some seeds 
                        when I came to this place.   

           A butterfly lands onto the sprig and begins feeding.  The 
           woman smiles.

                                 GYPSY
                        The butterflies eat it.  Take 
                        some.

           The shadowy man finds what he’s looking for and removes 
           it from her cart.  A bulbous GLASS JAR.

           The Dark Figure awkwardly grabs the sprig from the 
           woman’s hand, crushing the butterfly in the process.

           The woman continues to smile, oblivious to the danger.  

           The Dark Figure fills the gypsy’s empty palm with an 
           obscene amount of sparkling GOLD COINS - the same found 
           on Lucille Westernra’s drained corpse.

           A clap of thunder RUMBLES from afar.  Sheets of rain 
           spill from above.

           The gypsy sniffs the air once again, her brow wrinkling 
           with worry.  

           The Dark Figure has disappeared - along with her animals.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET, LYCEUM THEATRE -- NIGHT

           BOBBIES wielding wooden rifles and lacquered batons have 
           gathered in a ring around Inspector Swanson and Dr. 
           Nightingale - both of whom are elegantly dressed.

                                 SWANSON
                        Be on high alert.

           A thick-set BOBBIE tips his hat up with a nightstick, 
           befuddled.

                                 BOBBIE
                        Why here, Chief Inspector?

                        Our victims appear to have

           EXT. LYCEUM THEATRE -- NIGHT

           A tall structure of fluted Doric columns and chiseled 
           friezes.  

           Crowds of WEALTHY PATRONS pack into the entrance.  Men in 
           their waistcoats and brass topped canes - women in their 
           laced corsets and frilled gowns.

           INT. THEATER -- CONTINUOUS

           A grand, gilded hall of brilliant gold leaf and rich 
           maroon.  THREE TIERS of packed seating surround the floor 
           illuminated by dozens of quivering amber gas lamps.

           AT THE BOTTOM TIER

           Swanson and Nightingale take their seats among eager 
           attendees.  Swanson hands over a pair of shiny OPERA 
           BINOCULARS.

                                 SWANSON
                        Watch for anything unusual.

           Nightingale looks over Swanson, admiring his appearance.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        You look nice, Donald.

                                 SWANSON
                        Try to remember why we’re here.

           Nightingale takes the binoculars, disappointed.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Yes, of course.  Couldn’t have 
                        anyone mistaking us for a couple.

           Swanson’s demeanor softens.

                                 SWANSON
                        I’m sorry.  You look beautiful, 
                        Florence.  It’s an honor to have 
                        you by my side.

           Her cheeks rose over with flattery.

           AT THE TOP TIER

           A private VIEWING BOX has been cleared empty. 

           Inside, a HANDSOME ARISTOCRAT in a tall top hat and crisp 
           tailcoat sits alone.  At the exit far behind him, twin 
           INDIAN BODYGUARDS in leaf green turbans stand guard.

           Gas lamps gently dim.  The velvet curtains draping the 
           stage draw back.  Berlioz’s dark opera “LE DAMNATION DE 
           FAUST” begins.

           Nightingale lifts binoculars to her face, excitedly 
           watching

           THROUGH MAGNIFIED LENSES

           as DEMON CREATURES cavort across the stage.  BLACK BIRDS 
           on wires descend, flapping over a hellish landscape.  A 
           single shaft of light beats down on a solitary FAUST.

           Swanson scans the crowd with a watchful eye, searching 
           for anything suspicious.

           INSIDE THE VIEWING BOX

           The Indian bodyguards sense something.  Their eyes 
           narrow.  A DARK SHAPE floats in and out of shadow.  

           Both men split from each other.  

           They quietly unsheathe jeweled scabbards from their 
           belts, heads swiveling about.  Each attempts to locate 
           the wraith at separate sides of the room.

           The FIRST GUARD lifts his knife above his head and 
           plunges it into a shadow moving across a far wall.  

           The scabbard’s blade lodges firmly in the stone, 
           hopelessly skewering something furry.  A runnel of blood 
           trickles from leathery wings belonging to -

           A BAT.

           The first guard looks to his brother across the viewing 
           box.  Both men’s faces wrinkle with confusion.

           The opera’s thunderous music crescendos with OMINOUS 
           TONES.

           Suddenly, two GREY WOLVES leap from the shadows of the 
           viewing box, jaws thick with drool, yellow eyes ablaze.  

           The animals’ knife-sharp jaws tear into both bodyguards’ 
           necks, simultaneously unleashing geysers of blood that 
           violently splatter over the walls.

           As the wolves feast on their fallen prey, a DARK FIGURE 
           emerges from the seats behind the aristocrat.  The LEECH 
           KILLER.

           He plunges a thick, DUAL PRONGED NEEDLE into the man’s 
           jugular.  

           The Killer quickly connects the needle to a length of 
           tubing secured to a brass BLOOD TRANSFUSION APPARATUS at 
           his feet.  The same machine seen earlier in the belfry.  

           Screwed to the base of the apparatus is an empty GLASS 
           MASON JAR labeled:  “ARTHUR HOLMWOOD.”

           The Killer activates the device.  The internal gears 
           WHIRL and SPUTTER to life.

           The aristocrat's eyes instantly white over.  Rich, dark 
           blood pulls from the man’s neck through the tubing into 
           the machine.  

           The Killer connects a separate length of tubing to 
           another dual pronged needle affixed to the same 
           apparatus.  

           He momentarily hesitates, then jabs the needle into his 
           own jugular.

           The Killer proceeds to give himself a full blood 
           transfusion using Holmwood’s vital fluids.

           The Killer’s diseased blood slowly fills the empty mason 
           jar as the process completes itself.

           AT THE BOTTOM TIER

           Nightingale is scanning the crowd with her opera glasses.

           THROUGH MAGNIFIED LENSES

           She tilts up to a private VIEWING BOX.  Inside, Holmwood 
           is writhing in shadow, mouth foaming, body violently 
           convulsing.

           Glasses in hand, Nightingale leaps from her seat, 
           SCREAMING, pointing to the ceiling.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        The Leech!  He’s up there!

           The violins of the orchestra awkwardly SCREECH to a halt.

           Swanson quickly pulls a silver finished pistol from his 
           vest and unloads into Holmwood’s viewing box with a PING-
           PANG-PONG.

           Swanson’s bullets SKITTER around the Killer, shattering 
           wooden moulding to splinters.

           A half dozen BOBBIES rush into the viewing box from the 
           exit, rifles drawn.

           The Killer is hopelessly cornered.  

           He quickly grabs the transfusion apparatus and leaps from 
           the bannister!

           Coat unfurling, he plummets to the

           BOTTOM TIER

           onto the proscenium.  COSTUMED PERFORMERS scatter past 
           the amber glow of footlights to avoid him.

           Bobbies from above wildly fire rounds down to the stage, 
           inadvertently exploding the fiery contents of several gas 
           lamps hung above it.

           Hell is unleashed upon the hall.

           A spit of fire sprays over the Killer’s head and across 
           the stage, igniting sets and props in a curtain of 
           brilliant orange flame. 

           Several members of the audience are doused with fire in 
           the process.

           Filled with terror, the entire auditorium stampedes to 
           the exits.

           The crowd pulls Swanson and Nightingale away from the 
           stage.  

           Swanson desperately attempts to shoot his weapon into the 
           flaming proscenium, but it’s no use.

           Waves of undulating flame overwhelm the platform, 
           spilling into the orchestra pit and climbing up the tall 
           curtains to the domed ceiling.

           The Killer has vanished.

           AMBULANCE CARRIAGE reined to a Clydesdale.  

           Swanson is putting the finishing touches on an INK 
           RENDERING of the Killer dressed in a highwayman’s coat 
           and hat.  

           He hands the drawing to a Bobbie.

                        See to it this makes its way to 
                        press.

           Swanson and Nightingale move to a CORPSE covered in sheet 
           sitting just ahead of the carriage.

           Swanson nods for another Bobbie to remove the sheet.

           Beneath it is the terribly burned, melted remains of SIR 
           ARTHUR HOLMWOOD (40s).  His skeletal face scorched and 
           twisted in an expression of utter terror.

           The Bobbie is overwhelmed by the stench.  He drops the 
           sheet, hurling behind the carriage.

           Swanson and Nightingale each cover their mouths with 
           rags.

                        Sir Arthur Holmwood.

           A glint on Holmwood’s burnt neck catches Swanson’s eye.  

           He kneels down to get a better look and pulls a DUAL 
           PRONGED NEEDLE from the man’s charred nape.

                        What’s this?

           He hands the metallic object to Nightingale.

           She carefully inspects it in her hand, slowly realizing 
           what it is.

                        inclined.

           She moves close to Swanson, excitement in her voice.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Don’t you see?  The puncture 
                        wounds.  The suction.  That’s what 
                        he’s been doing.

           It dawns on Swanson as well.

                                 SWANSON
                        Ridding his body of sickness.  

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Giving himself transfusions using 
                        the victim’s blood.  It’s quick.  
                        It’s quiet.  Really, quite 
                        brilliant.

           The beet red coroner, Dr. Moors, waddles out of a 
           HOSPITAL CARRIAGE and over to the group.  He continues 
           gulping for air, out of breath.

                                 DR. MOORS
                        I came as quickly as I could. The 
                        morgue is full.  St. Mary’s has 
                        been overrun with sickness.  It’s 
                        like nothing I’ve ever seen.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        How do you mean, doctor?

                                 DR. MOORS
                        A group of passengers riding the 
                        London Underground were attacked.  
                        Some diseased psychotics living 
                        beneath the stations.  The bite 
                        wounds are beyond comprehension.

           Dr. Moors throws back a shot of whisky from his flask.

           Nightingale looks to Swanson, worried.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        It’s beginning.  Just as Dr. Van 
                        Helsing warned.  We must find the 
                        original carrier.  He’s the key to 
                        this all.

           A POLICE CARRIAGE trots up to the theater’s remains.

           Out steps Commissioner Bradford.  Flanking him are 
           several MILITARY SOLDIERS on horseback, with their 
           pressed khaki uniforms and ivory Pith helmets.  

           The Commissioner is fuming.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Jesus Christ, Swanson!  You burned 
                        the Goddamn theater to the ground!

           Swanson nods to the soldiers.

                                 SWANSON
                        Who are these men?

                        Sir Holmwood was a friend of the 
                        Queen’s.  Her Majesty’s declared

                        That’s preposterous.  We are on 
                        the verge of apprehending this 
                        wraith.  Now is not the time to -

           The Commissioner stabs a finger into Nightingale’s 
           shoulder.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        You forget your place, madam.

           Nightingale firmly steps forward.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        And where exactly is that, 
                        Commissioner?

           The air charges with tension.  

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Go home.  Both of you.  

           The Commissioner turns to Swanson.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Scotland Yard has failed London. 

           A cluster of salivating NEWS REPORTERS swarm the area.  
           Their flash powder SPARKS.  Strobes of white light shock 
           the scene.

           Commissioner Bradford immediately goes to meet them.

           Nightingale looks on, disappointed.

           Swanson’s eyes narrow.  He scratches the scar across his 
           eye.  A plan begins forming.  

                                 SWANSON
                        Come with me.

           He takes Nightingale by the hand and the two get into a 
           POLICE CARRIAGE.

           INT. SWANSON’S CARRIAGE -- CONTINUOUS

           Swanson and Nightingale face each other, braced against 
           the sway of the moving coach.

                                 SWANSON
                        You wanted to know what I’ve been 
                        doing at Carfax - who I’ve been 
                        seeing?

           Swanson looks out the window, into the rising sun.

                                 SWANSON
                        The man who hacked those women to 
                        pieces ten years ago.  The one who 
                        killed Emily.  The Leather Apron 
                        of Whitechapel.

           Nightingale falls back into her seat, hands rising to her 
           mouth in shock.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        My God, Donald.  Jack the Ripper?  
                        You caught him?

                        Years ago.  He’s been helping me 
                        with this case.

           Dr. Nightingale falls back into her seat, stunned and 
           disturbed.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        I’m so sorry.  What he did to 
                        Emily was...
                               (finding the words)
                        ...unspeakable.  Confronting him 
                        must be a horror in and of itself.

                        so close to discovering who this 
                        cutthroat is, I’d hoped to speak 
                        with him one last time.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Then we should proceed to Carfax 
                        Abbey with haste.  Justice demands 
                        it.

                                 SWANSON
                        He’ll only speak with you.

           Nightingale blanches.

                                 SWANSON
                        He’s been reading the papers.  He 
                        knows you’re working the case with 
                        me.  I understand if you -

           Nightingale steels herself.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        I’ll do it.  I’ll talk to him.  If 
                        that’s what it takes to finish 
                        this.

                                 SWANSON
                        He’s dangerous Florence.  A pure 
                        psychotic.  Are you sure?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        What choice do we have?

           Swanson smiles proudly.  He opens a window and shouts to 
           the coachman.

                                 SWANSON
                        To Carfax Abbey!

           INT. CARFAX ABBEY -- AFTERNOON, CONTINUOUS

           Swanson and Nightingale quickly move through the 
           handsomely decorated mansion.  Several NURSES hover about 
           them in protest.

                                 NURSE
                        As I said before, Dr. Seward

                        Visiting a friend in Hyde Park.

           They continue walking.  A young NURSE turns to 
           Nightingale, pleading.

                                 NURSE
                        Please, Dr. Nightingale - try to 
                        understand.  Dr. Seward will have 
                        us all put out on the streets if 
                        we let you -

           Nightingale stops, firmly rebuking the women.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        We’ll all be dead if you don’t let 
                        me down there.

           A hush falls over the room.  Nightingale notices the RED 
           CROSS LAPEL she pinned to the Nurse’s gown earlier.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Do your part in helping contribute 
                        to the cause.  London’s survival 
                        hangs in the balance.

           The other nurses look to one another, shamed.  The young 
           Nurse straightens up.  

                                 NURSE
                        I’ll have the orderlies prepare 
                        the patient for you at once, 
                        doctor.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Very good.

           Swanson smirks, proud of his partner.

                        the issue.

                        You’ll do fine.  No one is 
                        stronger than you.  Just don’t let 
                        him get inside your head.

           Nightingale exhales a breath of stress.

                        I’ll be here, waiting.

           Nightingale turns to the door and pounds its outsides.  

           An ORDERLY creaks open the metal door.

           INT. BOILER ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           A basement snaked with leaking pipes.  Drips of water 
           SIZZLE atop iron BOILERS roaring with flame, their grated 
           cores tossing glowing orange embers across the room.

           Jack stands cuffed at the center of the space illuminated 
           by flickering firelight.  A demon in waiting.  

           Around his neck is a thick IRON COLLAR.  Three lengths of 
           linked chain have been fastened to it from supports on 
           the ceiling, each held taut by three muscular ORDERLIES.

           The door locks behind Nightingale.  She slowly steps 
           toward Jack, the heels of her laced boots CLICKING across 
           the stone floor.

           Jack looks up, eyes wild.

                        a bit short on time.

           Jack looks her up and down, smacking his lips.  He speaks 
           in a rich, gravely voice.

                        sleep.

            She makes an attempt to ignore Jack.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        I understand you’ve had some time 
                        to think on this case.  What 
                        conclusions have you drawn?

           Jack chuckles to himself.

                                 JACK
                        About Dr. Van Helsing?  Lord 
                        Holmwood?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                               (surprised)
                        You’ve been well informed.

                                 JACK
                        “Well informed.”

           Jack loudly chortles.

                                 JACK
                        Clever ‘lil tramp.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        You know who he is, don’t you?  
                        The Leech.

           Jack smiles a mouthful of silver.

                        Yes, Leechy.  Had my suspicions 
                        for some time.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Who’s been murdering these people, 
                        Jack?

                                 JACK
                        ‘Aint it obvious?  

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        How do you mean?

                                 JACK
                        Who’s got a mind full of screws?  
                        Knows all the corpsies?  Who has 
                        the gold to make ‘em disappear?

           Jack leans forward, chains CLINKING.

                                 JACK
                        The inmate runnin’ the asylum.

           Nightingale’s initially puzzled by the reference.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Dr. Seward?  Impossible.

                                 JACK
                        Bloke’s doped to the gills with 
                        that milk of his.  The doc.  Lost 
                        the plot, he has.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        The killer is a dying man.  His 
                        blood has been thoroughly analyz-

                                 JACK
                               (interrupting)
                        You’ve seen that mansion above 
                        this funny farm?  All queered up 
                        with fancy trinkets.  Whoever has 
                        the gold, makes the rules.  How 
                        hard you think it’d be to plant 
                        the rare red stuff into them jars 
                        Leechy leaves you?  That 
                        Lowlander, Van Helsing - he taught 
                        Seward.  What sort of things he 
                        teach him, you think?

           Nightingale pulls back, considering things.  The 
           orderlies shift uncomfortably.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           (The images come in quick hazy bursts.  In Nightingale’s 
           POV.)

           - Nightingale accidentally interrupts Dr. Seward in his 
           study, she sees infected injection marks dotting the 
           collapsed veins of the doctor’s arms.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE (V.O.)
                        I’m here for Chief Inspector 
                        Swanson.  We’ve an appointment at 
                        Oxford.

           - Nightingale enters Dr. Van Helsing’s lab, gleaming 
           blood jars ring the walls.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING (V.O.)
                        The monsters I fight float on the 
                        air.  Silent wraiths who can 
                        hardly be seen.

           - Nightingale talks to Swanson in a rocking police 
           carriage, Carfax Asylum slowly disappears behind them.

                                 SWANSON (V.O.)
                        Seward is hiding something.  He 
                        knows more than he lets on...

           BACK TO SCENE

           Jack’s tone intensifies.  Foam spittle ejects from his 
           rotted mouth.

                                 JACK
                        Them doctors’ve got you and Boss 
                        chasin’ a goose like a couple of 
                        fuckin’ prats.  It’s been a proper 
                        good time watchin’ you both run 
                        the merry-go-round together.  
                        Truly, it has.

           Nightingale takes a step back.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Why would he kill his own friends?

                                 JACK
                        Same reason I hacked all them 
                        cunnies to bits.  Swanson’s whore 
                        of a sister included.

           Jack leans close, voice hushing to a whisper.  His eyes 
           twinkle with psychotic intensity.

                                 JACK
                        It was fun.

           (NOTE:  The following happens in the span of a few short 
           moments.)

           In a burst of feral energy, Jack unexpectedly EXPLODES 
           from his supports!  

           The chains wrapping him go slack to the floor.  The bolts 
           of his neck collar pop open.

           Clutching a homemade KNIFE crafted from the loose torture 
           chair spike, he leaps at the three orderlies.  

           Swanson can be heard desperately pounding at the locked 
           boiler room door, SCREAMING.

           With sickening predatory precision, Jack dispenses with 
           each orderly.  

           He spills the first guard’s wriggling entrails across the 
           floor.  

           He cuts the second guard’s throat so deep, the man’s head 
           is nearly severed.

           He throws the front half of the third guard into an open 
           boiler, cremating his upper torso to cinders.

           Now splashed with blood, Jack turns his focus to 
           Nightingale - whose knees shake so violently she can 
           hardly stand. 

           Jack slinks over to her, circling his prey.  He moves 
           close.  Smears of the dead men’s blood wipe across 
           Nightingale’s delicate clothing.

           Jack begins unbuttoning Nightingale’s jacket, exposing 
           her breasts.  Shimmering tears streak down her cheeks.  
           Her pillowy lips tremble as she whimpers helplessly.

           Swanson’s SCREAMING intensifies in the background.

           Jack moves inches from Nightingale’s face, sniffing the 
           blonde locks of her fragrant hair.  He closes his eyes, 
           savoring the scent.

           Jack moves close to Nightingale’s ear.  Goosebumps break 
           across her neck as he prepares to speak - mouth 
           glistening with dark drips of blood.

                        Brave ‘lil bitch.  

           Jack stretches out his arm for her to see.  Eight long 
           TALLY MARKS have been carefully slashed across it.  

           He takes the rusted tip of his knife and carves a ninth 
           deep into the flesh of his arm.

                                 JACK
                        You can be my number nine, love.

           Jack’s slimy tongue slides across Nightingale’s cheeks, 
           tasting her salty tears.

           He lifts his rusted knife above his head, preparing to 
           plunge it into Nightingale’s back, when -

           BLAM!  A bullet suddenly rips through Jack’s shoulder, 
           throwing him to the ground.

           Wisps of smoke crawl from the barrel of Swanson’s freshly 
           discharged pistol - the now smashed boiler room door 
           liberated from its supports.

           The first of several orderlies wielding ELECTRIC PROD 
           POLES rush into the room.  They immediately plunge the 
           poles into Jack, electrocuting him into submission.

           Jack laughs uncontrollably.

                                 JACK
                        You’re in too deep, Boss!  
                        London’ll burn ‘cause of you!

           Swanson dashes to Nightingale’s side, slipping across the 
           blood soaked floor.  

           He covers her with his jacket and leads her from the 
           room, Jack’s ravings echoing behind them.

                                 JACK
                        She’ll burn!

           The Inspector stares

           OUTSIDE THE CARRIAGE WINDOW

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - Across the upper level brick flats, wives nervously 
           pull windows closed and blow out candles.

           - On the street, an old couple holding suitcases clutches 
           at a Constable’s waistcoat pleading for a way out of the 
           city.

           - Down a line of shops, a rowdy crowd has gathered in 
           front of an apothecary, a freshly painted sign nailed to 
           its outside reading:  “ANTISEPTIC SOLUTION SOLD OUT!”

           BACK TO SCENE

           INSIDE THE CARRIAGE

           Swanson looks to Nightingale, who remains silently 
           brooding. 

           The Inspector watches her finish buttoning up a freshly 
           cleaned white NURSE’S UNIFORM borrowed from the asylum.

                                 SWANSON
                        I’m sorry, Florence.

           Nightingale stays silent for a moment, then turns to him.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        It’s not you I’m angry with, 
                        Donald.

           He moves close, taking up her trembling hands, gently 
           cupping them with his.

                                 SWANSON
                        You looked the devil in the eye 
                        back there and lived to tell the 
                        tale.  If ever there was a moment 
                        to be proud, it is this day.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        We laugh at children.  How they 
                        claim fear of creatures prowling 
                        the night.  Of all the places I’ve 
                        been.  The things I’ve seen.  I 
                        never could have imagined a more 
                        horrible nightmare made real.

           Nightingale peers through the window as the sun prepares 
           to set on mighty London.

           EXT. BARNUM & BAILEY CIRCUS, HYDE PARK -- NIGHT

           Loud bursts of colorful FIREWORKS detonate over the 
           swaying elms of Hyde Park.  

           Beyond the trees lay an expansive, crowded CIRCUS GROUNDS 
           of carnival lights and attractions.  

           HUNDREDS OF PATRONS pack the area passing glittery women 
           atop leathery elephants and garish clowns dripping with 
           grease paint.

           Dr. Seward struggles to weave through the crowd.  He 
           looks pale and nervous, dabbing his sweaty forehead with 
           a soaked handkerchief.

                        Out of my bloody way.

           Seward gets to the tent face of a large, Western-themed 
           attraction:  “BUFFALO BILL’S WILD WEST!”

           INT. BUFFALO BILL’S WILD WEST - CONTINUOUS

           A dusty dirt floor is ringed by hundreds of anxious 
           onlookers.

           At the center of the ring, a war-weary Native-American in 
           feathers and beads stands alone clutching a tomahawk.  

           He is the famous Native-American CHIEF SITTING BULL 
           (60s).  

           The crowd hushes.

                                 SITTING BULL
                               (shouting)
                        It is through this mysterious 
                        power that we too have our being, 
                        and we therefore yield to our 
                        neighbors, even to our animal 
                        neighbors, the same right as 
                        ourselves to inhabit this vast 
                        land.

           A magical explosion of smoke sweeps across the ring.  The 
           Chief disappears, and in his place, TWENTY-BRAVES on 
           horseback appear SCREAMING battle cries.

           Seward peers through the smoke.  He makes eye contact

           to meet him

           BEHIND THE TENT

           where a series of smaller canvas TEEPEES sit.  

           The two men enter inside one of the dwellings.

           INT. TEPEE -- NIGHT

           Seward addresses the cowboy, a handsome man dressed in a 
           ten-gallon hat and a long leather duster - QUINCY P. 
           MORRIS (40s).  

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Quincy, I’ve come to warn you.

           Morris pours two tall glasses of amber whiskey.

           His thorny handlebar moustache twitches as he speaks with 
           the thick twang of an American accent.

                                 MORRIS
                        Good to see you too, Doc.  Been a 
                        while.

           Morris gulps down one of the glasses, unfazed.  He offers 
           the other to Seward.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        No, I never drink.

           Morris happily gulps it down.

                                 MORRIS
                        What do you want?

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Have you not read the papers?

                                 MORRIS
                        I don’t read.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        What happened in Romania...  
                        Someone...  Some thing has come 
                        seeking retribution for what we’ve 
                        done.

           Morris goes to pour himself another glass, but Seward 
           moves to block him.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        They are all dead.  Lucy.  The 
                        Harkers.  Even, Holmwood.  We’re 
                        next.

           Morris becomes upset, already feeling the effects of his 
           drink.

                                 MORRIS
                        So be it.  Anything that happens, 
                        we deserve for what we done.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BARNUM & BAILEY CIRCUS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Swanson and Nightingale are flanked by Bobbies trailing 
           red-furred BLOOD HOUNDS.

                                 SWANSON
                        Dr. Jack Seward is our suspect.  
                        His intended target: Gunslinger 
                        Quincy P. Morris.

           Swanson and Nightingale take hold of a blood hound of 
           their own.  

           Nightingale pulls a bloodied handkerchief and holds it to 
           the animal’s snout.

           The animal points its slobbery nose to the ground, 
           leading the couple past juggling CLOWNS, roaring TIGERS, 
           Arabian SWORDSMEN, and flaming FIRE-BREATHERS.

           Eventually, the pair comes to the face of

           MORRIS’ TEPEE

           The hound BARKS uncontrollably, its target acquired.

           Swanson cocks his pistol and shouts out.  

                                 SWANSON
                        Dr. Seward, we know you’re in 
                        there.

           A few moments pass, when -

           Dr. Seward emerges from the tent, hands raised.

                        What the devil do you think you’re 
                        doing, sir?

                                 SWANSON
                        Arresting you for the murders of 
                        Lucy Westenra, Jonathan and Mina 
                        Harker, Arthur Holmwood, and, what 
                        I gather may be Quincy P. Morr -

           Suddenly, Morris steps out of the tent behind him, 
           confused.

                                 MORRIS
                        What is all this?

           Dr. Seward chuckles to himself, smug and confident as 
           ever.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Surely you don’t think me the 
                        killer?

           Morris impatiently turns to Seward.

                                 MORRIS
                        I’ve got a show to prepare for.  
                        Nice seein’ you, as always.

           He gives Nightingale a once over, then tips his hat to 
           the others before moving back into his tent.

           Swanson cocks back his pistol.  Seward moves close to 
           him.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Chief Inspector, you made the 
                        awful mistake of letting Jack into 
                        your head.  He’s replaced your 
                        good sense with warped fantasies 
                        and hollow suppositions.  Isn’t 
                        his motivation for leading you to 
                        me, obvious?  I thought better of 
                        you.

           Swanson fills with anger.

                                 SWANSON
                        You’re hiding something, doctor.  
                        I know about Transylvania.  The 
                        nobleman.  The riches Harker 
                        claimed were there.  What 
                        happened?

                        Who is this phantom draining each 
                        of you?  What’ve you done to him? 

           Seward stays silent.

                                 SWANSON
                        I’ve half a mind to soften you in 
                        the Yard’s cells until you’ve 
                        explained yourself, sir.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        On what evidence?  You threaten, 
                        and bluster without cause, Chief 
                        Inspector.

           Glass SHATTERING suddenly sounds from inside Morris’ 
           tent.  

           Nightingale’s hound begins barking uncontrollably.  

           Swanson calls out.

                                 SWANSON
                        Morris?

           No answer.

           Swanson moves Seward aside.  He cocks his pistol and 
           slowly enters

           INSIDE THE TEPEE

           regarding what he sees in stunned horror.

           Morris is seated in a chair, eyes rolled white, a broken 
           whisky bottle at his feet.  Two circular wounds bore deep 
           into his neck.  Dead.

           A gleaming blood jar sits by his side labeled:  “QUINCY 
           P. MORRIS.”

                                 SWANSON
                        Morris is dead!

           Nightingale bursts into the tent.

           A few small clouds of steam rise from a SEWER CAP at the 
           center of the floor.

                                 SWANSON
                        Down there.

           Swanson and Nightingale quickly move back the iron cover.

           Nightingale grabs a lantern and the pair descend into...

           INT. SEWERS -- CONTINUOUS

           ...a foggy maze of arch stone passageways slathered with 
           muck and teeming with rats and cockroaches.  A trickle of 
           water cuts through.

           Long beams of soft colored carnival light filter down 
           from sewer caps lining the ceiling.

           Swanson pulls his silver finished pistol, twisting in 
           every direction in search of movement.  

           Nightingale lifts her lantern ahead.  

           A group of shadows play across the far end of the tunnel.  
           Soft whispers echo from afar.

           Nightingale quietly points forward.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        There.

           The pair splashes across the tunnel towards the shadows.

           Nightingale loses her footing and trips.  She tries to 
           wipe sludge stains off her bleach white nurse uniform.  

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Disgustingly awful.

           Swanson goes to help her.  Something catches his eye - 

           The bony face of a rotting SKELETON dressed in a corset 
           and gown lay at their feet.  

           He takes Nightingale’s lantern and moves it forward.

           Dozens of richly clothed skeletal remains litter the 
           floor of the sewer.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        What did this?

           They continue moving down the damp corridor, around the 
           bend of the sewer to a 

           DRAINING CHAMBER

           where liquid waste has collected in a large circular 
           pool.

           Swanson lifts the lantern high, face blanching at the 
           teeming masses before them.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Oh my God.

           Dozens upon dozens of INFECTED LONDONERS are hunched over 
           the freshly slain bodies of carnival attendees. 

           Each hairless, pustule covered leper feasts upon the 
           severed jugular of a glass-eyed victim.

                                 SWANSON
                        Let’s get the hell out of here.

           Swanson heaves the lantern at the lepers, igniting the 
           entire chamber in a burst of brilliant orange flame.

           MOMENTS LATER - DOWN THE SEWER CORRIDOR

           Swanson and Nightingale run, huffing and puffing lung 
           fulls of rotten air.  

           Wild, pale-skinned, crimson-eyed lepers sprint through 
           the glowing fire behind them, desperate for blood.

           Swanson sees light ahead of a section of the tunnel.  

           Suddenly, a group of equally deranged infected appear 
           there as well.

           The lepers close in from both sides of the corridor, 
           swarming the couple from every direction.  

           Swanson desperately fires into the crowd.  

           A few lepers are felled, SCREAMING as they crumple to the 
           ground in heaps.  

           Several of them each begin oddly smoking.

           Swanson looks to his pistol with confusion.

           Throngs of infected inadvertently push him into a dark 
           opening.

           Nightingale turns, watching Swanson descend through the 
           darkness as lepers close in from all sides.

           INT. DRAIN PIPE -- CONTINUOUS 

           Swanson spirals down, coasting on a slick film of water 
           and sewage, rapidly gaining velocity.
                                   6/27/11

           INT. SUBWAY STATION, LONDON UNDERGROUND -- CONTINUOUS

           Swanson slides out the end of the drain pipe and lands on 
           the wet concrete floor.  

           Nightingale climbs out of the drain pipe behind him.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        What in God’s name was all that!?!

                                 SWANSON
                        You tell me, doctor.

           Swanson continues searching for any signs of the Killer 
           across the underground subway station.

           A path of TRAIN TRACKS cuts through a long stone tunnel.  
           Passengers clutching tickets eagerly wait for a RAIL CAR 
           to arrive.

           The rail car comes screeching across the tracks to a stop 
           directly in front of them.  Swanson watches as passengers 
           begin loading into it.  

           Out of the corner of his eye, a DARK FIGURE appears to 
           leap onto the train car from above. 

                                 SWANSON
                        He’s boarded the train.

           Swanson grabs Nightingale by the hand and pulls her into 
           the car.

           INT. RAIL CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           A richly decadent Victorian train car filled with velvet 
           sofas, silk curtains and crystal chandeliers.

           The train car lurches forward.  The chandeliers CLANK 
           overhead.  

           A few female passengers look on at Nightingale’s soiled 
           clothing in disgust.

           Swanson searches the crowd.  He sees the muddy tip of a 
           broad slouch hat at the far end of the train car.  

           BLAM!  He fires a warning shot into the air.

           Startled passengers part ahead of him, revealing -

           The LEECH KILLER heaving for breath, his deep crimson 
           eyes staring over a black collar.

                        you dead where you stand.

           The Killer shouts out in an deep, thick Romanian accent.

                                 KILLER
                        You have no bullets left to shoot 
                        me with.

           Swanson keeps his gun pointed.

                                 KILLER
                        Besides - what will you do?  Let 
                        the woman die?

           The Killer tilts his head to Swanson’s feet, coat 
           dramatically billowing from behind.

           Nightingale has collapsed.  Two small runnels of blood 
           trickle from her neck.  She’s been bitten.

           Swanson hesitates, slowly kneeling.  Nightingale looks 
           up, reaching for him, helpless.

           INSERT CUT:  SWANSON’S BLOODIED SISTER EMILY REACHES FOR 
           HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS.

           The rail car arrives at its next stop.  

           Frightened passengers quickly exit.

           Swanson looks up - 

           The Killer has vanished from sight.

           EXT. LONDON (AERIAL) -- NIGHT

           The moon floats across the sky like a blue glass 
           cataract, shooting silver light onto the quiet streets 
           below.  

           A storm builds from afar.  Hot arcs of white lighting 
           stab the horizon, giving way to a deep RUMBLE of thunder.

           Sewer caps across the city suddenly lift, one by one.

           Out of the darkness, HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS of lepers 
           slowly flood the street, silent phantoms spreading across 
           the city like a living plague.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ST. MARY’S HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           Rows of nervous family members.  NURSES and NUNS buzz 
           about doling out steaming cups of tea.

           Among those waiting, Swanson anxiously tugs at the chain 
           of his pocket watch.

           Dr. Van Helsing bursts forth from the entrance, out of 
           breath, a MEDICAL BAG at his side.  He shouts out to 
           Swanson.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Chief Inspector!  We’ve no time to 
                        be lost!

           INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

           Swanson and Van Helsing quickly move past overcrowded 
           rooms filled with sick, pale, boil-ridden patients.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        I came as soon as I recieved your 
                        wire.  Where is she?  How long 
                        since she was bitten?

                                 SWANSON
                        An hour.  Maybe less.

           They stop at the opening to a patient’s room.  

           The beet red drunkard, Dr. Moors stumbles out of the 
           entrance, flask in hand.  

           Terribly savage SCREAMS come from behind him.  Moors 
           raises his flask to toast the two men.

                                 DR. MOORS
                        Good luck.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Cream lace curtains elegantly flutter past an open window 
           sill.

           Several nurses are bent over a bed holding Dr. 
           Nightingale.  Her skin is milk-white and glistening with 
           beads of sweat.  
                                                            (CONTINUED)

           CONTINUED:

           She struggles in terrible pain, purple veins throbbing.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Help me!  God help me!

           Swanson and Van Helsing rush to her side.  

           Van Helsing sets his bag down and quickly checks 
           Nightingales’ eyes.  They have clouded over solid red.  

           He gingerly places a hand across her forehead, quickly 
           drawing it back.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        We must administer a solution at 
                        once.

           Swanson looks to Van Helsing, confused.

                                 SWANSON
                        I thought you said there was no 
                        cure?

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        You didn’t think I’d entrust the 
                        result of years of research to a 
                        couple I’d just met?

           Van Helsing removes from his bag a GLASS VIAL filled with 
           silver crystals suspended in a clear liquid.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING 
                        Her blood boils.  Each drop dying 
                        by the minute.

           Van Helsing screws the vial onto a hypodermic needle.

                                 SWANSON
                        What is that?

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        A concoction of my own making.  
                        Silver nitrate solution.  

           Nightingale’s back arcs in a burst of agony.  

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        The cells of this disease react 
                        unfavorably to silver.  But, we 
                        must be cautious.  If hemolysis 
                        occurs on the serum, her healthy 
                        blood cells will explode.

           Swanson turns to Van Helsing, concern in his eyes.

                                 SWANSON
                        You’ve tried this before then?

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        On animals.  Goats.  Sheep.

           Van Helsing squirts the solution from the tip of a long 
           gleaming needle.  

                                 SWANSON
                        Will it hurt?

           He prepares to plunge it into Nightingale’s jugular.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Incomprehensibly so.

           He jams the needle into her neck and squeezes the 
           plunger.  

           Nightingale’s resulting SCREAMS are so terrifying, the 
           other nurses immediately flee the room.

           She struggles against the cure, writhing and kicking.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Grab hold of her!

           Swanson and Van Helsing brace against Nightingale to calm 
           her.  

           Her veins raise, each coursing with silver nitrate.  Fine 
           wisps of smoke crawl from the surface of her sizzling 
           skin. 

           Then, Nightingale begins settling, gasping for breath.  

           Swanson moves close, lovingly squeezing Nightingale’s 
           hand tight against his.

                                 SWANSON
                        I’m here Florence.  I’m here...

           Van Helsing is distracted by the distant sound of 
           building chaos.  

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Hold her close, Chief Inspector.

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Van Helsing is at the window sill clutching a golden 
           CRUCIFIX.  Across his eyes dance long tendrils of rising 
           flame.

           Swanson kisses Nightingale on the forehead, then moves to 
           Van Helsing’s side.

                                 SWANSON
                        Watch Dr. Nightingale.  

           He hands Van Helsing a wax sealed ENVELOPE.

                                 SWANSON
                        When she wakes, give this to her. 

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Where will you go?

                                 SWANSON
                        Carfax Abbey.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW

           London is burning.  Carriages have overturned.  
           Storefronts are shattered.  

           Throngs of terrified citizens scatter across the streets, 
           diseased, ravenous lepers in fast pursuit.  

           A fork of lightning stabs BIG BEN’S spire, giving way to 
           a torrent of rain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MUSIC ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE -- NIGHT

           Queen Victoria sits at her piano by candlelight, solemnly 
           tapping at the ivory keys alone, unable to see London 
           burning ahead of the story-high windows before her.

           A shimmering tear falls from her wrinkled face, delicate 
           orange flames reflecting across it.

           A ROYAL GUARD adorned with medals approaches her.

                                 ROYAL GUARD
                        It’s time, your Majesty.

           EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Scores more ROYAL GUARDS on horseback encircle the 
           Queen’s STATE COACH of teak wood gilded in gold leaf.  

           A group of subjects holding umbrellas lead the Queen to 
           her carriage.

           She nods to the highly decorated COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF of 
           the British Military approaching the carriage flanked by 
           groups of heavily armed SOLDIERS.

                                 QUEEN VICTORIA
                        I will to you the authority to 
                        take control of our city, 
                        Commander.  God be with you.

           The Commander watches eight horses break into a trot, 
           pulling the reflective coach away from the palace to 
           safety.

           Behind the Commander, additional soldiers wheel MAXIM 
           MACHINE GUNS out of several ammunition-filled WAR WAGONS 
           gathered in front of the palace.

                                 COMMANDER
                        We will not fail you, your 
                        Highness.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CARFAX ABBEY -- NIGHT

           A watery blanket of rain soaks everything it touches.

           The imposing manor sits dark and dormant.  Its windows 
           are shattered.  Gas lamps no longer hiss with flame.

           Swanson and a half dozen BOBBIES wielding rifles on 
           horseback arrive.  They quickly kick down the front door.

           INT. CARFAX ABBEY -- CONTINUOUS

           It’s deathly quiet save for the sound of rain and thunder 
           building outside.

           Each of the men hold glowing gas lamps to their faces, 
           weaving through the mansion.

           The interior has been ransacked.  Paintings hang crooked.  
           Walls are smashed.  The once roaring fireplace weakly 
           pulses with dying embers.

           A hot shock of lighting suddenly illuminates the room.

           Bloodied, mutilated NURSE CORPSES litter the floor, their 
           limp bodies already buzzing with flies.

           Swanson kneels to a nurse’s corpse.  Her neck has been 
           slashed to the spine.  A lump crawls into his throat.

                        Knife wounds.  All of them.

           The men come to Dr. Seward’s office door.  Swanson slowly 
           creaks it open.

           INT. SEWARD’S OFFICE -- NIGHT

           A harsh wind whips through the darkened doctor’s office, 
           swirling papers across the room.  Someone is seated in 
           the doctor’s chair, his back turned.

           Swanson carefully turns the chair.

           In it sits the rasping, terribly slashed body of Dr. 
           Seward.  His shirt is soaked in blood.  A broken off 
           morphine needle juts from his withered arm.

           The men quickly circle the doctor.

           Red spit bubbles at Seward’s mouth as he attempts to 
           speak.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                               (weakly)
                        Those grotesques.  They 
                        overwhelmed the manor.

           The other officers hush.  Swanson moves close. 

                                 SWANSON
                        Where is Jack, Doctor Seward?

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Gone.

           Swanson’s eyes widen with uneasy realization.  He begins 
           dabbing the doctor’s forehead with a white silk 
           handkerchief.

                                 SWANSON
                        Help us save the city.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        It’s too late.

                        madness.  Make peace with your 
                        creator.

           Seward motions Swanson closer, whispering at his ear.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           (Each morphine induced hallucination appears warped and 
           distorted, twisting in on itself and reversing.  Voices 
           echo alternately and quickly clarify.)

           - R.N. Renfield walks into Jonathan Harker’s office 
           beaming, a tattered map in his hands.  He flips a roughly 
           pressed gold coin onto Harker’s desk. 

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        A year ago, R.N. Renfield 
                        approached Jonathan Harker with a 
                        treasure map he’d acquired while 
                        abroad.

           - Harker sits with Dr. Seward in a less opulent Carfax 
           Abbey.  Lucy Westenra stands behind Seward, hand at his 
           shoulder.  Harker hands over the map.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        We decided to organize an 
                        expedition.

           - In a dimly lit pub, Harker, Seward, Holmwood and Morris 
           raise frothy beer glasses to the ceiling.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        Harker provided the map.  Holmwood 
                        funded the voyage.  Morris offered 
                        protection.  

           - Renfield watches outside the pub as the men celebrate.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        Renfield discovered our plot and 
                        became enraged.

           - Renfield foams at the mouth, red faced, screaming at 
           Jonathan Harker on the steps of his flat.  Mina Harker 
           nervously watches from parted curtains.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        So I had him committed to my 
                        asylum.

           - Muscled orderlies pull a straightjacket onto Renfield 
           and drag him kicking and screaming into the dark 
           corridors of the asylum.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        After several weeks journey, we 
                        came to a crumbling castle.

           - Holding torches, the group approaches the snowy mouth 
           of a stone fortress.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        A weak old nobleman lay inside.  A 
                        leprous wretch villagers called 
                        “Dracula.”

           - Morris slams the butt of his rifle against Vlad Tepes 
           III’s face, splashing dark blood and white teeth across 
           the marble floor.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        The bowels of his castle held 
                        unimaginable riches.

           - The group enters a subterranean vault of ruined statues 
           and overturned trunks filled with sparking gold coins and 
           twinkling gems.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        We filled our coaches...

           - Harker, Seward and Holmwood finish loading the last of 
           the gleaming treasure into an overstuffed carriage.  
           Morris approaches the castle with a roaring torch.

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        ...and burned the castle...

           - The lantern-lit carriage filled with treasure pulls 
           away, the castle behind it now consumed in flame.  

                                 DR. SEWARD (V.O.)
                        ...with the old man still dying 
                        inside.

           - Tepes III’s melted body dissolves in flame, his 
           horrific screams echoing through the blazing inferno.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Seward gasps for breath.  Swanson looks on, confused.  

                                 SWANSON
                        If you killed him, who is seeking 
                        retribution against you?

           Seward pulls Swanson close.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        His steward.

           Swanson glances to the other Bobbies, concerned.

                        His half-brother.  

           Seward clenches Swanson’s collar tight, his dying words a 
           final, pain-filled gasp.

                                 DR. SEWARD
                        Graf Orlok.  Nosferatu.

           Seward goes slack.  His eyes glaze over.  Dead.

           Swanson steps back, mind racing.  A BOBBIE nervously 
           speaks.

                                 BOBBIE
                        What now, Chief Inspector?

           Swanson scans across the room to an open window.  Foggy 
           London burns bright in the distance.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - A group of soldiers hastily crank a loud warning siren 
           atop a water tower overlooking the city, its alarm 
           ringing across the rain drenched metropolis.

           - Ships overflowing with wealthy passengers struggle to 
           pull from London’s docks, a riot of blood-thirsty lepers 
           overwhelming each.

           - Downtown, masses of people from all classes scream as 
           they attempt to escape the blazing city, carriages 
           overturning, horses running free.

           - Billowing newspapers float through the broken, flaming 
           city.  Swanson’s sketch of the Leech Killer is 
           accompanied by a headline:  “LEECH BURNS LONDON!”

           - Thousands of infected lepers glide through the maze of 
           flaming buildings, savagely biting at the necks of men 
           and women helpless to defend themselves.

           - A group of Bobbies fire wildly at an infected crowd 
           gathered around them.  The crimson-eyed savages overwhelm 
           them in one push.

           - From war wagons the Commander of the Army signals his 
           men to begin firing into crowds, their maxim machine guns 
           tearing leper flesh to bloodied bits of red meat.

           - A leper ferociously laps at a geyser of blood flowing 
           from the open throat of an elegantly dressed woman, 
           hundreds more infected rising from the sewers behind him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- LATER, NIGHT

           The building has been abandoned.  Gas lamps sputter winks 
           of light across the room.

           Nightingale lies in a hospital bed, recovering.

           Van Helsing sits by her bedside, puffing hot the cherry 
           of his cigar while he keeps an anxious vigil. 

           Nightingale flinches, and blinks her eyes groggily as she 
           slowly awakes.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        How do you feel?

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Dreadfully awful.  What... 
                        happened?

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        You were infected by illness 
                        coughed forth from the darkest 
                        corners of Europe.  The city has 
                        since been overwhelmed by it.

           Nightingale anxiously lifts herself up.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Where’s Donald...  Chief Inspector 
                        Swanson...?

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Gone.  To Carfax Abbey.  He 
                        instructed me to give you this.

           Van Helsing hands over a wax sealed ENVELOPED.

           Nightingale opens it.  In quickly scrawled font, a note 
           reads:  “LEAVE THE CITY. NEVER LOOK BACK. YOURS ALWAYS, 
           DONALD.”

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        He loves you, I think.  Meanwhile, 
                        we sit here fiddling while Rome 
                        burns.

           Nightingale rises to her feet.  She begins pulling on 
           clothing behind a DRESSING SCREEN.

                        We will need to leave London at 
                        once.  I’m afraid the city is all 
                        but lost.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        You are mistaken, doctor.

           Nightingale steps from behind the screen, fully dressed.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        You cured me, which means there is 
                        still hope.

           Nightingale looks to Van Helsing’s MEDICAL BAG opened at 
           the floor.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        How much more do you have?

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Enough.  But we lack a proper 
                        method of distribution.

           Nightingale’s gaze is drawn by the flutter of a gas lamp.  
           A thought strikes her mind.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        On the contrary.

           She tosses Swanson’s letter into the lamp and watches it 
           curl black with flame.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Come with me, doctor.

                                 DR. VAN HELSING
                        Where?

                        To Carfax Abbey.

           EXT. STREETS, LONDON -- CONTINUOUS

           Nightingale and Van Helsing each race by horseback 
           through the bloody chaos of London’s streets, dodging 
           lepers hunched over feeding on pale corpses.

           An injured CONSTABLE waiving a NEWSPAPER leaps in front 
           of the pair.

           The Constable points to the ILLUSTRATION of the Leech 
           Killer on the front page of the TIMES LONDON.

           Nightingale looks to Van Helsing, wary.

                        We’ve no time.

           Nightingale extends a hand down to the police man, skirt 
           dramatically flowing in the storm.

           A battalion of BRITISH SOLDIERS led by square jawed 
           COLONEL BRYAN MAHON (40s), approach the grounds on 
           horseback.

           Commissioner Bradford and SCOTLAND YARD INVESTIGATORS 
           ride at their side.  

           They all quickly dismount and rush inside.

           INT. SEWARD’S OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Swanson and his men are interrupted by the soldiers.  
           Colonel Mahon and Commissioner Bradford step forth.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        I’ve come to evacuate you from the

                        Graf Orlok.

                        London’s been placed on mandatory 
                        quarantine by authority of Queen 
                        Victoria.  If dying is what you 
                        wish, remain here.

           He looks to the other Bobbies.

                        Any among you hoping to see 
                        another sunrise will come with us.

           Van Helsing and Nightingale suddenly rush into the room 
           out of breath, the bloodied Constable at their side.

           Swanson turns to Nightingale.

                                 SWANSON
                        What are you doing here, Florence?

           Nightingale removes from Van Helsing’s bag, a large GLASS 
           CYLINDER filled with silver shards suspended in liquid.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE

                        more and there may not be an

                        at the Metropolitan Gasworks 
                        facility.  Enough of his compound 
                        will spread across the city 
                        through London’s gaslight network, 
                        to cure most everyone infected.

                        London’s defense now falls to us.

           The Inspector quickly checks the barrel, then snaps it 
           shut.

           Bits of ash aimlessly drift past smashed storefronts and 
           bloodied lepers like apocalyptic snow.

           Colonel Mahon leads a CARAVAN of quickly moving horses 
           and WAR WAGONS weaving through the burning city, a 
           tattered UNION JACK flapping in the breeze.

           SOLDIERS wielding high-powered MAXIM MACHINE GUNS mow a 
           path ahead of the caravan, tearing apart diseased LEPERS 
           with a steady stream of silvery ammunition.

           Behind the wagon, Swanson, Nightingale, Van Helsing and 
           the others gallop at full speed atop muscled steeds - 
           dodging felled bodies and spent brass shell casings.

           The group comes to a fork in the road.  Nightingale, Van 
           Helsing and a UNIT OF SOLDIERS divert toward the 
           METROPOLITAN GAS WORKS facility.  

           Swanson, Commissioner Bradford and SCOTLAND YARD 
           INVESTIGATORS push on toward BIG BEN.

           The Killer crouches at the edge of an eave overlooking 
           London, his black highwayman coat beating in the rainy 
           tempest.

           A beautifully catastrophic, vertiginous panorama of the 
           smoldering city lay ahead of the steeples.

           His scarlet eyes narrow to thin slits, observing

           as Swanson and his cavalcade of investigators arrive at 
           the base of the clock tower.

           EXT. TOWER BASE -- NIGHT

           Swanson and his men reach the entrance.  They all 
           dismount, rifles and pistols at the ready.

           The Commissioner signals for several men to stay behind.

           The Commissioner shouts out.

                                 COMMISSIONER BRADFORD
                        Tonight, we prove Scotland Yard’s 
                        worth!

           They all raise rifles to the sky.  The Commissioner turns 
           to Swanson.

                        Yes sir.

           Swanson throws his weight at the door, smashing open its 
           supports.

           He and FIVE MEN swarm into the tower.

           INT. STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           A tall wooden staircase twists to the BELFRY.

           The group carefully ascends the stairs, howling winds and 
           torrential rain battering the spire from outside.  A deep 
           rumble of THUNDER booms overhead.

           Suddenly, a maelstrom of screeching BATS explodes from 
           the ceiling.  Teeming hordes fill the air, tearing at the 
           men’s skin and clothes.

                                 SWANSON

           wings and fangs.

           A shadowy space of arched metal ceilings and cranking 
           gears.  

           BIG BEN’S enormous, bronze-webbed CLOCK FACE ticks away, 
           the city burning bright through its opaque center.

           Several stories-high IRON BELLS hang from above, their 
           knotted ropes twirling.  Runnels of cold rainwater splash 
           from the ceiling into puddles on the floor.

           Swanson and his men enter out of the staircase, weapons 
           pointed.

           They quickly search the belfry before coming to the 

           CLOCK FACE

           where the LEECH KILLER stands silhouetted, back turned 
           overlooking the city.

           Swanson moves ahead, rifle aimed at the Killer’s back.  
           He shouts out with steely conviction.

                        You have come to escort me to the 
                        gates of hell?

           He slowly discards a tattered highwayman coat and hat, 
           which falls to the floor like a second skin.  Neck 
           craning, he reveals himself to the men.  

           A jolt of white lighting illuminates the Killer’s naked 
           upper torso and hideous visage -  

           GRAF ORLOK A/K/A NOSFERATU (40s), a living nightmare.  
           Bald headed with deep, blood-red eyes.  A sinewy muscled 
           frame of deformed flesh covered in open lesions.  Two 
           large, rodent-like front teeth hang over his bottom lip.

           The men swallow hard, each cocking their weapons.  

           Swanson remains steadfast.

                        On your knees.

           Orlok raises his leather gloved hands, each finger tipped

           They pass through the factory’s doors.

           INT. FACTORY -- NIGHT

           Gas lamps illuminate an expansive network of IRON PIPES, 
           steaming ENGINES, pumping PISTONS and roaring FURNACES.

           DOZENS OF LEPERS feed on the FACTORY WORKERS by gaslight.  
           Splashes of dark blood gloss equipment where the men once 
           worked.

           Nightingale, Van Helsing and the others slink behind a 
           CONDENSER.

           UP AHEAD

           A series of huge metal COAL BINS sit.

           The coal inside a bin sifts downward, falling between TWO 
           ROLLING MASHERS which pulverize it into tiny pieces.  The 
           resulting gas is sucked into large iron pipes.

           AT THE CONDENSER

           Nightingale points forward, whispering.

                        There.  The mixers.

                        We’ll create a phalanx formation

           The sweaty soldiers encircle Nightingale and Van Helsing.  
           They all quietly cock their weapons.  

           Colonel Mahon prepares to signal.

           The soldiers unload their weapons at anything that moves.  
           Rifles loudly CRACKING in precise synchronicity.  

           A ballet of carnage ensues.

           Bullets fly through hot clouds of gunpowder, tearing gory 
           holes through anything caught in the cross-fire.

           Several lepers manage to penetrate the firing phalanx, 
           overtaking a few soldiers, pinning them to the ground and 
           feasting on their opened jugulars.

           The circle of soldiers surrounding the doctors tightens, 
           slowly shrinking.

           He purses diseased lips releasing a shrill high-pitched 
           WHISTLE.

           Two yellow-eyed gypsy WOLVES leap from the shadows, fur 
           matted, pink gums foaming.  

           They viciously attack, SMASHING two men to the ground, 
           burying their razor-sharp muzzles into warm flesh.

           The other men quickly react, spraying bullets at Orlok.  

           He somersaults around the shadows, dodging the rounds 
           with fluid, effortless grace.

           Several stray shots SHATTER the glass clock face behind 
           the wraith, inviting the raging thunderstorm into the 
           belfry.

           With his bronze claws, he lacerates the first man’s neck, 
           splitting it like ribbons of marbled meat.

           He plunges two fingers into the second man’s face, 
           skewering his eyeballs.  Tears of thick blood disgorge 
           from the man’s empty eye sockets as he howls in pain.

           Orlok lunges at the third man, gnashing his yellow teeth.  
           He tears a gaping wound into the man’s throbbing throat 
           lapping fresh blood from an open vein before discarding 
           the remains down the staircase.

           A SHOCK of lightning illuminates the wide mouthed, bug 
           eyed corpses of Scotland Yard’s elite at Orlok’s feet.  

           He turns, face splattered with blood.  The wolves trot to 
           his side, bits of flesh and smatters of blood caught in 
           their grey coats.

           Orlok’s scarlet eyes dart about as he searches the belfry 
           for Swanson.  

           He enters a 

           MAZE OF CLOCK GEARS

           each oily cog CRANKING away with a TICK. TICK. TICK. 
           TICK.

           Orlok SCREECHES his talons across the grimy metal of a 
           rotating cog, brilliant orange SPARKS arcing away from 
           their glimmering tips.

           VALVE, breaking it off.  GAS FUMES hiss out in an 
           invisible stream.

           The lepers have had enough.  Colonel Mahon can see it in 
           their eyes.

           In a flash, the infected blitz the group.

           Colonel Mahon tosses his weapon and unsheathes his SWORD, 
           hacking and stabbing, screaming to the others.

           The lepers quickly overwhelm the Colonel, tearing at his 
           uniform and eating into him like a pack of ravening 
           wolves.

           His sword comes down across a pipe, shooting a spark into 
           the gas jet.  

           A wall of flame spurts from the pipe, incinerating 
           Colonel Mahon and the lepers feasting on him.

           The soldier, Nightingale and Van Helsing sprint to the

           Those not incinerated, leap through the wall of flame 
           chasing them

           UP THE STAIRS

           making quick work of the soldier bringing up the rear, 
           engulfing his corpse in a wave of gore.

           Van Helsing immediately takes up the soldier’s RIFLE.

           Nightingale and Van Helsing are only a few yards from the 
           COAL BINS, more lepers racing behind them.

           into the surge of infected hurtling toward them.

                        Swanson.  Just as London’s

                        those I slaughtered took a brother 
                        from me.  You and I are not so 
                        different.  We both understand the 
                        meaning of loss.  Of pain.

           Orlok’s pinched ears perk.  He hears something and peers 
           across the room.

                        And what must be done to those who

           Swanson’s BOWLER HAT peeks out from atop one of the 
           gears. 

           A devious smile curls from Orlok’s lips.  He crouches, 
           slowly slinking near the hat, preparing to pounce - his 
           savage wolves snarling beside him.

           Suddenly, Swanson unexpectedly darts from behind Orlok, a 
           massive STEEL WRENCH in his hands.  

           Orlok’s wolves immediately dive in their master’s 
           defense.

           In a flash, Swanson slams his wrench over the first 
           wolf’s head, splitting the animals soft skull to bits of 
           bone and brain. 

           Swanson kicks the second wolf into a series of nearby 
           twirling gears.  

           The square teeth of the cogs act as a meat grinder, 
           churning the wolf’s yelping body into a mass of flesh and 
           fur.

           Orlok’s eyes widen with unfettered rage.  

           He races toward Swanson and the men clash, bronze nails 
           SPARKING against the metal of Swanson’s wrench.

           The two enemies dig into one another, stumbling back into 
           the 

           BELFRY

           Orlok swipes across Swanson’s face, slicing three 
           extremely deep gashes into the sinewy muscle of his 
           cheek.  Blood pours from the open wound.

           The wrench falls from Swanson’s hands, CLANGING to the 
           floor.

           Orlok leaps atop his prey, SLAMMING Swanson onto the 
           ground as a vein of white lighting crawls across the 
           stormy sky behind them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FACTORY -- NIGHT

           Van Helsing and Nightingale continue fighting for their 
           own lives.

           CLICK.  Van Helsing’s rifle runs out of ammunition.  

           The wild lepers dig in, preparing to finish the job.

           Nightingale removes the SILVER NITRATE from a medical bag 
           and plunges it down one of the COAL BINS.

           TWO ROLLING MASHERS shatter the glass receptacle soaking 
           the chalky black coal with lustrous solution.

           A thick swirl of SILVER GAS shoots from the bottom of the 
           crusher and is immediately sucked into the gas pipes.

           The GAS LAMPS inside the factory extinguish and the open 
           GAS VALVE fires a steady stream of vapor into the 
           building.  

           A silvery cloud of fumes creep into every corner of the 
           darkened building.

           Nightingale and Van Helsing watch on, as the silver mist 
           overwhelms the infected - their arms and legs flailing 
           wildly in the building fog.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - Each and every gas lamp is summarily snuffed out across 
           London.  The entire city goes dark.

           - Plumes of silver gas prowl through the moonlit 
           cobblestone streets, past shops, pubs and theaters filled 
           with infected.

           - Shimmering vapor overwhelms a group of lepers feeding 
           on nuns at the steps of a church.  Once exposed, they all 
           collapse to the ground.

           - The gas twists through the rainy docks.  Infected fall 
           from dozens of ships’ masts, plunging into the icy water 
           below.

           - Parked atop a grassy escarpment overlooking the city, 
           the Queen smiles inside her golden carriage.  Royal 
           Guards watch the cure spread, cheering.

           - At street level, the fog clears past the muddied boots 
           of Britain’s Commander-In-Chief, felled infected laying 
           in droves ahead of him.

           - Soldiers slowly pull through the city, rifles drawn, 
           searching for any remnants of the diseased.  

           - Clusters of healthy Londoners slowly emerge from 
           buildings, spreading out into the streets with caution.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. BELFRY -- NIGHT

           A distant grumble of thunder shakes the belfry, the storm 
           finally pulling away from the horizon.

           In shock, Swanson falls in and out of consciousness.  His 
           eyes white, body wracked with pain.

           Orlok slides his pustule covered tongue across Swanson’s 
           bleeding face, savoring each drop of precious blood.

           Then, there’s a CLICK.  

           Orlok looks down.  Swanson has his silver finished pistol 
           dug into his ribs.

           Small wisps of smoke crawl from the leper’s pale flesh.  
           His eyes widen in stunned realization.

           Swanson pulls the trigger.  The hammer CLACKS.  

           No shots are fired.  He is out of bullets.

           Out of desperate exhaustion, Swanson continues thumbing 
           back the hammer and pulling the trigger.

           Orlok lets out a deep bellow of laughter.

                                 ORLOK
                        Every life must have its end.  Now 
                        comes yours.

           He throws his head back, sharp teeth widening.  

                                 ORLOK
                        The blood is the life.

           Orlok prepares to tear through Swanson’s neck, eyes 
           blazing with demoniac fury, when -

           JACK THE RIPPER SUDDENLY BURSTS FORTH FROM THE SHADOWS!

           His steely blue blade catches the light just before it 
           plunges into Orlok’s belly.

           The two killers roll around the belfry, stopping just 
           beneath a cluster of enormous IRON BELLS hanging 
           overhead.

           Jack constricts Orlok’s head in a tight-fitting choke 
           hold.  The leper scratches and claws, slicing thin red 
           cuts across The Ripper’s glistening bicep.

           Jack laughs off Orlok’s struggles, enjoying the 
           confrontation.  He further tightens his hold. 

                                 JACK
                        Ugly ‘lil rat, ain’t ya?

           Both men stand just ahead of BIG BEN’s shattered clock 
           face.  

           A cool wind whips across the city, clearing away some of 
           the silver fog from London’s steeples.

           Jack twists the knife out of Orlok’s belly, pointing the 
           blood splashed blade across the landscape.

                                 JACK
                        She’s mine.  All of her.  And I 
                        aim to keep you from forgettin’.

           Jack wraps Orlok’s head in the ropes fluttering above.

                                 ORLOK
                        There will always be more.  Be 
                        done with it.  Send me to hell.

           Orlok rasps, runnels of black blood flowing from his 
           sickening maw.

           Jack puts his blade to the leper’s throat, relishing the 
           moment.

                                 JACK
                               (winking)
                        Don’t forget to tell ‘em, Jack 
                        sent ya.

           With a powerful swipe, Jack pulls his knife along Orlok’s 
           neck, instantly severing it from the base of his spine.  

           The leper’s head falls to the floor, rolling toward 
           Swanson’s feet.

           The slack from the rope gives out, and the enormous IRON 
           BELLS overhead VIBRATE with a deafening, ear-splitting 
           DONG!

           First beams of sunlight shine through BIG BEN’s open 
           face, silhouetting Jack the Ripper along with the blood 
           dripping from his gleaming blue knife.

           Jack slowly cranes his neck around, carefully studying 
           Swanson’s collapsed body.  Thinking.  Looking down to his 
           sparkling blade with hesitation.

           The bell continues tolling.  DONG!  DONG!  DONG!

           What to do...

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           The golden sun has risen into the soft pink sky, burning 
           off the fog enveloping the city.

           Commissioner Bradford and his men weave through the 
           belfry, weapons drawn.  

           They move around a corner, gasping at what they see.

           Swanson’s body lay across the floor, Orlok’s severed head 
           at his feet.

           The men rush over to Swanson.  

           Nightingale suddenly stumbles into the room, covered in 
           coal soot.  She breaks through the group and kneels.

           Shimmering tears fall from her eyes, each one plopping 
           onto Swanson’s slashed vest.

           Then, Swanson’s eyes slowly flit open.  He takes up her 
           hand and squeezes tight.

           A wide grin breaks across Nightingale’s lips.  She 
           lovingly strokes his hair, eyes flooded.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        It’s over.

           EXT. LONDON, ENGLAND (AERIAL) -- DAY

           Wooden scaffolding spirals around the outsides of nearly 
           every building across London - BIG BEN’s shattered face 
           repaired to its former glory.

           EXT. MARYLEBONE TRAIN STATION -- DAY

           Diesel LOCOMOTIVES chug forward, belching black clouds of 
           smoke into the clear blue sky.  

           Passengers eagerly await incoming trains, clutching 
           tickets, flipping through the TIMES LONDON.  A headline 
           reads:  “LONDON LIMPS BACK: CITY ON THE MEND!”

           Chief Inspector Swanson is sitting on a bench, three 
           stitched scars slashed across his face.

           He sketches a traditional stipple DRAWING of Graf Orlok 
           in profile, when Dr. Nightingale approaches him - bags at 
           her side.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        The train will be leaving any 
                        moment.

                                 SWANSON
                        Off to save the world?

           Nightingale gives him a bittersweet smile.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        London’s streets are not the only 
                        refuge for monsters.  It must be 
                        confirmed Orlok’s sickness died 
                        with him.

                                 SWANSON
                        I understand.

           Nightingale looks on, taking in a last glimpse of mighty 
           London.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Do you ever think about where he

                        Every waking hour.

           Nightingale’s train WHISTLES steam.  Dr. Van Helsing 
           appears out of a car window, waiving he to join him.

                                 DR. NIGHTINGALE
                        Donald, before I go, there’s 
                        something I want to tell you.  
                        When I saw you lying there in the 
                        belfry, covered in blood, I -

           Swanson pulls Nightingale’s face to his, kissing her 
           deeply.  After a few passionate moments, he draws back.

                                 SWANSON
                        Be careful, Florence.

           Invigorated and grinning, Nightingale yanks up her bags 
           and slowly boards the train.

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Swanson watches the locomotive pull away from London.

           A BOBBIE approaches him with a wax sealed ENVELOPE.  A 
           postmark stamped across it reads:  “GENEVA, SW.”

           He curiously removes a letter from it.  

           Elegant RED INK twists across the parchment page.  

           Swanson’s eyes go wide as he begins reading...

           (MOZART’S “REQUIEM” slowly fades up, building with each 
           line read.)

           - It’s a frosty blue night in Geneva.  Delicate flakes of 
           snow drift aimlessly across the needle spires of the 
           city, the purple Swiss Alps anchored in the distance.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Dear Boss.  I’m writin’ from this, 
                        the 20th of centuries...

           - Jack, along with his psychotic assistant, R.N. 
           Renfield, moves inside a suit shop tended by a 
           bespectacled tailor.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        ...hoping those scars of yours 
                        have started their healin’.

           - The couturier carefully measures Jack’s hulking 
           proportions in front of a series of silver mirrors, 
           Renfield eagerly watching.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        The ones people can see, anyway.

           - Inside the same shop, Jack walks across a collection of 
           fine leather gloves.  He takes his time pulling several 
           creaking pairs across his thick fingers.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Know that I have no plans to add 
                        to ‘em.  Long as you leave me be.

           - Jack tries on a series of black hats, first a bowler, 
           then a smoking cap.  Renfield approaches him with a tall, 
           silk top hat.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Remember, our history together’ll 
                        always be one written in blood.

           - Jack moves back into the tailor’s sparkling mirrors, 
           fully dressed in his classic black and white suit, trench 
           coat and top hat.  He smiles, proudly beaming.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        And never forget, we’re all just 
                        shadows in a fog.

           - Jack and Renfield patiently stand in front of a red-
           brick building illuminated by gas light.  Jack’s hulking 
           body obscures a plaque covering the building’s snow 
           dusted outsides.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Yours truly, Jack the Ripper.

           - Renfield watches a beautiful woman slowly move into a 
           darkened alley alone.  He nods to Jack, whose mouth 
           gradually twists into a smirk of silver.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        P.S.  Good news.  Managed to find 
                        a proper job with a decent bloke.  
                        An undertaker.  Finally found a 
                        use for my talents, if you get my 
                        meanin’...

           - Cape fluttering, Jack glides across the snow toward the 
           dark alley, dramatically revealing the iron plaque behind 
           him:  “LEICHENHALLE DESSEN (MORTUARY OF) - DR. VICTOR 
           FRANKENSTEIN, M.D.”

           BACK TO SCENE

           AT THE TRAIN STATION

           Swanson smudges his finger across Jack’s letter, its 
           bloody red ink smearing over the page.

           The Chief Inspector considers boarding a train for 
           GENEVA.  He stares across the tracks to a busy TICKET 
           COUNTER, jaw clenched.  Mind racing. 

           MOZART’S “REQUIEM” crescendoes with thunderously EPIC 
           NOTES, just as he sets out for the ticket counter...

                                                              TO BLACK.

           THE END
