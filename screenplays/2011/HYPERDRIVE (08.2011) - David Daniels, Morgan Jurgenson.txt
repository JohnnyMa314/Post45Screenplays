           INT. HARDY JONES’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           HARDY JONES (30) jolts awake, sweating, fights back the 
           anxiety from whatever nightmare he was suffering through.   
           An oversized bedside digital clock reads 4:15 AM.  

           INT. HARDY JONES’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Still in a black T-shirt and boxers, Hardy splashes cold 
           water on his face, runs wet fingers through his hair.  

           INT. HARDY JONES’S HOME OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Scratching his tummy, Hardy reaches a desk and turns on a 
           light, illuminating the inner sanctum of a nerd with money.   

           Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, complete with a rolling track-
           ladder.  A sampling of the sci-fi spines:  Robert Heinlein, 
           William Gibson, Roger Zelazny, Isaac Asimov.

           So many worlds, so many places to get lost.

           TELESCOPE by the window.  Collectibles from Comic-Con.  And a 
           special bookshelf --  

           This one has every published edition of Jones’s own novels:  
           The OMICRON Series.  Hardbacks, paperbacks, translations in 
           Polish, German, Japanese, etc.  Sleek, clean cover art.  
           Space opera for smart people.

           Above Hardy’s desk is a huge cork-board covered with maps, 
           star charts, notes and sketches: the building blocks of his 
           homemade universe and the skeleton of his latest book.

           Hardy stretches, tries to touch his toes.  Fails.  Screw it, 
           time to work.  He drops in front of his computer, cracks 
           knuckles and elbows (ugh) and begins typing furiously.

           Then, a sudden loud KNOCK at the front door interrupts his 
           flow.  He looks over at another clock: it’s still 4:15 AM...?

           INT. HARDY JONES’S FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Jones tiptoes towards his door, cautious to avoid making any 
           sound whatsoever.

           Another LOUD KNOCK scares the bejesus out of him.

                                 PLEASANT VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hardy Jones?  Sorry to bother you, 
                        but this will just take a moment of 
                        your time.
           Jones stops dead.  The voice has an odd metallic quality, 
           like it might be computerized.  Now he hears heavy BREATHING, 
           mechanized WHIRRING.  Who the hell is this?

                                 PLEASANT VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Jones, please open the door.  I 
                        know you’re inside.

           Jones makes a decision.  He is not moving, he is not opening 
           that door.  No way, no how--

           An incredibly loud DOCTOR WHO THEME RINGTONE goes off!  It’s 
           from his cell phone on a table by the door. 

                                 PLEASANT VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Left the ringer on, Mr. Jones?  
                        Just open the door, and we can get 
                        this business taken care of.

           Jones is frozen between answering the phone and answering the 
           door.  Indecision and panic take hold.  He’s sweating as he 
           starts to lean toward the PEEPHOLE...

           But the door is KICKED DOWN, revealing SEVEN FEET OF 
           MENACING, ARMORED ALIEN MECH SOLDIER!  Extra ridges on its 
           chest and arms.  Pale red irises.  Oversized canines glisten 
           with saliva.  Humanoid, but definitely not from around here.  

           Clutched in its hand is a VERY BIG RIFLE that looks like a 
           mini-particle accelerator.

           Jones gapes in awe.  His phone drops to the ground.  Finally, 
           the Alien SPEAKS in his brutal, native tongue.  It’s LOUD, 
           RUDE and totally impossible to understand.

           After a pause, the Alien touches a button on his armor, and 
           the pleasant computerized voice translates:

                                 PLEASANT VOICE (CONT’D)
                             (subtitled)
                        Are you currently with DirecTV or 
                        Time-Warner cable?

           Jones is frozen in fear and confusion.  Unable to answer, he 
           shrinks back against his wall of books.

           The Alien ROARS, switches on the RIFLE.  A fuel cell HUMS TO 
           LIFE, glows bright blue.  The Alien gives a BATTLE CRY and 
           OPENS FIRE.  As shredded books fill the air we SMASH TO:

           INT. HARDY JONES’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Hardy Jones once again jolts awake, sweating.  He raises a 
           fistful of Nintendo NES bedsheets, mops his face, safe. 
           INT. HARDY JONES’S HOME OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Hardy’s fingers are a flurry on the keyboard as inspiration 
           flows out of him and into his latest novel.  

           We drift across the room and through a window, where San 
           Francisco is laced with pre-dawn silver and gold--

           EXT. JONES’S BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

           The city is waking up before it even went to bed.  Headlights 
           speed over the Bay Bridge as we glide across the bay --

           EXT. STREETS BY A BAYSIDE PARK - EARLY MORNING

           A FIGURE in a sleek MOTORCYCLE HELMET and BACKPACK runs.  
           Fast.  Like first prize is gold and second prize is a bullet.  

           A BLACK HUMMER crests the hill behind the figure.

           Legs pumping, the figure speeds up an insanely steep incline.  
           Before physics can slow the runner’s pace, the Backpack GLOWS 
           BLUE, propels the figure uphill AT SUPERHUMAN SPEED. 

           The Hummer can barely keep up.

           EXT. BERKELEY - STREET CORNER - EARLY MORNING

           A TAXI CAB gives birth to a group of still-wasted UC BERKELEY 
           STUDENTS.  The CAB DRIVER, an affable Chinese-American goof, 
           makes quick change, a seasoned pro.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        OK, fare is $35.  Out of $100, so 5-
                        10-15 and 10 more makes us even.  

           The kid hesitates, but he’s pretty high, turns, staggers off.  
           The Cabbie stuffs the swindled cash into his breast pocket.  

                                 CAB DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        The hidden costs of higher 
                        education.

           Before the Cabbie pulls away, a new PASSENGER dives in back.  

           It’s the figure from the chase, and on closer inspection it’s 
           not a motorcycle helmet, it’s a FLIGHT CRASH HELMET.  The 
           figure rips it free, reveals a WOMAN.  

           She’s fearless, impassioned, and hotter than your girlfriend - 
           and right now she’s breathing like she’s just run a marathon 
           through a minefield.  This is SERA (late 20s).
           The Cabbie spots her in the rear-view, his smile evaporates. 

                                 CAB DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        You’re not supposed to be here.  
                        Not for another eleven years.

                                 SERA
                        We’re breached.  It moves today.  
                        Now.

           Tires SCREECH as the Black Hummer slides into view.  

                                 SERA (CONT’D)
                        Now, Tommy!

           The driver slams the car in gear and floors it.

           EXT. BAY BRIDGE - SUNRISE

           Early morning traffic rolls towards the Bay Bridge.  The taxi 
           blows past at top speed, yet the Hummer pursues. 

           INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           Traffic grows thicker, and the Cab Driver has to make a few 
           unsafe lane changes.  Horns HONK. 

           EXT. HUMMER - CONTINUOUS

           Through an open window, someone is visible in the BACKSEAT.  

           Square jaw, eyes of a true believer.  This is HUNTER (late 
           30s), the kind of military man you’d trust to get things done 
           no matter what it took.  Whoever these guys are, this is 
           definitely their leader.

           EXT. BAY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Hummer has no trouble keeping up.  It drives in a fast 
           straight line, and the cars in its path INVOLUNTARILY SWERVE 
           OUT OF ITS WAY, like a magnet repelling everything around it.

           A Mini flies into a Prius, a Sequoia slams an Acura.  Chaos.

           INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           The Cabbie weaves, but the traffic grows unavoidable.  

           One bad decision, and suddenly the Cab is TRAPPED, boxed in 
           behind an 18-wheeler, with an F-150 to the left and the San 
           Francisco Bay to the right.
           Sera turns, ready for anything, but... the Hummer HAS 
           DISAPPEARED.  No sign of it, just a lot of scared motorists.

           Sera catches her breath.  For a moment, calm.

           Then - ON THE RIGHT - up from nowhere, the HUMMER RISES, 
           floating in MID-AIR NEXT TO THE BRIDGE!

           EXT. HUMMER - CONTINUOUS

           A door flies open, KORT  - muscular, grey-eyed, vicious - 
           hangs out, extends an ASSAULT RIFLE, and lets it talk - 
           BBRRRAAPPAAAPAAPP!!!

           INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           Sera panics as BULLETS rip through the interior. 

                                 SERA
                        Go!!!

           The Cabbie slams on the gas.  But he takes one IN THE 
           FOREHEAD and the taxi swerves out of control.

           Sera dives into the front seat.  Pushes the dead Cab Driver 
           aside.  Grasps for the steering wheel, fights to survive.

           Another SHOT misses Sera by millimeters, SHATTERS the window.

           Impossibly, Sera gets seated and jams the car into REVERSE. 
           Traffic still hems her in, so she accelerates the only 
           direction she can... right towards the edge.

           As the taxi plunges into the open air we CUT TO BLACK.

                                 MOORE (V.O.)
                        I just don’t think you’re being 
                        realistic.

           EXT. TWO-FAMILY HOME - DOLORES HEIGHTS, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           DETECTIVE ROBERT MOORE (mid-30s), cop-handsome, purposeful, 
           ever unflappable, hefts a grocery bag out of the trunk of his 
           unmarked Chevy as he talks into a cell phone.  

                                 MOORE
                        Annie, I’m sorry but your math is 
                        all wrong.  Two dates, a sleep-over 
                        and a brunch don’t equal me meeting 
                        your mother.
                             (inaudible plea)
                        I’m sure she’s a wonderful woman, 
                        but this isn’t Fantasy Island.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOORE (CONT'D)
                             (inaudible anger)
                        Well nice sleeping with you too.

           Moore hangs up, takes a deep breath, checks his reflection in 
           the car’s side-view mirror, then heads through the open gate.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MATHESON HOUSE - DAY

           A small barbecue is in progress as Moore appears.

           DETECTIVE MATHESON (34), Moore’s partner for the past decade, 
           is a good cop and better family man with a “License to 
           Grill,” or so his apron declares.  

           He’s also attempting a transition to a healthy diet:  he’s 
           enthusiastically flipping veggies and something chicken-ish.

                                 MATHESON
                        There he is.   

                                 MOORE
                             (scans the grill)
                        Should I get the M.E. down here to 
                        identify that?  

                                 MATHESON
                        Meatless chicken.  Tempeh.  Smile, 
                        it’s good for you.

           Moore conspiratorially produces a package of hamburger meat.    

                                 MOORE 
                        I got your back, partner.  

                                 MATHESON
                        C’mon.  My cholesterol’s at 295.  
                        If I eat that, I’m not gonna see 
                        Archie get through grade school.  
                        Support the lifestyle choice, man.               

                                 MOORE
                        I brought bacon.  Smoked Gouda.

           Across the yard, Matheson’s lovely wife CHERYL (30) spots 
           Moore, steps away from her two girlfriends.  She’s not happy.

                                 MATHESON 
                        Well, I hope you brought your vest. 

           Before Moore can brace for impact, Cheryl is in his face.

                                 CHERYL
                        Really?
                                 MOORE
                        Hi, Cheryl.

                                 CHERYL
                        Really?

           Moore is unsure how to respond.

                                 CHERYL (CONT’D)
                        I got a text from Annie.

                                 MOORE
                             (oh shit)
                        So fast.  So frighteningly fast.

                                 CHERYL
                        You’re a pig.  Just bring your 
                        death-burgers to the kitchen, don’t 
                        hit on my friends, and don’t make 
                        my son cry.

           Moore grits his teeth, does as told.  Matheson remains zen.

                                 MATHESON
                        Just a relaxing family barbecue.

           INT. KITCHEN - MATHESON HOUSE - DAY

           Moore puts the beers on ice, turns and comes face to face 
           with ARCHIE (4), cute, shy, pudgy.  It’s not gonna take much.

                                 MOORE
                        Hi, Archie.

                                 ARCHIE
                        Hi, Uncle Robbie.  I’m playing 
                        Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and I wanna 
                        bring the special Mouse-ka-tool to 
                        Goofy, OK?  Will you help me?

           Moore is clearly uncomfortable.

                                 MOORE
                        So how’s school?

                                 ARCHIE
                        I’m Mickey and you’re Pluto and we 
                        have to bring the Mouse-ka-Tool to 
                        Goofy, OK?

                                 MOORE
                             (not up for pretending)
                        I don’t think so, Arch.
                                 ARCHIE
                        We have to bring the Mouse-ka-Tool 
                        to Goofy!

                                 MOORE
                        I’m going out to talk to your Dad.

           And that’s all it took.  Little Archie lets loose with a sob.

                                 ARCHIE
                        MOOOOOOMMMMYYYYY!!!!

                                 MOORE
                        No.  No.  Shhh!

           Cheryl runs in, furious.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t do anything!

                                 CHERYL
                        I can’t believe --

           Moore’s cell phone RINGS (”Peter Gunn Theme” ringtone).  

                                 MOORE
                             (answers)
                        Moore... I’m just talking to 
                        someone... No, it’s not important.
                             (an apologetic “just being 
                              honest” shrug to Cheryl)
                        We’ll be there in fifteen.

           INT. HARBOR COURT HOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           Broken glass everywhere.  Crime Scene Techs bag samples and 
           dust for fingerprints.

           Moore inspects the Cab Driver’s dead body with a pen, 
           indifferent.  Detective Matheson refers to his notepad.

                                 MATHESON 
                        Vic’s name was Tommy Chang.  Cab 
                        was his.  Last paying fare was a 
                        couple of Berkeley kids around 4AM.  
                             (can’t let it go)
                        I can’t believe you said no to 
                        Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.  Did you 
                        know kids under five who engage in 
                        imaginative play every day are 
                        three times more likely to go to 
                        Ivy League schools?
                                 MOORE 
                        No, Matty, I did not know that.  
                        Now how about we put on our big boy 
                        pants and solve a brutal homicide?  

                                 MATHESON
                        Fine.  But pretending with my son 
                        has made me a better detective.  

                                 MOORE
                             (concentrates hard)
                        OK.  I’m pretending... we’re doing 
                        policework.  Anyone find the gun?

                                 MATHESON 
                        Is that really your first question?

           Moore finally stands, reveals the smallish room with a bed, 
           desk, TV, and an upside-down, battered TAXI CAB.

                                 MOORE
                        Anyone see anything?

                                 MATHESON
                        A housekeeper and some guests heard 
                        a loud crash around 8:15, but no 
                        one actually entered the room until 
                        about an hour ago.  

           Moore moves some debris and reveals SERA, unconscious in the 
           back seat.  They lock eyes.  Her look is urgent.    

                                 MOORE 
                        Live one!

           Paramedics swoop in, gingerly free her from the wreck.  She 
           SPEAKS frantic gibberish at Moore.

           TIGHT ON SERA’S EYES:  Her irises flicker from green to red 
           like a dying neon bulb.

           The paramedics speed her away.  Moore steps to the door.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        That didn’t sound like English.  
                        Call the liaison, have him figure 
                        out whatever language she’s 
                        speaking so we can get a trans-
                        lator.  Dig up what you can on our 
                        vic, then meet me at the hospital.     

                                 MATHESON
                             (shaking his head)
                        This is so unbelievable.
                                 MOORE
                        Only because we don’t have all the 
                        facts yet, Matty.

                                 MATHESON
                        This story’s gotta be bigger.

                                 MOORE
                        The story will never be bigger than 
                        the facts.  Maybe dumber, but not 
                        bigger.

                                 MATHESON 
                        You don’t find anything strange 
                        about this crime scene?  Anything 
                        at all?

           Moore makes one last survey of the room.  

                                 MOORE
                        No coffee.  I’m gonna go find some.           

           As he exits, his partner calls out to him.

                                 MATHESON
                        There are more things in heaven and 
                        earth than are dreamt of in your 
                        philosophy, Robbie!

           We pull back, OUT THE WINDOW to reveal-- 

           EXT. HARBOR COURT HOTEL - DAY

           THE TAXI’S REAR END IS STICKING OUT OF A WINDOW ON THE 37TH 
           FLOOR.  A truly impossible sight.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Sera is in bed, wired into monitors and IVs.  

           A nurse attempts to draw blood, but the needle can’t 
           penetrate her skin.  Then the tip actually breaks off.  
           Confused, the nurse leaves to get another --

           Passes Moore in the hall with a baby-faced LIAISON OFFICER.

                                 MOORE
                        Was there a crisis over in 
                        Chinatown, they needed all the 
                        adult translators?

                                 LIAISON OFFICER
                        I have a Ph.D. in literary 
                        translation from Stanford.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIAISON OFFICER (CONT'D)
                             (Moore: “Who cares”)
                        I speak eight languages fluently.  
                             (Moore still unimpressed)
                        That includes Farsi and Japanese. 
                        And I’m 29!

                                 MOORE
                             (opening Sera’s door)
                        Be my guest, Ambassador.

           Sera is weak, but alert enough to panic at the sight of the 
           cops.  She spews a TORRENT of unintelligible words.   

                                 LIAISON OFFICER 
                        Whoa.  

                                 MOORE
                        “Whoa”? 

                                 LIAISON OFFICER
                        I’m gonna need back up.  

                                 MOORE
                        Call it in.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY - MONTAGE

           A parade of A DOZEN TRANSLATORS, all different ethnicities 
           and ages.  No one understands Sera.  She POINTS at her WRIST 
           as her speech becomes more and more impassioned, then angry.

           She glares at Moore, who grows increasingly frustrated.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           The LAST TRANSLATOR shrugs, turns to Moore.

                                 LAST TRANSLATOR
                        Maybe it’s the head injury.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - DAY 

           Moore exits Sera’s room, rubs his temples.  A burly mass of 
           an ORDERLY, sleeve tattoos, oddly bushy sideburns, attends to 
           a service cart, folding small towels.  He sizes up Moore.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Azilari.

           Moore looks around, is this weirdo talking to him?  
                                 ORDERLY (CONT’D)
                        The girl.  She’s, uh, speaking 
                        Azilari.  Least I think so, never 
                        heard it out loud before.  

                                 MOORE
                        You understand what she’s saying?

                                 ORDERLY
                        Bits and pieces.  She doesn’t like 
                        you.  Like, at all.

                                 MOORE
                        What’s Azzy Larry?  Where’s it 
                        from?

                                 ORDERLY
                             (patiently)
                        Azzz-eee-laaaari.  It’s from 
                        Omicron Eridani.   

           Beat.  Moore stares.

                                 MOORE
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

           The Orderly motions for Moore to follow him.   

           INT. HOSPITAL - BREAK ROOM - DAY 

           The Orderly produces a book from his locker, hands it to 
           Moore.  It’s a sci-fi paperback, titled “Destination”.

           At 900 plus pages, it’s not a book, it’s a doorstop.  

                                 ORDERLY
                        Book Six in the Omicron series.  I 
                        cannot believe you’ve never heard 
                        of Hardy Jones.  He’s like George 
                        R.R. Martin before HBO. In two 
                        years, everyone’s gonna know him.  
                        He is the shit.

           Moore looks at the cover, reads the name HARDY JONES under 
           the title.  He flips to the ‘About the Author’ page--  

           A PICTURE of Hardy Jones - the writer from our opening - 
           seated in a Star Trek Captain’s Chair with the mother of all 
           dorky grins.  Definitely not “the shit.”
           Moore reads:  “Hardy Jones is a former comic shop clerk now 
           known throughout the galaxy as the author of the Hugo and 
           Nebula Award-winning Omicron Eridani series.  He lives in San 
           Francisco with no pets.”

                                 ORDERLY (CONT’D)
                        This one’s the last book of the 
                        second trilogy.  I’ve been re-
                        reading from the beginning, 
                        prepping for Book Seven coming out 
                        this summer.

                                 MOORE
                        Good thinking.  
                             (scans the pages)
                        The language you heard, it’s in 
                        here? 

                                 ORDERLY
                        Yeah.  Jones writes all the chapter 
                        intros in Azilari, but...
                             (with respect)
                        ...to actually learn how to speak 
                        it, that is some next-level Star 
                        Trek convention shit.

                                 MOORE
                        Mind if I borrow this?

                                 ORDERLY
                             (earnestly)
                        You should really start with the 
                        first one.  You’re gonna be lost.

                                 MOORE
                        Thanks, I’m good.  Nice chops, by 
                        the way.  

                                 ORDERLY
                        The ladies love ‘em.

           Moore heads out.

           INT. JONES’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Three dedicated flatscreen monitors are wired to an endless 
           online game of Starcraft 2.  Jones sits in a custom-built 
           GAME CHAIR, shouting into a head mic.

                                 JONES
                        Yeah, okay Brad.  Okay.  Let’s see 
                        if you like the taste of m’balls.  
                        Bling.  Suck it.  Yeah?  Really?    
           A KNOCK at his door.  Jones ignores it.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        You and your Naruto headband need 
                        to be put to bed.  Which reminds 
                        me, did your mom make it home from 
                        my place yet?

           The KNOCK grows urgent.  Jones finally answers and lights up.  
           It’s THE MAILMAN (50s), a paternal Richard Jenkins type.  
           He’s Jones’s buddy and link to the outside world.

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Mr. Jones. 

                                 JONES
                        So did it come?  

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Mail first.

           Jones impatiently flips through the stack of envelopes: fan 
           mail, junk mail, residual checks.

                                 JONES
                        So?

           The Mailman finally stands aside, reveals a large package.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Aw, hell yeah.  C’mon in!

           As Jones attacks the package, the Mailman heads to the 
           kitchen and checks the fridge.  Nothing but Monster Energy 
           cans, Japanese vitamin drinks, and a bucket of cold KFC.  

           He opens a cupboard: at least five bags of each variety of 
           Pepperidge Farm cookies, shelved alphabetically.  

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        You ever hear of a vegetable?

           Jones ignores him.  He’s ripping through bubble wrap.

                                 THE MAILMAN (CONT’D)
                             (suffers a sip of Monster)
                        Seriously, I worry about your diet.   

           The Mailman notes the game on Jones’s monitor screens.  

                                 THE MAILMAN (CONT’D)

                                 THE MAILMAN (CONT’D)
                        Have you set the dates for your 
                        book tour yet?     

                                 JONES
                        Yeah... no.  Europe.  That’s... 
                             (incredibly scary)
                        a huge time commitment.  And I have 
                        a ton of work to do on Book Seven 
                        before it goes to press.

                                 MAILMAN
                        So it has absolutely nothing to do 
                        with anxiety over leaving your 
                        comfort zone?

           Jones winces.  That’s exactly what this has to do with.  

                                 JONES
                        I like my comfort zone.  I have 
                        everything I need here.  Why would 
                        anyone opt in on discomfort?

           For a beat Jones is vulnerable, but the shield goes back up.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Besides, I can’t disappoint the 
                        fans.  Work to do.
                             (tears the bubble wrap)
                        Sweeeeet.

           Jones holds up his new treasures:  a BAMBOO KENDO SWORD and a 
           HUGE KENDO HELMET.

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Wowsers.

                                 JONES
                        Right?  Impossible to get these in 
                        the States.  I gotta post this!  
                        Take a shot!

           Jones gives the Mailman his iPad then dons the ridiculous 
           helmet.  He POSES with the bamboo sword poised to strike.

                                 THE MAILMAN
                             (getting into it)
                        OK, now give me some attitude!

           With a ridiculous samurai YELL, Jones charges at the Mailman.

           And that’s when DETECTIVE MOORE appears at the open front 
           door.  He surveys Jones, swinging the sword like a jackass.    

                                 MOORE
                        Hardy Jones?
           The Mailman straightens up.

                                 JONES
                             (muffled by the helmet)
                        That’s me.

           Jones removes the helmet and grabs his iPad from the Mailman.  
           He can’t resist completing the status update.  In seconds, 
           he’s lost messaging his “Geek” Chorus.  

           Moore parts his coat, shows the seven-pointed star clipped to 
           his belt.  And in case the sidearm doesn’t sell it--     

                                 MOORE
                        San Francisco P.D.  

           The Mailman heads for the door.  

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        You take it easy, Jones.

           Jones guffaws, shows Moore the freshly posted photo as if he 
           cares, and types one last text.   

                                 JONES
                        Sorry, you’re with the police?  You 
                        sure you got the right place?  
                        Everything’s cool here.  

           Moore eyes the nerd’s abode: no sign of “cool” anywhere.  He 
           pulls out the copy of Destination.

                                 MOORE
                        Are you the author of this book?

           Jones understands, takes the book, grabs a pen and signs it.

                                 JONES
                        Next time, just call the publisher.  
                        They’ll send a box of these over to 
                        your Media Relations Department.  
                        Save the City some gas money.  

                                 MOORE
                        Yeah, thanks.  I’m actually with 
                        Homicide.

                                 JONES
                        Like murder?

                                 MOORE
                        Yeah.  Like murder.  I’m 
                        investigating one that happened 
                        this morning and I need to ask you 
                        some questions.
                                 JONES
                        I didn’t do it.

                                 MOORE
                        That’s what guilty people say.

                                 JONES
                        Really?

                                 MOORE
                        Relax Bruce Lee, you’re not a 
                        suspect.  That said --

                                 JONES
                        Mifune.  

                                 MOORE
                        What?

                                 JONES
                        Bruce Lee never played a samurai, 
                        Toshiro Mifune would be a much 
                        better comparison.

           Moore grits his teeth.

                                 MOORE
                        I’m hoping you can help me with 
                        something.

                                 JONES 
                        Have a seat.  Color me intrigued.

           Moore sits in a highly-stylish, poorly-functional chair.  
           Tries his best to stay balanced.   

                                 MOORE
                        Your books use a language called 
                        Ass-U-Larry.  

                                 JONES
                        Azilari.  Yes.  

                                 MOORE
                        Where did you learn that language?

                                 JONES
                             (is this a joke)
                        Learned?  I made it up.

                                 MOORE
                        You made it up.

                                 JONES
                        Yeah.  I made it up.  I’m a writer.
                                 MOORE
                        Writers do that, make stuff up.

                                 JONES
                        Yeah.  We make stuff up.  

                                 MOORE
                        So this language isn’t real.

                                 JONES
                        Well you don’t have to be a dick 
                        about it, I thought I did a fairly 
                        decent job.

                                 MOORE
                        Easy.  I’m just working through 
                        something.

                                 JONES
                        Maybe if you just tell me what’s 
                        going on I can help you out.

                                 MOORE
                        Good.  Because I’m trying to figure 
                        out how I have a murder witness who 
                        only speaks your made-up language.  

                                 JONES
                        No way.  Like a few words?   

                                 MOORE
                        Like every word.  

           Jones tilts his head like a confused puppy. 

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Look, what I really need is for you 
                        to come down to San Francisco 
                        General and talk to her.  See if 
                        you can translate what she says.

                                 JONES
                        Yeah.  Yeah, of course.

                                 MOORE
                        Good.  Thank you.

           He gladly gets up from the uncomfortable chair, heads for the 
           door, is surprised to find Jones not following.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        You coming?
                                 JONES
                        Oh, I don’t leave the house on 
                        Thursdays.
                             (off Moore’s look)
                        Starcraft Day.

           Like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

                                 MOORE
                             (incredulous)
                        Of course.  

           Jones buries his agitation.  Threats to the schedule are not 
           good.  To calm himself, he resumes texting, multi-tasking.

                                 JONES
                        You said she’s at SFG?  I can just 
                        drop by in the morning.
                             (obviously lying)
                        I have some errands to run out that 
                        way so it’s no problem.  

                                 MOORE
                             (losing patience)
                        OK, Mr. Jones?  It is a problem.  
                        If you don’t solve a case in the 
                        first thirty-six hours, it’s 
                        probably not getting solved.

                                 JONES
                             (does the math)
                        Perfect, there’s plenty of time.   

           Jones returns to texting.  Moore walks up, rips the iPad 
           away.  

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 MOORE
                        You want your toy back?  It’ll be 
                        in my car.

                                 JONES
                        You can’t take that!  That’s 
                        robbery.

                                 MOORE
                        Not my department.  

                                  JONES 
                        It’s not a toy!  

           But Moore is already out the door.
           Jones starts to follow, but stops.  Debates.  He can always 
           get a new iPad.  Looks over at his Starcraft game.  The nest 
           so inviting.  

           But he steals a glance at the shelf of books he’s authored... 
           and something tells him to go, like it or not.

           EXT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Moore walks toward the elevator.  The door OPENS, and 
           surprise, there’s DETECTIVE MATHESON coming out.

                                 MOORE
                        I already got him, Matty.  

           Jones storms out of his door, heads straight for Moore.

                                 JONES
                        That is not a cheap piece of 
                        hardware, my friend!

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m not here for him.  

           He gestures to the door right across from Jones’s.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        This is our victim’s place. 

           Moore looks at Jones, looks at the neighbor’s door.  

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Weird yet?

                                 JONES
                        Tommy’s dead?

                                 MOORE
                        You knew him?

                                 JONES
                             (feels terrible)
                        I just saw him last week at the 
                        landlord’s potluck.  He made pork 
                        dumplings.  

                                 MOORE
                        C’mon.

           Trying to ignore the weirdness of the situation, Moore grabs 
           Jones and guides him down the hall.  Jones resists.
                                 JONES
                        I don’t know, man.  I’ve been out 
                        of my apartment thirty seconds, and 
                        my neighbor’s already dead.  Maybe 
                        this isn’t such a good idea.

                                 MOORE
                        We’re just going to the hospital.  
                        It’s not exactly the Danger Zone.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DUSK

           The sun has vanished behind the HOSPITAL by the time Moore 
           whips his car into the lot.  Jones rides shotgun.

           As Moore’s car disappears, another vehicle pulls into view 
           and parks: the black Hummer from the bridge.

           INT. HUMMER - DUSK

           In the passenger seat is KORT, the man with the assault 
           rifle, a hulking mass of intimidation.

           The driver is CLAG, bad teeth, worse hair, and a pinched face 
           that’s currently a sickly green.  He doesn’t look well.

           In the backseat sits SATISHA, a cruelly beautiful woman in 
           skin-tight leather.  Her eyes glow a subtle red.

           And beside her is their leader, HUNTER.  Not happy.

           Satisha scans the hospital with a WHITE HANDHELD DEVICE.

                                 SATISHA
                        She’s in there.

                                 HUNTER
                        Let’s try to do this quietly.  I’d 
                        like to avoid another Rigel-9 
                        incident.

           Without a word, Clag suddenly opens his door and vomits.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        And someone get him a wet-nap.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - NIGHT

           Jones peeks into Sera’s room through a small window.

                                 JONES
                        Holy shit!
                                 MOORE
                        What?  You recognize her?

                                 JONES
                        No.  She’s hot.  None of my fans 
                        are hot.

                                 MOORE
                        So today’s your lucky day.

                                 JONES
                        What are the odds that my one hot 
                        fan would be involved in a murder 
                        investigation?

                                 MOORE
                        What are the odds that you’ll get 
                        in there sometime today?

           Jones looks sheepish.

                                 JONES
                        This may shock you, but I’m 
                        actually not very good with women.

                                 MOORE
                        You’re not good with men either.  
                        She’s a murder witness, go ask her 
                        what she saw.  That’s how we’re 
                        gonna catch the bad guy who shot 
                        your neighbor.

           Jones nods, reaches for the door, but stops.  He retreats, 
           paces, tries to calm himself.  Deep breath.  

                                 JONES
                             (to himself)
                        Just talking to the beautiful 
                        woman.  The beautiful murder 
                        witness.  No problem.

           Moore rolls his eyes.  Jones checks himself out in the glass 
           of a wall-mounted fire-extinguisher cabinet, steels his 
           resolve, and opens the door.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sera is up, standing by the window, surveying the lights of 
           the city.  She doesn’t look well, the early stages of the flu 
           maybe, hair matted with sweat.

           Jones enters, but freezes when he sees flashes of Sera’s bare 
           body through the openings in her hospital gown.  She turns to 
           Jones, unself-conscious but surprised to see him.
           Moore steps into the room and Sera’s features quickly harden.  
           He hands Jones a photo of Tommy.  Jones hesitates.

                                 MOORE
                             (impatient)
                        Start with how she knows him.

           Jones begins a SUBTITLED DIALOGUE, still amazed someone 
           actually speaks this language.

                                 JONES
                             (halting, not fluent)
                        Hello attractive-yet-respected 
                        woman.  My name is Hardy Jones.  

                                 SERA
                        Hello Jones.  I’m Sera Nikadane 
                        from Guardian Station 16.  You live 
                        in a beautiful city.

                                 JONES
                             (accidentally in English)
                        Thanks.  
                             (holds up a photo, back to 
                              Azilari)
                        The unkind policeman needs 
                        information.  This man.  Tommy.  
                        How do you know him?

                                 SERA
                        We trained together.
                             (re: Moore)
                        Can he be trusted?

                                 MOORE
                        What’s she saying?

                                 JONES
                        She wants to know if you can be 
                        trusted.

                                 MOORE
                             (to Sera, slow)
                        You can trust me.  I’m a good guy.  

           Sera locks eyes with Moore, makes a decision, starts 
           speaking, and she has a lot to say.  

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           Jones holds up a finger, one moment, while he listens.  Sera 
           continues, growing more passionate, desperate even.
                                 JONES
                        She’s a Guardian of Omicron 
                        Eridani.  She’s... responsible for 
                        a Weapon... a very powerful Weapon. 
                        The Syndicate... is here to steal 
                        it.  Ooh, I know this - to use in 
                        the coming inter-dimensional war 
                        with the Confederation!  Right?

           Sera nods, allowing herself a smile.  Jones understood her.

                                 MOORE
                        You wanna boil that down for me?  

                                 JONES
                        The Syndicate and the Confederation 
                        have been enemies for centuries --

                                 MOORE
                             (interrupts)
                        Less is more.

           Jones pulls Moore to the corner, away from Sera.

                                 JONES 
                        She says that her and Tommy are 
                        from Omicron.  That’s the star 
                        system where my books take place.

                                 MOORE
                        So... she’s crazy.

                                 JONES
                        Also my first guess.  But she’s 
                        kind of freaking me out because 
                        she’s basically telling me the 
                        whole plot of Book Eight.

                                 MOORE
                        OK, so she read Book Eight.

                                 JONES
                        I haven’t written it yet.

           Moore looks at Sera who’s fuming, and back at Jones who’s 
           mystified, teetering on the edge of the rabbit hole.

                                 MOORE
                        So she’s psychic?  

                                 JONES
                        I don’t think so.
                                 MOORE
                        Don’t be an idiot.  You have notes 
                        about your next book, right?  Maybe 
                        someone crazy enough to memorize 
                        your ridiculous-sounding fake 
                        language is also crazy enough to 
                        break into your apartment and read 
                        your notes.  Maybe Tommy told her 
                        about them.  Isn't that a tad more 
                        likely than her being from a remote 
                        corner of the goddamn Milky Way?

           Sera approaches, urgently grabs Jones and SPEAKS in Azilari. 

                                 JONES
                        She says she wants to talk to me 
                        alone.  Without you.

           Moore debates, but he’s been a cop long enough to know 
           wonderful things can happen outside the playbook.  

                                 MOORE
                        Make this clear to her.  I can 
                        detain a suspect for twenty-four 
                        hours without charge.  I also have 
                        a buddy in the mental evaluation 
                        unit at Atascadero on speed-dial.  
                        The truth might move things in a 
                        better direction.

           As Moore walks out, he tosses a PLASTIC BAG full of Sera’s 
           personal effects onto a chair, then furtively glances up at a 
           CAMERA in the corner of the room.

           INT. HOSPITAL SECURITY STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Moore enters, shows his badge. 

                                 MOORE
                        I need to see Room 6-0-7.

           The SECURITY GUARD obliges, and Sera appears on the screen.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sera glances up at the camera, then rifles through the bag of 
           her personal effects.  Finds a COPPER BRACELET, slides it 
           onto her wrist, and runs her fingers over it purposefully.

           INT. HOSPITAL SECURITY STATION - NIGHT

           The monitor Moore is watching distorts, turns to static.
                                 MOORE
                        Wha--?  Can you fix that?

           The Guard puts his only technical skill into motion, WHACKS 
           the side of the monitor.  Doesn’t help.  He shrugs at Moore.   

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sera speaks rapidly to Jones, puts a desperate hand to her 
           chest appealing to him for help.

                                 JONES
                        C’mon, you don’t really need that.  
                        Even if you did, how could I 
                        possibly get it for you?  

           A pleading look comes over Sera’s eyes.  

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                             (he points to his head)
                        I think you might need help.  Like 
                        a doctor?  I want to help you... 
                        Can you understand me?

           Sera looks at Jones, dead serious.  In seconds, she makes an 
           impromptu torch out of hospital supplies:  she dips a face-
           cloth in rubbing alcohol, generates a spark by scraping her 
           fingernail across an emery board, and lights it up.  

           Without missing a beat, she removes her hospital gown.  Jones 
           is speechless.

           She runs the flame back and forth along her collar bone.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do that! 

           But Sera’s skin doesn’t burn... something else happens.  

           The bones in her chest CHANGE SHAPE.  Subtle ridges form, her 
           veins pulsate with luminous blood. 

           She touches her copper bracelet one last time, finally 
           enabling her to speak in perfect English.

                                 SERA
                        I was born in the first Orbital 
                        Colony off Eridani B in the ninth 
                        decade of the Middle War. 

           As she speaks, her irises turn redder and redder.  
                                 SERA (CONT'D)
                        My father fought at the Syndicate 
                        Incursion on Omicron 2 and was part 
                        of the Guardian unit that finally 
                        hid the Weapon.  They chose here, 
                        in the most remote backwater star 
                        system they could find.  I’ve been 
                        training to come here since I was 
                        seven.  Until today, my feet have 
                        never touched the Earth, and I have 
                        never seen a sky with a single sun.  
                        I lost everything when my ship was 
                        shot down.  You know the truth.  
                        You know I need your help.

           Jones jaw is on the floor.  His space opera has somehow come 
           to Earth, and the proof is right before his eyes.

                                 SERA (CONT’D)
                        No offense about the whole 
                        “backwater” thing, it’s actually 
                        kind of nice.

           Jones freezes like a circuit just blew in his brain.  

                                 JONES
                        This isn’t possible.  
                             (hyperventilating)
                        I’m feeling really light-headed 
                        right now.

           He steadies himself on the bed... then lies down on it.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Is there water?

           Suddenly, the OVERHEAD LIGHTS die.  EMERGENCY LIGHTS kick on 
           with a low whine.  The Hospital power has shut down.  

           Sera’s expression melts to fear.  She rests a hand on Jones.

                                 SERA 
                        Stay here.  The people chasing me 
                        are very dangerous.  I’ll come back 
                        for you.

                                 JONES
                             (in the fetal position)
                        OK.   Bye.

           As Jones tries to process what the hell is going on, Sera 
           BOLTS OUT OF THE ROOM.
                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                             (semi-delirious)
                        The hot fan is from space.  She’s --   

           He snaps out of it, realizes Sera escaped on his watch.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Hey, come back!

           EXT. HOSPITAL - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Satisha turns from an OPEN ELECTRICAL TERMINAL.  Hunter and 
           his team survey the hospital perimeter.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Let’s go.  

           Unfortunately, Clag is still not adjusting very well to our 
           atmosphere.  He’s sweating, out of breath and growing more 
           and more queasy.  Earthsick.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        Blue hell, man, your metabolism 
                        should’ve stabilized by now.  Are 
                        you gonna vomit again?

                                 CLAG
                        No sir.

           Clag vomits.  Hunter recoils, adjusts his plan.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Stay with the vehicle.  You two, 
                        with me.

           He moves off with Kort and Satisha.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - SIXTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Sera speeds down the hall in her hospital gown, earning 
           stares from workers and patients.

           Moore appears at the end of the hall, spots her, reacts with 
           urgency.  But Sera turns on a dime, leaps over an Orderly’s 
           cart, and tears down another corridor.   

           Jones runs into view, frantic.

                                 JONES
                        She ran away!

                                 MOORE
                        Oh really?
           They take off after her.  She’s fast, but Moore’s been in his 
           share of foot chases.  He stays on Sera’s tail as she enters -

           INT. HOSPITAL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Moore bursts through the doors as Sera bounds over the rail--

                                 MOORE
                        No!

           He leans out, stunned to see Sera land flawlessly on the 
           opposite rail TWO FLIGHTS BELOW, swing over and disappear.

           For the first time, Moore looks genuinely confused.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        How...?

           Jones finally catches up, out of breath, maybe dying.

                                 JONES
                        I don’t think... she’s human.

           But Moore is already bounding down the stairs.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Sera sprints around a corner.  Slides to a stop.  

           HUNTER AND HIS CREW appear at the other end of the hall.  
           They spot her, produce ASSAULT RIFLES from under their coats.

           Nurses, doctors and patients scream and duck for cover as the 
           gunmen UNLOAD their clips.

           Sera runs back the way she came.  Bullets pepper the walls 
           all around her, but she makes it through a door.

                                 HUNTER
                        Split up!  Don’t let her leave!

           His partners peel off.  

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Moore and Jones emerge into the aftermath, survey the damage.

                                 JONES
                             (getting scared)
                        Oh my god, that was gunfire!

           Moore continues on, gun raised.
           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Sera hides in a Nurses’ Station.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Hunter and his crew search, room by room.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Moore cautiously peers around a corner.  A moment later, 
           Jones peers next to him.  They make their way down the hall.

                                 JONES
                             (aggressive whisper)
                        Exactly how much longer will you 
                        need my help?

                                 MOORE
                             (more aggressive whisper)
                        Actually, I’ve got this part!  

                                 JONES
                             (even more aggressive 
                              whisper)
                        You said I’d be safe.  The hospital 
                        is the Danger Zone!

           Moore holds up a “stay right here” hand and a “be quiet” 
           finger.  Jones hangs back as Moore disappears from view.  

           A beat as Jones realizes he’s alone and unarmed.  Not good.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Satisha steps into view as Sera ducks deeper into the dark of 
           her hiding place in the Nurses’ Station.

           As Satisha walks past, Sera ATTACKS.  She flips Satisha to 
           the ground, then immediately takes off running again.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALL - FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Sera rips around a corner, finds HUNTER waiting.  She turns.  
           CLICK!  Kort grins widely, blocks her escape. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Now, now.  Where is it?

           Sera looks back at Hunter with hatred in her eyes. 
                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re not still upset about 
                        Commander Vorhis, are you Sera?  I 
                        promise he didn’t feel a thing when 
                        I ripped the location of the Weapon 
                        out of his mind.  Actually, maybe 
                        he did when I inserted the probe 
                        into the base of his skull.

                                 SERA
                        He was the only father I ever had, 
                        you gutless murderer.

                                 HUNTER
                        I really couldn’t care less.  The 
                        Syndicate is finally taking control 
                        of its future.  We’re not leaving 
                        without the Weapon. 

                                 SERA
                        You’ll never find it in time.  The 
                        Confed has activated the protocols.    
                        My backup is already on its way.  

           Hunter is far from excited by the news.  

           DOWN THE HALL

           Moore spots Hunter and Kort pinning Sera down.

           BACK WITH SERA

           Hunter prods her further.  

                                 HUNTER
                        You’re making the worst kind of 
                        mistake.

                                 SERA
                        And you’re about to experience a 
                        hot quick death.  We’re ready to 
                        sacrifice everything, Hunter.

                                 MOORE (O.S.)
                        Drop it, dickhead.

           CLICK!  Moore holds Hunter in his sights, nods to Kort.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        You too, Barry Bonds.  

           Hunter and Kort hold their ground.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        No English?  Drop the fucking guns!
           Just then JONES STUMBLES IN through a side door, clutching an 
           IV POLE like a samurai sword --

           And stops dead when he realizes he’s just stepped into a 
           gigantic hornet’s nest... and blocked Moore’s angle to shoot.

                                 JONES
                        Frak.

           BULLETS FLY as Hunter and Kort unload their clips.  Moore 
           dives, tackles Jones to safety.  Sera flees.

           SATISHA appears and AIMS A SMALL DART GUN AT MOORE -- BUT 
           JONES STUMBLES INTO THE LINE OF FIRE at the last second.

           A tiny dart zips right into Jones’s ass.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Ow!!!  

           Jones grabs for the dart, but it DISSOLVES as he touches it.    

                                 MOORE
                             (pushing Jones to safety)
                        Stay down, dumb-ass!  

           Satisha takes shelter, pulls out HER WHITE HANDHELD DEVICE.  
           Picks up a signal, smiles.  We realize SHE JUST SHOT JONES 
           WITH A TRACKER.  She catches Hunter’s eye, nods.

                                 HUNTER
                        Pull back!

           The trio withdraws from Moore’s fire with tactical precision.

           EXT. FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Backup arrives.  A dozen cop cars slide to a stop, including 
           Matheson in his unmarked sedan.

           INT/EXT. BEHIND THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Clag swerves the Hummer into view just as the Syndicate crew 
           exits the building.  They smash through cop cars and make an 
           easy getaway as Matheson and the other cops dive to safety. 

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT

           Sera, disguised by a lab coat, purposefully heads for an 
           exit.  She masks a COUGH, her illness growing worse.

           In the chaos, no one notices her escape into the night.
           EXT. SIDE OF THE EMBARCADERO - NIGHT

           The Hummer is parked on the Embarcadero along the Bay.  

           Hunter stares at the water, thinking.  Clag has contracted a 
           steady spasmatic shake.  Kort fidgets, impatient.   

                                 KORT
                        We should be tearing this city 
                        apart.  We need more men.

                                 HUNTER
                        We have our reenforcements on the 
                        ship if necessary.

                                 KORT
                        That policeman is learning too 
                        much, we should have killed him.

                                 HUNTER
                             (smoldering anger)
                        Kort.  I like killing annoying 
                        people too, but we have no time to 
                        search blindly.  The Confed’s fail-
                        safe will rip a hole in this planet 
                        in hours.  That policeman is 
                        tracking Sera, we are tracking him.  
                        He leads us to her, she leads us to 
                        the Weapon, Syndicate victorious.  
                        Am I going too fast?  Would you be 
                        more comfortable back in the 
                        Supervoid?

           Cowed, Kort turns away.

           Satisha monitors the tracking chip embedded on Jones.  

           EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Police are interviewing witnesses, photographing evidence.  
           Detective Matheson approaches Moore.

                                 MOORE
                        You handing out smiles?

                                 MATHESON
                        They’re in the wind.  

                                 MOORE
                        C’mon Matty!  We’ve got half the 
                        damn force here, and what... they 
                        just flew away?
                                 MATHESON
                        We’re on the Hummer.  I’m meeting 
                        the Transpo Director in ten to go 
                        over video from the street cams.  
                        So... um... what exactly happened?

           Moore fingers a photo of Sera.  Something about her eyes...

                                 MOORE 
                        I want this photo everywhere, APB.  
                        The girl’s the key.

           Jones staggers up to them, absently eating from a bag of 
           Teriyaki Turkey Jerky.  He’s about a minute away from the 
           onset of PTSD.  He looks at Moore, wide-eyed.

                                 JONES
                        Ride home?  Please?

                                 MOORE
                        Alright, listen up.  You tell me 
                        every goddamn thing she told you 
                        after I left, or I swear I’ll get a 
                        search warrant for your apartment, 
                        and when the cops toss it, I’m 
                        pretty sure you won’t be happy with 
                        the level of respect they pay to 
                        your comic book collection.

           Jones starts to lose it.

                                 JONES
                        OK, Detective?  I keep my graphic 
                        novels in a safety deposit box.
                             (beat)
                        She said she’d come back.  

           Moore looks around, incredulous.

                                 MOORE
                        Do you see her around?  That woman 
                        is now wanted for questioning in a 
                        murder.  And it doesn’t matter that 
                        you think she’s pretty.

                                 JONES
                        Pretty?  I just had my entire 
                        reality realigned.  And then two 
                        minutes later, I got shot at!  I 
                        want to go home, I want to watch 
                        the Doctor Who premiere, and I want 
                        my goddamn iPad back!
                                 MOORE
                             (had enough)
                        Who the hell is she?!

           Jones is breathing hard.  That’s almost as big a tantrum he’s 
           thrown in his entire life.  But for the first time since Sera 
           revealed herself to him, the wheels start to turn.

           He locks eyes with Moore, realizes the absurdity of trying to 
           convince this guy that Sera is anything but human.  Finally:

                                 JONES
                        OK, I’m just gonna throw this out 
                        there.  I’m not saying you’ll 
                        believe it, but I think I know 
                        what’s going on here.  You remember 
                        the rebels in Star Wars?

                                 MOORE
                        Never seen it.

           A pause.

                                 JONES
                        You just blew my mind.

                                 MOORE
                        Keep talking.

           Jones presses on, he really wants them to get it.

                                 JONES
                        The rebels hid their most important 
                        weapons on the most remote planets 
                        where the Empire would never find 
                        them.  Well, that’s us, that’s 
                        Earth.  Sera - she hid something 
                        here.  And those guys with the 
                        guns?  They’re the Empire.  And 
                        they just found us.

           Moore and Matheson are speechless for an eternity, then--  

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m gonna go call in that APB.  

                                 MOORE
                        And find me a coffee, with about 
                        this much Irish whiskey in it.  
                             (turns to Jones)
                        Jones, it’s been fun, the City 
                        thanks you for your help.  I’ll get  
                        someone to drive you home.
           Moore walks off, gets into his car.  Jones runs after him. 
           Talking it out has given him clarity, made him turn a corner.

                                 JONES 
                        I can figure out where she’s going.  

                                 MOORE
                        Go home Jones.  

                                 JONES
                        There’s nothing I’d like to do more 
                        right now.  And frankly, you’re not 
                        that fun to be around.  But she’s 
                        in trouble, and you’re never gonna 
                        find her without me.

                                 MOORE
                        This isn’t one of your stories.  
                        This is real.

                                 JONES
                        That’s what’s freaking me out.

           Moore looks like he’s agreeing to a vasectomy, but Jones is 
           the only lead he’s got.  He hands over the iPad.    

                                 MOORE 
                        Get in, Mifune.

           Jones nervously hops in the car, happy to have his electronic 
           security blanket back, and they speed off.

           EXT. LASER BEANS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           Elaborate neon depicts a space-helmeted hottie firing a laser 
           pistol at giant green one-eyed monsters.

           INT. LASER BEANS - NIGHT

           There’s no other way to say it - this is a Starbucks with 
           Laser Tag.  Geek nirvana.  

           Tables and rows of terminals where guys who don’t get a lot 
           of sun are jacked into Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, Star 
           Wars: The Old Republic, a dozen more MMORPGs.

           Bookshelves packed with Japanese manga.  Posters of 
           superheroes and anime babes.  One booth is a life-size re-
           creation of the scene where the baby xenomorph bursts out of 
           Kane’s chest in Alien.

           Nerds drink coffee, read their favorite stuff, and yes, 
           occasionally take out their frustrations on the laser tag 
           indoor arena and shooting range in the back.
           A chunky NERD-BARISTA, goatee, Game of Thrones T-shirt, 
           perfectly executes the Vacuum Method, a notoriously tricky 
           but oh-my-god-so-worth-it way to brew.  It involves two glass 
           globes, a Bunsen burner, and a working knowledge of physics.

           Jones eagerly awaits his cup, fully entranced by the magic.  
           Moore cannot fucking believe this shit.

                                 MOORE 
                        Do you really feel we’re doing all 
                        we can to find that girl right now?

                                 JONES
                        Just... be cool.  

                                 MOORE
                        Did you really just say that here?

           The Barista finished up, hands over two cups.

                                 NERD-BARISTA
                        There you go, gentlemen.  
                             (conspiratorial to Jones)
                        Can’t wait for Ataxia!  Torvin is 
                        the greatest anti-hero ever!

                                 JONES
                        And I’m sure he’d love this coffee.

           Jones receives his cup reverentially.  

           Moore accepts his like it’s a telemarketing call, takes a 
           quick hello-goodbye sip.  

                                 MOORE 
                        Mmmm.  OK, break’s over.

                                 JONES
                        No no no, you know, savor it?

           Jones does, his eyes show only bliss.  Moore relents, savors 
           a sip of the steaming goodness.

                                 MOORE
                             (quiet menace)
                        That’s really really good, I’m not 
                        gonna lie, but if I’m in here for 
                        more than another five minutes, I’m 
                        gonna feel compelled to give 
                        someone a wedgie.  

           The Nerd-Barista’s eyes widen, his sense-memory kicking in. 
                                 JONES
                             (to Barista)
                        We need to see Lewis.  

                                 NERD-BARISTA
                             (nodding to the back)
                        In the Arena.

           As they head over, a buzz of “That’s really him!” sweeps 
           through the place.  Jones is deep in his fanbase.

           The entrance to the Arena is a gigantic DRAGON’S MOUTH 
           complete with SMOKE pouring out, glowing lights and the CONAN 
           SCORE coming through speakers.  It’s ridiculous.

                                 MOORE
                        If this is a dead end, I am going 
                        to be very, very angry.

                                 JONES
                        Look, I know you think she’s crazy, 
                        but if Sera really thinks she’s 
                        from O.E., there’s something she 
                        thinks she needs, and Lewis will 
                        know where to find it.  Now don’t 
                        make any sudden moves in there, 
                        he’s jittery. 

                                 MOORE
                        I just hope none of this geek shit 
                        is contagious.

           INT. LASER BEANS ARENA - NIGHT

           Two fourteen-year-old dorks, taking their situation way too 
           seriously, take cover on either side of a doorway leading 
           into a dark hallway.  They meet eyes, nod, and burst forward.

           Nothing.  They walk forward into a larger chamber with 
           glowing fractal patterns projected onto the walls.  Then-

                                 LEWIS
                        AHHHHHH!!!!!!!

           A fat, bearded uber-nerd rolls into the chamber on the 
           ground, fires his “laser pistol” as he tumbles, takes out the 
           teens, then jumps to his feet in triumph.  

           This is LEWIS MIKELBERG (38).

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        You have been owned, bitches.  And 
                        I don’t mean pwned.  I’m old-school 
                        like that.
                                 TEEN
                        You suck, Nickel-bag.  My mom picks 
                        us up in 15, we’re gonna go catch 
                        Peter Jackson’s Hobbit vlog on the 
                        widescreen.

           Moore and Jones enter.  Lewis spins and fires, his laser 
           lights on Moore’s forehead.  Moore frowns.  

                                 LEWIS
                        Jones.

                                 JONES
                        Lewis.

                                 LEWIS
                        You’re interrupting my conquest of 
                        Gamma sector.  What the hell are 
                        you doing here in meat-space?

                                 JONES 
                        Trust me, if I had a choice, this 
                        would be an iChat.  Can we, uh, 
                        mind-meld for a sec?

           Lewis assesses Moore, quickly makes him as a cop.   

                                 LEWIS
                        Suppose we play a little game 
                        first... Detective.

           INT. LASER BEANS SHOOTING RANGE - CONTINUOUS

           Lewis guides Jones and Moore to the target practice range 
           like he’s some high-level government informant.  

                                 LEWIS
                        If you can hit every target before 
                        I do, then perhaps --

           Moore picks up a laser gun and SHOOTS out every single target 
           in the room in about ten seconds.

                                 MOORE
                        I trained at Quantico, fucknuts.
                             (to Jones)
                        Please god, just ask him what you 
                        need to ask him so I can get back 
                        to Earth.

                                 JONES
                        Lithium Hydride.
                             (off Lewis’s raised eyebrow)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JONES (CONT'D)
                        I don’t need it, I just need to 
                        know where I’d find it if I did.

           Lewis ponders, strokes the beard, makes a decision.

                                 LEWIS
                        I need my secure terminal.

           INT. LASER BEANS - LEWIS’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Lewis sits at a desktop, typing away.  We’ll pretend we don’t 
           notice the pervy anime chick blow-up dolls and scale models.

                                 JONES
                             (fascinated by the screen)
                        So this is a safe forum?

                                 LEWIS
                        It’s better if you don’t ask about 
                        that, Jonesy.

                                 JONES
                        Oh my god.  Are you in with...

                                 LEWIS
                        The Cypherpunks?  They’ve been shut 
                        down for years.  But occasionally 
                        it pays to believe in ghosts. 

           Lewis logs on to a Bulletin Board site and uploads a message.

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        This forum runs on the Rubberhose 
                        system - the encryption’s 
                        encrypted.  Even the Cray XT5 would 
                        take a month to recognize that 
                        there’s anything hidden.

                                 MOORE
                             (not impressed)
                        This gonna take a lot of time?

                                 LEWIS
                        I already got a hit.  Jonesy, your 
                        answer is the Vallecitos Nuclear 
                        Center, thirty miles west of town.  

           Moore and Jones trade an ominous look.  

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        There’s something else...  
                             (turns to them)
                        You guys aren’t the only ones 
                        asking around about this stuff.
           EXT. LASER BEANS - NIGHT

           Moore gets in Jones’ face at the car.     

                                 MOORE
                        Alright Neo, this just got bigger 
                        than you and me.  I need the 
                        details about what that girl thinks 
                        is happening, or I swear I’ll put 
                        you in a prison where they re-enact 
                        Desperate Housewives episodes at 
                        group time. 

                                 JONES
                        Why are you so fixated on her 
                        anyway?  What about chasing down 
                        those scary arch-criminals who were 
                        shooting at us?  You know they’re 
                        the guys who killed Tommy.

                                 MOORE
                        In the real world, there are laws.  
                        That girl is a witness in a murder 
                        investigation.  I can get them for 
                        shooting up the hospital, but I 
                        need her to connect them to Tommy.  
                        I can’t just make shit up like you 
                        do all day.

           Jones desperately wants to tell Moore that none of this is 
           made up, but he knows it’s hopeless.  Instead:  

                                 JONES
                        OK so in Alien?  The xenomorph has 
                        acid for blood.  Which is totally 
                        awesome because even after you kill 
                        a xenomorph, it can still kill you.  
                        Coolest villains ever, by the way.

           He SNORTS in geeky ecstacy.

                                 MOORE
                        I need you to stop saying 
                        'xenomorph' right now.

                        Look, in my books, the OEs are the 
                        same way.  If they’re not on their 
                        home planet, they need a chemical 
                        to cool their blood.  Like a 
                        diabetic needs insulin.  Only with 
                        this, if they miss a dose, their 
                        bodies will literally explode.

                                 JONES (CONT'D)
                        That's how Book Two of my series 
                        ends – Rygar gives up his last dose 
                        to save his daughter.

                                 MOORE
                        Sounds truly heartbreaking.

                                 JONES
                        I cried when I wrote it.  Dick.  
                        Anyway, the chemical is Lithium 
                        Hydride.  Sera said her supply was 
                        destroyed.  We use it to keep 
                        nuclear reactors cool.  That’s why 
                        it’s at Vallecitos, and that’s 
                        where your witness is headed.

           Moore shakes his head, somewhere between skeptical and 
           impressed.  He might be onto something, or he might be 
           blowing this entire investigation on a wild goose chase.  

           EXT. INTERSTATE 580 - LATER

           Moore’s car speeds from the city into the country.  A short 
           distance back, Hunter’s black Hummer follows.  

           INT. MOORE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Moore listens to a baseball game to help him think, an old 
           habit.  Jones is busy typing on his iPad.  It gets to Moore.

                                 MOORE 
                             (re: Jones’s iPad)
                        What is that?  What are you doing?

                                 JONES
                        I’m blogging about the case.

                                 MOORE
                        You can’t blog about the case.

                                 JONES
                        Relax, I haven’t uploaded anything 
                        yet.  But if anything happens to 
                        me, I want the fans to know...
                             (can’t resist)
                        ...that I might be in the middle of 
                        an intergalactic arms race.

           Moore slams on the brakes, traffic whips all around them.

                                 MOORE
                        This is an open homicide 
                        investigation.
           He grabs the iPad, futilely searches for an off switch.  

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        I’m tracking a foreigner trying to 
                        obtain illegal chemicals.  There’s 
                        nothing intergalactic about it.

           A trailer ROARS past them, shakes the car.  

                                 JONES
                        I don’t think we’re parked in a 
                        good spot.  

                                 MOORE
                        Too real for you?  

                                 JONES
                        You have a serious problem with 
                        what I do, don’t you?

                                 MOORE
                        Hey, if you want to waste your life 
                        making up stories about little 
                        wizards and little dragons 
                        magically jerking each other off 
                        all day, it’s fine by me.  But I 
                        have a job to do.

                                 JONES
                        OK, wizards and dragons?  That’s 
                        fantasy.  Which I also like.  But I 
                        write sci-fi, there’s a huge 
                        difference.  It inspires people.  

                                 MOORE
                        To do what?  Buy more comic books?  
                        Pretend there’s a better world out 
                        there?  I got news for you, pal.  
                        You can fly around up in the clouds 
                        for awhile, but when you come back 
                        down, people are still people.  
                        They steal from each other, they 
                        kill each other, they disappoint 
                        each other.  That never changes.  

                                 JONES
                        Wow.  Who killed Santa Claus for 
                        you?  Mommy or Daddy?  

           Moore chucks the iPad in the backseat.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Careful!

           Moore drives on, huffy.  Jones sulks.
                                 MOORE
                        Intergalactic, my ass.

                                 JONES
                        Your ass will never be 
                        intergalactic.

           EXT. VALLECITOS NUCLEAR CENTER - NIGHT

           A sprawling CAMPUS of buildings and a HUGE NUCLEAR REACTOR 
           CONTAINMENT SILO.  Moore’s car idles at a SECURITY GATE.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I’m sorry, Detective, there’s no 
                        way I can let you in there with a 
                        civilian at this hour with no 
                        warrant and no clearance.

                                 MOORE
                        Look, we just need to talk to a 
                        technician, make sure everything is 
                        normal, and we’re out.

           Security Guard notes Jones playing HUNGRY SHARK on his iPad.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I’m gonna need something, 
                        Detective.

                                 JONES
                        Will a call from DHS work?

           Moore lights up, dials his contact.  Voicemail.  

                                 MOORE
                        Shit.

                                 JONES
                        What’s the number here?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        415-384-9200.

           Jones fires off an email.

                                 MOORE 
                        What could you possibly--?

           Jones holds up a ‘wait for it’ finger.

           The phone inside the Security booth rings.  The Guard picks 
           up, listens, raises the gate, waves them through.

           Moore is speechless.
                                 JONES
                        Deputy Secretary Lute’s a huge 
                        Omicron nerd.  She posts on my 
                        fanpage daily, trying to get me to 
                        give up spoilers.

           EXT. VALLECITOS NUCLEAR CENTER - NIGHT

           A smarmy TECHNICIAN guides Moore and Jones across the campus.    

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Welcome to Vallecitos.  I’m Billy, 
                        and I’m so happy to be touring you 
                        around instead of making sure the 
                        nuclear reactor is working 
                        properly.

           EXT. BUILDING 14 - NIGHT

           They arrive at a massive storage facility that could double 
           as an airplane hangar.  The door is one huge slab of steel.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Building 14.  Chemical Storage.  

           Moore does a cursory glance looking for a disturbance.  

                                 MOORE
                        Anything out of the ordinary 
                        tonight?  Signs of a break-in?

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        As I mentioned, I’ve been kind of 
                        busy preventing meltdowns.

                                 JONES
                        Nothing unusual in the sky?

           Moore stares daggers at Jones.  The Technician looks at Jones 
           like he’s insane - which at this point, he may be.

                                 MOORE
                        Can we see inside?

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Nope.  Condition of our insurance.  
                        They don’t want to be making pay-
                        outs to every visitor who grows a 
                        third nipple in five years.  

           Moore peels a hundred from his money clip, offers it up.  The 
           Technician eyes the money, debates.  Pockets the cash.
                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.
                             (lifts his silent walkie)
                        My radio is calling me away.

           The Tech scans his card, and the STEEL DOOR OPENS.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Moore re: Jones)
                        If he touches anything, shoot him. 

                                 MOORE
                        I like you, Billy.  

           The Technician heads off.  Jones and Moore enter.

           INT. BUILDING FOURTEEN - NIGHT

           A warehouse full of pallet after pallet of chemical drums, 
           technical equipment and construction material.  They walk 
           past the many, many storage units.    

                                 JONES
                        I think the Ark of the Covenant is 
                        in here.

                                 MOORE
                        Does anything you know not come 
                        from a movie?  

                                 JONES
                        I know you’re an asshole.  

           Moore and Jones assess the situation.  All appears normal.  

                                 MOORE
                        Wow, your hunch was dead on.  

                                 JONES
                        Maybe she’s not here yet.

                                 MOORE
                        You know what I think?  I think you 
                        need this to be true.  To justify 
                        all the time you waste thinking 
                        about shit that doesn’t exist.

           Jones can’t let that one go.

                                 JONES
                        OK, Detective, let me break it down 
                        for you.  I make a good living on 
                        stories, but I’d write them even if 
                        no one was reading.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JONES (CONT'D)
                        Those stories were what I had when 
                        there was no one to talk to during 
                        recess.  Or study hall.  Or my 
                        early twenties.  Now I don’t know 
                        who this girl really is, but I know 
                        she’s someone I need to find, and 
                        this is the only place I can think 
                        of where she needs to go.

           Moore looks like he may actually have some sympathy, but --

           Ahead, a NOISE signals trouble.  An intruder.  Moore draws 
           his gun.  A SHADOW moves on the CATWALK above.  

                                 MOORE
                        San Francisco Police, stay where 
                        you are!

           The shadow crosses into the light, pausing to get his 
           bearings.  The figure comes into view.  A familiar face.

                                                          MOORE
                           JONES
           That’s my mailman.
                                              That’s your mailman.

           The Mailman produces a SILVER BALL from inside his coat, 
           tosses it into the air.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Look out!

           THE BALL HOVERS IN MIDDLE OF THE ROOM... and immediately 
           SWELLS until it becomes a GLOBE the size of a VW Beetle.  The 
           globe vibrates and EMITS A VISIBLE PULSE THAT SPREADS OUT IN 
           A WAVE THROUGHOUT THE ROOM.

                                 JONES
                        What the hell is he doing with 
                        that?

                                 MOORE
                        What?

           The wave hits them.  Moore squints, his ears won’t pop.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                             (yells)
                        What is that?!

                                 JONES
                        I think... it’s a Gravity-Flex!

                                 MOORE
                        What?!
           Moore and Jones suddenly FALL UP through the air, their feet 
           slamming into the ceiling as their world rotates.  

           EVERYTHING NOT TIED DOWN starts falling upwards all around 
           them.  Tables, tools, pressurized tanks fly at them.  

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is going on?!

                                 JONES
                        I think my mailman is involved in 
                        this somehow.

                                 MOORE
                             (points at the floor/ceiling)
                        This!  This!  Why am I on the 
                        ceiling?!

           A massive CRATE SMASHES into the ceiling right next to Moore.

                                 JONES 
                        Too real for you?

           Moore’s glare screams, “Not now.”

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        That globe is emitting a field of 
                        repolarized gravitons.  The ceiling 
                        can be the floor, the wall can be 
                        the ceiling.  
                             (confused but in awe)
                        I totally thought I made that shit 
                        up.
                             (spots something)
                        There!

           Jones points to the Mailman running away ACROSS THE CEILING, 
           a duffle bag slung over his back.  

                                 MOORE
                        I’ll get him.  You find a way to 
                        turn that thing off.

           Moore chases after the man.  Jones stays behind and holds 
           onto the catwalk.

                                 JONES
                        Yeah... I’ll just turn it off.
                             (suddenly remembers)
                        Moore, be careful about--!

           But another WAVE emanates from the GLOBE, and gravity SHIFTS 
           AGAIN.  Now EVERYTHING SHIFTS and FALLS over to the west wall 
           of the facility.  
           Moore SLAMS into a pile of SMASHED LAB EQUIPMENT.  He fights 
           for balance, gains his sea legs, and continues the chase.  

           The Mailman is bizarrely spry for his age, and apparently 
           accustomed to shifting gravity.  He adapts to each change 
           like it was nothing, using unexpected hand-holds to keep him 
           upright and balanced.

           A huge PALLET OF EQUIPMENT smashes through the side wall 
           leaving a GAPING HOLE.  The MAILMAN DROPS THROUGH IT like it 
           was a hole in the floor --

           EXT. BUILDING THREE - CONTINUOUS

           -- and lands ON THE OUTER WALL OF ANOTHER BUILDING.  

           From where the Mailman lands, we see Moore struggling to 
           replicate the move, but he can’t quite get out.  

           Moore loses his grip and FALLS INTO THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING 
           in a heap.

           INT. BUILDING FOURTEEN - NIGHT

           Jones stands on the side of the catwalk, jumps for the silver 
           globe, tries over and over, he’s not exactly NBA material.  

           Finally, he uses his brain, and opens a glass cabinet holding 
           a FIRE HOSE.  The hose DROPS OUT SIDEWAYS and dangles into 
           the center of the room, right near the Gravity Flex globe. 

           Jones SWINGS on the fire hose, and manages to put a hand on  
           the Gravity-Flex...

           ...but it starts to ROLL AWAY.

           Oh shit.

           EXT. BUILDING THREE - NIGHT

           Moore and the Mailman cling impossibly perpendicular to the 
           outer wall, about 20 yards apart.  The shadow of a MASSIVE 
           NUCLEAR REACTOR CONTAINMENT SILO towers in the background.

           Moore staggers to his feet and shouts to the Mailman.

                                 MOORE
                        Where is she?

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        You’re in over your head, 
                        Detective.
           That’s when the next gravity wave HITS.  Moore immediately 
           starts to fall.  

           But The Mailman is ready for it, and sails in exactly the 
           right direction so that he lands on --

           EXT. NUCLEAR REACTOR CONTAINMENT SILO - CONTINUOUS

           The Mailman lands on the curved surface of the massive silo 
           and makes a RUNNING LEAP ONTO A SECURE LADDER that reaches 
           from the ground to the very top.

           MOORE IS FALLING FAST... if he doesn’t grab onto something 
           soon, he might just fall up into the sky.  

           He HITS THE SIDE OF THE SILO, starts SLIDING UPWARD, clutches 
           desperately for a hand-hold as he quickly RUNS OUT OF SILO.

           INT. BUILDING FOURTEEN - NIGHT

           Jones still hangs by the firehose, but the Gravity Flex Globe 
           has rolled further and now hovers about 30 yards away.  

           He spots three OBJECTS at once: a METAL DRUM with a FLAMMABLE 
           label leaking LIQUID ONTO THE GLOBE, a STEEL BEAM dislodged 
           from the ceiling, and SCAFFOLDING WITH ALUMINUM SIDING.

           He does a quick bit of guesswork, anticipating the next 
           gravity shift... the PULSE IS EMITTED...

           EXT. NUCLEAR REACTOR CONTAINMENT SILO - CONTINUOUS

           MOORE has fallen all the way to very TOP OF THE SILO... 

           Like Luke dangling at the bottom of Cloud City, Moore hangs 
           by a SMALL LEAD PIPE that is STARTING TO GIVE WAY!  

           If it breaks, Moore will fall up into the sky... to a very 
           unpleasant death.  

           INT. BUILDING FOURTEEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jones guesses right about the next pulse, SWINGS OFF OF THE 
           FIREHOSE and lands on the DISLODGED STEEL BEAM.  He hangs on 
           for dear life.

                                 JONES
                        AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           The beam FALLS, scraping the scaffolding.  SPARKS SHOWER!  
           The liquid from the leaking DRUM ignites...
                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t die.  Please don’t die. 

           Jones rides the beam as it CRACKS into the Globe like a 
           mallet hitting a croquet ball.  The device CRASHES TO THE 
           FLOOR, TRAPPED under the beam.

           Jones shouts victoriously, grins like an idiot - this is the 
           coolest thing he’s ever done.  And he survived!  

           But he spots the blazing liquid -- he springs to his feet, 
           dives for cover just as the leaking drum EXPLODES, TAKING THE 
           GLOBE WITH IT!

           EXT. NUCLEAR REACTOR CONTAINMENT SILO - CONTINUOUS

           Gravity normalizes!  Moore drops to the roof of the silo like 
           a brick, safe from oblivion.

           The Mailman climbs onto the roof from the safety ladder.  And 
           is promptly greeted by Moore’s gun.  

                                 MOORE
                             (incredibly shaken)
                        Hold it.  

           The Mailman raises both hands in a gesture of surrender.

                                 MAILMAN
                        You need to help us, Detective.  
                        Sera needs what I have and the 
                        Weapon needs to be moved.  All of 
                        our worlds are at stake.

           Moore’s eyes narrow ever so slightly.

           INT. MOORE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Moore drives, silent.  The Mailman sits in back, hands zip-
           tied.  Jones, in the passenger seat, turns to look at his 
           formerly normal friend with wide eyes.  

           He mouths, What the fuck? The Mailman mouths back, I’m sorry!

                                 MOORE
                             (to Jones)
                        Don’t talk.  Not to me, not to him.

           His cell RINGS.  Moore answers, hoping for good news.  

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Matty?  Any luck with that Hummer?  
           INTERCUT - INT. SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

           Matheson stands with some officials in front of the numerous 
           video screens monitoring traffic flow.

                                 MATHESON
                        We got them heading out on 
                        Interstate 580 about an hour ago.

           BACK TO MOORE:  He looks up just in time to see a sign 
           reminding us that they’re on Interstate 580 right now.

           The Mailman leans over the backseat.  

                                 MAILMAN
                        They’re tracking you, Detective.

           Moore is torn.  None of this is making sense.

                                 MOORE
                             (into phone)
                        We’re back in town in half an hour.  
                        The girl’s at the Hibernia Bank 
                        Building.  Meet us there. 

           Moore hangs up.  Jones squirms like he’s about to speak-- 

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t even.

           They drive on in silence.

           INT. BUILDING FOURTEEN - NIGHT - LATER

           Clag, looking sicker, sweating bullets, desperately searches 
           an LiH container, finds nothing left.  Kort laughs at him.

                                 SATISHA
                        She’s sick.

                                 HUNTER
                        She can’t last more than a few 
                        hours.  A simple matter of time.   

           Hunter surveys the damaged remains of the Gravity-Flex.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        Who are these idiots?

           EXT. SECURITY STATION - NIGHT

           The Black Hummer drives through the gates, past a metal drum 
           bearing a RADIATION WARNING.  
           Sticking out of the drum, the DEAD HAND OF THE SMARMY 
           TECHNICIAN clutches his walkie-talkie, ominously chirping out 
           static.

           EXT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

           Moore’s car is parked in the Tenderloin across from the 
           historic Hibernia Bank Building.  This is a gorgeous 19th 
           century building that’s been abandoned for thirty years.  

           INT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - LOBBY - DAWN

           Sunbeams filter into the lobby.  Cathedral ceilings, ornate 
           stonework, marble floors.  Moore and Jones trail the Mailman. 

                                 JONES
                        Wow, look at this place... Did you 
                        know this is the bank Patty Hearst 
                        robbed back in the ‘70s?

                                 MOORE
                        Hey ADD, stay focused.  
                             (to the Mailman)
                        Where is she?  Where’s Sera?

                                 MAILMAN
                        She’s close.

           Moore stands his ground.

                                 MOORE
                        Why don’t you call her, have her 
                        meet us right here.

                                 MAILMAN
                        She’s not well.  We have to go to 
                        her.  Trust me, I want to get her 
                        healthy and get her out of here.  

                                 MOORE
                        Forgive me if I’m not in a trusting 
                        mood right now.

                                 JONES
                        Don’t mind him, he gets like that 
                        when someone shatters his entire 
                        world-view.

           The Mailman concedes, speaks into his wrist in Azilari.

                                 MOORE
                        What’d he say?
                                 JONES
                        She’s coming to us.  

           Moore straightens up, back in control of things.

                                 MOORE
                        Good.

           They wait, and waiting gives Jones time to think.  And talk.

                                 JONES 
                        You know the most amazing part of 
                        all this?  
                             (Moore could care less)
                        Definitive proof of multiverse 
                        theory.  I mean, I was having a 
                        freak-out earlier, I’m not gonna 
                        lie, but really it’s just a chicken-
                        egg problem.  Like I’m the chicken, 
                        my books are the eggs, but then 
                        there are these other eggs that 
                        look just like mine, but I didn’t 
                        lay ‘em.  Right?

           Moore looks like his head is going to explode.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Then I remembered - multiverse 
                        theory.  Whatever we think of, 
                        somewhere out there it really 
                        exists.  Like think of a hobbit, 
                        right?  Somewhere out there -- 
                        hobbits are real.

                                 MOORE
                        The bullets in this gun are real, I 
                        swear to god.  

                                 JONES
                        That’s because, if the universe is 
                        infinite, every possible variation 
                        of everything actually exists an 
                        infinite number of times in an 
                        infinite number of ways.  So we 
                        should never be surprised about 
                        anything!  Take this conversation--

                                 MOORE
                        We’re not having a conversation.
                                 JONES
                        If you go far enough into the 
                        universe, you’ll actually encounter 
                        another us talking about exactly 
                        the same thing.  And if you go even 
                        further, you’ll see us again, but 
                        maybe we’re speaking Mandarin... 
                        anything you can imagine... 
                        infinite versions!

           Fascination washes over Moore’s face.  

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        You’re getting it, aren’t you?

                                 MOORE
                        Yeah... somewhere out there, 
                        there’s a version of me kicking 
                        your ass right now.  

                                 JONES
                        Well, yeah, but there’s a version 
                        of me kicking your ass too.

                                 MOORE
                        See, that’s where your little 
                        theory falls apar-- Shit.

           The Mailman is no longer there, Moore draws his gun.

                                 JONES
                        Where’s my mailman?

                                 MOORE
                        You’re the genius, you tell me!

           Moore spots a large leather-padded door still swinging 
           slightly.  Moore and Jones rush through it.   

           INT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - MAIN HALL - DAY 

           Moore and Jones enter the massive Main Hall.

           This is a bank like they don’t build ‘em anymore.  A wall of 
           teller stations, all solid marble.  On the back wall are 
           three enormous VAULTS, doors ajar.  

           The CEILING is dominated by a STAINED GLASS SKYLIGHT in 
           disrepair.  Light streams in through the cracked dusty glass.

           Moore gestures for Jones to keep quiet as they peer behind 
           the teller stations to see -- 

           The Mailman kneels beside Sera, sweating, severely ill.
           A GLOWING RED ORB the size of ping-pong ball floats above the 
           Mailman’s hand.  It pulses a cool BLUE as it floats toward 
           Sera and MELDS INTO HER CHEST with a bright FLASH.  Her eyes 
           clear as she recovers.  

                                 SERA
                        We have to repair the ship.

                                 MAILMAN
                        We have to explain everything.  One 
                        of them is going to figure it out.

                                 SERA
                        First, the ship.  We can’t risk the 
                        Weapon becoming unstable.  Tommy’s 
                        gone, it’s only you and me.

           Moore steps up, gun raised.  Sera and the Mailman freeze. 

                                 MOORE
                        You know what to do.

           Sera stares at Jones.  But Jones stares at something else.

                                 JONES
                        Moore.

                                 MOORE
                        Not now.

                                 JONES
                        Moore --

                                 MOORE
                        I don’t know many more ways to say 
                        it, Jones, just shut your mouth!  
                        No more aliens, no more laser guns, 
                        no more goddamn anti-gravity!  You 
                        two, on your knees, hands behind 
                        your head, interlock your--

                                 JONES
                             (hushed, voice cracking)
                        Moore!

                                 MOORE
                        What?!

           Moore finally turns-- 

           And sees TWO SMALL CREATURES EMERGING FROM THE CENTER VAULT.  
           They look like mutant tiger cubs:  feline, patterned fur, 
           slightly bigger than house cats, but just as cute.  
                                 JONES
                        Don’t.  Move.

           Moore eyeballs the harmless little animals.

                                 MOORE
                        Are you not a cat person?

           Moore shuts up as the Creatures bare sharp TEETH and over-
           sized CLAWS... and rapidly begin to GROW.

           With each step toward MOORE AND JONES, the cats grow LARGER 
           and MORE MENACING.  TEETH EXTEND into SABERTOOTH SPIKES.  
           CLAWS BECOME DAGGERS mounted on crackling knuckles.

           Whatever bioengineering lab these things came from is 
           definitely not in our neighborhood. 

           The large cats circle Moore and Jones, studying their lunch.  
           They’ve grown so tall the guys have to look up at them.   

           The Mailman touches his own copper bracelet (similar to 
           Sera’s).  He is somehow KEEPING THE CREATURES AT BAY.

           CRASH!!!  HUNTER AND HIS TEAM smash down through the skylight 
           above.  Assault rifles replaced with LASER CARBINES.  

           They drop down towards Moore and Jones using Anti-Grav Packs, 
           giving them a huge tactical advantage...

           ...until they notice the CREATURES whose eyes light up at the 
           sight of fresh meat descending from the sky.  

           THE FIGHT IS ON:

           - Creature #1 GROWLS AND LEAPS AT SATISHA.  She OPENS FIRE, 
           but the beast is too fast, and she’s SKEWERED by its CLAWS.

           - MOORE FIRES UP AT HUNTER, who evades the bullets and blasts 
           away into a corner of the room. 

           - CLAG drops to the ground.  His Earthsickness is much worse, 
           and he knows the MAILMAN has the cure.  Nearly delirious, he 
           runs at the old man.  But the bad-ass Mailman holds his own.  

           - KORT isn’t screwing around.  He drops down in front of Sera 
           and holds his CARBINE in her face.

                                 KORT
                        Get up!

           She does, hands raised.

           JONES makes a run at KORT’S BACK, SLAMS into him with all the 
           strength and speed he can muster.  It is not effective.  
           Kort turns, PICKS UP JONES by the scruff of the neck and 
           HURLS HIM OVER THE TELLER COUNTER.

           SERA takes advantage of the distraction and throws a KICK 
           into KORT’S FACE.  He staggers backward, then starts to FIRE 
           AT HER.  She tumbles behind a counter.

           Moore keeps Hunter pinned down, but Hunter grins when he sees-

           CREATURE #2 - no longer under the Mailman’s control - has set 
           its sights on MOORE who turns and UNLOADS HIS CLIP AT IT, but 
           the thing just keeps on coming.  

           Now free to move, Hunter sets his sights on Sera.  

           Jones recovers, sees Moore is in trouble.  He rushes up, digs 
           in a pocket, holds aloft the bag of Teriyaki Turkey Jerky.

                                 JONES
                        C’mere girl!

           The Creature re-directs toward the smell of food.  

                                 MOORE
                        Are you crazy?!

                                 JONES
                        It’s a Shi’Ar.  Just a kitten.

           Jones’s plan works a little too well:  the Creature pounces,  
           chases them OUT THROUGH A BACK DOOR.

           INT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Moore and Jones run for their life.

                                 MOORE
                        Just a little kitten.  Tony the 
                        friggin’ Tiger!

                                 JONES
                        In my books, they never attack 
                        anyone who feeds them!

                                 MOORE
                        I don’t think they can read!

           INT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - MAIN HALL - DAY

           SERA trades a desperate look with the MAILMAN.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Go.  Protect the Weapon.  
           Sera turns, runs after Moore and Jones.  

           The Mailman steels his resolve as Kort and Clag close in.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Leave him to me, get Sera!

           Hunter grabs the Mailman as Kort and Clag run off after Sera.  
           The Mailman directs his attention across the room--

           Creature #1 looks up from feasting on Satisha, feels the 
           Mailman’s commanding gaze, then LEAPS at Hunter.

           Its jaws clamp onto his LEFT ARM.  Some of Hunter’s flesh is 
           torn away, reveals HIS LEFT ARM IS ACTUALLY A POWERFUL BIONIC 
           LIMB - as we’ll see, this is his own lethal Swiss Army knife.

           The Creature pounces again, and Hunter BATS IT AWAY.  It 
           lands in a LIFELESS HEAP.  

           Hunter surveys his exposed arm.  He’s not happy.  He turns 
           his wrath on the Mailman, pushes the old man down to his 
           knees, stands behind him.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        How many cycles have you wasted 
                        your existence on this backwater?

                                 MAILMAN
                        You don’t scare me.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Oh no?

           He produces a TOOL from his utility belt.  It’s a nasty-
           looking SPIKE that crackles with blue electricity.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        How about now?

           With that, he JAMS THE SPIKE INTO THE BACK OF THE MAILMAN’S 
           NECK!  The Mailman attempts to scream in pain, but collapses 
           like he’s just been unplugged.

           INT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Moore and Jones sprint through a pair of double doors.  Fast. 

           CRAAASSHHH!!! CREATURE #2 breaks through the double doors and 
           surrounding wall, still hot on their trail.

           The guys fly around a corner, but find the Hallway is coming 
           to a rapid end.  They have run out of exits.  They turn and 
           face the on-coming threat...
           The Creature LEAPS AT THEM, CLAWS EXTENDED!

           The guys SCREAM.  Jones faints.  

           Just as the Creature knocks Moore to the floor, Sera touches 
           her wristband, and instantly SHRINKS the beast back to the 
           size of a house cat.

           The cat stands on Moore’s chest, harmlessly licks his face.

                                 SERA
                             (to Moore, slowly)
                        You can trust me.  I’m a good guy.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           Moore’s car SCREECHES into traffic, speeds around vehicles.  

           INT. MOORE’S CAR - DAY 

           Moore guns the engine, but he’s driving SHELL-SHOCKED, 
           directionless.  Jones is still passed out in the backseat, 
           Sera is beside him moving a SCANNING DEVICE over his body.

           She gets a reading in the region of his ass.  With a quick 
           motion, she changes the setting on the scanner and SLAPS IT 
           ONTO JONES’S REAR END.  He jolts awake for a moment - 

                                 JONES
                        Agent Scully, no!

           There’s a loud SUCKING SOUND, and the tiny tracking device 
           POPS OUT and disintegrates into dust.  

           Sera looks to Moore, who’s still in a daze.

                                 SERA
                        Detective?

                                 MOORE
                             (snapped out of it)
                        Huh?

           He makes a quick decision, pulls the car into a parking lot.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                             (finally cracking)
                        OK, please make it make sense.  And 
                        I don’t want to hear about his 
                        goddamn books.
                             (to Sera)
                        Are you... is there a... plan?  
                        What the hell is going on?
           Sera softens.  She touches Moore reassuringly.

                                 SERA
                        I know what I need to do.  The 
                        Weapon I need to retrieve, I know 
                        where it is.  And yes... I’m not 
                        from here.

                                 MOORE
                             (calming a little)
                        Great.  That’s great.  At least you 
                        look like us, right?  No tentacles 
                        or... whatnot.  So what do we do?  
                        Grab this thing, you phone home and 
                        get on your way?

                                 SERA
                        The problem is my ship.  It’s 
                        damaged.  Hunter ambushed me before 
                        I entered your atmosphere.

                                 MOORE
                        Damaged how?

                                 SERA
                        The hyperdrive core has been 
                        compromised.

                                 JONES
                             (finally recovered)
                        A hyperdrive core is the key 
                        component to an FTL drive, which--

                                 MOORE
                             (back to being Moore)
                        Less is still more.

                                 JONES
                        She means the fuel cell was damaged 
                        and it's deteriorating.  Like an 
                        element with a short half-life.

                                 MOORE
                        She’s out of gas.  Just say that.
                        Where do we get a new--?

                                 JONES
                        Hyperdrive core.

                                 MOORE
                        Yeah.  
                             (trying it on for size)
                        “Hyperdrive core.”  Whatever. 
                                 SERA
                        The element is rare, but there 
                        should be a supply on this planet.  
                        If I could access your data web, I 
                        might be able to find something 
                        with comparable specs.

           Jones produces his iPad.  

                                 JONES
                        Good thing I brought my “toy.”  

           He hits the power switch.  Nothing.  Batteries are dead.

                                 MOORE
                        I hope that shark game was fun.

                                 JONES
                        My apartment’s two blocks away.

           Moore drives out of the parking lot.    

           INT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

           Matheson enters, looks around.  

                                 MATHESON
                        Robbie?  Buddy..?

           No sign of Moore.  Checks his watch, maybe he’s early.  
           Checks the pedometer on his belt, decides to get a few more 
           steps in while he waits. 

           Matheson hears a noise.  Spots Kort and Clag.  He quickly 
           takes cover and draws his weapon.   

           INT. HIBERNIA BANK BUILDING - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Hunter has the MAILMAN propped up in a chair, the old man’s 
           eyes open and flashing, as though he’s... rebooting somehow.  

           Just then, Kort and Clag return from their search holding 
           MATHESON between them.  He’s been beaten into submission.

                                 KORT
                        We found something.  Hiding.  
                        Ineffectively.

           Hunter looks up, pleased.

                                 HUNTER
                        A policeman.  Wonderful.  Just, you 
                        know, secure him.  Take away his 
                        really scary weapons.
           Clag is sweating bullets, veins pulse in his forehead and 
           neck.  Clearly not well.  He nudges what’s left of Satisha’s 
           mauled corpse with his boot.

                                 CLAG
                        The tracking beacon is offline.

                                 HUNTER
                        Not to worry.  We have a new source 
                        of information.  

           Hunter takes a LONG METAL ROD and slides it into the 
           Mailman’s chest until a loud CRUNCH-POP rings out.

           Matheson’s eyes widen.  He’s incredibly freaked out, but 
           keeps quiet.

           A data stream and various icons appear on a device at the 
           other end of the jack.  Hunter begins to tap the touchscreen.  

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        Here we go.

                                 CLAG
                        You found it?

           We do not see what Hunter sees, only that his smile grows.  
           Kort and Clag crowd the monitor, even Matheson is amazed.   

                                 HUNTER
                        Now that is a clever hiding spot.  

           INT. JONES’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Jones is clearly relieved to be back in his comfort zone, 
           nearly kisses the ground in relief as they enter his abode.  
           He busies himself setting up his work station for Sera.  

                                 MOORE 
                        What about your friend back there?    

                                 SERA 
                             (sad, but driven)
                        He was doing his duty.

                                 MOORE
                        Neither snow, nor rain, nor alien 
                        invasion.

                                 JONES
                        Technically, this isn’t an 
                        invasion.
                                 SERA
                        None of this matters if we don’t 
                        move the Weapon in time.

                                 MOORE
                        What happens then?

                                 SERA
                        Do you really want to know?  

                                 JONES
                        Here you go.  I have it set so--

           Sera is already several web-pages deep.  

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        OK, you’re good.

           Moore pulls Jones aside.

                                 MOORE
                        What did she mean “in time”?

                                 JONES
                        Some kind of fail-safe.  

                                 MOORE
                        Like what?

                                 JONES
                        If her civilization is anything 
                        like the one I write about, they 
                        have some pretty extreme 
                        capabilities.  Nukes to them would 
                        be... small-scale.  

                                 MOORE
                        So what the hell is this Weapon?

                                 JONES
                        It’s almost a myth.  Hidden for 
                        generations.  I was going to reveal 
                        it in the last book in my series, 
                        but I’m years away from writing it.

                                 MOORE
                        Well use your imagination!

                                 JONES
                        I just know it’s something that 
                        could destroy entire worlds.  The 
                        fail-safe would have to be... you 
                        know, like when a Bomb Unit sends 
                        that robot in to detonate a bomb so 
                        no one else can use it?
                                 MOORE
                        What are we talking about?  A few 
                        blocks?  The whole city?

                                 JONES
                        No, more like... North America?  
                        Give or take?

                                 MOORE
                             (as this sinks in)
                        You couldn’t have written about a 
                        peaceful tropical island?  With 
                        umbrella drinks and naked women 
                        running around on the beach?

           Sera motions to the computer.  Jones inspects what she’s 
           brought up on the screen.  Moore grabs a bag of Milano 
           cookies from the cupboard, goes to town.

                                 SERA
                        From what I can understand of your 
                        systems of measurement, we need a 
                        material that is crystallo-
                        graphically isometric with a mid-
                        range density, and a specific 
                        gravity between 5.6 and 6.0.

           Jones is at a loss.  Moore, however, stops chewing, a look of 
           dread washing over his face.  

                                 MOORE
                        No.

                                 JONES
                        What?

                                 MOORE
                        Those specs have to be wrong.    

                                 JONES
                             (impressed but suspect)
                        You know what she’s looking for?

           Moore does, and he isn’t happy.  

           Suddenly, a LOUD KNOCK at the door.

                                 MOORE
                        Expecting someone?

           Jones shakes his head.  Moore steps to the door, checks the 
           peephole.  

                                 JONES
                        Who is it?
                                 MOORE
                        It’s your mailman.

           Jones fights Moore for space at the peephole.

           FISH-EYE VIEW:  The Mailman stands in the hallway. 

                                 JONES
                        He doesn’t look very good.

                                 SERA
                        Get away from the door!

           She grabs Jones and SHOVES HIM UNDER A DESK.  Moore backs 
           away just in time.  The door blasts off its hinges and the 
           Mailman storms in.  He raises a LASER CARBINE and opens fire.

           Moore and Sera barely reach cover.  Jones shrieks as his 
           sanctum santorum is turned into swiss cheese.

                                 SERA (CONT’D)
                        We have to go!

                                 MOORE
                        Sure!  Just as soon as the goddamn 
                        mailman stops trying to kill us!

           The Mailman’s gun sputters.  He struggles to get it to work.  

           Moore rises, fires at the Mailman.  The bullet PINGS off him, 
           ricochets back and destroys Jones’s life-size VOLTRON MODEL.    

                                 JONES
                        Hey!

                                 MOORE
                        The hell..?

           The Mailman leaps at Moore, lifts him up by the throat with 
           superhuman strength.     

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                             (squeaky)
                        Little help.

           Jones is on it.  He grabs his bamboo Kendo sword and charges.  
           The weapon slashes through the air-- 

           And shatters uselessly on the Mailman’s skull.  

           Jones gasps in regret.  Moore gasps in pain, he scratches at 
           the Mailman’s face--

           And rips it off!
           The Mailman is an ANDROID!

                                 JONES
                        What in the Westworld..?

           The Mailman levels his carbine at Jones.   

           Sera leaps into action, uses her Copper Bracelet to generate 
           an ENERGY SHIELD.  It glows ORANGE as it deflects the 
           Mailman’s laserfire.  

           She expertly tumbles and rolls, pops up and slices at the 
           Mailman with the shield.  

           As soon as the sparking particles hit him, the Mailman shorts 
           out for a split-second.  Enough for Moore to break away.   

           The Mailman recovers, produces a gadget that we know 
           instantly can ONLY BE AN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE.  

                                 MOORE 
                        Oh shit.

                                 SERA
                        Get out, now!

           She pushes Moore and Jones towards the large picture window.    
           Jones panics, looks at his computer, his destroyed note wall.

                                 JONES
                        My book!

           Sera hugs them both tight, impossibly strong, and leaps 
           through the glass and into space.

           The Mailman hammers the detonator.

           EXT. JONES’S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           The top half of the building erupts, bricks and mortar fly 
           everywhere, glass and steel sparks shower down like rain. 

           Ten stories up, Sera SAILS THROUGH THE AIR with Moore and 
           Jones clinging tightly to her.  

                                 SERA
                        Hold on!

           Sera adjusts the ENERGY SHIELD, and it changes shape into a 
           makeshift PARACHUTE!

           They land painfully atop a SPEEDING METRO BUS, safe.  
           As the bus races away, Jones looks back at the fire raging 
           where his peaceful, quiet life used to be.  Where his latest 
           novel just went up in smoke.

           And to where the burnt-but-still-functional Android Mailman 
           stares out at them before rising to his feet.  

           INT. SYNDICATE CREW’S HUMMER - DUSK

           HUNTER sits in the backseat with a very frightened Matheson.  
           They watch the last bit of the explosion drift up into the 
           atmosphere a few blocks away.  

                                 HUNTER
                        That should flush them out.  Now 
                        they’ll make for her ship, and 
                        we’ll be there waiting.
                             (to Kort and Clag)
                        I feel it’s best to be honest about 
                        a few things right now.  

           Kort shifts uncomfortably in the passenger seat.  Clag 
           shivers behind the wheel, looks near death.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        This is the most important thing 
                        either of you will ever do.  The 
                        survival of our way of life and 
                        that of countless future 
                        generations is on our shoulders.

           HUNTER holds the box full of LITHIUM HYDRIDE that O.E.s need 
           to survive on Earth.  Two of the RED ORBS begin to hover.

           One floats to Kort and melds into his body.  He glows with 
           renewed energy.  

                                 CLAG
                        Thank you, Hunter.

           Clag eagerly awaits his dose.  It doesn’t come.  

                                 HUNTER
                        I just don’t feel like I’m getting 
                        the support I need.

           Instead, the orb floats to Hunter who absorbs it with a 
           shudder.  Clag can see what’s about to happen. 

                                 CLAG 
                        Not here.  This planet smells worse 
                        than the laundry room of an 
                        Arcturian brothel.  
           Hunter looks at Clag with contempt.

                                 HUNTER
                        What pathetic last words.

           Clag begins to tremble violently as the Earthsickness wins 
           out.  His skin bubbles and boils grotesquely until finally... 
           he EXPLODES across the interior of the Hummer.  

           The ACIDIC GORE sprays onto Matheson, who finally snaps:

                                 MATHESON
                        Ahhhh!!!  What the fuck?!?  
                        Whatthefuckwhatthefuck!?!?

           Kort and Hunter exchange a look, then burst out laughing.

           EXT. THE GRANADA HOTEL - NIGHT

           The sign sells us on “San Francisco’s top rated retirement 
           community.”  We’ll take their word.  

           Moore, Jones and Sera stand next to Moore’s car.  

                                 JONES
                        Let’s just go to the mall.

                                 MOORE
                        Mall’s closed.

                                 JONES
                        You’re a cop, get a security guard 
                        to let us in.

                                 MOORE
                        Right.  We’ll just say the planet’s 
                        in danger, and the only thing that 
                        can save it is cubic zirconium 
                        which is, in fact, priceless inter-
                        planetary rocket fuel.  Jackass.  

                                 JONES
                        So Plan B: knock off an old folks’ 
                        home?

                                 MOORE
                        There’s someone here who owes me, 
                        and I’m 99% sure he’ll have plenty 
                        of what we need.

           INT. THE GRANADA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Not the happiest place on Earth, but there is a game room.
           That’s where we find ALASTAIR (76).  Good-looking for his 
           age, shades of Burt Lancaster.  Silver hair coiffed like he’s 
           at the country club.  Right now, he’s neck-deep in a poker 
           game that he will not lose.

           His poker-mates are all MISSHAPEN OLD DUDES who probably know 
           they’re being fleeced, but they’re way past caring.  In this 
           place, the house always wins anyway.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Who’s ready to keep it going past 
                        third street?

           A froggy-looking OLD FART with coke-bottle glasses folds.  

                                 OLD FART
                        Aw, cram it, Alastair.  If that 
                        deck isn’t marked, I still have 
                        both my balls.  And unless the left 
                        one’s reproduced, that ain’t so.

           His buddy, entangled in breathing equipment, chimes in.

                                 WHEEZER
                        Yeah, fuckstick! 

           Alastair looks disappointed, but before he can defend himself 
           against the slings and arrows, a NURSE approaches.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        You’re just in time, darlin’, looks 
                        like a seat’s opening up. 

                                 NURSE
                        A policeman’s here to see you.  

           Alastair straightens up.  

                                 ALASTAIR 
                        Gentlemen, I hope you reconsider 
                        your harsh words, and maybe we’ll 
                        resume after my visit.

           He follows the Nurse to the Lobby.

           INT. THE GRANADA HOTEL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Alastair spots Moore.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Detective Moore.

           He surveys Jones and Sera and the weight on their shoulders.  
                                 ALASTAIR (CONT’D)
                        I sense this is not a social call.

           INT. THE GRENADA HOTEL - ALASTAIR’S ROOM - EVENING

           Alastair slides a massive TRUNK out from underneath his bed.  

           He opens it, reveals rows and rows of the tools of his former 
           trade:  gambling paraphernalia, false beards and spirit gum, 
           a wad of counterfeit bills and of course... paste.  Fake 
           jewels of all shapes and sizes.

                                 ALASTAIR
                             (to Sera)
                        What’ll it be, young lady?  I’m 
                        sure that whatever we place around 
                        your neck will never be more than 
                        gild on a perfect lily.

           Sera blushes, but Moore’s seen it before.

                                 MOORE
                        Save the act.  We just need the 
                        stones.

                                 JONES
                        Oh man!  Is that a Svengali deck?

           He grabs a deck of cards and starts playing around with them.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        You have an eye for the trade.

                                 JONES
                        I saw these on Breaking the 
                        Magician’s Code.  Awesome.

           Moore yanks the cards away, dumps them unceremoniously back 
           into the trunk.

                                 MOORE
                        Yeah, it’s awesome getting your 
                        fingers broken so you can’t work to 
                        support your wife and child.  Not 
                        that “work” was ever really part of 
                        the equation, was it Dad?

           At “Dad,” Jones gulps, finally understanding the situation.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        That was a long time ago, Robbie.

           Sera holds up a huge necklace of cubic zirconia.
                                 SERA
                        We can take this?

                                 ALASTAIR
                        You don’t want that junk, darling.  
                        This one brings out your eyes.

           He expertly exchanges the necklace for another, “rubies.”  
           Moore takes it from Sera.    

                                 MOORE
                        We’ll go with the other one.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Which other one?

           Alastair opens his hand.  The cubic zirconia has vanished.

                                 JONES
                        Whoa, that was so cool.  

                                 MOORE
                        Not cool.  Hand it over.  

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Not until you tell me what’s going 
                        on.  Nothing better to do on a 
                        Friday night than shake down an old 
                        grifter?

                                 MOORE
                        You wouldn’t believe it.  I don’t 
                        even believe it.  

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Try me.

                                 MOORE
                        I don’t have time to argue, Dad. 
                        Give me the damn necklace.

                                 JONES
                        He’s right, Mr. Moore, it’s too 
                        complicated to explain now.   

                                 ALASTAIR
                        And who are you again?  

                                 JONES
                        Hardy Jones.  The sci-fi writer.

                                 ALASTAIR
                             (lights up)
                        Oh, Robbie loved that stuff when he 
                        was little.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALASTAIR (CONT'D)
                        What was that TV show you used to 
                        watch?  You remember, you made me 
                        buy the lunchbox with the picture 
                        on the front-- 

                                 MOORE
                        OK, hands on the wall.

           Alastair obliges, the drill is muscle memory at his age.  
           Moore pats him down, searching for the necklace.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        The one in space, with the robots 
                        and the people looking for Earth?

                                 JONES
                             (shock)
                        You watched Battlestar Galactica?!

           Moore averts his eyes.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        That’s the one!  Every Sunday night 
                        this kid!  Like a goddamn religion.  

                                 MOORE
                        That’s funny, I remember someone 
                        pawning the TV.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Yeah, that’s when you created your 
                        own story -- what was that name you 
                        called yourself?  

           Moore comes up empty on his search.

                                 MOORE 
                        Aw, come on.  Where is it?

                                 ALASTAIR
                        If only my memory could be jogged, 
                        I might just remember where that 
                        necklace walked away to.  

           Moore looks to Jones.  Looks to Sera.  Sucks it up.  But his 
           RESPONSE is hushed, unintelligible.

                                 ALASTAIR (CONT’D)
                        What was that?  Altzheimer’s kicks 
                        in like that at my age, we’re 
                        working against the clock.  

                                 MOORE
                             (deep breath)
                        Kaltar... Warrior Prince of Space.
                                 ALASTAIR
                        There it is.

           Jones grins ear to ear.  Moore glares.

                                 MOORE
                        Shut up.

                                 JONES
                        Did I say anything?

           Moore turns, Alastair is already fastening the necklace 
           around Sera’s neck.

                                 ALASTAIR 
                             (to Sera)
                        I was wrong, you look divine.

           Maybe it’s the moonlight hitting the necklace just right... 
           maybe it’s her unearthly warmth, but for the first time, Sera 
           looks elegant.

           Moore and Jones stare just a moment too long, and Alastair 
           breaks the silence.

                                 ALASTAIR (CONT’D)
                        Now you wanna tell me what’s really 
                        going on? 

                                 MOORE
                        I can’t, Dad.

           Alastair stops Moore as they’re heading out the door.  He 
           looks like he wants to say more, but only manages--

                                 ALASTAIR
                        You’re still a warrior, Robbie.  
                        Say hello to your mother.

           EXT. THE GRANADA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Moore walks to the car, tense.  He looks at Jones --

                                 MOORE
                        Are you -- are you crying?

                                 JONES
                        No. 

           Jones dabs his wet cheeks.  

                                 MOORE
                        Unbelievable.
                                 JONES
                        I never knew my father.  It was 
                        just Mom and me growing up.  After 
                        she passed --

                                 MOORE
                             (not in the mood)
                        Get the hell in the car.  

           They get in, Moore driving, Sera and Jones in the back.  

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                             (to Sera re: necklace)
                        So we’re good?  That’ll work?

                                 SERA
                        It’ll have to.  We’re out of time.

           Sera adjusts her wrist-device, makes the standard “picture 
           frame” gesture with her hands.  A SCREEN projects ONTO THE 
           CAR WINDOW.  She resizes it, begins to manipulate the data.

                                 JONES
                        Dude!  You’re a walking M.I.T. lab.  
                        This all goes into the next book.  
                             (remembers it’s gone)
                        If I can reconstruct it.

                                 SERA
                        You will.  Don’t lose hope.  

           A WARNING SENSOR lights up on Sera’s data display.  

                                 SERA (CONT’D)
                        We need to drive faster.  My back-
                        up is almost here. 

                                 MOORE
                        Back up?  That fail-safe thing?  
                        How long?

                                 SERA
                        190 minutes.

                                 JONES
                        Guess you won’t get to see Avatar.

           Moore floors it.  

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - ACCESS ROAD - NIGHT

           The car SPEEDS DOWN A WOODED ACCESS ROAD to a parking area.  
                                 SERA (V.O.)
                        It’s just behind this building.  

           Moore parks, they exit and start towards --

           EXT. THE CONSERVATORY OF FLOWERS - NIGHT

           An enormous, ornate Victorian GREENHOUSE and botanical garden 
           nestled in the woods in a corner of Golden Gate Park.  

           As Sera leads Jones and Moore around the back, she speaks.

                                 SERA
                        We had gardens like this inside the 
                        Orbital Colony.  They were the 
                        closest most of us ever came to 
                        being on a real planet.  It was a 
                        beautiful place but a little sad.

                                 JONES
                             (slightly out of breath)
                        How did you get out?

                                 SERA
                        Just lucky, I guess.

           Her reminiscences are cut short.  They arrive at:

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

           Forklifts and bulldozers ring a DEEP EXCAVATION behind the 
           Conservatory, about half the size of a football field, which 
           will become the basement of a new building.

           The ground is packed earth, scarred by the landing of Sera’s 
           ship: a trench stretches across the site.

           Sera climbs a LADDER down into the excavation.  Moore 
           follows.  Jones awkwardly steps onto the ladder but has a 
           flash of vertigo.  Moore steadies him.  

                                 MOORE
                        Easy there, Speed Racer.

           They continue down.  

           EXT. EXCAVATION SITE - NIGHT

           Sera approaches a massive pile of BUILDING MATERIALS at one 
           end of the trench.  She  holds out her hand, and suddenly...

           The PILE SHIFTS and FRAGMENTS into what looks like several 
           plate-glass windows.  Then, one by one, the windows 
           disappear, as if sucked down a drain.
           The holo-projection is gone, in its place is SERA’S SHIP.

           Sleek, reflective surfaces.  Aerodynamic nose, streamlined 
           cabin pods, and in back, spherical housing for an FTL drive.  
           Moore and Jones react like gearheads at a concept car show.

           Sera approaches the SPHERE, touches its surface.  A round 
           HOLE melts open, reveals the inner workings of the engine.

           There is a central chamber with a spinning core, but it’s 
           glowing a sickly PALE GREEN.  Sera fuses the cubic zirconia 
           INTO THE SPINNING CORE.  After a few minor adjustments, the 
           glow becomes a healthier BRIGHT BLUE.

           Jones walks around the ship in a daze.  Moore watches Sera.  
           Something about a woman working on an engine...

                                 JONES
                        I still don’t get it.  I got too 
                        many details right.  

                                 MOORE
                        Look, there’s an explanation.  
                        Whatever you wrote about, you got 
                        it somewhere. 

                                 JONES
                        No, I don’t think so, man.  It’s 
                        this weird jumble.  All my 
                        characters, they’re just made up, 
                        they don’t really exist.  But the 
                        history, the wars... Sera says 
                        they’re dead on.

                                 MOORE
                        So do the nerds get a happy ending?

           Before Jones can reply, Sera approaches.

                                 SERA
                        It’s done.  With time to spare.

                                 JONES
                        How long do we have?

                                 SERA
                        About two hours.

                                 MOORE
                        Alright, mission accomplished.  Now 
                        where’s this Weapon stashed?

           Sera breathes deep.
                                 SERA
                        It’s better if I show you.

           Moore is cautious.  Jones is excited.  

           Sera takes a new DEVICE from a satchel.  A slim stick with a 
           crystalline tip - it could almost be a magic wand.

           Waves of ELECTRICITY form around the device.  Moore and Jones 
           are MESMERIZED.

           And then...

           JONES’S EYES BEGIN TO GLOW.  He faints, his lips part, and 
           the GLOW EMERGES FROM HIS MOUTH.  

           Suddenly, Jones LEVITATES TWO FEET OFF THE GROUND, tendrils 
           of electricity channel back and forth between Sera’s Device 
           and his head.

           Moore is dumbfounded.  He looks to Sera who is SMILING.  

           Over the sound of the crackling energy -- 

                                 SERA (CONT’D)
                        The Weapon wasn’t stable without a 
                        biological host!

                                 MOORE
                        What’s happening to him?!

                                 SERA
                        He’s waking up.

           As she looks on at her destiny being fulfilled -- 

           FFFTTT! FFFTTT! FFFTTT!

           THREE BOLTS OF LASER FIRE SHOOT SERA THROUGH THE CHEST!

           Sera collapses, wounds smoking.  

           Moore swoops in to catch her.  

           The wand device SHATTERS on the ground.  

           Jones drops from the air, falls on his face.

           Above on the ledge, THE MAILMAN ANDROID, or whatever is left 
           of him, looks down, levels his LASER CARBINE.

           His RED LASER FIRE narrowly misses Moore as he drags Sera and 
           Jones behind the massive landing gear of the ship.
                                 MOORE
                             (to Sera)
                        Stay with me, sweetheart!

                                 JONES
                             (dazed)
                        I’m OK, I’m not going anywhere.    

                                 MOORE
                        Not you.

           Moore pushes Jones out of the way, focused on Sera’s wounds.  

                                 SERA
                        Keep him safe.

                                 MOORE
                        Don’t talk.

                                 JONES
                        What is she saying?  What - What 
                        happened to me?

                                 SERA
                             (locks eyes with Jones)
                        You’re -- 
                             (struggles)
                        It’s not just a story anymore.

           Sera fades.  Jones just stares.  Moore fruitlessly tries CPR.

                                 MOORE
                        No, goddammit.   

                                 JONES
                        What did she mean?  Not a story 
                        anymore?

                                 MOORE
                        It’s you.

                                 JONES
                        It’s me?

           Moore finally gives up on Sera, devastated but professional.

                                 MOORE
                        You’re the Weapon.  You’re who they 
                        were guarding.  Your mailman, your 
                        neighbor the cab driver.  Her.  Who 
                        knows who else in your life.

                                 JONES
                        I’m the--?  I’ve never even been in 
                        a fight.  People in my life?
                                 MOORE
                        Keeping you safe.     

                                 JONES
                        I can’t be the Weapon.

           The Mailman drops down into the excavation site.

           Moore reacts, assesses the situation.  He grabs Sera’s 
           bracelet and slides it onto his wrist, the copper instantly 
           MORPHS TO FIT HIS ARM.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 MOORE
                        Guarding your ass.

           Moore steps out to face the Mailman, raises the bracelet--

           And nearly knocks himself out as the released ENERGY SHIELD 
           smacks him in the face.  He stumbles, dazed from the hit.  
           Sera made this look so easy.  

           The Mailman takes aim.  Moore recovers, blocks the laser 
           blasts just before they strike Jones.   

           Using an Anti-Grav Pack, the Mailman flies over them, lands 
           on the other side.  Moore adjusts, keeps the shield up.  

           The Mailman bounds around, firing.  Moore weaves, waving the 
           shield.  It’s not pretty, but he defends their position.  

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Do something?!

                                 JONES
                        What do you want me to do?!

                                 MOORE
                        Use your damn... powers!

                                 JONES
                        I don’t have any powers!

                                 MOORE
                        You picked a hell of a time to stop 
                        believing in magic!  

           Moore charges, hits the Mailman like he’s tackling a 
           quarterback.  But the Mailman catches him...

           ...and LIFTS MOORE OFF THE GROUND.  It looks like he’s about 
           to deliver a suplex.  
           At the last second, Moore blindly SMACKS THE CONTROLS ON THE 
           ANTI-GRAV PACK.

           The Mailman, with Moore hanging on for dear life, TAKES OFF 
           like a comet.  His AGP is out of control.     

           EXT. THE CONSERVATORY OF FLOWERS - CONTINUOUS

           THE MAILMAN AND MOORE fly through the air towards the 
           beautiful white greenhouse.  They’re heading straight for the 
           60-foot-high dome made of thousands of window-panes.  

           Gaining speed, they SMASH INTO THE GREENHOUSE!

           INT. THE CONSERVATORY OF FLOWERS - CONTINUOUS

           They continue to soar right through the massive building, 
           CRASHING into huge displays of FLOWERS and SPLASHING into man-
           made ponds full of exotic AQUATIC PLANTS until...

           EXT. THE CONSERVATORY OF FLOWERS - CONTINUOUS

           They SMASH OUT THROUGH THE ROOF, shattering hundreds of 
           windows as they ascend.

           For a moment, they’re airborne, but it’s a quick trip.  They 
           COLLIDE with a massive palm tree and hit the ground, followed 
           by a downpour of heavy PALM FRONDS.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Jones looks down at SERA’S BODY, pleading with her ghost.

                                 JONES
                        I don’t know what to do.  You need 
                        to tell me.

           Hunter and Kort suddenly appear above on the ledge.  Jones 
           withdraws, hides behind the ship as Hunter and Kort drop.

           Hunter approaches Sera, nudges her with his boot.

                                 HUNTER
                        Such a waste.

                                 KORT
                             (creepy)
                        Take a skin sample, we can make a 
                        clone that looks just like her.
                                 HUNTER
                        Could you please just focus on 
                        obtaining the most powerful weapon 
                        in the universe?  Please?

                                 KORT
                        Fine, but it’s a long trip back.  
                        I’m just saying.

           Hunter turns his attention to Jones.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Care to come out?  Or shall we come 
                        get you?

           Jones holds his breath.  Clenches his fists.  Attempts to 
           activate anything...

                                 JONES
                             (hushed)
                        C’mon.  Stupid.  Do something.  

           Kort rounds the corner.  Jones reacts, leaps out SCREAMING, 
           does an impressive Street Fighter “Hadouken!”... to no 
           effect.  Clearly this is not how he activates his powers.  

           Hunter gives Kort a nod, and the large man SUCKER-PUNCHES 
           Jones in the face.  And Jones goes down for the count.  

           EXT. CONSERVATORY OF FLOWERS - NIGHT

           Moore stirs next to the shell of The Mailman who now looks 
           more like C3PO’s broken and battered grandpa than the 
           friendly paternal man we met at Jones’s apartment.

           Moore pulls himself to his feet, runs back for Jones--

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Moore arrives in time to see Kort loading Jones into the 
           black Hummer.  Hunter stands with Matheson, who looks like he 
           just got out of a prison brawl. 

                                 MOORE
                        Jesus, Matty!

                                 HUNTER
                        Stay where you are, Detective.  
                        We’ll be leaving shortly, and I can 
                        guarantee you, we’ll never be back.    
                        If you follow us, this nice police-
                        man will have his neck snapped.
           And with that, Kort starts the engine and they speed off.  
           Moore is left standing in the road, huffing and puffing.  

                                 MOORE
                        Goddammit!

           In minutes, he’s lost the only thing he needed to protect.  
           He looks down at Sera, lying dead.  His partner is probably 
           next.  Loses it.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        AGGGHHH!!!!!

           He sucks back a breath, warding off despair with every ounce 
           of energy he has left.

           Then a moment of calm.  Something hits him.  He takes on a 
           look of resolve as an idea forms.  He runs back to the 
           Conservatory punching a number into his CELL PHONE.  

           INT. LASER BEANS - NIGHT

           LEWIS is busy macking on a couple of COSPLAY GIRLS.  He wears 
           a shirt that says, “The Password is JOSHUA.”

                                 LEWIS
                        What do you think?

           He shows a temporary tattoo of the Zelda Triforce on his arm.

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        Or...?

           Shows a temporary Thundercats logo on the other arm.  

                                 SAILOR MOON GIRL
                        Zelda, definitely.  

                                 FINAL FANTASY GIRL 
                        I don’t know, Thundercats are sexy.

           Lewis’s ringtone starts - it’s the FIREFLY theme.  He lets it 
           play, singing along, lovin’ it, then answers.  

                                 LEWIS 
                             (into phone)
                        Moshi-moshi.

           INTERCUT - EXT. CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

           Moore stands over the remains of the Mailman android.

                                 MOORE
                        Lewis?    
                                 LEWIS
                        Yeah?

                                 MOORE
                        Lewis, it’s Detective Moore.  I was 
                        there with Jones?

                                 LEWIS
                        Ah, Detective, how can you be of 
                        service to me?

           Lewis hams it up for the ladies.

                                 MOORE
                        Give it a rest, I need your help.  

                                 LEWIS
                        I’m kind of in the middle of 
                        something.  A blonde and a brunette 
                        something if you take my meaning.

                                 MOORE
                        Look Lewis?  I’m sure whatever 
                        creepy adolescent fantasy you’re 
                        fulfilling may seem important, but 
                        Jones is in serious trouble and I 
                        need to reprogram an android.

                                 LEWIS
                        Cell phones, Moore?  Call customer 
                        service. 

                                 MOORE
                        Not a cell phone!  An actual honest-
                        to-god space robot!  And we’ve got 
                        about 45 minutes to save the planet 
                        from an even bigger space robot! 

           ON LEWIS as his eyes light up.  He’s waited a lifetime for 
           just this call.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Lewis?

           INTERCUT - INT. LASER BEANS - LEWIS’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Lewis drops in front of his workstation.  He’s amped but 
           freaked out, convinced of how important this is.  

           ANDROID SCHEMATICS, fictional and not, filter through on 
           Lewis’s monitor array.
                                 LEWIS
                        OK, I’m cross-referencing every 
                        publication on androids since the 
                        first US patent in 1863.  If I’m 
                        going to find any kind of match, I 
                        need the exact details of what 
                        you’re looking at.

           Moore scans the dead man’s chest, torn open and robotic, but 
           oozing with biomass.

                                 MOORE
                        I got wires, microchips and sludge. 

                                 LEWIS
                        Microchips or microprocessors?

                                 MOORE
                        Are you kidding me right now?

                                 LEWIS
                             (rolls his eyes)
                        Is there anything that looks like a 
                        display driver amplifier?

                                 MOORE 
                        How the fuck should I know?!?

           Lewis types wildly.

                                 LEWIS 
                        I can’t believe your phone doesn’t 
                        have video.  I can’t work under 
                        these conditions.

                                 MOORE
                        Lewis!  No time.

                                 LEWIS
                        OK.  Don’t panic.  
                             (laughs to himself)
                        Is there a diaphragm?  Like a 
                        fleshy partition dividing the upper 
                        and lower torso? 

           Moore spots it, a gooey mess.  

                                 MOORE
                        I see it.

                                 LEWIS
                        OK, I need you to plunge your hand 
                        through the diaphragm, down into 
                        the stomach cavity.
                                 MOORE
                        Reach inside?

                                 LEWIS
                        Yeah, reach inside, Braveheart.  
                        You should feel something like a 
                        gas cap underneath it.

           Moore touches the gooey diaphragm, pushes his hand in.  It 
           looks and sounds disgusting and, judging from Moore’s pained 
           expression, must feel and smell even worse.

           He pulls his hand away, gagging.

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        You got it?

                                 MOORE
                        Hold on.

           Taking a deep breath, Moore gives it another go and pushes 
           his hand all the way inside the Mailman’s stomach cavity.  

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        I got nothing.

                                 LEWIS
                        One sec.

           His fingers are a flurry on the keys.

                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        OK, the reset switch is probably 
                        deeper.  Between the hip bones.

                                 MOORE
                        This is the only way to reach it?

                                 LEWIS
                        The least homoerotic.  Up to you.  

           Moore steels himself, pushes in further, nearly up to his 
           shoulder inside the Mailman’s midsection.  

                                 MOORE 
                        I got it!  

           Moore does, he turns the cap with a loud CRUNCH.

                                 LEWIS
                        OK, just don’t turn the cap.

                                 MOORE
                        What?!!  I turned the cap!!
                                 LEWIS
                        Oh shit.

                                 MOORE
                        Shit, shit what?

                                 LEWIS
                        Clockwise or counterclockwise?! 

                                 MOORE
                        Lewis, I swear to god--

                                 LEWIS
                        Alright, alright wait!  Let me 
                        think.

           Beat.  Lewis starts to sweat.

                                 MOORE
                        Any time Lewis.  Fate of the 
                        universe, man.

           Lewis deliberates.  This is the most important decision he’s 
           ever made, he cannot be wrong.    

                                 LEWIS
                        OK, try this--

           ONLY ON MOORE as he digests what Lewis is saying. 

                                 MOORE
                        Uh-huh... yeah... OK.

           Moore PUNCHES THE MAILMAN IN THE FACE as hard as he can.  The 
           Android lights up, snaps back to life --

                                 MAILMAN
                             (where he left off)
                        The Weapon will stay hidden!  
                        You’ll never find it!! 

                                 MOORE
                        Uh... they found it.  Him.  And 
                        they’ve got him.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Oh dear.

                                 LEWIS
                             (in phone)
                        How’d we do?

                                 MOORE
                        Nice work, Lewis.
           INT. LASER BEANS - LEWIS’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Lewis leans back in his chair, breathes easier.  He looks up 
           at a huge poster of LANDO CALRISSIAN, smiles ear to ear.  

                                 LEWIS
                        We’re heroes.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Mailman, moving with jerks and twitches, examines Sera.

                                 MOORE
                        Can we do anything?

                                 THE MAILMAN
                             (shaking his head)
                        We can only do what she wanted to 
                        do.  Keep them from taking Jones.

           Moore is pissed, checks his gun, empty. 

                                 MOORE
                        Well unless you can shoot lasers 
                        out of your ass, this is gonna be a 
                        short fight.

           Moore’s cell phone RINGS.  The I.D. says it’s his boss 
           CAPTAIN KELLY.  He debates, finally picks up.    

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Moore.

           The Mailman respectfully takes Sera’s body to her ship.  

                                 CAPTAIN (PHONE)
                        Moore?  Where the hell are you?  
                        I’ve got Homeland chewing my ass-- 

                                 MOORE
                        Listen, Captain, I--

           The Mailman places a hand on the hull of Sera’s ship, and an 
           ENTRYWAY melts open, revealing --

           A HIDDEN CACHE of ALIEN WEAPONS.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        --I’m gonna have to call you back.

                                 CAPTAIN (PHONE)
                        Moore--?
           Moore hangs up, evaluates the arsenal as the Mailman sets 
           Sera’s body in some kind of DEEP-FREEZE storage compartment.   

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        The men that have Jones - the 
                        Syndicate recruited them from the 
                        prison worlds in the Eridanus 
                        Supervoid.  They’re the most 
                        vicious killers in the system.

                                 MOORE 
                        Well, let’s see ‘em try to stop a 
                        kid from the Mission District.

           Quick cuts:

           - Moore pulls on a CHEST PLATE made of SMART MATERIAL - it 
           molds itself to the shape of his upper body.

           - He straps crystalline SHIELD GENERATORS to his arms.  POWER 
           courses through them as they lock into place.

           - He stows something that looks like the bladeless HILT OF A 
           SWORD into a holster.

           - He grabs the biggest, baddest GUN you or your father have 
           ever seen.

           - He locks and loads, and the gigantic gun HUMS TO LIFE.

           The Mailman tilts his head, takes in the new Moore: bad-ass, 
           well-armed... but wouldn’t be out of place at Comic-Con.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        This better not end up on the 
                        internet. 

           INT. HUMMER - MOVING

           Jones is zip-tied in the rear storage compartment.  

                                 KORT
                        Keep him whole or slice him up?

           In the rear, Jones’s EYES ARE OPEN.  He stares at the TRUNK 
           LATCH, desperately trying to think of an escape route.

                                 HUNTER (O.S.)
                        The Weapon is an integral part of 
                        him.  Functionality might be 
                        compromised if we try to remove it.

                                 KORT (O.S.)
                        Say the word, I start cutting.  
           Jones FOCUSES ON THE LATCH - can he use the Force?  He 
           focuses his thoughts... strains his face... Nope.

                                 HUNTER
                        Leave it to the surgeons.  With 
                        this power, the Syndicate can 
                        destroy worlds, even create new 
                        ones.  It can’t arrive damaged.

           Jones’s wheels turn furiously, but he can’t crack the code.

           Battered and bruised, Matheson makes an attempt at reason.  

                                 MATHESON
                        You look like smart guys.  Why 
                        don’t you just pull the car over 
                        and turn yourselves in before this 
                        gets any worse for you?   

           Hunter locks eyes with him, his features DISTORT.  We are 
           reminded that these bad guys are not human.  

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        No?  OK.  

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The Hummer speeds North over the bridge.

           EXT. SKY OVER GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Above the bridge towers, a RIPPLE.  Sera’s SHIP FLICKERS IN 
           AND OUT OF VIEW, its cloaking device obviously damaged. 
           Still, it moves with incredible speed, tracking the Hummer.

           INT. SERA’S SHIP - NIGHT

           The Mailman pilots.  Moore is crammed in the seat behind him.  

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        My motor skills are compromised, 
                        I’m losing mobility.  I have to 
                        turn on the ship’s A.I.

           He inserts a finger into a socket, and the shipboard 
           ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT COMPUTER activates.  

           AN ANGRY GARBLED ALIEN LANGUAGE can be heard from a speaker, 
           but it quickly scrambles and switches to English.

                                 A.I.
                        -- and I have never been so 
                        humiliated in all my life!
                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Don’t put this on me.

                                 A.I.
                        What are you gonna do, Tin Man?

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        I’m going to ignore you until 
                        you’re in a better mood.

                                 MOORE
                        You guys need a time-out?  Just 
                        follow the goddamn car!  

                                 A.I.
                        Who’s the meat-bucket?

           Before Moore can answer, the surviving SHI’AR CAT from 
           earlier suddenly manifests aboard the ship, scares the shit 
           out of Moore, even in its small form.

                                 MOORE
                        We got a problem.

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Stay calm.  The Shi’Ar is inter-
                        dimensional.  Sometimes she pops 
                        up.  Unexpectedly.  

           The cat hops onto Moore’s lap.  He’s frozen with fear, but 
           the cat just curls up and snuggles.  

                                 THE MAILMAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, you’re off the menu.

           Moore assess the situation: he’s on a neurotic spaceship with 
           a broken robot and a carnivorous alien kitten.

                                 MOORE
                        Lucky me.

           EXT. MARIN HEADLANDS - NIGHT

           The Hummer winds down Bunker Road, wrapping around an 
           enormous lagoon.  San Francisco lights in the distance.  

           EXT. SHORES OF RODEO LAGOON - NIGHT

           The Hummer slides to a stop at the muddy edge of the lagoon.  
           The night is quiet.  Brown PELICANS float among the pondweed. 

           Hunter exits, configures a remote control DISPLAY that 
           appears on the forearm of his Bionic Arm.  Kort opens the 
           back of the Hummer, drags Jones to his feet.     
                                 JONES
                        You guys are gonna be in seriously 
                        deep shit as soon as I figure 
                        myself out.
                             (spots something)
                        Oh.  My.  Spaghetti monster.

           The LAGOON BUBBLES as one MASSIVE METALLIC GUN TURRET, then 
           ANOTHER, and ANOTHER rise up out of the water.

           In moments, HUNTER’S ENTIRE SHIP is visible.  If Sera’s was a 
           Corvette, this is a Mack Truck.  A well-armed Mack Truck.   

           The ship DESCENDS and comes to rest in the empty parking lot 
           next to the Marin Headlands Visitor Center.

           Hunter heads for the ship with Jones.

                                 KORT
                             (re: Matheson)
                        What about him?

                                 HUNTER
                        All yours.

           Kort smiles.  Matheson panics.  

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           Hunter starts his pre-flight.  Jones can’t help but be  
           intrigued by his surroundings.

           Hunter drops in front of the ships controls, which conform to 
           his presence, shifting and retracting as he needs them.    

                                 JONES 
                        Damn, the bad guys always get the 
                        best tech.
                             (to Hunter)
                        So do you fly us home, or is there 
                        an A.I.?
                             (gets no answer)
                        I’m just fact-checking.  I wrote 
                        that organics need to be put into 
                        hypersleep before a ship hits light-
                        speed.  If that’s the case, you 
                        should know I get an awful reaction 
                        to sleeping pills.  Just a heads 
                        up, ‘cause I’m pretty sure you do 
                        not want to be in zero-G with 
                        projectile vomit floating around. 

           Hunter ignores him, activates a communication station.  
           A high-resolution HOLOGRAM appears of a conference table, 
           around which sit the SYNDICATE OLIGARCHY, an obviously nasty 
           bunch.  They speak in AZILARI, subtitled.

                                 SILVER-HAIRED OLIGARCH (HOLOGRAM)
                        Do you have news for us?

                                 HUNTER
                        The Confed Guardians are dead, and 
                        the Weapon has been recovered.

                                 FOXY FEMALE OLIGARCH(HOLOGRAM)
                        And its condition?

           Jones leans into view, waves hello with his bound hands.    

                                 JONES
                             (in English)
                        Oh my god, you guys are the 
                        Syndicate Oligarchy!  I can’t 
                        believe you evil bastards are real!  
                        How many of you guys still live in 
                        your original bodies?

           Hunter pushes him away.  

                                 HUNTER
                             (subtitled)
                        The Weapon is intact.  For now.  
                        But the fail-safe is on its way, we 
                        must leave immediately.

                                 FREAKISHLY PALE OLIGARCH (HOLOGRAM)
                             (subtitled)
                        You have made us proud, Hunter.  To 
                        think the new hero of the Syndicate 
                        was born in a Confed colony.  Send 
                        a communique when you come out of 
                        hypersleep.

           The hologram disappears.  Jones reappraises Hunter.

                                 JONES
                        You’re a Confed?  
                             (no response)
                        Let me guess.  Your parents were 
                        Aggies... glass farmers?  Probably 
                        kept you out of school, simple 
                        economics there.  But one night in 
                        a bar, a Syndicate Believer talks 
                        to you.  You’re so desperate to get 
                        off the farm, you don’t even care 
                        if it’s all propaganda.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JONES (CONT'D)
                        Before you know it, you’re helping 
                        the local rebels take out a Confed 
                        councilman.  A botched job or a 
                        snitch lands you in jail.  Some 
                        nasty shithole like the Supervoid 
                        prisons.  That’s where you have no 
                        choice but to stick with your 
                        Syndie buddies.  Maybe you were 
                        even the toughest one in there.  
                        And when you got out, they gave you 
                        a mission.  The most important one 
                        they had.  But you’re still just a 
                        kid from a glass farm who didn’t 
                        want to harvest crops like his dad.     

           Hunter finally snaps.

           He SLAMS HIS BIONIC FIST INTO JONES’S STOMACH.  Jones doubles 
           over, more than the wind knocked out of him.

                                 HUNTER
                        This ends with you dead.  You’re 
                        nothing but the sheath for a blade, 
                        the holster for a gun.  The Weapon 
                        will be ripped from your insides. 
                        And then I will personally see to 
                        it that this, your disgusting 
                        Earth, is taken apart atom by atom.  
                        The Syndicate will strip it clean, 
                        sell half the population as slave 
                        labor and bring the other half back 
                        to O.E. as fertilizer.  

           Jones struggles on the floor, desperate to keep breathing, to 
           buy time until something tells him what to do.

           EXT. HUNTER’S SHIP/VISITOR CENTER - NIGHT

           Kort has Matheson propped against the wall of the Visitor 
           Center, and proceeds to play William Tell with him.

                                 MATHESON
                        Oh god.  Miss.  Miss.  Miss.

           Matheson jumps as each blast SPLINTERS THE WALL next to his 
           head.  Kort smiles, takes aim for a kill shot--

                                 MOORE (O.S.)
                        Turn around nice and easy, Dolph 
                        Lungren.

           Kort freezes, turns, and LAUGHS at the sight of Moore in his 
           ridiculous warrior get-up, the giant cannon in his hands.
                                 KORT
                        What are you supposed to be?

                                 MOORE
                        I’m the guy who’s about to kick 
                        your ass.  

           Kort CRACKS his neckbones and gets ready for a fight.

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           On a monitor, Hunter notices Moore’s arrival.  

                                 HUNTER
                        I’ve had enough of your friend.  

           He moves to the rear hold, touches a panel.  THREE CHAMBERS 
           OPEN, their doors splitting and disappearing into the wall.

           Inside are THREE COPIES OF SATISHA.  They emerge from their 
           pods and stretch.  They’re armed to the teeth.

           EXT. HUNTER’S SHIP/VISITOR CENTER - NIGHT

           Moore closes in on Kort, cocky.

                                 MOORE
                        If you put the gun down, I can 
                        still just arrest you.

           Kort doesn’t fret, his grin grows wider as the THREE SATISHAS 
           silently drop down from Hunter’s ship one by one.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        What, no police brutality where 
                        you’re from?

           Moore finally gets that feeling, like someone is behind him.  
           He turns, finds he’s surrounded by three gorgeous killers. 

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Ladies.

           Moore fires his HUGE GUN, an explosive particle beam that 
           nearly fries the three Satishas as they tumble to safety. 

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                             (admiring his new gun)
                        Not bad.  

           The clones ATTACK like they’ve been taking gymnastics class.  
           As Moore BLASTS AWAY, one of them FLIPS THROUGH THE AIR, 
           lands in front of him and RIPS THE GUN AWAY.
           Moore backs up, tries to activate his defensive shields, but 
           the alien tech is too complicated.  He gets them working JUST 
           IN TIME as laser fire SPRAYS ALL AROUND.

           Desperate, he pulls the bladeless SWORD HILT out of its 
           holster.  Unsure, he GRIPS it, activates it--

           And a six-inch ENERGY BLADE emerges.  A pussified, way-too-
           small version of a light saber.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Oh come on!  

           The Satishas produce their own weapons, SONIC WHIPS.  Each 
           snap ripples the air with a THUNDEROUS CRACK, the energy 
           burst knocking Moore back.

           He tries to block with the tiny sword, but it’s useless.

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           Jones watches a monitor helplessly as Moore loses ground.

           EXT. HUNTER’S SHIP/VISITOR CENTER - NIGHT

           A WHIP-SNAP knocks the energy dagger out of Moore’s hands.  
           The deactivated hilt lands at Matheson’s feet.

           Moore turns as the three Satishas circle him.

                                 MOORE
                        Look, how about we call it a draw 
                        and the three of you come back to 
                        my houseboat, enjoy a few 
                        margaritas, and we make some 
                        memories?

           A whip cracks dangerously close to him.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        OK, how about just two of you?   

           Just as one of the lethal women gets the drop on Moore, she 
           is BATTED AWAY by the MASSIVE PAW of the Shi’Ar Cat!  

           The Creature, now in full-on giant lion form, leaps into 
           sight and quickly turns the tide, distracting the clones.  

           Moore reacts, dives for a dropped sonic whip.

           Kort responds, raises his gun.  But Matheson makes a move 
           too, quickly scoops up Moore’s fallen sword hilt--

           And plunges THE GLOWING DAGGER INTO KORT’S BELLY.
                                 MATHESON
                        AHHHHHH!!!!!

           Matheson CARVES KORT UP LIKE A TURKEY.  The hulking bad guy 
           VOMITS ACID BILE as his entrails burn through his armor. 

                                 MOORE
                        You OK?

                                 MATHESON
                        Go.  Get Jones.  

           Moore races aboard the ship as Matheson watches the two 
           remaining Satishas get menaced by the giant Shi’Ar cat.   

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           Hunter finishes his PRE-FLIGHT, and grabs Jones.  He drags 
           him into the rear hold and jams him into a HYPERSLEEP POD.  

           HARNESSES automatically strap Jones’s head and body in place.  

                                 JONES
                        So that’s a yes on the hypersleep?

                                 HUNTER
                        And you’re never waking up.

           Hunter ACTIVATES THE POD.  The doors CLOSE.  

           Through the portal glass, we see TWO NEEDLES emerge and 
           PIERCE JONES’S NECK.  In seconds, he’s UNCONSCIOUS.

           PAN OVER TO DISPLAY SCREEN.  A shot of THE NIGHT SKY... 
           overlaid with rapidly changing ALIEN SYMBOLS that begin to 
           look frighteningly like a COUNTDOWN.  PUSH IN AND CUT TO:

           EXT. THE SKY OVER HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           We push higher and higher, into SPACE.  SOMETHING IS COMING.

           Speeding toward Earth is a GIGANTIC SLEEK SILVER MISSILE 
           DRONE.  An ICBM’s interstellar big brother.  Not good.

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           Moore sneaks on board.  He speaks quietly into his headset.

                                 MOORE
                        Which way?

           INTERCUT - INT. SERA’S SHIP - NIGHT
           The Mailman Android, too damaged to join the fight, is 
           running navigation, scanning schematics of Hunter’s ship.

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Keep going straight.  Turn left.  

                                 MOORE
                        Is he alive?

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        My scan says yes.

                                 MOORE
                        How much time -- ?    

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Just find him.  When you do, he’s 
                        got to complete his activation. 

                                 MOORE
                        How the hell does that work?  

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        There’s no manual.  He just needs a 
                        moment of self-awareness, and he 
                        should know what to do.  

                                 MOORE
                        How close am I?

                                 THE MAILMAN
                        Jones should be just--

           A flood of static and feedback cuts in.  Moore winces, 
           ditches the headset.   

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           Hunter turns from the terminal that is JAMMING Moore’s 
           signal.  His BIONIC ARM POWERING UP.  

           INT. HYPERSLEEP POD - NIGHT

           Jones sleeps soundly. We FLASH TO IMAGES OF JONES’S PAST:

           - Jones (age 10) with his MOM (30s, vital, nurturing).  She 
           gives him a TELESCOPE.

           - Mom watching Jones as he plays Nintendo.

           - His mom’s funeral, Jones (17) looking sad and scared.

           - Jones writing in a college dorm room while everyone else 
           parties downstairs.
           - An adult Jones still writing with even more passion.

           - The vivid covers of the O.E. books.

           - The recent moment where Sera ACTIVATES him, as glowing 
           energy spews from his eyes and mouth.

           - Sera saying something in Azilari, Jones responding.

           - Jones’s Mother smiling.

           CLOSE ON JONES’S FACE.

                                 JONES
                        You said “we.”

                                 SERA (O.S.)
                        Yes.  You knew.

                                 JONES
                        No!  I didn’t know.  We’re from 
                        Omicron?

                                 SERA (O.S.)
                        Yes, Jones.  You and I.  Your 
                        Mother.  She was a Guardian like 
                        me.  We are from Omicron Eridani.  

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - NIGHT

           Moore finally sees the Hypersleep chamber ahead.  But then --

           Hunter appears in his way.  Moore cracks the whip, but Hunter 
           grabs it with his Bionic Arm, effortlessly tugs it free and 
           starts RUNNING RIGHT AT MOORE.

           Moore quickdraws a BLASTER holstered on his thigh.  But 
           Hunter is faster, already at CLOSE QUARTERS, and the bionic 
           fist SMACKS THE BLASTER AWAY.

           Out of weapons, Moore relies on side-steps, head-fakes and 
           spins, street-ball style.  He gets around Hunter, bolts.

           Moore dashes into the sleep chamber, slaps the door controls, 
           and the panels slam shut.  He SMASHES THE CONTROLS WITH HIS 
           ELBOW, hopefully securing his escape.  Hunter seethes.

           Moore looks in from the other side of the glass portal, grins 
           victoriously at Hunter before he disappears.  

           Enraged, Hunter sledgehammers the door with his bionic fist.  
           INT. JONES’S DREAMSCAPE - NIGHT

           Jones continues to talk with Sera in his hypersleep dream.  
           She appears in a white, flowing robe.

                                 SERA
                        You were conceived on the Ring 
                        Colony Aggrandis by your mother and 
                        father, both scientists for the 
                        Confed.  When they invented the 
                        Weapon, they thought they were 
                        ending hunger, poverty, disease.  
                        Curing their race of its weaknesses 
                        forever.  But the invention was 
                        weaponized, turned into an 
                        unstoppable force of destruction.  
                        And so they hid it.  In you.  An 
                        organic hiding place for the most 
                        fearsome weapon in existence.

                                 JONES 
                        That’s not me.  I grew up here. 

                                 SERA
                        Your memory has been closed off.  
                        Only bleeding out from time to 
                        time.  Your stories?  Your books?  
                        They’re a blend of your memories 
                        and your dreams.  It’s you.

                                 JONES
                        But I’ve spent my life just hiding.

                                 SERA
                        Not hiding.  Becoming.  Your 
                        journey - every moment you felt out 
                        of place, every night you retreated 
                        into your imagination.  It all had 
                        a purpose.

           INT. HYPERSLEEP POD - NIGHT

           Moore struggles to open the hypersleep pod, finally wins.  
           But Jones is out cold.  Moore shakes him.

                                 MOORE
                        Wake up!  Jones!    
                             (whistles)
                        Hey!  C’mon, man, wake up!

           Moore starts slapping him, hard, nothing works.
           INT. JONES’S DREAMSCAPE - NIGHT

           Jones’s dream self stares at his hands.  

                                 JONES
                        I feel it.  It’s there.  I have to 
                        wake up.

                                 SERA
                        Yes.

                                 JONES
                        How --?

           She reels back and SLAPS JONES HARD! --

           INT. HYPERSLEEP CHAMBER - NIGHT

           --Moore’s hand slaps Jones hard.  Jones’s eyes fly open.  He 
           grimaces in pain.  

           Moore lights up, happy to see him.  But Hunter’s fist pounds 
           away, the steel doors dent in, dangerously close to failing.

                                 MOORE
                        C’mon, Sleeping Beauty.

           Jones is still dazed as Moore lifts him out of the chamber 
           and sets him on his feet.  

           Jones immediately collapses, as if he suddenly has no bones.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Get up!

                                 JONES
                        I can’t.  The hypersleep drugs 
                        haven’t worn off.  What are you 
                        wearing?

           CRACK!!!  The steel doors give way and Hunter pushes in.  

           Moore readies to fight.  Hunter has had enough playing 
           around, he raises his hand like it’s a cannon --

           And FIRES A PLASMA BEAM at Moore!!!

           Moore narrowly dodges, slams onto the floor beside Jones.   

                                 MOORE
                        What the fuck was that?!
                                 JONES
                        He probably has... a plasma 
                        accelerator in his prosthesis.

                                 MOORE
                        How about a heads up next time?

           Hunter is on him.  He grabs Moore and SLAMS him into a wall.   

           Jones eyes his useless legs... but THEN HE WIGGLES A TOE.

           Moore groans in pain as Hunter slams him into another wall.  

           Jones drags himself across the floor, half awake.  

           Moore punches Hunter, who takes it, gives it back harder.  
           Moore is losing this fight quickly.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Had enough..?

           Hunter is having fun now, bloodies Moore’s other nostril.  

           Jones pulls himself toward Hunter, almost there.  Moore spots 
           him.  Gets the plan.

                                 HUNTER
                        How many hits do you think it’ll 
                        take to crack your skull?

                                 MOORE
                             (battered and broken)
                        I don’t know, I’m not big on math.

                                 HUNTER
                        Let’s find out.  

                                 MOORE
                        Why don’t you sleep on it.

           Jones pulls himself to his hands and knees, and Moore shoves 
           Hunter, knocking him over Jones, and into a hypersleep pod.

           Jones hits the controls and the harnesses SECURE Hunter.

                                 HUNTER
                        NO!!!!

           His yell is cut short as the door of the pod slams shut, and 
           the needle injections PUT HIM TO SLEEP.   

                                 MOORE
                        Frozen in carbonite.
                                 JONES
                             (double-take)
                        You have seen it!

                                 MOORE
                        Of course I’ve seen it.  

           For just a moment, the cold adult exterior cracks, and Moore 
           is the kid that still believes.  He sends a brotherly punch 
           into Jones’s arm.

                                 JONES
                        Ow!

           But before they can relax - an ALARM BLARES out. 

                                 MOORE
                        Tell me that’s a good alarm.

                                 JONES
                        I don’t think they have those.  
                        That’s why they’re called “alarms.”

           He pushes toward the ship’s bridge.  Moore runs after him.

           INT. HUNTER’S SHIP - BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Jones plops into the captain’s chair and the controls morph 
           to adapt to him.  (This is the real, much more bad-ass 
           version of Jones’s dorky “About the Author” photo.)

                                 JONES
                        Cool.

           He makes some adjustments and a display illuminates, showing 
           the FAIL-SAFE MISSILE DRONE BURNING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. 

                                 MOORE
                        Is that --?

                                 JONES
                        The Fail-Safe Drone.

                                 MOORE
                        No problem.  We’ll just tell it to 
                        stop, everything’s OK now.

           Moore slaps Jones on the back, confident.  Jones isn’t sure.

           EXT. HUNTER’S SHIP/VISITOR CENTER - NIGHT

           Moore steps from the ship.  Sees the Shi’Ar snacking on the 
           remains of the Satishas.  Matheson gestures all is good.   
           The MAILMAN waves from inside the cockpit of Sera’s ship.

           Jones emerges, stands by Moore’s side.  They look to the SKY.

           The FAIL-SAFE MISSILE DRONE is heading right for them, but 
           somehow it’s SLOWING DOWN.

                                 MOORE
                        I think it knows you’re safe. 

           As if to answer, the Drone starts to HOVER above them and 
           emits an array of SCANNING LASERS over the lagoon.

                                 JONES
                        Maybe.

           THEN IT TRANSFORMS - expanding PANEL AFTER PANEL, APPENDAGE 
           AFTER APPENDAGE until it’s an ENORMOUS INTIMIDATING DEATH 
           MACHINE with METALLIC TENDRILS, GUN TURRETS, and the MOTHER 
           OF ALL DEATH RAYS right in the center.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        Maybe not.

           It TEARS ACROSS THE LAGOON, TENDRILS picking up and tossing 
           aside BOAT AFTER BOAT.  The air becomes a blur of LASER FIRE.

           Moore and Jones run for higher ground to a hill overlooking 
           the Lagoon and the mile-long Golden Gate Recreation Complex.

           The Drone hovers menacingly...then the DEATH RAY activates -- 
           VAPORIZES SEVERAL BUILDINGS AND ALL THE WATER IN THE LAGOON.

                                 MOORE
                        Holy shit!  Stop it!  

                                 JONES
                        OK... here it goes!

           Jones looks at his hands.  Strains his mind.

                                 JONES (CONT’D)
                        I have no idea what the hell I’m 
                        doing!

                                 MOORE
                        You’re the Weapon!  Be the goddamn 
                        Weapon!

           The DRONE IS CLOSING IN.

                                 JONES
                        OK, the pressure thing?  It doesn’t 
                        help me.  I’m getting a neck cramp.
                                 MOORE
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

           Another larger building is vaporized.  They’re next.    

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Suck it up!

           The guys TAKE SHELTER IN A GROVE OF TREES.

                                 JONES
                             (rubbing his neck)
                        This one’s bad.  

           Moore starts to rub his shoulders and neck.  

                                 MOORE 
                        Is that better? 

                                 JONES
                             (closing his eyes)
                        That’s good.  You’re good at this. 

                                 MOORE
                        Just -- be self-aware.  That’s what 
                        your Mailman said.

           Jones opens his eyes.  A new clarity.

                                 MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Does that mean anything?

                                 JONES
                        Yes.  Yes it does.

           He stands on the hilltop and faces the DRONE...

           CLOSE ON JONES’S EYES -- ZOOM INTO HIS MIND AND SEE:

           - Jones’s parents HOLDING JONES AS A BABY.

           - A childhood AMONG THE STARS.  A FOUR-YEAR OLD JONES playing 
           in the gardens of a FLOATING SPHERICAL SPACE COLONY.

           - A FLASH OF AN INTERSTELLAR JOURNEY

           - EARTH seen from space.

           Jones has broken through.  He knows what he is, what he’s 
           been all along.  He is not of this Earth.  And he has great 
           power.
           EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT

           JONES stands below the MASSIVE INTIMIDATING DRONE.  But with 
           a new clarity behind his eyes.  He holds up a HAND...

                                 JONES
                        Stop.

           And it does.  The DRONE LITERALLY FREEZES IN PLACE.  The 
           sudden SILENCE IS SHOCKING.

           Then Jones begins to TAKE THE DRONE APART... MOLECULE BY 
           MOLECULE.  It’s astonishing.

           The deconstruction goes FASTER AND FASTER until, in moments, 
           there’s literally NOTHING LEFT.

           Moore and Jones trade a look.  

                                 MOORE
                        Wow.

                                 JONES
                        Right?

           Jones eyes his hands, sees the potential.  So does Moore.  

                                 MOORE
                        Sera.

           INT. SERA’S SHIP - SUNRISE

           Moore and the Mailman gently lift Sera’s body out of storage.

           EXT. SERA’S SHIP - SUNRISE

           Moore lays Sera down before Jones.  

                                 JONES
                        I don’t know if I can.

                                 MOORE
                        Try.  

           Jones kneels down and inspects her wounds.  He places a hand 
           gently in the center of her chest, concentrates...

           At first, nothing.  But then Moore can see it, something is 
           happening.  Jones’s hands act like a conduit for some kind of 
           energy, flowing into Sera, awakening the dead tissue.

           And she OPENS HER EYES, TAKES A BREATH!  The deus has exed 
           the machina.
                                 THE MAILMAN 
                             (to Jones)
                        You were worth protecting.

                                 MOORE
                        Glad I didn’t kill you myself.

           Matheson perks up, gives his partner a head nod.  

                                 MATHESON
                        I just hope he can lower my 
                        cholesterol because I really need a 
                        goddamn cheeseburger.

           INT. SKYSCRAPER - STAIRWELL - DAYS LATER

           Moore hoofs it up the metal stairs, his footsteps echoing.  

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER - ROOF - NIGHT

           Moore steps outside, finds Jones waiting with packed bags.

                                 MOORE
                        Are you really doing this?

                                 JONES
                        It’s kind of my job now.  Speaking 
                        of which, I’m down a few Guardians.  

                                 MOORE
                        I think I’d fail the entrance exam.  

                                 SERA (O.S.)
                        I could put in a good word for you.

           The AIR SHIMMERS, and SERA’S SHIP is revealed, Sera, the 
           Mailman, and the small Shi’ar standing in the open door.   

           Moore locks eyes with Sera.  She steps to him, hugs him.  

                                 SERA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for believing, Detective.

           The Mailman looks to Jones.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Alright, Mr. Jones.  Time to see 
                        the world you thought you made up.

           Jones accepts his destiny, turns to his bags. 

                                 JONES
                        Oh, I almost forgot.  I won 
                        something on eBay for you.  
           Jones produces a gift, hands it to Moore.

           Suspect, Moore unwraps the package to reveal -- a vintage 
           original series Battlestar Galactica lunch box.

           No words are exchanged, none are needed.  Jones hefts his 
           bags, steps toward the ship.    

                                 MOORE
                        Hey, Jones.

                                 JONES
                             (turns back)
                        Yeah?

           Moore looks back at the city he loves, but he knows what he 
           needs to do.    

                                 MOORE
                        Shotgun.

                                 JONES
                        Whatever you say, Kaltar.

           The SHIP’S DOOR seals behind them.  

           As the SHIP TAKES OFF INTO THE NIGHT SKY...

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                 THE END
