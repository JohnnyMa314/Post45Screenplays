           EXT. TOWN OF COLFAX - DAY

           It is the summer of 1983. Colfax, Illinois. A suburban 
           utopia. John Hughes’ vision of America.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The summer of 1983 was the hottest 
                        summer in years.

           The SOUNDS of July play over the following string of images: 

           I. A group of CHILDREN play on a Slip-n-Slide.

           II. Two teenage GIRLS sunbathe on the hood of a newly washed 
           Trans Am. Journey BLASTS from the radio.

           III. The high school FOOTBALL TEAM practices drills under the 
           sweltering sun.

           Clips of each of the Narrator’s talking points flash across 
           the screen as they are mentioned.

                        The single of the season was “Every 
                        Breath You Take” by The Police and 
                        Eddie Murphy was the biggest star 
                        in Hollywood. Under manager Tony 
                        LaRussa, The Chicago White Sox 
                        appeared in their first postseason 
                        game since 1959. They would lose 
                        the ALCS to Baltimore.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           A MAN exits his cozy ranch home to fetch the morning 
           newspaper. Cicadas are everywhere.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        On top of the heat, that summer the 
                        cicadas had woken from their 
                        seventeen year hibernation and were 
                        covering everything -- mailboxes, 
                        parked cars, tree trunks and 
                        trampolines.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           A group of junior high school BOYS charge through a public 
           park. 
           One of them swings a baseball bats at a tree trunk and a 
           swarm of cicadas emerge like black smoke from within the 
           leaves.

           The boys fall over in fits of laughter.

                        In June, the eighty year old Frank 
                        Lloyd Wright house by the library 
                        burned down.

           EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT

           Violent flames consume a beautiful, antique home. It’s the 
           kind of house they don’t make anymore. A relic of old 
           American values and ingenuity.  

           In the distance, SIRENS blare.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was built in 1908 and FDR was 
                        said to have stayed there once 
                        while on the campaign trail. And 
                        overnight it was destroyed.

           FIRE FIGHTERS struggle to put out the blaze.

           EXT. RESERVOIR - DAY

           It’s the Fourth of July. The entire TOWN vacations at the 
           small lake in the center of the city. A MAN sets off a string 
           of roman candles. The EXPLOSIONS are met with APPLAUSE.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The fire was followed almost 
                        immediately by another controversy 
                        which occurred on the Fourth of 
                        July. 

           EXT. RESERVOIR - NIGHT

           OLIVIA COOPER and six FRIENDS sit on a pier drinking wine 
           late into the evening. Distant fireworks can be seen in the 
           night sky, far away.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Olivia Cooper, a Catholic school 
                        chick, apparently got drunk on 
                        boxed wine shortly after midnight.
                                 FRIEND
                        Who wants to go skinny-dipping!?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Went skinny-dipping--

           LATER

           Olivia and her friends run naked down the pier and cannonball 
           into the ink-black lake. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        --and drowned when her foot got 
                        caught on a buoy chain.

           EXT. RESERVOIR - DAY

           Olivia Cooper’s body floats face down in the murky, green 
           water. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She was found by a fisherman and 
                        his beagle the next morning when 
                        what they thought was a large trout 
                        turned out to be the body of a 
                        seventeen year old girl.

           The BEAGLE paddles to her body and BARKS. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DUSK

           CHARLIE CHAMBERS, the Narrator as a fifteen year old, rides 
           his Schwinn STING-RAY down the suburban streets. His baseball 
           mitt dangles from the left handlebar. 

           Charlie looks like a young Spielberg. He wears an old bomber 
           jacket and a pair of Coke bottle glasses. Thoughtful. Boyish, 
           but cool. The kind of kid who’s had character since he could 
           walk.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Our town was put under a dark spell 
                        in the summer of 1983. I observed 
                        it all from my Schwinn Sting-ray. 
                        It began with a fire and didn’t end 
                        until six months later when the 
                        Monroe sisters were finally dead--

           The street lights flicker on.
           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           Charlie pulls into a parking lot behind the bleachers. 
           FOOTBALLERS scrimmage beneath the stadium lights.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        --robbing us of our juvenescence 
                        and spreading unshakable anxiety 
                        like cyanide in the minds of those 
                        who remember.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - CHRISSY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           CHRISSY MONROE (17), dances around her room, changing and 
           making herself up in the vanity at the center of her teenage 
           temple.

           She is the quintessential girlfriend; the baby-sitter you 
           always had the hots for. She applies a thick layer of red lip 
           stick, smacks her lips and winks at herself. 

           A car horn HONKS three times outside her window.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Chrissy flies down the stairs and into the foyer of her home. 
           MR. MONROE (drinking a Bud) and MRS. MONROE (doing a 
           crossword puzzle) watch television in the adjacent living 
           room. 

           They are a handsome couple. Ivy League style with a touch of 
           Midwestern frump.

                                 MRS. MONROE
                        Chrissy, where are you going, 
                        sweetheart?

                                 CHRISSY
                        I’m going to the movies with Ben. 
                        I’ll be home at eleven.

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Curfew’s 10:45!

           The door slams. 

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Chrissy makes her way through her blue front lawn amid dozens 
           of FIRE FLIES. The sound of the CRICKETS and CICADAS form a 
           nighttime symphony around her.
           She struts toward a parked Saab which idles across the street 
           and down the block a few houses. She spins for the driver 
           like a disco dancer. The driver WHISTLES at her.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Chrissy hops in the car and smothers the driver with a string 
           of kisses. 

           His name is MR. PULASKI (32). He wears a sharp tweed sport 
           coat over a black turtleneck sweater and hides his handsome 
           features beneath a beaten, old baseball cap.

                                 CHRISSY
                        Don’t worry they’re watching TV.

           Pulaski whips the hat into the backseat before she can finish 
           the sentence. 

                                 PULASKI
                             (sarcastic)
                        Weird, you’re parents are watching 
                        television?

                                 CHRISSY
                        Well when you don’t have sex 
                        anymore that’s what you do.

           Mr. Pulaski lights a cigarette.

                                 CHRISSY (CONT’D)
                        So anyway, what’s the big news, 
                        huh?

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        Well...you got a D on your Crime 
                        and Punishment essay. 

           Chrissy laughs and slaps him on the shoulder.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Mr. Pulaski, was the young, hip 
                        English teacher who let kids in 
                        class talk about movies and 
                        philosophy and things unrelated to 
                        the texts.
           FLASHBACK - INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - PULASKI’S CLASSROOM - 
           DAY

           Mr. Pulaski sits in silence before two dozen curious STUDENTS 
           in his cluttered yet refined classroom. A Beatles RECORD 
           spins on a turntable at his desk.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        When John Lennon was shot in 1980 
                        legend had it that Mr. Pulaski 
                        played The Beatles’ albums back-to-
                        back all day and didn't say a word 
                        in any of his classes.

           Sitting near the front of the classroom is Chrissy. She and 
           the rest of the GIRLS in class look upon Mr. Pulaski with 
           dreamy, puppy dog eyes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He was the teacher all the guys 
                        wanted to be and all the girls 
                        wanted to be with.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Chrissy and Mr. Pulaski continue their conversation in Mr. 
           Pulaski’s cramped sedan.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And he was indeed with Chrissy 
                        Monroe. 

                                 CHRISSY
                        What did I really get? 

                                 MR. PULASKI 
                        I dunno -- I haven’t graded it yet.

           Mr. Pulaski turns down the radio a touch. He takes a deep 
           drag of his cigarette.

                                 MR. PULASKI (CONT’D)
                        I think I’m leaving Suzanne. 

                                 CHRISSY
                        What?! Why?

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        Because I’m in love with you.

           Chrissy doesn’t know how to take this information. Many boys 
           have told her they love her before but this one is different. 
           She is silent.

                                 MR. PULASKI (CONT’D)
                        Hey now, don’t get all excited or 
                        anything.

                                 CHRISSY
                        Well wait, I mean, I think that’s 
                        fantastic but is that really what 
                        you want?

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        Yes. It is. And look, I know you’re 
                        young but who cares what they say? 
                        We’ll go somewhere else. I can 
                        teach anywhere.

           There is a long silence. Chrissy really takes in the 
           possibility. She smiles to herself.

                                 CHRISSY
                        Okay.

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        Okay?

                                 CHRISSY
                        I love you.

           They go in for a kiss when suddenly-- 

           CLICK. 

           The back door opens on the driver’s side and a FIGURE enters 
           the vehicle. Chrissy and Mr. Pulaski both turn in confusion. 
           The Figure’s face is obscured in shadow.

                                 FIGURE
                        I have a Smith & Wesson .44 Caliber 
                        pointed at the back of your head. 
                        Now drive the car.

           The Figure isn’t lying. He does indeed have a gun pointed at 
           the back of Mr. Pulaski’s skull. It is a long, silver hand-
           cannon with a cool black handle. Travis Bickle shit. 

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        Ok, man. Ok. 

           Chrissy is in a state of shock as Mr. Pulaski puts the car in 
           gear and pulls away from the curb. 

                                 MR. PULASKI (CONT’D)
                        So...where are we going?
                                 FIGURE
                        Keep driving.

           A smooth power BALLAD comes on over the car’s radio. It 
           contrasts starkly, almost humorously, with the situation. 

           Chrissy clutches Mr. Pulaski’s hand in trepidation. She 
           glances back at the assailant for a moment but can’t make out 
           any distinguishing features.

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        Hey man, look, if it’s money you’re 
                        looking for you’re welcome to 
                        anything I have.

                                 FIGURE
                        I’m not interested in money. In a 
                        quarter mile there will be a gravel 
                        road; turn left onto it.

           Chrissy’s shock passes and she begins to cry as Mr. Pulaski’s 
           car approaches a tiny gravel road which leads into the woods.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Mr. Pulaski’s sedan pulls into a clearing in the thick, dark 
           forest. Even under normal circumstances these woods would be 
           sinister. 

           The car comes to a stop and the engine is killed.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Mr. Pulaski, Chrissy and the Figure sit in silence.

                                 FIGURE
                        Leave the radio on.  

           Mr. Pulaski turns the ignition a half rotation, allowing the 
           radio to keep PLAYING.

                                 FIGURE (CONT’D)
                        Turn on the brights.

           Mr. Pulaski turns the brights on and a small patch of the 
           forest is illuminated with white light.

                                 FIGURE (CONT’D)
                        Now get out, put your hands where I 
                        can see them and stand in front of 
                        the car.
                                 CHRISSY
                        Please stop.

                                 MR. PULASKI 
                        Just do what he says. It’ll be over 
                        soon.

           Mr. Pulaski and Chrissy follow the Figure’s orders. The 
           Figure exits the car with them. New Order comes on over the 
           RADIO.

           The Figure leans against the hood of the vehicle, his face is 
           obscured by darkness. 

                                 FIGURE
                        Now take off each other’s clothes.

           Chrissy begins bawling.

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        Chrissy, baby, look at me. 

           Chrissy looks into Mr. Pulaski’s eyes. Her make-up, so 
           perfectly applied just minutes prior, now runs all down her 
           cheeks.

                                 MR. PULASKI (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be okay. I swear to God. 
                        It’s just some sicko. Let’s just do 
                        what he says and get out of here.

           Mr. Pulaski and Chrissy slowly begin to take off each other’s 
           clothes. New Order’s eerie new wave synths serve as the 
           soundtrack to the perverted strip tease.

           Eventually Chrissy and Mr. Pulaski are in nothing but their 
           underwear.

                                 FIGURE
                        Now kiss each other.

           Chrissy and Mr. Pulaski kiss. Given the circumstances, the 
           kiss is genuine and filled with an odd sense of love. 

                                 FIGURE (CONT’D)
                        Now touch her.

           Mr. Pulaski fingers Chrissy’s breast. It is sexless and 
           empty.

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           The two bodies hit the ground with a THUD. 
           Mr. Pulaski is dead instantly. Chrissy writhes in pain in the 
           dirt.

           Her SCREAMS are muffled by the blood which is gathered in her 
           lungs and being spit up all over her chin and neck. 

           The Figure walks up to Chrissy. He stands above her, cocks 
           his gun and points it at her face. She thrashes about on the 
           ground helplessly trying to escape the barrel. 

           BANG! 

           Again. 

           BANG! 

           Stillness. She is gone. 

           The Figure discharges the empty shells, puts them in his 
           pocket and walks into the thick of the woods; disappearing 
           among the branches. 

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           CRACK! 

           Charlie watches from the bleachers as two football players 
           collide against one another like crashing semis.

           They are BEN KIRCHHOFF (18) and SCOTT ANDERSON (17) -- the 
           stars of the team. Ben helps Scott up from the ground; they 
           low-five. 

           The COACH blows the WHISTLE and the PLAYERS all make for the 
           sidelines.

           Charlie concludes a string of notes he’d been taking in a 
           small composition notebook. They are all related to the 
           players and the drills. 

           He stands from his seat and walks down the bleachers.

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT

           BECKY MONROE (16), sneaks out of her bedroom window and onto 
           the roof. She is Chrissy’s elusive younger sister. Beautiful 
           but unknowable. A certain sadness surrounds her. 

           She lights a cigarette and watches the tree tops of Colfax 
           recede towards the horizon. 
           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           Charlie peddles his bike through the humid twilight. 

           He listens to the SOUNDS of the suburbs. A practiced CLARINET 
           struggles to hit a note from a nearby bedroom window. A 
           lonely dog BARKS in the distance. A man WHISTLES a haunting 
           melody to himself from some unseen place.

           ZOOOOOOOOOOM!

           A shirtless teenage motorcyclist speeds out of the woods and 
           motors past Charlie on his Triumph. We will later meet him in 
           depth but right now we barely catch a glimpse. 

           His name is CASPER TATUM. He looks scared; as though he’s 
           running from something.

           Charlie considers Casper for a moment before riding onto a 
           gravel path into the forest -- the shortcut home.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Charlie rides a few yards into the thick of the woods and 
           then he sees it...

           First the idling Saab, then the two naked, lifeless bodies 
           laying in the headlights before it. He’s the first at the 
           scene.

           Charlie stands in shock. He knows them both. His old baby-
           sitter and his English teacher. Only in matinees has he been 
           this close to such sadism. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There were boys I knew who would 
                        have paid all the money in their 
                        piggy banks to catch a glimpse of 
                        Chrissy Monroe without her clothes 
                        on.

           Charlie takes small steps toward the bodies. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But the spark of youth and vitality 
                        that Chrissy exhibited so loudly 
                        and proudly in life--

           He looks deep into Chrissy’s open, lifeless eyes.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        --the indelible spark which made 
                        horny sixteen year olds want to see 
                        her naked in the first place, was 
                        gone. She was dead.

           Charlie’s delayed instincts finally kick in and he sprints as 
           fast as he can from the scene, abandoning his Schwinn.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           LATER

           The crime scene is alive with POLICE OFFICERS taking photos, 
           looking for evidence and piecing together clues. Charlie’s 
           bike still lays in the grass where he left it.

           DETECTIVE HOFFMAN (65), the grizzled chief of police in 
           Colfax, arrives at the scene in his personal vehicle, a 60’s 
           Mercedes. He exits in a hurry.

           Hoffman is dressed as though he’s a character in a 40’s film 
           noir. Tan trench coat over a suit and tie. Lit cigarette in 
           mouth. He’s an older man whose maintained his cool. 
           Uncensored, unabashed American. A guy who could put a few 
           back and wrestle a bear.

           After twenty years of dealing with underage drinking and 
           traffic citations, he’s eager for some real police work.

           He makes his way toward the deceased where a CSI OFFICER a 
           few DEPUTIES are busy snapping photos of the body.

                                 HOFFMAN
                             (pointing to Pulaski)
                        What’s this guy’s story?

                                 DEPUTY
                        That’s Steve Pulaski, he’s an 
                        English teacher at the high school.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Ok, ok, ok, enough with the 
                        flashing. Cover her up with 
                        something.

                                 CSI OFFICER
                        Yes, sir.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Did you guys get ballistics on the 
                        pollock yet?
                                 DEPUTY
                             (shoving papers down 
                              Hoffman’s throat)
                        Yes, they’re right here.

           Hoffman reluctantly grabs the ballistics results as he stares 
           into Chrissy’s lifeless eyes, transfixed.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Jesus. Seventeen years old. What a 
                        waste.

           A blanket is thrown over her body.

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - WIDE - NIGHT

           A squad car pulls up to the curb of the Monroe’s proud home. 
           Hoffman and two POLICE OFFICERS exit the vehicle and walk to 
           the front door with their hats in their hands.

           They KNOCK. Mrs. Monroe answers almost instantly. There is 
           brief CHATTER before Mrs. Monroe lets out a blood curdling 
           SCREAM and collapses to her knees.

           MONTAGE - NEWS REPORTS - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           News-reports of the murder are seen on television sets in 
           various homes. Conflicting pieces of information about the 
           victims and the circumstances flash across the tube. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie sulks in the waiting area; his hands deep in his 
           pockets. CHARLIE’S FATHER, an old school, stern looking man 
           with Ray-Ban Clubmaster’s on and a pipe in his mouth, sits 
           beside him reading a novel.

                                 CHARLIE’S FATHER
                        Where were you tonight anyway? I 
                        thought your mother and I set some 
                        sort of weekday curfew regulations.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was taking notes on football 
                        practice for the newspaper.

           Charlie’s Father flips a page in his book.
                                 CHARLIE’S FATHER
                        Shame you can’t be on the field 
                        like I was instead of reporting on 
                        the drills.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know, Sir.

                                 CHARLIE’S FATHER
                        Once you fill out a little. Next 
                        year, maybe.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. Maybe.

                                 HOFFMAN (O.S.)
                        Charlie.

           Hoffman appears behind the reception desk and waves Charlie 
           over.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOFFMAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Other than a photo of his wife which sits on his desk, 
           Hoffman’s office of twenty-five years doesn’t look much 
           different than the day he moved into it.

           Charlie sits before Hoffman making himself small. His Schwinn 
           rests against the door behind him. 

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Alright Chambers, why’d you leave 
                        your bicycle? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I dunno, Sir. I forgot about it. I 
                        just ran home.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Do you remember seeing anybody?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Think hard now. Did you happen to 
                        hear anything? Or maybe sense 
                        something wasn’t right?

           Charlie tries to consider the question. He is clearly over-
           tired and unable to concentrate. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t think so.

           Hoffman SNAPS, SNAPS, SNAPS his fingers

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Hey kid, c’mon, wake up. I have a 
                        few more questions for you. Want a 
                        water or a coffee or something?

           Charlie thinks for a moment.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You got Mountain Dew?

           INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

           Charlie and his friends, MATTHEW, JAMIE and SCOOTER wait in 
           line with the entire town at Chrissy’s wake.

           They are the kind of friends you only have at fifteen and 
           never again. Blood brothers. 

           Tacked to cardboard displays are photos of Chrissy at various 
           stages in her short life. Her at a pool; a dance; a first 
           communion. The boys study them while grilling Charlie.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Was there blood?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, there was blood.

                                 JAMIE
                        Was she wearing any clothes?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Only her underwear.

                                 SCOOTER
                        Did you see her titties?

                                 CHARLIE
                        C’mon, dude.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Charlie, look it’s you!

           Matthew points at a picture.

           INSERT - PHOTO
           Chrissy stands among dozens of PEOPLE in the middle of a 
           block party. A slightly younger version of Charlie can be 
           seen just over her shoulder, motion blurred.

           BACK TO SCENE

           MR. JABLONSKI (55), a stocky, mustached man, and his wife 
           MRS. JABLONSKI (50) say their condolences to Mr. and Mrs. 
           Monroe, who stand zombified next to the closed casket. 

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        I’m so sorry about your loss...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The Monroe Family was a prominent 
                        fixture in the community, the 
                        Kennedy’s of Colfax. They were 
                        perhaps best known for organizing 
                        the most famous block parties and 
                        cookouts the town had ever seen.

           Mr. and Mrs. Monroe’s eyes are distant and empty.

           FLASHBACK - EXT. MONROE HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Dozens of FAMILIES, including Charlie and his Mother and 
           Father, enjoy the Monroe’s extravagant barbecue. KIDS swim in 
           their pool and ADULTS make small talk over wine and cheese.  

           Mr. Monroe tells a group of MEN about a vicious criminal he 
           recently put behind bars. Charlie watches from a distance.

                                 MR. MONROE
                        So we just locked up this one guy; 
                        a real kook, a psychopath...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Mr. Monroe was a district attorney 
                        for the city. He had put scores of 
                        creeps, psychos and perverts behind 
                        bars in his short but successful 
                        reign as public defender. He was 
                        merciless in his convictions, 
                        leading the press to nickname him 
                        ‘The Gavel’.

           MONTAGE - MUG SHOTS

           We cut to a quick montage of CRIMINALS Mr. Monroe had put 
           behind bars and who could potentially be the murderer of his 
           daughter.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        A handful of the criminals Mr. 
                        Monroe helped convict had been 
                        released from prison within the 
                        last few years. In fact earlier 
                        that spring, one had paid the 
                        Monroe’s a visit.

           We stop on a mug shot of LEVI WAYNE, a scrawny hillbilly 
           covered in tattoos.

           FLASHBACK - EXT. MONROE HOUSE - DAY

           The entire NEIGHBORHOOD watches from their porches as Levi 
           Wayne stands shirtless in the Monroe’s front lawn. He wears 
           nothing but a pair of cutoff jean shorts and brandishes a 
           pair of nunchucks which he is swinging high above his head. 

           Van Halen BLASTS from the radio of his parked van at the 
           curb.

           Mr. Monroe exits his home, stands on the porch and stares 
           Levi down. Becky, Chrissy and Mrs. Monroe watch from inside 
           the house.

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Levi. Put the nunchucks down.

                                 LEVI WAYNE
                        This is payback, boy!

           Levi releases the nunchucks in Mr. Monroe’s direction. They 
           miss by a mile, hitting the front window and spider-webbing 
           the glass.

           LATER

           The COPS arrive at the scene and arrest Levi.

           INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - NIGHT

           Becky sulks in the lobby of the funeral parlor. She’s been 
           there for hours and is clearly exhausted.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Becky Monroe had always been the 
                        black sheep of the family; 
                        overshadowed by Chrissy’s more 
                        traditional, American charm. 

           Charlie watches Becky from across the room.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Now free from comparisons to her 
                        sister, and imbued with a tragic 
                        mystique all her own, Becky was 
                        finally turning some heads.

           Their eyes meet.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Many years prior, when we were both 
                        children, Becky and I shared each 
                        other’s first kiss at one of her 
                        parents’ legendary parties. We had 
                        never spoken of it but it had 
                        forever left an implicit bond 
                        between us. We were more than mere 
                        neighbors.

           Becky looks away.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Don’t touch me!

           Ben Kirchhoff, the football player from earlier, drunkenly 
           makes a scene near the front of the funeral parlor. A 
           SECURITY GUARD tries to calm him down.

           Ben stumbles into a large bouquet of flowers which fall upon 
           the casket with a loud THUD.

           FLASHBACK - INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           In a square, cell-like room in the middle of the police 
           station, Hoffman grills Ben about the murders.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        How do you feel about the fact that 
                        your girly was tap assing with that 
                        faggy English teacher.

           Hoffman’s bluntness disarms Ben.

                                 BEN
                        What does that even mean?

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Tap assing? It means the ole’ in-n-
                        out. 

                                 BEN
                        She wasn’t doing any of that. They 
                        were just close.
                                 HOFFMAN
                        But if she was, would you have been 
                        jealous? Angry? Vengeful?

                                 BEN
                        If you think for one minute that I 
                        had anything to do with Chrissy’s 
                        murder you’re quacked. You should 
                        retire right now, old man.  

           His eyes water.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I loved her.

           Crocodile tears start streaming down Ben’s cheek. Hoffman 
           rolls his eyes.

           EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - NIGHT

           Ben slouches on the curb taking pulls from his flask.

           Becky exits the funeral parlor looking for some fresh air. 
           Ben turns around and nods to her. She waves back.

           Ben extends her his flask. She declines.

                                 BECKY
                        You okay?

                                 BEN
                        I’m, uh, drunk. 

                                 BECKY
                        How about I walk you home?

           EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Becky moseys down the sidewalk with Ben stumbling close 
           behind her. She lights a cigarette as Ben howls to the 
           heavens.

                                 BEN
                        God, take me now! I wanna see my 
                        baby! 
                             (to himself)
                        Just one more time.

           Becky can’t help but laugh to herself.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Your sister had such a nice ass.
           EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ben and Becky stop in front of Ben’s house -- a giant, modern-
           looking new construction home.

           Ben leans against the Mustang parked in his driveway. He 
           looks as cool as a drunk high schooler can. 

                                 BEN
                        Thanks for the walk, little lady.

           Ben catches Becky’s eyes. He looks at them long and hard. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Looking into Becky’s eyes, it 
                        occurred to Ben for the first time 
                        in his life, how much she looked 
                        like Chrissy.

           Ben drunkenly waltzes over to Becky.

                                 BEN
                        Seriously.

           He goes in for a kiss. Becky dodges him, amazed at the gall. 
           She slaps him on the face and storms away.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What?!

           EXT. PUBLIC POOL - SNACK BAR - DAY

           Charlie, Matthew, Jamie and Scooter shoot the shit over soggy 
           nachos and melting ice cream cones. Charlie’s mind is 
           somewhere else.

                                 SCOOTER
                        Would you guys go down on yourself 
                        if you could?

                                 JAMIE
                        I heard Boy George can do that.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Wouldn’t that make you gay? 

                                 SCOOTER
                        Is masturbating gay?

                                 JAMIE
                        You’re gay. 
                                 SCOOTER
                        I’d totally do it.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I guess why not?

                                 JAMIE
                        People would probably stop 
                        reproducing. If you could just suck 
                        your own cocker, who needs chicks?

           Charlie snaps out of his funk.

                                 CHARLIE
                        The end of the world would be, 
                        like, three dudes blowing 
                        themselves in a field.

           They all erupt in LAUGHTER.

           UNDERWATER

           SPLASH!

           Charlie and his FRIENDS cannonball off the high dive at the 
           swimming pool.

           Charlie swims at the deep end of the pool among dozens of 
           legs. 

           He sees a vision of Chrissy’s DEAD BODY laying at the bottom 
           of the pool. He GASPS and comes up for air.

           He wipes his goggles and looks back down but nothing is 
           there.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Chrissy was on everyone’s mind that 
                        Labor Day weekend.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           At the public park adjacent to the pool, the ADULTS in town 
           gossip over beer and BBQ. Everyone has an opinion.

           WOMAN #1 talks to a group of WASPS around a picnic table. 

                                 WOMAN 1
                        She was a S-L-U-T. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        C’mon Joan, she was seventeen. Get 
                        off it. 
           At the grill, MAN #1 looks into the lens of the camera and 
           says:

                                 MAN 1
                        If you ask me, the teacher killed 
                        her and then he killed himself. 
                        Sick son of a bitch.

           He flips a burger paddy.

           Woman #3 sunbathes next to her HUSBAND under a tree.

                                 WOMAN 3
                             (whispers)
                        I think it was Troy Kilgore.

           FLASHBACK - INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

           We glide across the walls of a dingy dorm room. An Elvis 
           Costello poster hangs next to various ticket stubs and a 
           Northwestern Wildcat pennant flag. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Troy Kilgore was a Northwestern 
                        business major whom Chrissy dated 
                        briefly the previous fall. They had 
                        a shared appreciation of Stevie 
                        Nicks and cocaine.

           Chrissy lays in bed with only a bra on. She has a line of 
           cocaine laid out on a Fleetwood Mac album cover. 

           Troy Kilgore emerges from off screen in a pair of skintight 
           briefs. He snorts the line of cocaine, lets out an excited 
           YELP, and kisses Chrissy. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        After Chrissy broke up with him for 
                        Ben, Troy had left a string of 
                        suicidal ramblings on her answering 
                        machine which were tape-recorded by 
                        Chrissy for laughs and found in her 
                        car’s glove compartment.

           FLASHBACK - INT. CAR - DAY

           Chrissy and her FRIENDS cruise down the streets listening to 
           one of the tape-recorded voicemails. They are laughing so 
           hard they are crying. 
                                 TROY’S MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        Baby. When I look into your eyes I 
                        see eternity. I see a grain of sand 
                        suspended in a moon beam.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        These diatribes were more often 
                        than not followed by a particularly 
                        poignant portion of Supertramp’s 
                        “Take The Long Way Home” played 
                        over his stereo.

           FLASHBACK - INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Troy lays in his bed holding the telephone up to a speaker 
           which blasts SUPERTRAMP. 

           He looks beyond moved by the lyrics. He puts the telephone up 
           to his mouth and, crying, says:

                                 TROY KILGORE
                        Take the long way back home to me, 
                        baby. I’ll be waiting...

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Troy Kilgore sits in the interrogation room with Hoffman.

           They both listen to the tape recorded voicemails which are 
           playing on a small boom box on the table between them.

                                 TROY’S MESSAGE (V.O.)
                             (through boom box)
                        ...waiting for you to come back 
                        into my life. I’m nothing without 
                        you.

           Hoffman hits STOP on the boom box.

                                 TROY KILGORE
                        I was crazy about that girl, man. 
                        What can I say?

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Well you can start off by telling 
                        me why you did it?

                                 TROY KILGORE
                        Well, um, I dunno -- it’s because 
                        Supertramp is like, probably the 
                        most underrated band...ever.
                                 HOFFMAN
                        Not that, Troy, why’d you kill her?

                                 TROY KILGORE
                        Woah. Woah. Woah. I need my lawyer. 
                        I didn’t kill anyone. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Like most of the suspects, the 
                        police couldn’t place the smoking 
                        gun in Troy’s hands.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOFFMAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Hoffman leans on his desk burning the midnight oil. He stares 
           at a cork-board filled with suspect mug shots, documents and 
           evidence. None of it connects. Hoffman takes a long, sobering 
           sip of coffee.

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

           Ben stands in front Chrissy’s headstone. He sets a large 
           bouquet of white roses on the fresh grave.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - ENTRY - DAY

           Charlie makes his way though hordes of STUDENTS in the 
           cramped hallways. The brief excitement of the new school year 
           is palpable.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        One doesn’t easily forget the smell 
                        of their high school. A mixture of 
                        industrial strength cleaning 
                        products, chalk, deodorant, 
                        chlorine, wet paint and hormones.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Charlie approaches his trusty locker and enters the combo: 43 
           - 9 - 14.

           He packs the locker with the semester’s text books and hangs 
           a photo of Carlton Fisk on the inside of the door.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER ROOM - DAY

           Charlie sits at a typewriter in a classroom full of 
           JOURNALISTS. 
           MR. BOUQUE (35), a young Hemingway of sorts, sits at his desk 
           at the head of the classroom and moderates the story 
           generating session.

           FRED STEIN raises his hand.

                                 FRED STEIN
                        I’d like to write about the 
                        choir/chemistry conflict!

           ARI BERLIN quickly follows.

                                 ARI BERLIN
                        And I think everyone should be 
                        aware of the healthy food options 
                        in the cafeteria.

                                 MR. BOUQUE
                        If that’s really what you want to 
                        write about, Ari. Sure.

           Charlie slowly raises his hand, unsure.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’d like to write about the Monroe 
                        murder.

           The room goes silent. Everyone anticipates Mr. Bouque’s 
           response.

                                 MR. BOUQUE
                        Chambers...you can have the Monroe 
                        murder if you turn in that pre-
                        season football practice piece I 
                        asked you to write six years ago.

           Charlie pumps his fist.

           BERLICE BEAMAN (15), sits next to Charlie. She is the four 
           eyed, red-headed arts and entertainment writer.

                                 BERLICE
                        Congratulations, Charlie. I know 
                        you were really gunning for that 
                        one. 

           Charlie readies his typewriter to begin writing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I guess.

           Berlice smiles at him. It wasn’t an accident she chose the 
           seat beside him. 
           Charlie begins typing.

           INSERT - TYPEWRITTEN WORDS

           “I discovered the bodies on a humid, still night in August.”

           EXT. FOREST - DUSK

           Charlie tiptoes through the forest carrying a flashlight and 
           a notebook. Wind chimes RATTLE in the distance.

           Up ahead a tiny memorial of flowers, stuffed animals and 
           framed photographs sit where Mr. Pulaski’s sedan once idled 
           in the moonlight. 

           Becky is sitting on the ground next to the memorial. Charlie 
           waves to her. She waves back.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi.

                                 BECKY
                        Hey.

           There is a long silence.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So what classes are you taking this 
                        semester?

                                 BECKY
                        I dunno, the ones everybody takes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cool. Yeah, me too.

           Charlie digs his Chuck Taylors into the dirt.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t get a chance to tell you 
                        at the funeral but I’m really, 
                        really sorry about your sister.

                                 BECKY
                        Yeah, thanks.

           Becky pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her pocket and offers 
           one to Charlie. He surprises himself by saying--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure.
           She puts both cigarettes in her mouth, lights them and hands 
           one to Charlie. Charlie takes a puff and tries his best to 
           hide the fact that it’s his first hit ever.

                                 BECKY
                        You know it’s funny. I didn’t even 
                        like my sister when she was alive. 

           Charlie coughs a bit. Silence follows. He racks his brain for 
           a change of subject.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, you remember that one time 
                        when we were like nine and we 
                        stayed up all night drinking pop 
                        and watching Saturday Night Live? 
                        That was the best.

                                 BECKY
                        No, not really.

           More silence. Becky senses she’s hurt Charlie’s feelings.

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        But that sounds like fun.

           Becky stands up, puts her cigarette out and walks away.

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go, Charlie. Talk soon.  

           Charlie watches her disappear into the trees. When she is out 
           of sight he throws his cigarette to the ground, stomps it out 
           and coughs up a lung. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           Becky drifts down the avenues, kicking an empty can. The 
           night is still and quiet. 

           WHISTLING is heard from some faraway, unseen place. It’s the 
           same eerie melody Charlie heard just before discovering the 
           bodies.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Becky opens her front door and enters her lifeless home. 

           Her parents are asleep on the sofa, basking in the blue glow 
           of the television. She puts an afghan over her mother and 
           turns the TV off before heading up the stairs.
           INT. MONROE HOUSE - CHRISSY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Becky opens Chrissy’s bedroom door with great hesitation. She 
           tiptoes in, careful not to disturb any sleeping ghosts.

           A photo of Chrissy and Ben is taped to the mirror. A crucifix 
           hangs next to a dream catcher on the wall above her 
           headboard.

           Becky lays down in Chrissy’s bed and falls asleep beneath a 
           swaying mobile of the stars.

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           The high school marching band BURSTS into a sloppy rendition 
           of Chicago’s “25 or 6 to 4.”

           AT BLEACHERS

           Hundreds of Colfax’s CITIZENS CHEER for the home team. 
           Charlie sits beside Berlice, Scooter and Matthew. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The homecoming game was a nail-
                        biter. 

           AT FIELD

           Ben Kirchhoff huddles with other FOOTBALLERS before an 
           important play. 

                                 BEN
                        Ok, Scotty, set up a block. Todd, 
                        do that thing you do and Chris, I’m 
                        gonna look for you in the end zone.

           We watch as this play is executed exactly. Colfax wins.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ben threw the winning touchdown 
                        pass and dedicated the game to 
                        Chrissy’s memory

           INSERT - CABLE ACCESS NEWS CHANNEL

           Ben is interviewed by a local NEWS REPORTER. He looks into 
           the camera while holding the trophy. 

                                 BEN
                        It’s with a heavy heart that I 
                        dedicate this game and this trophy 
                        to Chrissy Monroe. RIP, baby.  
           Just then the TEAM dumps a vat of Gatorade all over him. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The STUDENT BODY jives to K.C. And The Sunshine Band at the 
           homecoming dance. 

           Charlie and his FRIENDS break dance poorly in the middle of a 
           dancing circle. Scooter busts out a bizarre sequence of 
           robotics.

           Hoffman stands near the DJ BOOTH with his arms crossed, 
           observing the spectacle.

           Becky stands in the corner of the gymnasium twiddling her 
           thumbs. Ben approaches her. He is surprisingly handsome and 
           sober; modest. One can finally see why Chrissy dated him in 
           the first place.

                                 BEN
                        Hey Becky.

                                 BECKY
                        Hi.

                                 BEN
                        Look, I just wanted to say that I’m 
                        really sorry for the way I behaved 
                        the other night. I know it was a 
                        hard day for you and I totally 
                        shouldn’t have taken advantage of 
                        the situation. It was really 
                        uncool.

           Although the apology definitely has the air of being 
           practiced in the mirror a half dozen times, it is genuine. 
           Regardless, it does nothing to bring down Becky’s icy guard. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (straight cheese)
                        I shouldn’t drink so much. It’s 
                        been a hard few weeks for me too.

           A SLOW BURNER comes on over the PA.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Can I make it up to you with a 
                        dance?

                                 BECKY
                        I don’t think so. 
                                 BEN
                        C’mon, I’m a really good dancer.

                                 BECKY
                        I’m sure you are but I’m gonna go 
                        to the washroom. See you later, 
                        Ben.

           Becky walks away, leaving Ben alone with his tail between his 
           legs. He watches the STUDENT BODY awkwardly shuffle with one 
           another as he pours himself some punch, downs it in one shot 
           and crumples the plastic cup in his fist.

           AT DANCEFLOOR

           Berlice and Charlie slow dance. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And as we slow danced to The Bee 
                        Gees, across town the forest was on 
                        fire.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 

           Miles of woodland blaze in the night. The devastation is 
           brutal and vast. Flames engulf the towering elm trees.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was the forest where I broke my 
                        leg swinging from a tire swing when 
                        I was seven. The forest that served 
                        as the shortcut home on our 
                        bicycles and divided the town into 
                        rich and poor sections. The forest  
                        where a month prior, Chrissy Monroe 
                        and Mr. Pulaski were shot and 
                        killed. And like that it was burnt 
                        to the ground.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           We follow behind WES BIXLEY (19) and TYLER HALL (19) as they 
           strut toward the Colfax police station. They each sport long 
           black trench coats, long black hair and knee high combat 
           boots. Shit-kicking burnouts.

           INT. POLICE STATION - FOYER - DAY

           Wes and Tyler shove open the front doors of the police 
           station and march towards the RECEPTIONIST.
                                 WES
                        We wanna see Detective Hoffman.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        May I ask why?

                                 WES
                        We know who killed the Monroe girl.

           Tyler blows a bubble and it EXPLODES.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOFFMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tyler and Wes sit slouched in the two beige chairs in front 
           of Hoffman’s desk. 

           Hoffman gives the boys a once over before speaking.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        So, you think you know who killed 
                        Chrissy Monroe?

                                 WES
                        We know we know who killed Chrissy 
                        Monroe.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Ok. Let’s hear it.

           Wes looks around the room cautiously before slowly leaning 
           forward and whispering:

                                 WES
                        His name is Casper Tatum.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

           We follow behind an elusive FIGURE on a cool, black Triumph 
           Scrambler as he rides into the sunset down a lost highway. 
           His jean jacket flies in the wind behind him.

                        Casper Tatum grew up on the wrong 
                        side of the tracks and was known by 
                        our mothers as ‘plain white trash.’ 
                        Somehow he and I were in the same 
                        grade although he easily had three 
                        years and sixty pounds on me.
           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           A pair of strong, greasy HANDS tighten bolts on the engine of 
           a motorcycle. 

           We follow the hands down to the floor as they steal a match 
           from a matchbook and strike it against the motorcycle’s 
           cooling fins. 

           FLICK.

           The flame ignites and we follow the match up, watching as it 
           lights the end of a Lucky Strike which rests effortlessly 
           between the lips of-- 

           Casper Tatum. 

           He is the James Dean-esque town rebel and the definition of 
           teenage cool.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He was smoking cigarettes by the 
                        third grade and sleeping with 
                        women, I mean real, full grown 
                        women, by junior high.

           Casper blows smoke out his nostrils as he continues to work 
           on the engine. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        On top of all this, Casper was 
                        rumored to have killed before.

           FLASHBACK - INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Charlie, Jamie, Matt and Scooter sit around a table trading 
           lunch items and listening as HENRY (16) recounts a 
           titillating piece of gossip.

           Henry stabs his pork chop with a plastic spork.

                                 HENRY
                        I heard that one time he stabbed a 
                        waiter right in the throat, man.

                                 SCOOTER
                        Why?

                                 HENRY
                        Just cause he served him 2% milk.

                                 MATT
                        So?
                                 HENRY
                             (duh)
                        Casper only drinks skim. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Casper and SIX other HILLBILLY WOLVES swagger down the 
           hallways of the high school with no particular place to go; 
           certainly not class.

           Their names are KURT, JIM, JAMES, JETHRO and CLARK. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Casper was the leader of a 
                        throwback street gang who looked 
                        like they just stepped out of an 
                        S.E. Hinton novel.

           They all wear washed out blue jeans and matching denim 
           jackets with the words “The Hillbilly Wolves” embroidered 
           along the back in red stitching. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        They were called The Hillbilly 
                        Wolves and they were known around 
                        town for drinking, cursing and all 
                        around lawlessness.

           EXT. TRAIN YARD - DUSK

           Charlie spies on Casper and The Hillbilly Wolves as they sit 
           on a couple of deserted sofas in the middle of an old train 
           yard. They drink beers and throw the empties at passing 
           freights. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Apparently they were in a band of 
                        some sort but no one had ever seen 
                        them play a single note.

           Charlie jots down notes on their behavior. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Casper sits in the interrogation room with his feet up on the 
           table and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. He is 
           indifferent to Hoffman’s line of questioning.

           Hoffman recognizes a bit of his old self in Casper. 
                                 HOFFMAN
                        Is it true you drive a motorcycle?

                                 CASPER
                        I guess.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Did you know we found tire tracks 
                        matching those of your Triumph’s, 
                        at the scene of the crime?

                                 CASPER
                        You don’t say?

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Yeah, hepcat. Take a look.

           Hoffman lays down a stack of photos of the tire marks for 
           Casper to gaze at. He does, barely, before flicking them to 
           the other side of the table.

                                 HOFFMAN (CONT’D)
                        Those don’t do anything for you? 
                        Maybe these will.

           Hoffman slaps down two gruesome photos of Chrissy’s dead, 
           bloody body. It does nothing to dismantle Casper’s 
           impenetrable cool.

                                 CASPER
                             (too cool for school)
                        Look chief, I got homework to do. 
                        We done here?

           Hoffman knows very well that Casper hasn’t done a single 
           piece of homework in fifteen years.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was also well known that Casper 
                        hated Mr. Pulaski for supposedly 
                        refusing to pay him for a large 
                        quantity of marijuana that was 
                        transacted over the previous 
                        Christmas break.

           FLASHBACK - INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Casper walks down a crowded hallway during passing period. He 
           spies Mr. Pulaski down the way a bit, standing in front of 
           his classroom and greeting STUDENTS as they enter. 

                                 CASPER
                        Hey, Pulaski!
           Mr. Pulaski turns toward Casper.

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna have that essay to you by 
                        the end of the week, cross my 
                        heart.

                                 MR. PULASKI
                        That’s a deal.

           They shake hands; slyly exchanging a small plastic baggie of 
           marijuana. 

                                 CASPER
                        Sure is, teach.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Casper exits the police station and walks to his Triumph, 
           parked at the curb.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Casper had been released from 
                        custody based on a lack of 
                        substantial evidence.

           Casper gets on his bike and turns toward Hoffman, who stands 
           watching him from within the police station.

           Casper smiles and starts the engine.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        However, he was easily the town’s 
                        favorite suspect. Everyone wanted 
                        him to be the killer.

           Casper takes off down the street, clearly over the speed 
           limit.

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           Ben stands alone on the football field under the harsh 
           stadium lights. He is wearing his football gear and looking 
           directly into the camera as it rapidly pushes in on him.

                                 BEN
                        Casper Tatum killed my girlfriend 
                        and he’s going to pay.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But Casper had bigger problems.
           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HOME EC - DAY

           From the back row Casper watches a GIRL at the front of the 
           class brush a few strands of loose hair from the back of her 
           supple neck. 

           He is transfixed.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        For the first time in his short 
                        life Casper Tatum was in love.

           EXT. TRAIN YARD - DAY

           Casper and The Hillbilly Wolves drink Pabst Blue Ribbons and 
           loiter. They are already more than a case in and it isn’t 
           even dinner time yet.

           Clark plays a few lazy chords on a shitty, old acoustic.

                                 CASPER
                        There’s this chick in my Home Ec 
                        class, man. Brunette. Killer cans. 
                        Smokin’ body. She doesn’t even look 
                        my way though. Acts like I’m not 
                        even there.

                                 JETHRO
                        What’s her name?

                                 CASPER
                        Why do you think I’m asking you, 
                        cock knocker? I’m never there early 
                        enough to hear roll.

                                 KURT
                             (all Fonzi)
                        Oh, this happened to me once too. 
                        There was this one real quiet girl 
                        with killer cans in my math class -- 
                        way into what she had going on. So 
                        I told her -- you know, one day -- 
                        and she looks at me, all kinda bug 
                        eyed and droopy and shit and opens 
                        her mouth...turns out she’s 
                        retarded.

           The Hillbilly Wolves all look at Kurt aghast.

                                 KURT (CONT’D)
                        Hot fuckin’ retard though.

           They redirect their attention to Casper.
                                 CLARK
                        Well how about you just go on time 
                        tomorrow, Tatum?

                                 CASPER
                        Nah man, it’s after lunch.

           INT. CASPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Casper, wearing only tighty-whiteys, sits on the floor of his 
           bedroom amid t-ball trophies, race car bed sheets and a pin-
           up of Farrah Fawcett; the conflicting decorations of a boy 
           who went through a quick growth spurt. 

           He thumbs through last year’s yearbook looking for the 
           mystery girl. He gives up, lays down and lights a joint.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Somehow Casper was completely 
                        ignorant to the fact that the woman 
                        of his desires was the sister of a 
                        girl everyone thought he murdered.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HOME EC - DAY

           Back in Home Ec, the mystery girl finally turns toward Casper 
           and reveals to us that she is Becky Monroe. 

           Casper’s heart is in his throat.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - LUNCH LINE - DAY

           Casper and Becky stand next to one another in the food line. 
           Casper’s eyes are glued to her as she grabs various lunch 
           items and puts them on her tray. 

           He finally builds up the courage to say something.

                                 CASPER
                             (clearing his throat)
                        Hey, you’re that foxy chick in my 
                        Home Ec class aren’t you?

                                 BECKY
                        Yeah, and you’re the boy who stares 
                        at me all period. 

           Casper is stunned by the bluntness of Becky’s retort.
           She advances to the CASHIER as he puts his chocolate milk 
           back up on the counter and slyly dismisses himself from the 
           line. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Casper, swallowing his pride, exits the lunch line and makes 
           his way through the cafeteria.

           Charlie spots Casper from his lunch table and bee-lines his 
           way.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey Casper, would you like to give 
                        a quote for the newspaper 
                        concerning the murder of Chrissy 
                        Monroe?

           Casper, not slowing stride, shoves Charlie into a PASSER-BY -- 
           food flies everywhere.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The next day there was a mandatory 
                        assembly to commemorate the loss of 
                        Chrissy and Mr. Pulaski.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           The tightly packed STUDENT BODY sits in bleachers, facing 
           each other across a basketball court. At half-court a 
           miniature stage is erected with some STUDENTS and FACULTY 
           sitting in folding chairs waiting for the ceremony to begin.

           AT BLEACHERS

           Casper and The Hillbilly Wolves sit bored with the rest of 
           the school. One of them blows a spitball at Henry, a few rows 
           down, sitting next to Charlie and Berlice. 

           AT STAGE

           PRINCIPAL BOLDE (48), clears his throat at the podium and 
           begins the assembly.

                                 PRINCIPAL BOLDE
                        This has been a tough semester I 
                        know....
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Principal Bolde gave a corny 
                        speech. A pimple faced sophomore 
                        played an acoustic version of 
                        Kansas’s “Dust In The Wind.” 

           We see the PIMPLE FACED SOPHOMORE as he finger picks his 
           Yamaha acoustic.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The editor of the literary arts 
                        magazine read a poem called "Summer 
                        Passing." 

           We watch as the EDITOR fumbles through his clunky poem.

                                 EDITOR

                        Kiss me. Death. Chrissy. 

           Beat.

                                 EDITOR (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Through tears, Chrissy’s friends 
                        told over-the-top anecdotes about 
                        the deceased.

           We cut to a rotation of Chrissy’s FRIENDS struggling through 
           their poorly written speeches. KATE (18) and SARAH (17), 
           Chrissy’s best friends, start things off.

                                 KATE
                        She really, really cared about 
                        Pandas. I think if reincarnation is 
                        real Chrissy is a baby Panda 
                        somewhere far, far away.

           LATER.

                                 SARAH
                        One time I was sick with mono and 
                        Chrissy came over every day with my 
                        homework, some girly mags and my 
                        favorite candy, Charleston Chew.   

           LATER - Ben takes the stage and begins gently crying almost 
           immediately. It’s all a farce.
                                 BEN
                        And then I said, “I like black 
                        licorice too.” She just kinda 
                        smiled, you know that ole Chrissy 
                        smile. And then we kissed. It was 
                        over in an instant but it felt 
                        like...it felt like eternity. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ben Kirchhoff’s over-the-top 
                        retelling of his first kiss with 
                        Chrissy Monroe was a sad attempt to 
                        reclaim his place as her main 
                        squeeze. After her murder exposed a 
                        year long affair with Mr. Pulaski, 
                        Ben Kirchhoff was dealing with more 
                        than just heartbreak; he was 
                        wrestling with jealousy and rage.

                                 BEN
                             (phony, phony, phony)
                        We should also remember that Mr. 
                        Pulaski, a much loved teacher here 
                        at Colfax High, lost his life that 
                        night as well.

           Kurt HECKLES Ben from the bleachers.

                                 KURT
                        They were fucking!

           The AUDIENCE explodes.

           Ben takes the mic from the stand and begins prowling the 
           stage, searching the bleachers for the wise-guy.

                                 BEN
                        Who said that?! That’s hearsay!  

           Principal Bolde races toward the podium and attempts to 
           retrieve the microphone, Ben pushes him away. 

           LATER

           Ben, calmed down, stands silently at the podium. He exhales 
           through his closed lips like a motorboat into the microphone.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. You know. In conclusion I’d 
                        like to ask Chrissy’s beautiful 
                        sister, Becky Monroe to stand up. 
                        Everybody, lets show Becky our 
                        support.
           AT BLEACHES

           Becky sits in shock; the eyes of the entire STUDENT BODY 
           scrutinize her. 

                                 BEN
                        C’mon, Beck. Don’t be shy, girl.

           Becky shoots up from her seat and books it out of the 
           gymnasium. The entire school watches her in silence. 

           Casper too looks upon Becky with shock and confusion, though 
           not for the same reasons as everyone else. He slowly realizes 
           her family ties. 

           Becky opens up the gym doors and they slam behind her with a 
           BANG.

           The school bell RINGS.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

           In a secluded corner of the library, Casper whips through the 
           pages of last year’s yearbook -- this time with a specific 
           destination.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Casper hadn’t found Becky’s 
                        headshot in the yearbook the 
                        previous night because over the 
                        course of the last year Becky had 
                        developed greatly. Evolving from a 
                        brace-faced tomboy into the kind of 
                        girl who silenced rooms with her 
                        beauty.

           Casper stops his rapid flipping.

           INSERT - YEARBOOK PHOTO OF BECKY

           Becky has awkward baby fat, a bad haircut and braces. Her 
           growth is self-evident and humorous.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Casper loudly COUGHS into his inner-elbow as he tears out the 
           page and pockets it.
           EXT. CONVENIENT STORE - DAY

           Casper and the Hillbilly Wolves loiter outside a small corner 
           store. Casper’s mind is clearly somewhere else. He sucks down 
           cigarette after cigarette and remains quiet.

                                 KURT
                        Hey homos, when’s the next band 
                        practice?

                                 JAMES
                        Tuesday.

                                 JIM
                        Nah, I got an orthodontist 
                        appointment that day.

                                 KURT
                        C’mon we never fuckin’ practice. 
                        I’m sick of this. Your teeth look 
                        fine, Jim. Pearly white.

           A CUSTOMER walks past them.

                                 JETHRO
                             (to passing customer)
                        Hey boss, can you score us some 
                        brews?

           The Customer disregards their presence. 

           Casper withdraws the yearbook page from his coat pocket. He 
           unfolds it and stares at Becky’s awkward photo.

                                 CLARK
                        Guys, I told you, the White Hen on 
                        McArthur is way better for scoring 
                        booze. This place is the worst.

                                 KURT
                        But the White Hen don’t got 
                        Schlitz.

                                 CASPER
                        Will you ass holes zip the lip?! 
                        I’m gettin’ a migraine. 

                                 JAMES
                        What the fuck’s the matter with you 
                        Tatum?
                                 CASPER
                             (sighing)
                        I think I’m in love with the dead 
                        bitch’s sister.

           The Hillbilly Wolves start CRACKING UP. 

                                 CLARK
                        You’ve got to be kiddin’ me.

                                 JETHRO
                        Of all the girls at school, you 
                        have the hots for her? 

                                 CASPER
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

                                 CLARK
                        Her parents ain’t ever gonna 
                        approve.

                                 CASPER
                        I’ve never dated a girl whose 
                        parents approved.

                                 KURT
                        Good luck with that, Romeo.

                                 CASPER
                        Don’t worry. I got a plan.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie sits alone, typing at his Olympia typewriter a 
           million miles an hour. The rest of the staff has gone home 
           long ago.

           There is a KNOCK at the door. Charlie turns to see Casper 
           standing in the door frame.

                                 CASPER
                        Hey Chambers, I’m ready for my 
                        interview now, alright.

           Charlie is startled by Casper’s sudden presence.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh cool, man.

           Charlie quickly clears the desk beside him and motions for 
           Casper to take a seat.
           Casper takes small, loud steps toward Charlie and plops down 
           next to him. He takes his time, slouches back in his chair 
           and measures the room a bit. 

           He opens a fresh piece of gum from his pocket, unwraps it and 
           puts it in his mouth. He’s really drawing out beginning the 
           tale to build Charlie’s anticipation. 

           It’s definitely working.

                                 CASPER
                        So it all started after band 
                        practice one night when I was 
                        tripping on Ayahuasca...

           Charlie hits REC on his tape recorder and listens with 
           anticipation.

           FLASHBACK - INT. KURT’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Casper sits slouched on an ugly green sofa in Kurt’s wood-
           panneled basement. Instruments and wires are strewn across 
           the floor. His eyes are rolled back and his left leg 
           occasionally thumps against the ground uncontrollably.

           The place is spinning.

                                 CASPER (V.O.)
                        I don’t really remember too much 
                        from the high except that I was 
                        hotter than hell and needed to take 
                        my shirt off bad.

           FLASHBACK - EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Casper emerges from Kurt’s house, shirtless and drinking 
           straight from a bottle of bourbon. Kurt stays in the doorway 
           and watches as Casper stumbles toward his motorcycle.

                                 KURT
                        Casper, man, you okay to drive?

           Casper mounts his motorcycle, revs the engine and wheelies 
           out of his parking spot faster than hell.

           FLASHBACK - EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           Casper speeds through the neighborhoods at 75 miles per hour. 
           He pulls onto a dirt road leading into the forest. 
                                 CASPER (V.O.)
                        I took the short cut through the 
                        forest because it hit me -- I was 
                        high on DMT and driving an 
                        unregistered motorcycle, shirtless. 
                        And on top of that I was going 50 
                        miles over the speed limit, so...

           FLASHBACK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Casper’s motorcycle slows down as he comes upon Mr. Pulaski’s 
           parked car and the two bodies which lay before it in the 
           headlights.

           Casper’s eyes are like two round moons. His mouth on the 
           floor. He almost looks like he could smile. 

                                 CASPER (V.O.)
                        I didn’t know wether I was seeing 
                        shit from the junk running through 
                        my blood or if I had crashed and 
                        was in some sort of, like, 
                        purgatory. 

           He cranes his neck and looks deep into the eyes of Chrissy.

                                 CASPER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t even remember if I did it 
                        or not, to be honest with you. Not 
                        at first anyway.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER ROOM - NIGHT

           Casper stops his story for a moment and lights a cigarette. 
           Charlie bites his nails in suspense. 

                                 CASPER
                        Plus I knew that with my rap, just 
                        admitting I was there would have 
                        been enough to book me.

           Casper leans back in his chair.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So what did you do?

                                 CASPER
                        I just Goddamn drove off.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you see anyone?!
           Casper looks around to see if anyone is listening in on the 
           tale. He leans forward and whispers:

                                 CASPER
                        It might have been my imagination, 
                        but I swear to God I saw some perv 
                        peek behind a tree, dude.

           FLASHBACK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           A shadowy FIGURE peaks out from behind a giant elm tree. He 
           looks directly at Casper. The sound of the BUZZING cicadas 
           crescendo behind him. 

           Casper looks at the Figure, speechless.

           IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

           Casper hops on his motorcycle and speeds off through the 
           woods.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER ROOM - NIGHT

           Casper lights another cigarette with the end of his current 
           one.

                                 CASPER
                        But I saw a lot things that night 
                        if you know what I mean, Chuck.

           Casper chuckles to himself. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER ROOM - DAY

           Mr. Bouque unlocks the classroom door and enters the 
           newsroom. He sees Charlie sleeping on the small loveseat 
           tucked away in the corner of the room. He clenches a stack of 
           paper in his left hand.

           Mr. Bouque smiles. He puts down his briefcase and coffee and 
           takes a seat at the desk beside the loveseat. He types on the 
           typewriter key-by-key as loudly as possible.

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.

           The typewriter’s carriage reaches the end and it RINGS. 
           Charlie shoots up and out of sleep. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (mumbling)
                        It’s done.
           He extends the typed article to Mr. Bouque and collapses back 
           down into the loveseat and back to sleep.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s like the best thing I’ve ever 
                        written. 

           MONTAGE

           I. A printing press discharges newspaper after newspaper. The 
           headline reads, “Casper Tatum: Notes From The Bad Side of The 
           Tracks”

           II. Dozens of bound newspapers are dropped off in front of 
           the newspaper room.

           III. Charlie and the other newspaper staffers cut open the 
           twine binding all the papers. 

           IV. Charlie and the other staffers walk the hallways before 
           school, distributing the papers at the doors of classrooms. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HOME EC - DAY

           Casper watches as Becky reads the article along with the rest 
           of the class (and presumably the school). Casper smiles to 
           himself. It was all part of the plan. 

           Becky finishes the article and folds the paper onto her desk. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - GEOMETRY CLASS - DAY

           Ben reads Charlie’s article along with the other STUDENTS in 
           his math class. He is not happy with Casper’s vindication. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I won the Illinois student 
                        achievement in journalism award for 
                        that article. As a matter of fact 
                        it’s still framed in my childhood 
                        bedroom.

           FLASHFORWARD - INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Charlie’s childhood bedroom lays dormant and very little 
           changed. It’s that odd hour in the middle of the afternoon 
           where things are particularly quiet. One can see the 
           particles of dust in the atmosphere.
           Hanging on his wall next to his father’s old athletic 
           trophies is the framed Casper Tatum article and his framed 
           award certificate.

           We push in on the article and end on a CLOSE UP of Casper’s 
           black and white face. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Charlie and a hundred or so PARENTS are gathered in the 
           gymnasium for a special PTA meeting. Hoffman fields questions 
           at the podium in front of the congregation.

                                 PTA WOMAN #1
                        Why have no arrests been made?

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Because there is no one to arrest.

                                 PTA WOMAN #2
                        And what is the likelihood of the 
                        killer striking again?

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Low. Murderers very seldom strike 
                        the same place twice. We also have 
                        cops patrolling the town up the 
                        ass.

           A shocked MURMUR moves through the crowd.

                                 PTA MAN #1
                        What do you make of today’s article 
                        on Caper Tatum in the Colfax 
                        Tribune? Do you believe he is 
                        innocent?

                                 HOFFMAN
                        I’m not here to discuss my opinions 
                        with you. I’m here to calm your 
                        concerns and answer questions about 
                        our progress--

                                 PTA MAN #2
                        Pack it in, old timer!

           The entire PTA erupts in MURMUR. Hoffman clears his throat 
           and regains control of the crowd.
                                 HOFFMAN
                        Listen, I don’t have to be here. 
                        All you need to know is that the 
                        Colfax police department is keeping 
                        a close eye on a number of leads, 
                        and yes, that includes Casper 
                        Tatum. That being said, as of right 
                        now, he is innocent and he should 
                        be treated as so.

           Hoffman struts off the stage and out of the gymnasium.

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Autumn is in full effect and the air is brisk. The leaves on 
           the trees are gold and brown.

           Becky walks toward her Volvo parked in the far corner of the 
           expansive parking lot. As she reaches her car she sees that 
           the tires have been slashed.

           She GROANS. Just her luck.

           Just then Casper pulls up behind her on his motorcycle and 
           assesses the situation. She looks to him.

                                 CASPER
                        Sucks. Wanna lift?

           Becky looks to Casper and can’t help but smile. She senses he 
           had something to do with this. She has no other choice but to 
           accept his ride.

                                 BECKY
                        Fine.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Casper drives Becky through the old fashioned suburb on his 
           motorcycle. The breeze dances in Becky’s hair. She grabs his 
           torso tight. 

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - DAY

           Casper pulls up to Becky’s home. Her father rakes the 
           hundreds of dead leaves which cover the yard.

           The entire street watches from their windows and porches. 
           “Why is Casper Tatum at the Monroe house?!” 
           Mr. Jablonski observes the scene like a stoic scarecrow from 
           his garden and Charlie ogle’s from across the street. 

           Becky hops off the bike and stands before Casper in the grass 
           for a moment. 

                                 BECKY
                        Thanks.

                                 CASPER
                        No thing, chicken wing. 

           Becky slowly begins to walk backward down her lawn.

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, wait a minute. 

           Becky stops.

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        Look. I’m sorry about your dead 
                        sister but I didn’t do it. And I’d 
                        like to see you again. I think 
                        you’re one lush piece of ass.

                                 BECKY
                             (fighting a smile)
                        I don’t think so.

           Casper looks at her as though to say “C’mon.” 

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

           She skips through her long lawn, passing her father on the 
           way. 

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Who’s that?

                                 BECKY
                        No one. Some guy.

           She gently falls into a pile of leaves.

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Well motorcycle’s are dangerous. I 
                        don’t like you on them. 
           INT. CAR - DAY

           Ben and Scott watch the scene unfold from inside Ben’s 
           Mustang, parked across the street from the Monroe’s. Casper 
           starts his engine and rockets past them.

                                 SCOTT
                        No way, dude. She’s dating Tatum.

           Ben is livid. He spits onto the pavement before driving off.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           The hallway is now empty. We rapidly push in on Ben who is in 
           the distance chucking a tennis ball at a locker bay. 

           BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

           As we get closer, he turns to the camera and throws the 
           tennis ball straight at the lens.

           The glass SHATTERS.

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY

           Becky, Ben, Charlie and the rest of their GYM CLASS race 
           across the track during 100 meter sprints. Between gasps of 
           air, Ben questions Becky.

                                 BEN
                        You dating that scum of the earth 
                        faggot, Casper Tatum?

                                 BECKY
                        Please.

                                 BEN
                        That’s what a little bird told me. 

                                 BECKY
                        Well I’m sorry to disappoint you.

                                 BEN
                        It’s not me you’re disappointing, 
                        Rebecca, it’s your sister. You know 
                        he’s the one who did it.

           Becky sprints ahead of Ben. 
           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Later in gym class, everyone runs around the gymnasium 
           playing dodgeball. They whip red rubber balls at one another.

           Ben has his eyes dead set on Becky. 

           Charlie watches from the sidelines as Ben grabs a ball from 
           the floor, take two steps, winds up and chucks the ball as 
           fast as he can straight at Becky’s face. 

           BOOM.

           Her nose gushes blood.

           The entire class stops playing. Becky looks up, sees Ben and 
           runs out of the gym in embarrassment.

           Everyone gapes at Ben.

                                 BEN
                        What? It was an accident. She 
                        shouldn’t have been standing there!

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        After hearing of the assault, 
                        Casper lost it.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Casper struts down the hallway, stoned to the bone. Kurt 
           emerges from an adjacent classroom and high fives Casper.

                                 KURT
                        Hey you hear that chick you wanna 
                        jog got her face all fucked up? 

                                 CASPER
                        What?!

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - STAIRWELL - DAY

           Ben careens down a flight of stairs after school. It is one 
           of the secluded stairwells with bad lighting and very few 
           STUDENTS.

           Ben reaches the first floor landing and walks toward the 
           exit.

                                 CASPER (O.S.)
                        Yo, Kirchhoff.
           Ben turns around to see Casper hidden underneath the stairs. 
           He is clutching a red rubber dodgeball with his right hand.

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        You think hittin’ a girl is cool, 
                        tough guy?

           Casper whips the ball straight at Ben’s nose. Ben is stunned 
           for a moment.

           They tumble on the tile floor, throwing punch after punch.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ben sits on a doctor’s bed in the cramped nurse’s office. He 
           has cotton balls stuffed up his nose and he holds an ice bag 
           to his forehead.

           Hoffman questions him about the incident. 

                                 HOFFMAN
                        So he whipped the ball at your face 
                        for no reason?

                                 BEN
                        No reason at all! I’m just minding 
                        my own business and I get smacked 
                        in the fucking stairwell!

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It took exactly thirty-six minutes 
                        for word of Casper and Ben’s 
                        fisticuff to reach Becky at home.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Becky, donning a fresh black eye, sits at a desk in her 
           bedroom doing homework. Her room is like a smaller, hipper 
           version of Chrissy’s. A Go-Gos poster hangs over her bed next 
           to an overcrowded bookshelf. 

           The telephone RINGS. She picks up.

                                 BECKY
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Hoffman and Casper meet again in the interrogation room. 
           There is a long silence; each man measures the other.
                                 HOFFMAN
                        So, from my perspective -- the lead 
                        suspect in a murder just assaulted 
                        the boyfriend of the victim.

                                 CASPER
                        Who himself, is also a suspect.

                                 HOFFMAN
                        Leave the law enforcement to us, 
                        Tatum. 

           Casper scoffs.

                                 HOFFMAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen, you don’t wanna answer 
                        questions -- fine by me. We can 
                        hang out all night.

                                 CASPER
                        Ok. He chucked a dodgeball at a 
                        chick who I may or may not have the 
                        hots for; embarrassed her; gave her 
                        a bloody nose. So I gave him a 
                        taste of his own medicine. Nothing 
                        to do with anything other than 
                        that. Dig?

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HOME EC - DAY

           Casper is escorted to his seat by a POLICE OFFICER. He and 
           Becky have matching black eyes. 

           She watches him make his way to the back of the classroom. 
           Their eyes meet as he takes a seat. She smiles at him.

           He smiles back. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The unlikely teenage love affair 
                        between Casper Tatum and Becky 
                        Monroe began in a Home Ec classroom 
                        and was officiated with an hour 
                        long session of frenching under the 
                        bleachers.

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - BLEACHERS - DAY

           Casper and Becky make out under the bleachers of the football 
           field.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The sister of a dead girl and the 
                        prime suspect in the murder were 
                        suddenly lovers. The gossip spread 
                        through the town by supper that 
                        evening.

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Charlie, Charlie’s Father and CHARLIE’S MOTHER gossip over 
           dinner. The atmosphere is humorless and quiet.

                                 CHARLIE’S MOTHER
                        Can you believe that little river 
                        rat is dating Becky Monroe?

                                 CHARLIE’S FATHER
                             (totally doesn’t care)
                        Just terrible. The horror.

           Charlie eats his mashed potatoes in silence.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           A group of TEENAGERS sit in a large movie theatre before a 
           film begins. They share a bag of popcorn and discuss the 
           scandal. 

                                 TEEN 1
                        Look, if someone killed my sister -- 
                        not only would I not be dating 
                        them, but you’d have to remove my 
                        fingers from his cold, dead body. 

                                 TEEN 2
                        Yeah. But he is kinda dreamy.

                                 TEEN 1
                        His dreamy, cold dead body then.

           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           Two ALTER BOYS whisper to one another as a PRIEST conducts a 
           mid-week mass.

                                 ALTER BOY 1
                        I bet he’s gonna kill her too.

                                 ALTER BOY 2
                        Yeah, but I bet he’ll rape and 
                        sodomize her first.
                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                             (to congregation)
                        And thou said do not judge what 
                        thou do not understand. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Casper and Becky walk hand-in-hand down the school hallways. 
           Everyone stares in dumbfounded shock, especially Ben.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        None of the noise mattered to 
                        Becky, though. The girl who had 
                        once lived under a shadow was now 
                        coming out. And on top of that she 
                        really dug Casper.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

           Casper and Becky drive down a highway in her Volvo. “Space 
           Age Love Song” by Flock of Seagulls BLASTS from the radio.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She dug the way he smelled -- Brut 
                        deodorant and nicotine. She dug 
                        that she had to stand on her 
                        tiptoes to kiss him and that when 
                        you got to know him, he was really 
                        just a softy. For instance his 
                        favorite band was Flock of Seagulls 
                        and he never missed an episode of 
                        Dallas.

           EXT. PLANITARIUM - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Casper and Becky lean against her car’s trunk, smoking a 
           joint. Casper inhales deeply before shotgunning the smoke 
           into Becky’s mouth.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He got her high for the first time 
                        at the Jacobson Planetarium.

           Becky holds the smoke in for a moment, then lets it escape 
           her lungs in one giant cloud. She breaks into a coughing fit.
           INT. PLANETARIUM - THEATER - NIGHT 

           Casper and Becky sit in reclined chairs in a giant circular 
           auditorium and watch the projected galaxy spin on the domed 
           ceiling. 

           The GUIDE narrating the show stands at a podium at the rear 
           of the theater.

                                 GUIDE
                             (into microphone)
                        There are 500 billion galaxies. 300 
                        billion solar systems per galaxy on 
                        average. We live on Earth. In one 
                        solar system. In one galaxy. We 
                        live and lose all on this little 
                        rotating blue, green planet. 

           Casper puts his hand on Becky’s. They’re both high as kites. 
           Their minds are blown. 

                                 GUIDE (CONT’D)
                             (into microphone)
                        Somehow we find joy and hope and 
                        even love in spite of the crushing 
                        insignificance of the universe.

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie watches from his window as Casper and Becky pull into 
           her driveway. They exit the car and kiss goodbye before 
           Casper walks toward his motorcycle, parked down the street.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Becky lays wide awake in her bedroom and stares at the 
           ceiling longingly.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They weren’t that different, Casper 
                        and Becky. They both had parents 
                        who didn’t acknowledge their 
                        existence. They were both Libras. 
                        And they both preferred sweet to 
                        savory. In spite of the crushing 
                        insignificance of the universe they 
                        had found each other.
           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           Casper and Becky stroll down the sidewalk and take in the 
           fall atmosphere. The trees are almost completely bare. Jack-
           o'-lanterns and cobwebs cover the lawns of Colfax.

                                 CASPER
                        You know, when me and the wolves 
                        finally cut a record and go on tour 
                        we’re really gonna show this two 
                        cent town who’s boss.

                                 BECKY
                        How many songs you guys have?

                                 CASPER
                        Well a buncha old ones but we don’t 
                        like those anymore, you know? The 
                        new ones, those are gonna be 
                        killer.

                                 BECKY
                        Can you play me one?

                                 CASPER
                        Well I haven’t put them down on 
                        paper yet. They’re in my head, 
                        though.

                                 BECKY
                        Oh. Cool.

           Casper senses Becky smells bull shit.

                                 CASPER
                        In your head songs are perfect. 
                        Fuckin’ perfect. Then they come out 
                        on paper and Kurt’s fuckin’ up the 
                        bass line and Clark’s pickin’ at 
                        his ass and they’re ruined, you 
                        know? The songs are ruined.

                                 BECKY
                        Well sure. In your head things are 
                        sacred. 

                                 CASPER
                        Yeah, yeah, exactly. Sacred.

           Casper really thinks about the meaning of that word for a 
           moment. 

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        What’s sacred to you, sweets?
                                 BECKY
                        Um, I don’t know...

                                 CASPER
                        C’mon, gotta be something. 

                                 BECKY
                             (off the cuff)
                        Alright, the month of May, sherbert 
                        ice cream, and, I dunno, The Beach 
                        Boys.

                                 CASPER
                        Don’t goof with me.

                                 BECKY
                        What? I’m a simple girl with simple 
                        pleasures.

                                 CASPER
                        Nah, you’re dark. And smart. And 
                        you ain’t simple.

           Becky stops walking. Casper follows suit. They are standing 
           in front of the Monroe’s house. 

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        So don’t be sneaky with me, 
                        sherbert.

           They kiss.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Fresh from her walk with Casper, Becky skips into her home. 
           The front door isn’t even closed before she hears:

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Rebecca, can you come in here?

           Becky looks in the direction of her father. He is sitting in 
           the adjoining front room, talking with Mrs. Monroe and Ben. 
           The mood is somber.

           Becky’s heart sinks.

                                 MR. MONROE (CONT’D)
                        Well it was very kind of you to 
                        stop by, young man.

                                 BEN
                        Absolutely, Sir. Just doing what I 
                        think’s right. 
           Ben shakes Mr. Monroe’s hand, nods to Becky and exits the 
           house. Becky rolls her eyes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        At this point Ben had been plotting 
                        his revenge for quite some time.

           Becky slogs over to her parents and sits before them on a 
           chair beside the sofa. Mr. Monroe towers over her, SCREAMING.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Through their crushing grief, the 
                        Monroe’s hadn’t paid much attention 
                        to Becky’s social life. Nor to the 
                        outside world for that matter.

                                 MR. MONROE
                        How could you disgrace the memory 
                        of your sister like that?!

           Becky sits staring into the middle distance of the room. Her 
           eyes water as her Father continues to berate her.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She was prohibited from seeing 
                        Casper and grounded indefinitely. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HOME EC - DAY

           Casper walks into Home Ec class, predictably late. He is 
           surprised when he finds that Becky’s chair is empty. 

           He takes a seat and stares confused at the empty desk in the 
           front row. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Becky was pulled from her normally 
                        scheduled Home Ec period with 
                        Casper and placed in one earlier in 
                        the day.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN COLFAX - DAY

           Large semi-trucks roll into the quaint downtown Colfax. 
           CARNIES and sideshow FREAKS begin to prepare for the 
           festivities taking place that weekend.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The week Becky Monroe was grounded 
                        was the week the Halloween carnival 
                        rolled into town.
           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Casper appears at Becky’s house late that night.

           He throws pebbles up at her darkened window. After making 
           contact a few times, her light turns on and Becky appears as 
           a silhouette. 

           She waves. He waves back. 

           Casper motions for her to open the window. She does.

                                 CASPER
                        Where were you today? You sick?

                                 BECKY
                        Shhh. My Mom and Dad will hear you.

           He pulls a bottle of Tums out of the pocket of his motorcycle 
           jacket.

           They whisper.

                                 CASPER
                        I brought you some Tums. I heard 
                        the stomach flu is going around and 
                        I thought you might have it.  

                                 BECKY
                             (smiling)
                        No. I haven’t had the stomach flu 
                        since I was nine. I wasn’t in class 
                        today because my parent’s hate you 
                        and pulled me out of that period. 

                                 CASPER
                        What?! Why?!

                                 BECKY
                        They think you killed my sister. 

           He rolls his eyes. There is a long silence.

                                 CASPER
                        Fuck this. Meet me at the carnival 
                        this weekend.

                                 BECKY
                        What?!

                                 CASPER
                        In front of the ferris wheel.
                                 BECKY
                        I think we should just let things 
                        cool off.

           Casper tip toes backward.

                                 CASPER
                        Eight o’clock. Ferris wheel. Be 
                        there.

                                 BECKY
                        Casper, wait.

                                 CASPER
                        I love you.

           He runs off down the yard.

           Days drip by one-by-one. Both Casper and Becky sulk through 
           their routines without each other. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        In their moments of solitude each 
                        yearned for the other. They counted 
                        down the days till they could 
                        reunite on a slate black chalkboard 
                        in the back of their minds.

           I. Casper day dreams in class about Becky.

           II. Becky sulks in her bedroom, spinning records and reading 
           books.

           III. Casper and the Hillbilly Wolves drink beers at the train 
           tracks.

           IV. In gym class, Ben watches Becky walk across the pool deck 
           in her bathing suit. She sees his eyes on her and covers 
           herself with a towel. 

           V. The carnival rides are erected by the Carnies.

           VI. Hoffman patrols the carnival ground, sucking down a 
           cigarette. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Charlie drives his father’s Buick through the carnival’s 
           midway. Berlice sits shotgun beside him and Jamie and Scooter 
           sit in the back.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The week before the carnival I 
                        finally turned sixteen. And that 
                        Friday, my dad let me take out his 
                        Buick. 

           The Zipper and the Tilt-a-Whirl test-run with no one in them. 
           The game tents are opened and circus FREAKS stroll the 
           avenues. Charlie and Berlice look at the sights with naive 
           wonder. 

           Berlice excitedly grabs Charlie’s hand. It is a rare instance 
           of spontaneous action. A subconscious urge. Jamie and Scooter 
           watch from the back seat in awkward anticipation.

           Charlie looks at their adjoined hands. He needs to make sure 
           it isn’t an accident. Their young fingers slowly begin to 
           intertwine and then unfurl with each other. 

           Intertwine and unfurl. 

           Intertwine and unfurl. 

           Although it is chilly outside, their hands are clammy and 
           charged. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nice night.

                                 BERLICE
                        Yeah.

           He’s talking about the weather. She isn’t.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Like Charlie and his buddies, Casper and The Hillbilly Wolves 
           drive through the town in one of their cars. 

           In between sips of Budweiser, they watch the crowds of PEOPLE 
           make their way towards the carnival.

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           Ben and the Footballers ram into one another at practice. 

           BANG! BOOM! CRUNCH!
           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Ben and Scott change out of their sweaty uniforms and into 
           cheese-ball button up shirts and slacks. They look into the 
           mirror. They like what they see.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - TILT-A-WHIRL - DAY

           Charlie and Berlice share a carriage on the CREAKY, old Tilt-
           a-Whirl. Berlice SCREAMS and LAUGHS in excitement. She 
           clutches Charlie’s arm.

           They spin away from us for a moment and when they return 
           again their lips are locked. 

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - DUSK

           The Monroe’s doorbell rings.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - DUSK

           Becky, still trapped in her ivory tower, broods in her 
           pajamas in a sea of comforters. 

           The doorbell sparks her attention.

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - DUSK

           Mr. Monroe answers the door to reveal Ben standing on the 
           stoop; a shit-eating grin on his face. 

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Hello, Benajamin.

                                 BEN
                        Hello, Sir. My friends and I are 
                        going to the Halloween fair and we 
                        were wondering if perhaps we could 
                        bring Becky with.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - DUSK

           There is a quiet KNOCK on Becky’s door.

                                 BECKY
                        Yes.
                                 MR. MONROE 
                             (through door)
                        Get dressed. Ben’s here to see you. 
                        He’s taking you to that carnival 
                        thing. I’ve given him permission.

           Becky springs from the bed in an excited furry.

           She retrieves some dirty clothes from the hamper in her 
           closet and changes into them quickly.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - FOYER - DUSK

           Becky glides down the staircase into the foyer of her home. 
           Ben stands next to her parents in his freshly dry cleaned 
           letterman jacket. 

                                 BEN
                        You look beautiful, Becky.

           She hugs her mother and kisses her father on the cheek.

                                 MRS. MONROE
                        Becky, take a jacket. It’s chilly 
                        outside.

           Mrs. Monroe hands Becky a beat-up denim jacket from the 
           closet by the front door. 

                                 MR. MONROE 
                             (to Ben)
                        You have her back at a descent 
                        time, Ben. She is still grounded. 

                                 BEN
                        Absolutely, Sir. She’s in good 
                        hands.

           INT. CAR - DUSK

           Ben, Becky, Scott and his date, Kate -- Chrissy’s friend from 
           the assembly -- cruise through the wan dusklight in Ben’s 
           sleek Mustang.  

           Scott and Kate suck each other’s faces off in the backseat. 
           Ben and Becky sit in the front. Ben puts his arm around 
           Becky’s shoulder and gives her a once over.

                                 BEN
                        So -- you finally got a taste for 
                        the ole Kirchhoff, huh?
                                 BECKY
                        Umm, yeah. 

                                 BEN
                        Nice. 

           There is a brief lull. The sound of the SLOBBERING in the 
           backseat forces Ben to turn up the radio a bit.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        So I’m sorry about the way I may 
                        have behaved the last few weeks. I 
                        think I’m finally at the last stage 
                        of grief though -- acceptance.

                                 BECKY
                        That’s great, Ben. I’m really happy 
                        for you.

                                 BEN
                        You know, you and your sister 
                        aren’t that different from one 
                        another.

           They reach the fringes of Colfax’s downtown. The excitement 
           of the carnival can be felt. Electricity is in the air. 

           Ben pulls his car into a parking spot at the curb. Kate and 
           Scott are still lip-locked and his hands are down her pants.

           Ben shuffles closer to Becky; his thumb gently grazing her 
           breast. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        In fact you and your sister have 
                        similar lips. 

           Beat.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Had similar lips I mean. 

           Ben goes in for a kiss. 

           She maneuvers away from him and whispers:

                                 BECKY
                        Later. I promise.

           Ben smiles. He slaps Scott on the shoulder and breaks up his 
           and Kate’s make-out session.
                                 BEN
                        C’mon time for the carnival, fuck 
                        face.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Casper waits alone in front of the spinning, circular lights 
           of the ferris wheel. His hands are deep in the pockets of his 
           leather jacket. 

           He looks at his watch -- it’s 8:13 PM.

           Casper watches as scores of BRUNETTES who vaguely resemble 
           Becky march past him arm-in-arm with their LOVED ONES. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Becky, Ben, Scott and Kate stroll through the entrance to the 
           carnival. The lights are ablaze and nearly everyone is 
           wearing a Halloween costume.

           Ben and Scott stop to chat with a GRADUATE.

                                 GRADUATE
                        KIRCCCCCCCHHHHHHOOFFFFFFF! 
                        ANDERSON! No fuckin’ way!

                                 BEN
                        Goober! How’s college, man?!

                                 GRADUATE
                        Can I be honest?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah!

                                 FRIEND
                        Dude. 

                                 SCOTT
                        That good?

                                 GRADUATE
                        Dude.

           Kate and Becky stand awkwardly near their dates, though 
           neither are included in the conversation.

           Becky taps Ben on the shoulder.
                                 BECKY
                        Hey, I gotta use the ladies room. 
                        I’ll be back.

                                 BEN
                        Ok, I’ll miss you.

           Ben pinches Becky ass before she starts off down the midway. 
           It is swarming with PEOPLE, noise and excitement.  

           As she maneuvers through the traffic we get a better view of 
           the carnival’s geography. It blankets a quarter mile stretch 
           of downtown Colfax and its adjacent avenues. The ferris wheel 
           stands at the opposite end of the fairgrounds.

           Becky ducks into the entrance of a nearby, crowded 
           convenience store. 

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           Becky hurries through the hectic aisles of the convenience 
           store. CHILDREN buy candy and TEENAGERS score booze as Becky 
           searches for something.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Ben, Scott and Kate continue to chat with the Graduate at the 
           carnival’s entrance. It is now completely dark outside and 
           the festivities are in full swing.

                                 GRADUATE
                        Had this one chick, man. She was 
                        like a contortionist. Legs shootin’ 
                        left and right.

           Ben checks his digital wrist watch. It is 8:29 PM.

           He looks around briefly for Becky before resuming his 
           conversation with the Graduate.

           INT. CARNIVAL - PORTA-POTTY - NIGHT

           Becky opens the porta-potty door and it closes behind her 
           with a BANG. She pulls a generic, two-buck skeleton costume 
           out of her purse and quickly changes, careful not to touch 
           the grimy toilet. 
           EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The Hillbilly Wolves, minus Casper, loiter on folding chairs 
           around Kurt’s shitty 1975 Chevy Nova. The Replacements BLAST 
           from the car radio. 

           They shotgun cans of Coors Light and harass two overweight 
           PASSERS-BY; imitating the sound of their footsteps.

                                 HILLBILLY WOLVES
                             (collectively)
                        Boom-bada-boom-bada-boom!

           The overweight PASSERS-BY scurry away.

           The Hillbilly Wolves CRACK UP as a pretty BLONDE struts past 
           them. Kurt WHISTLES suggestively at her before drunkenly 
           falling from his nest atop the Nova. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - PORTA-POTTY - NIGHT

           Becky exits the porta-potty in her disguise. She quickly 
           scurries away in pursuit of the ferris wheel.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Casper looks at his watch once more; it is 8:35 PM. He 
           shrugs. He is moments away from giving up. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Becky creeps past Ben, Scott and Kate as she proceeds through 
           the fairgrounds. Although she is in disguise she is careful 
           not to be spotted by them. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FOOD TRUCK - NIGHT

           Charlie and Berlice wait in line at a busy food vendor. The 
           CASHIER calls them up.

                                 CASHIER
                        Next!

           Charlie advances forward.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’d like two elephant ears please. 

           Detective Hoffman patrols the grounds. He passes Charlie and 
           Berlice on his route. 
           He nods to them; they nod back.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - PORTA-POTTY - NIGHT

           Ben, Scott, Kate and five other FOOTBALLERS rifle through the 
           various porta-potties which stand in a line near the 
           carnival’s entrance. 

                                 BEN
                        Kate, where did she go?

                                 KATE
                        I dunno, Ben. She told you she was 
                        going to the bathroom.

                                 BEN
                        I was talking to Goober Gorsky, ok. 
                        Shut your mouth. I was busy.

                                 KATE
                             (to Scott)
                        Are you gonna let him talk to me 
                        like that?

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Kate)
                        Babe, c’mon. Shut up.
                             (to Ben)
                        Ben, you too, man. Gimme a break. I 
                        got nag-nag-nagin’ from both ends, 
                        here.

                                 BEN
                        Control the female and then talk to 
                        me.

                                 KATE
                        You know what, Ben -- I think you 
                        killed Chrissy. 

           Ben raises his fist in anger. 

                                 BEN
                             (through clenched teeth; 
                              to Scott)
                        Get her out of here, man.

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Kate)
                        Babe! God.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, I’m gone. 
           Kate storms down the avenue in her cheap high-heels. 

           One of the Footballers finds something in the trash can 
           beside the porta-potties.

                                 FOOTBALLER
                        Hey Ben, look.

           Ben directs his attention to the jean jacket clenched in the 
           Footballer’s hand.

                                 BEN
                             (to himself)
                        Tatum. 

           Ben lifts his fingers and SNAPS.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - MIDWAY - NIGHT

           Ben, Scott and the Footballers march through the midway with 
           reckless abandon. Ben carries Becky’s jean jacket clutched in 
           his left fist. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Casper stands dejected in front of the ferris wheel. He has 
           given up.

           Just then someone taps on his shoulder. He turns around to 
           see a small, little skeleton (Becky) looking up him.

                                 CASPER
                        Bug off. 

           She taps him again.

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        What did I just say?

           Becky kicks his shin.

                                 CASPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to punch you, kid.

           Becky removes the skeleton mask to reveal her face to Casper. 
           He is overcome with joy. 

           He picks her up, spins her around and they kiss.

           Time stands still.
           EXT. CARNIVAL - MIDWAY - NIGHT

           Ben, Scott and the Footballers continue to march down the 
           midway. Ben’s eyes are beady and far away. He is 
           bloodthirsty.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ben Kirchhoff was feeling a number 
                        of emotions as he marched through 
                        the brisk October night toward a 
                        showdown. Casper Tatum had probably 
                        killed his girlfriend, made him 
                        look like a pussy in front of his 
                        classmates and now was making a 
                        mockery of him by stealing Becky 
                        Monroe. Casper Tatum was the scum 
                        of the earth and he had finally met 
                        his match.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Becky and Casper arrive at Kurt’s car. 

           The Hillbilly Wolves are lighting off M-80s inside jack-o'-
           lanterns. Them and the cars around them are covered in orange 
           goo. 

                                 JIM
                        Oh, hey guys. 

                                 CASPER
                        Be scarce. Kurt I’m using your 
                        backseat.

           Becky and Casper enter the cramped backseat of the two-door 
           shit box.

           Kurt lingers for a moment, hoping to catch a glimpse of some 
           skin before reluctantly joining the rest of The Hillbilly 
           Wolves on their way towards the carnival. 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Casper and Becky start stripping off each other’s clothes and 
           exploring one another’s biology. Their sweaty skin sticks to 
           the smoke stained black leather. 

                                 BECKY
                        I’ve never done this before.
           Casper stops dead in his tracks. He wasn’t expecting that. He 
           laughs to himself and kisses her neck with much more 
           sensitivity than before. 

                                 CASPER
                        It’s no thing, sugar plum. Watch. 

           He unstraps her bra and removes it from her slender shoulder; 
           kissing a path down to her underwear. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Charlie and Berlice are next in line for the ferris wheel. A 
           CARNIE opens the gate, lets them in and they take a seat next 
           to one another on a blue carriage to the top of Colfax.

           She kisses his cheek. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - NEAR FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           The Hillbilly Wolves, minus Casper, stroll through the 
           midway, bird-doggin’ CHICKS and drinking beers. 

           James and Kurt up-skirt BROADS left and right. 

           Meanwhile, bustling down the midway in the opposite 
           direction, toward the Hillbilly Wolves, is Ben, Scott and the 
           Footballers.

                                 BEN
                        Look at these fuckin’ jokers. 

           The Hillbilly Wolves snap out of their debauchery and stand 
           still for their enemy’s approach. 

           They are way too drunk for this. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your jerk-off leader?

                                 KURT
                        He’s uh, bangin’ your dead 
                        squeeze’s lil hottie of a sister. 

           Clark sticks his right pointer finger through the “OK” sign 
           he holds up with his left hand. In and out. In and out. His 
           tongue wagging. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Charlie and Berlice approach the top of the ferris wheel.
                                 BERLICE
                        ...And it was then that I realized 
                        what Iggy Pop was really trying to 
                        say. 

           The ride comes to a complete stop. Their carriage gently 
           sways. 

           Charlie spots the commotion occurring below between The 
           Hillbilly Wolves and Ben and the Footballers. 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Becky and Casper lay in the backseat of the car following 
           their romp. Becky slips her skeleton costume back on. Casper 
           watches her with affection.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - MIDWAY - NIGHT

           Becky and Casper walk hand-in-hand through the carnival. It 
           is almost slow-motion. They are drunk on love and lights. 
           It’s one of those rare instances where you’re aware of the 
           present. 

           After a moment, they see the commotion ahead between the 
           Footballers and the Hillbilly Wolves. 

           They sprint to the scene.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - NEAR FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Casper breaks into the circle of bodies and tries to cool the 
           situation.

                                 CASPER
                        Hey, hey, hey -- what’s going on 
                        here?!

                                 BEN
                        “What’s going on here?”

           Ben sees Becky behind Casper’s shoulder.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (sarcastic)
                        Oh, there’s my date. Hey Becky.

           The auxiliary players on both sides quiet down and watch as 
           Ben and Casper verbally duke it out.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Well we were, uh, just about to 
                        kick the shit out of your hick 
                        friends but since you’re here, I 
                        think -- maybe -- we’ll kick the 
                        shit out of you instead.

                                 CASPER
                        I thought we already dealt with 
                        this.

           Becky tugs at Casper’s arm.

                                 BECKY
                        C’mon babe, he isn’t worth it.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Charlie cranes his neck as much as he can without tipping the 
           carriage. He tries to get a clear view of the confrontation.

                                 BERLICE
                        What’s going on?

           Charlie doesn’t respond; he is completely immersed in the 
           action below. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - NEAR FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Ben advances upon Casper, basically standing toe to toe. A 
           small CROWD has gathered around them

                                 BEN
                        You call a sneak attack under the 
                        staircase a fight, pus pus?

           Casper turns around and follows Becky’s advice. They begin to 
           walk away, hand-in-hand, when Ben says--

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        You better sleep with one eye open, 
                        Becky. You’re dating a cold blooded 
                        killer. 

           Casper stops dead in his tracks. He closes his eyes tight and 
           tries to control his impulses.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        We all know you‘re the one, Tatum. 
                        You got blood on your hands. 
           Casper lets go of Becky’s hand and charges toward Ben, 
           knocking him off his feet and sending him soaring towards the 
           pavement. 

           BOOM.

           Fists start flying almost immediately. It’s an all out brawl. 
           Man on man. Footballer on Hillbilly Wolf. 

           Becky watches from the sidelines along with the growing sea 
           of ONLOOKERS. She is terrified by the manic violence she is 
           witnessing. 

           Blood SPLATTERS. 

           Bones BREAK. 

           Fists SMASH. 

           It isn’t an easy fight but after a while, Ben has the best of 
           Casper. 

           He lands punch after punch after punch. 

           At this point the Hillbilly Wolves have been subdued by the 
           Footballers and are being held back; forced to witness their 
           leader’s demise. 

                                 BECKY
                        STOP!

           The entire carnival seems to be silenced by Becky’s guttural 
           wail.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Charlie and Berlice watch in suspense. They’ve witnessed a 
           bird’s eye view of the savagery. 

           They look to one another for a brief beat before redirecting 
           their attention to the drama below.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - NEAR FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Ben lets go of the bloody and defeated Casper and plods up to 
           Becky. 

           He grabs her cheeks with his right hand and looks deep into 
           her eyes, pulling her in close. She can smell his mixture of 
           body odor and Old Spice. 
                                 BEN
                        You’re a slut just like your 
                        sister, you know that?

           BOOM!

           Ben hits the pavement like a ton of bricks, revealing Casper 
           standing behind him -- rock in hand.

           Casper’s eyes are crazed and far away. This isn’t the same 
           boy we saw making love to Becky not too long ago.

           He falls to his knees beside Ben’s trembling body and smashes 
           Ben’s head repeatedly into the curb.

           BOOM!

           BOOM!

           BOOM!

           BOOM!

           FREEZE FRAME

           Casper’s face is contorted in hatred as he bashes Ben’s skull 
           against the pavement.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There were no longer any doubts 
                        that Casper Tatum was capable of 
                        cold blooded murder.

           BACK TO SCENE

           The crowd gathered around the showdown is silent and in awe 
           of the graphic warfare they just witnessed.

           Sirens BLARE in the distance. 

           The gravity of the situation dawns on Casper and he snaps out 
           of his violent spell. He looks up to Becky for rescue. 

           Becky herself is in a state of astonishment. There’s nothing 
           she can do for Casper.

           There’s nothing she can do for herself.

           Casper hops to his feet, runs to Becky and kisses her once 
           more. The kiss is short and sweet but filled with tragic 
           longing. Filled with lightning. 

                                 CASPER
                        I’ll come back for you. I promise.
           He runs off into the night. The Hillbilly Wolves follow after 
           him.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Charlie and Berlice are finally lowered from the top of the 
           ferris wheel.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - NEAR FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Hoffman and a half dozen POLICE OFFICERS make their way 
           through the throngs of people and break into the center of 
           the scene.

           There is blood covering the street like rain water. Ben’s 
           still, warm body twitches slightly on the ground. 

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Ben)
                        Bud. Man. Kirch. Can you hear me?! 

           Ben definitely can’t hear him.

           Becky stands frozen, unable to process what just happened. 
           She makes eye contact with Hoffman and begins to bawl.

           INT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

           Becky is driven home in the back of Hoffman’s squad car. Her 
           makeup runs down her soft, feminine face. 

           It’s been a long couple of months. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT

           Ben lays on a hospital bed on life support. Tubes run in and 
           out of his body. Machines surround him, monitoring his 
           fragile condition.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ben lived for a few days on life 
                        support. Best case scenario was 
                        that he would have been a vegetable 
                        for life.

           INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

           Charlie and the rest of the TOWN stand in line at yet another 
           funeral. This time for Ben.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They unplugged the machine on 
                        November 3 and he took fourteen 
                        breaths on his own before joining 
                        Chrissy and Mr. Pulaski in the 
                        apple pie in the Sky.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

           Casper cruises down the desolate American highways in the new 
           light of dawn.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Casper never came back to Colfax 
                        for Becky. But everyone had moved 
                        on from the murders. It was all 
                        pinned on him. His failure to 
                        materialize was yet another piece 
                        of evidence in support of his 
                        guilt. 

           INT. BERLICE’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Charlie and Berlice lay semi-nude under a blanket on a 
           crusty, old futon. They both look horrified.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I lost my virginity on Christmas 
                        Eve to Berlice in her basement. She 
                        bought me a Casio watch and I 
                        bought her a new Smith Corona.

           Berlice turns to Charlie.

                                 BERLICE
                        Umm, so, Merry Christmas.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Becky lays on her bed in the middle of a sunny afternoon. She 
           watches an old movie on a tiny tube television propped up on 
           the end of her night table.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Becky dropped out of school almost 
                        immediately following Halloween 
                        weekend and I didn’t see much of 
                        her for a very long time.
           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           We move down a desolate school corridor in the still minutes 
           before students arrive.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Seasons passed. Fall turned to 
                        winter. 

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Becky, wearing pajamas she’s probably worn for three days 
           straight, flips through a stack of records at the foot of her 
           bed. 

           She stops on an old, sun stained copy of The Beach Boy’s 
           Endless Summer LP. She takes it out of its jacket, blows the 
           dust off and lays it down on her turntable.

           She places the needle down on the groove. It CRACKLES for a 
           moment before a lush, dreamy Beach Boys melody brings warmth 
           and life to her empty room.

           She smiles.

           MONTAGE - EXT. TOWN OF COLFAX - DAY

           It is now winter. The streets and yards of Colfax are covered 
           in a thick blanket of powdery white snow. 

           In fact it’s snowing now.

           THE BEACH BOYS provide an ironic sense of lost summer to the 
           following images lifted from “A Charlie Brown Christmas”:

           I. Mr. Jablonski struggles to shovel the heavy, wet snow from 
           his driveway.

           II. Scores of KIDS sled on a giant hillside. 

           III. Dozens of CHILDREN ice skate on a frozen pond.

           IV. FAMILIES in town remove the Christmas decorations from 
           their houses.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Charlie cautiously drives his father’s Buick down the icy 
           suburban streets with Berlice. He isn’t used to the driving 
           conditions and is having trouble adapting. 
           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie and Berlice pull into Charlie’s driveway and exit the 
           vehicle. 

           As Charlie gets out, he looks up to Becky’s bedroom window 
           across the street -- its amber glow beckons him.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           The first Beach Boys song concludes and another takes its 
           place on Becky’s turntable.

           She is in the liminal state between sleep and wakefulness; 
           collapsed on a pile of bedding which is bundled up in the 
           corner of her room.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        In the last month, Becky had 
                        rediscovered her home. The 
                        forgotten corners; the 
                        imperfections in the drywall.

           She lights a cigarette and paints her toe nails. 

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           A load of laundry rumbles in the antique washer and dryer.

                        The safe smell of the laundry room 
                        and--

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           The still kitchen waits in the mid-afternoon for life to open 
           its drawers and cabinets.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        --that weird spot by the pantry 
                        where for some reason it was always 
                        cold.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - CLOSET - DAY

           Becky rips a magazine picture of pop star, Leif Garret, off 
           the wall of her closet. It reveals a giant, gaping hole. 
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She uncovered a hole in the wall in 
                        her closet from the time when 
                        Chrissy got so mad she kicked it. 
                        It was a secret they never told 
                        their parents; they covered it with 
                        a picture of Leif Garret from an 
                        issue of Tiger Beat.

           Becky covers the hole back up with the magazine photo.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Becky sashays across her teenage tomb. The Beach Boys 
           continue to play. 

           At the window, she opens the blinds with her fingers to peer 
           outside into the winter wonderland. Across the street she 
           spies Charlie and Berlice building a snow man. 

           It’s so cute she almost gags.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Becky counts the tiles in the bathroom while sitting in the 
           lukewarm tub. Her fingers are pruney and one gets the 
           impression she’s been in there for hours.

           LATER

           Becky stands in front of the mirror and looks at herself. She 
           grabs her thick brown hair and pulls it in front of her face, 
           disgusted. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Charlie and Berlice sit on two big bean bags playing his new 
           Atari system. There is much excitement over the back and 
           forth bouncing digital ball. 

           The doorbell RINGS. 

           Charlie pauses the game and makes his way to the door. 
           Berlice grabs Charlie’s controller and un-pauses it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Berlice, pause it. 

           She giggles. 
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious, pause it. That’s 
                        cheating.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie opens his front door to reveal Becky Monroe, the last 
           girl on Earth he’d expect, standing on his porch. 

           Although thin and sporting a short, self-cut hairstyle which 
           is dyed blonde, she is more beautiful than ever. She almost 
           looks like a heroin chic model. Smokey eyes and ennui.

           He is shocked by her presence; as if Chrissy Monroe was 
           standing there instead. In fact, Becky looks a lot like 
           Chrissy. She smiles at him -- a smile that communicates an 
           invisible trust and familiarity only old friends have.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, hi.

                                 BECKY
                        Hey.

           He notices she’s barefoot. She ran across the street and the 
           snow, without shoes on. 

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        I was just wondering if I could 
                        borrow some books. I’ve read all 
                        the ones at my house like three 
                        times over. Even my Dad’s boring 
                        stock market books. 

           Charlie struggles to wrap his head around the last twenty 
           seconds.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uhh, yeah, of course. Um, I’m kinda 
                        busy right now--

                                 BECKY
                        Yeah, I totally get it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, but, uh, I’ll run a few over 
                        later?! Cool?

                                 BECKY
                        Cool.

           Becky scurries back home; careful to retrace her exact 
           footprints in the snow. 
           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Charlie sits back down next to Berlice and un-pauses the 
           game.

                                 BERLICE
                        Who was that?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No one. I’m not counting that last 
                        game. You cheated.

           Berlice kisses Charlie on the cheek.

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie tears apart his bookshelves trying to find the right 
           books to give Becky. Books that he thinks say a lot about 
           himself.

           He puts them in a small cardboard box. 

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie exits his home and runs through the freezing air, 
           crossing the street to the Monroe’s. The box of books fumbles 
           in his scrawny arms. 

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie rings the doorbell. He is somehow out of breath from 
           the brief trek over.

           After a moment, Mr. Monroe answers the door. He is smoking a 
           pipe and sporting an unbuttoned dress shirt which exposes a 
           an abundance of old school chest hair. 

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Hello, Charles.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (nervous)
                        Hi, Sir. Um, Becky came over and 
                        asked for these books. So, here.

           Charlie extends the box to Mr. Monroe. He takes them, 
           curiously. 

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Becky left the house today?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes. 

                                 MR. MONROE
                        Okay. Well I’ll make sure she gets 
                        them. Good night.

           Mr. Monroe closes the door. Charlie sprints back home.

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S ROOM - DAY

           Becky sits at her desk with her legs propped up on a chair, 
           reading Charlie’s copy of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

           She underlines a portion.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Becky underlined sentences in my 
                        paperbacks as though she owned 
                        them.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           The doorbell RINGS.

           Charlie answers the door to see Becky standing on the porch 
           with a stack of his books. 

                                 BECKY
                        I have a few left to read. These 
                        were great, though. Thanks.

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Charlie flips through his copy of Huck Finn, inspecting 
           Becky’s annotations. He is puzzled by them.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She seemed to understand them in a 
                        way it took me years to and in some 
                        cases, still don’t.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           Charlie and Becky go on a walk through the snowy streets. 
           Charlie is overly enthusiastic. We can’t make out exactly 
           what Charlie is saying though he definitely has a lot say.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We talked about the texts after she 
                        read them.

                                 BECKY
                        I don’t think that’s what the 
                        author is trying to say at all, 
                        Charlie. I think that he’s saying 
                        there’s no such thing as love. That 
                        it’s a fleeting, meaningless 
                        invention of mankind. And that 
                        ultimately we are alone. We came 
                        into this world alone and we will 
                        die alone.  

           Becky says that last bit with almost zero sentimentality. She 
           speaks as though they’re debating a math problem and not a 
           fundamental human quandary. 

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        You hungry?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s not the way I read it at 
                        all. 

                                 BECKY
                        Is Burger Heaven still open? 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER ROOM - DAY

           Charlie and Berlice sit in the newsroom during an editorial 
           meeting. Berlice stares at Charlie the entire time. He 
           doesn’t look her way once.

           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Charlie exits the school and makes way for his car through 
           the tundra. 

                                 BERLICE (O.S.)
                        Charlie!

           Charlie turns around to see Berlice jogging toward him.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (oh, shit)
                        Oh hey, Berlice.

           She stops beside him and they continue to walk.
                                 BERLICE
                        Where have you been lately? I’ve 
                        been brushing up on my Pong skills. 
                        I’ll bet I can beat you now.

           She playfully kicks him on the butt.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I haven’t really played in a 
                        while. Been really busy. 

                                 BERLICE
                        Well my friends and I were going to 
                        go see “Broadway Danny Rose” 
                        tomorrow night at The Americana. Do 
                        you wanna come? 

           They reach Charlie’s car and stand at it for a moment. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sheesh, I’d love to go but I might 
                        have this thing.

                                 BERLICE
                        Oh. Ok. I thought you loved Woody 
                        Allen, though.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I mean I do. I’m just kinda, like, 
                        getting sick of him.

           Berlice looks devastated.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway -- we’ll catch a flick soon. 
                        Promise.

           Charlie ducks into his car, starts the engine and drives off. 
           Berlice watches him disappear out of the parking lot. 

           Once he is gone Berlice marches toward her own car, fumbles 
           with the keys and drops them in a puddle of melted snow. 

           She retrieves the wet keys and gets inside the cold car. She 
           puts her head in her hands and begins to bawl. 

           Teenage heartbreak at its purest.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Charlie and Becky cruise down the snowy streets of Colfax 
           listening to the radio and singing along to, you guessed it, 
           The Beach Boys.

                        Becky and I became friends again 
                        during that Midwestern winter. We 
                        cruised around in my car beneath 
                        newspaper skies and smoke stained 
                        snow, listening to the Beach Boys.

           MONTAGE

           Charlie and Becky explore the sugar-coated suburb. It’s an 
           almost post-apocolyptic wasteland and they are the only 
           humans crazy enough to brave the cold.

                                 NARRATOR
                        It was like we were nine again; 
                        except we could drive and we didn’t 
                        have curfews and Chrissy was dead.

           I. They make snow angels in a hillside.

           II. They do donuts with Charlie’s car in an empty, icy 
           parking lot.

           III. They pour soda pop into cups of snow and make homemade 
           Slurpees.

           IV. They shop for records in a hole-in-the-wall record store.

           V. They go see “Broadway Danny Rose.”

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Becky and Charlie sit and scarf down cheeseburgers in the 
           parking lot of a fast food restaurant. They both discuss 
           “Broadway Danny Rose.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I mean it wasn’t “Annie Hall” 
                        or “Manhattan” but the Gordon 
                        Willis cinematography was great and 
                        it had some really funny moments.

                                 BECKY
                        I thought it was stupid. I mean a 
                        black and white comedy in 1984 
                        about some talent manager’s 
                        misadventures. So pretentious. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.
           Charlie watches as Becky takes a big bite of her 
           cheeseburger. The bite is more than she can handle and she 
           takes a moment to compose herself.

                                 BECKY
                        Sorry. So hungry.

           It is a split second of imperfection but Charlie seems to be 
           more attracted to her than ever.

                                 CHARLIE
                        When we were nine, I had the 
                        biggest crush on you. You kissed me 
                        at your parents’ party and then you 
                        kissed Mark Monaghan the next 
                        weekend and I was devastated.

                                 BECKY
                             (chewing)
                        What?! Mark Monaghan?! That’s 
                        fucking disgusting. I don’t 
                        remember that at all. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. It was pretty brutal.

           Becky frowns an exaggerated frown. Somehow though, it is 
           sincere and not mocking.

                                 BECKY
                        I’m sorry, Chuck. If it’s any 
                        condolence, I at least remember 
                        kissing you; not Mark. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Please. 

           Becky gets a bright idea. She rummages through Charlie’s 
           glove compartment.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 BECKY
                        I’m looking for gum.

           Becky finds an old, wrapped up Ring-Pop underneath the car’s 
           owner’s manual. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s really old.

           Becky unwraps it and starts sucking on it.
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? You’re not even 
                        done with your french fries.

           Becky plops the Ring-Pop out of her mouth momentarily.  

                                 BECKY
                        I’m gonna kiss you.

           She puts the Ring-Pop back in. Charlie didn’t see that one 
           coming.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You are?!

                                 BECKY
                             (still sucking)
                        Yes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why?!

                                 BECKY
                             (still sucking)
                        To make up for Mark Monaghan.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you sure?

                                 BECKY
                        Shut up.

           Becky drops the Ring-Pop to the floor and grabs the back of 
           Charlie’s head, pulling his face toward hers.

           Their lips meet. The kiss is somewhere between a peck and a 
           french kiss. There’s tongue but barely. Just enough to be 
           ambiguous.

           It is over almost as soon as it begins but it staggers 
           Charlie.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Her mouth tasted like cherry ring-
                        pops and cigarettes.

           Once the kiss is over Charlie almost immediately picks up the 
           Ring-Pop from the car’s carpeting.

                                 CHARLIE
                        My dad would kill me if I ruined 
                        the interior.
           INT. CAR - NIGHT 

           Charlie drives Becky home. They are both silent but 
           comfortable. 

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie pulls into Becky’s driveway and puts the car in park. 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Becky and Charlie sit still for a moment in her driveway. 
           Neither want the night to be over.

           There is a long silence.

           They both LAUGH. 

                                 BECKY
                        I had a fun night with you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Me too. 

                                 BECKY
                        Thanks.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Anytime.

           Becky grabs Charlie’s hand for just a second.

                                 BECKY
                        See you tomorrow?

                                 CHARLIE
                        See you tomorrow.

           She lets go of his hand and exits the car. Charlie watches 
           her as she lights a cigarette and begins smoking it on the 
           porch.

           She waves to him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I wouldn’t see Becky Monroe the 
                        next day. Or ever again.

           Charlie backs the car out of Becky’s driveway and pulls it 
           into his own driveway across the street.
           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie exits the car and enters his home.

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie lays in bed with a smirk glued to his face. He is 
           unable to sleep. He stares at the ceiling fan and thinks 
           about Becky.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But that night I planned our lives 
                        together in my head.

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Becky stands on her porch in the freezing cold sucking down a 
           cigarette. 

           Across the street and a couple houses down, Mr. Jablonski 
           shovels snow from his driveway. He sees her on the porch and 
           waves her over.

           Becky looks around, confused. She points at herself as if to 
           say “me?”

           Mr. Jablonski shakes his head, “yes.”

           Becky rolls her eyes and reluctantly makes her way toward Mr. 
           Jablonski, “what a creep-o.”

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We’d both go to the same college 
                        and have dorm rooms on the same 
                        floor.

           EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY (SUPER 8MM HOME MOVIE) 

           Becky and Charlie carry cardboard boxes full of their 
           belongings through a sunny, crowded college campus. 

           INT. DORMATORY - DAY (SUPER 8MM HOME MOVIE) 

           Becky helps Charlie hang a poster on his cramped dorm room 
           wall. She puts books upon his shelf. They wave to the camera. 
           She shows the camera the book she’s holding, Huck Finn.
           EXT. SEASIDE BLUFF - DAY (SUPER 8MM HOME MOVIE) 

           Charlie and Becky, both in their mid-twenties, stand in 
           wedding garments before a PRIEST at an outdoor alter. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Then once we graduated we’d get 
                        married on a bluff overlooking the 
                        sea in California. Some place nice. 
                        Some place where we could get away 
                        from the idiot Midwest cold.

           A small CONGREGATION of family and friends watch as Becky and 
           Charlie kiss one another and finalize their wedding vows.

           EXT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Becky approaches Mr. Jablonski in front of his house. He is 
           huffing and puffing from shoveling the snow.

                                 BECKY
                        Hi. Do you need help, Sir?

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        Help? No. I have a question. You 
                        like records?

                                 BECKY
                        Uhh, yeah.

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        K, good. I have my daughter’s old 
                        ones in the attic.

                                 BECKY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        Sorry. I can be thick sometimes. 
                        I’m asking, do you want them? 
                        They’re collecting dust and I’m 
                        gonna throw them out otherwise. I 
                        saw you over there and thought I’d 
                        ask. 

                                 BECKY
                             (not sure)
                        Sure.

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        You shouldn’t smoke by the way. 
                        Killed my brother. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY (SUPER 8MM HOME MOVIE) 

           Charlie and Becky, both as adults, play with two small 
           CHILDREN in the living room of a large, warm house.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We’d have two kids -- a boy and a 
                        girl -- and we’d name them after 
                        characters in our favorite books. 
                        We’d raise them in a nice house 
                        where food was always cooking and 
                        music was always playing. I’d 
                        become a famous writer and Becky, a 
                        painter. We’d serve as each other’s 
                        muses.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY (SUPER 8MM HOME MOVIE) 

           Becky stirs spaghetti sauce and playfully flicks some on 
           whoever’s holding the camera, presumably Charlie. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie’s eyes begin to close; he’s drifting off to sleep.

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Mr. Jablonski and Becky stomp snow off their shoes as they 
           enter Mr. Jablonski’s dark, musky home. She’s not sure why 
           she agreed to come in. The place gives her the creeps.

           She looks around the house, suspiciously.

                                 BECKY
                        Where’s Mrs. Jablonski?

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        Away on business. The records are 
                        just upstairs.

           He leads her up the low lit stairway. 

           Each step CREAKS as they ascend past family photos and 
           memories hung on the wall.

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

           Mr. Jablonski waits for Becky at the second floor landing. 
           It’s even darker than the first floor.
                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        I’m gonna go grab a flashlight, 
                        it’s kinda dark up there. I’ll meet 
                        you. Just follow those stairs up.

           Mr. Jablonski points to a spiral staircase in the corner of 
           the hallway. 

                                 BECKY
                        You know what, I’ll come back 
                        tomorrow.

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        Don’t be crazy, their right up 
                        there. 

           He points to the staircase once more. She decides to go 
           onward. Mr. Jablonski disappears into the shadows and Becky 
           tip-toes down the hallway toward the spiral stairs.

           She reaches them and slowly climbs. Each tin step CLINKS and 
           CLANKS as she rises.

           At the top she sees a shut door, with light escaping at the 
           crack beneath. 

                                 BECKY
                             (yelling)
                        Mr. Jablonski I don’t think you 
                        need a flashlight -- the light is 
                        on here. 

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                             (right behind her)
                        Oh, good.

           Becky SCREAMS. Mr. Jablonski somehow is directly behind her. 
           She didn’t notice him approach.

                                 MR. JABLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Go on in.

           She takes the three more steps up to the top. 

           CLICK.

           CLACK.

           CLICK.

           She hesitates as she put her hand on the doorknob.

                                 MR. JABLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Go on. The boxes are right there.
           She twists the door handle and opens into--

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

           --a completely empty attic. 

           No boxes. No anything. Insulation and two-by-fours. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie’s eyes close completely. He is fast asleep.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And then we’d grow old and die 
                        together.

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

           The circumstances dawn on Becky instantaneously. Her face is 
           flush. 

           Just then, Mr. Jablonski pulls a leather belt over her neck 
           and tightens. 

           We only see a split second of her struggle but we get the 
           picture. 

           EXT. BEACH - DAY (SUPER 8MM HOME MOVIE) 

           Becky and Charlie, as senior citizens, sit next to one 
           another on the beach and watch the sun set over a sorbet sky. 

           The film burns out. 

           EXT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The garage door opens and Mr. Jablonski’s wood-panneled 
           station wagon pulls out into the gothic black air. 

           EXT. RESERVOIR - NIGHT

           Mr. Jablonski opens the back door of his station wagon and 
           pulls out a heavy black garbage bag. He has a separate duffle 
           bag slung across his shoulder.

           He drags the garbage bag through the snowy field, tracing a 
           line from his car to the reservoir ahead. The same reservoir 
           where Olivia Cooper drowned over the Fourth of July.
           As Mr. Jablonski approaches the body of water he puts the 
           garbage bag down and opens his duffle bag -- removing two 
           25lbs dumbbell's and a roll of duct tape. 

           He tapes the dumbbells to either end of the garbage bag and 
           pushes it into the murky water. 

           The garbage bag sinks immediately between two chunks of ice. 

           Mr. Jablonski watches as it disappears. He looks up to the 
           horizon and takes in the sight of the prairie decay. 

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie carries over a new box of books. He knocks on the 
           door. No one answers.

           After some time, he leaves the box on the porch and walks 
           back home -- periodically looking back at Chrissy’s bedroom 
           window, confused. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSPAPER ROOM - DAY

           Charlie battles a case of writer’s block at his desk in the 
           newsroom. He hears GIGGLING and turns around to see-

           -Berlice and GLEN (17), coauthoring an article at a desk 
           behind him. There is clearly some flirtation going on between 
           them.

           He turns back around to the blank piece of paper sitting atop 
           his typewriter. 

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - PAYPHONE - DAY

           Charlie dials on the school’s payphone. He listens as it 
           rings a few times and then goes to voicemail.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (into phone)
                        Hi Mr. and Mrs. Monroe. This is 
                        Charlie Chambers. I was wondering 
                        if you could have Becky call me 
                        when she can. I’ll be home after 
                        school today.

           EXT. RESERVOIR - DAY

           A JOGGER and her BLACK LAB run through the empty park. 
           As the path weaves near the lake, the jogger spots something 
           in the water.

           She jogs in place and squints her eyes to make out what 
           exactly it is that she sees.  

           CLOSE ON

           Blonde locks of tangled hair float at the surface of the lake 
           covered in seaweed and ice. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           The jogger lets out a blood curdling SCREAM.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Charlie drives down his block, in the distance he can see 
           dozens of police cars surrounding the Monroe’s house. 

           He stops the car as he approaches the barricade.

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - DAY

           In a spell, Charlie exits the car and runs toward the house. 

           Through the crowd of POLICEMEN, he spots Hoffman consoling a 
           delirious Mrs. Monroe sitting on the snowy lawn, crying. Mr. 
           Monroe sits with his head in his hands on the porch.

           Charlie taps a SPECTATOR on the shoulder.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you know what happened?

                                 SPECTATOR
                        The girl who lived here died.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?!

                                 SPECTATOR 
                        Did you know her?

           Hoffman makes eye contact with Charlie and nods to him. A 
           comforting nod that communicates the answer to any question 
           Charlie might have. He’s seen all he needs to see.

           He begins to walk back to his house, staggered.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s amazing where your mind will 
                        wander in moments of profound 
                        grief. I can remember walking home 
                        and thinking about hot dogs and the 
                        ending of Rocky and the way my 
                        favorite pair of Levi’s no longer 
                        fit quite right. I remembered 
                        everything but her. 

           As Charlie walks back to his house, he spots his Father 
           standing stoically with his arms crossed in the front yard. 
           The sight of him is the straw that break’s the camel’s back. 
           Charlie begins to cry as he trudges into his Father’s open 
           arms, desperate for comfort.

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - ATTIC - DAY

           Mr. Jablonski washes his attic with a bucket of soap and 
           water. There is a paranoid, obsessive quality to his rigorous 
           scrubbing.

           MONTAGE - NEWS REPORTS - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           You know the drill.

           News-reports of the murder are seen on television sets in 
           various homes. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOFFMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Again, Charlie sits before Hoffman’s desk. He is a much 
           different person than the naive boy we first met.

           He tells Hoffman of his last moments with Becky.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And then, we, uh, kissed. And she 
                        said we’d see each other tomorrow.

           There is a KNOCK at the door and Hoffman’s SECRETARY enters 
           the room half-way.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Can I get you guys anything from 
                        the Rec room?

                                 HOFFMAN
                        I’m fine. Chambers?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Coffee. Black. Please. 

           INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

           Charlie, once again, waits with his buddies and the rest of 
           the TOWN in line at Becky’s wake. 

           He lays a flower atop the closed casket before he kneels and 
           says a silent prayer. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The funeral parlor couldn’t make 
                        her look like herself and so again 
                        it was a closed casket.

           FLASHBACK - INT. MORGUE - DAY 

           Becky’s body lays on a steel bed under a harsh white light. 
           Her face is bloated and her skin is green but she retains an 
           odd beauty and a certain peacefulness. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie sits on the edge of his bed and bawls his eyes out. 
           It’s the kind of cry you only have once or twice in your life 
           past the age of twelve.

           LATER

           With his suit and tie still on, Charlie crawls beneath his 
           comforter and welcomes some much needed shut eye.

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Mr. Jablonski awakes the next day to another overcast winter 
           morning. Mrs. Jablonski lies next to him, still sleeping.

           He gets out of bed and yawns.

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Mr. Jablonski brushes his teeth and gargles mouth wash.

           INT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Mr. Jablonski, wearing a blue robe, pours himself a bowl of 
           Frosted Flakes and a cup of coffee.
           He takes a seat at the kitchen table, eats his breakfast and 
           skims the morning newspaper.

           It is a particularly still morning. The clock on the wall-- 

           TICK. 

           TOCK.

           TICK.

           BOOM!

           Glass SHATTERS.

           Doors are KICKED open.

           Suddenly there are ten POLICE OFFICERS surrounding Mr. 
           Jablonski in mid-bite. Their guns are drawn and they’re ready 
           to fire.

           Hoffman emerges in the middle of all this and presents his 
           badge to Mr. Jablonski.

           Mr. Jablonski finishes chewing and smiles. 

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie watches from his yard as Mr. Jablonski is escorted 
           from his house and into the back of a police car.

           Mr. Jablonski makes long eye-contact with Charlie. Time stops 
           temporarily.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Mr. Jablonski, my neighbor growing 
                        up -- and the man who was known 
                        throughout town for his ability to 
                        grow the tallest sunflowers -- also 
                        happened to be a murderer.

           INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

           Mr. Jablonski and his ATTORNEYS stand at the front of a 
           packed courtroom as the JURY reads their sentencing.

                                 JUROR
                        George Melvin Jablonski, the court 
                        finds you guilty on all three 
                        counts of murder.

           There are wild CHEERS from the CONGREGATION.
           The JUDGE bangs his gavel.

           BANG!

           BANG!

           BANG!

           FLASHBACK - INT. BANK - DAY

           Mr. Jablonski waltzes into your average, everyday bank and 
           approaches a female TELLER (22).

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He was caught by Miranda 
                        Frankenstein, an employee at the 
                        City Center Bank.

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                             (to Teller)
                        I’d like to see my safe deposit 
                        box.

           FLASHBACK - INT. BANK - SAFE DEPOSIT ROOM - DAY

           Mr. Jablonski is showed to his safe deposit box by the 
           TELLER. 

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        I’d like some privacy.

                                 TELLER
                        Sir, it’s actually mandatory-

                                 MR. JABLONSKI
                        I said I would like some privacy. 
                        Please.

           The Teller politely smiles and exits the room. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She had witnessed him putting a 
                        bloody piece of fabric into his 
                        safe deposit box and called the 
                        police.

           Once the coast is clear, Mr. Jablonski, pulls a blood stained 
           piece of fabric out of his back pocket, opens his safe 
           deposit box and drops it inside. 

           CLOSE ON
           The Teller peers through a crack in the door leading to the 
           safe deposit room. Her eyes are wide in terror.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Along with the bloody fabric the 
                        police found one of Chrissy’s teeth 
                        and a handwritten, sealed 
                        confession which talked of his 
                        sinister plan--

           INSERT - CONTENTS OF SAFE DEPOSIT BOX

           A sealed envelope rests beside Chrissy’s molar. 

           FLASHBACK - EXT. MR. JABLONSKI’S HOUSE - DAY

           It is summer again. Mr. Jablonski waters his famous 
           sunflowers and studies Chrissy and Becky sunbathing in their 
           front lawn, minding their own business and ignorant to the 
           fate which awaits them. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        --to kill the two beautiful bundles 
                        of life that he saw alive in that 
                        home every day. Two girls whose 
                        sheer youthful audacity he could 
                        not help but correct.

           FLASH FORWARD - INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           DR. MATSAS (55), a stocky, Greek, mustached psychologist, 
           looks into the lens of the camera and speaks.

           It is a super campy, pop-psy explanation of psychopathology. 

                                 DR. MATSAS
                        In the case of George Jablonski, 
                        the desire to kill came seemingly 
                        out of nowhere. In fact this isn’t 
                        uncommon among serial killers. 

           INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

           We follow behind Mr. Jablonski as he’s walked through a 
           prison by three SECURITY GUARDS. He wears a freshly pressed 
           orange jumpsuit and brandishes an array of handcuffs.

                                 DR. MATSAS (V.O.)
                        It can come in one’s old age for

                        must...kill.

                        A year and a half after Jablonski’s 
                        arrest, Detective Hoffman retired.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           A hundred INDIVIDUALS gather in a tacky banquet hall in honor 
           of Detective Hoffman’s retiring. 

           His FRIEND speaks at a podium at the front of the room.

                                 HOFFMAN’S FRIEND

                        the previous speakers haven’t said 
                        already? He’s a man of courage. Of 
                        kindness. He’s the kind of man they 
                        just don’t make anymore. A real

           Hoffman looks around the room from his table and wonders how 
           it is that he got so old. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Hoffman wanders the burnt forest where Mr. Pulaski and 
           Chrissy were killed. What little remains from the memorial is 
           covered in snow, dirt and ash.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The arsonists were finally 
                        apprehended. It turned out to be 
                        Tyler and Wes, the delinquents who 
                        tried to pin the murders on Casper. 
                        They were caught dosing a school 
                        bus with lighter fluid late one 
                        night. 
           EXT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Wes and Tyler, wearing their trenchcoat uniforms, spray a 
           school bus with lighter fluid from a squirt gun. 

           Police SIRENS sound. They try to run but they’re surrounded 
           by squad cars.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They had no motive other than it 
                        being fun.

           LATER

           Wes and Tyler are shoved into the back of the squad cars. 
           They are smiling.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Casper, a bit older than when we last saw him, cruises down 
           yet another long, hard stretch of American pavement on his 
           Triumph. 

           He has a handlebar mustache and his hair hangs down to his 
           shoulders. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Casper Tatum evaded the law for six 
                        years. His body was brought back 
                        home in 1989 after he was found 
                        dead from an overdose.

           EXT. RAMADA INN - DAY

           The most depressing motel to ever be erected sits on a small 
           stretch of highway in some shit hole Texas town. 

           INT. RAMADA INN - NIGHT

           Casper, completely naked, fills a large, deflated green 
           balloon with enough cocaine to kill an elephant. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Apparently, he had filled a balloon 
                        with cocaine, wrapped--

           INT. RAMADA INN - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Casper sits down in the bathtub, turns on the faucet and 
           pulls the balloon over his head.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        --it around his head in the 
                        bathroom of a Ramada Inn in Dallas, 
                        Texas, and snorted until he saw 
                        God.

           We push in on him rapidly as he sniffs and sniffs and sniffs.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT (2006)

           Charlie, as a middle-aged man, sits at a banquet table in the 
           gym of his old high school. He is surrounded by former 
           CLASSMATES who appear to have grown into their parents. 
           Unlike them, Charlie has retained a certain amount of 
           vitality and youth.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The Monroe sisters didn’t show up 
                        to the twenty year high school 
                        reunion.

           INSERT - SIGN

           A sign in the foyer of the high school directs ALUMNI to the 
           gymnasium. It says “Colfax High -- Class of ‘86 -- 20 
           Years...ALREADY?!”

           BACK TO SCENE 

           The camera pushes in on a large display of photographs 
           hanging on a wall in the gym.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Their photos hung next to others 
                        who had passed away in the two 
                        decades since high school let out.

           The camera stops on a close-up of a photograph of the Monroe 
           sisters.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Monroe left town 
                        shortly after Becky’s death and a 
                        new family moved in.

           EXT. MONROE HOUSE - NIGHT

           A moving truck pulls up to the Monroe’s house followed by a 
           station wagon full of a new FAMILY. They all excitedly exit 
           the vehicle and jump up and down into their new home. 
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I fell in love with the girl who 
                        took Becky’s old bedroom. 

           INT. MONROE HOUSE - BECKY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie and PRUDENCE (17) lay semi-nude underneath the covers 
           of her bed. Charlie is much more at ease with the situation 
           since the last time we saw him in these circumstances.

           He inspects the details of the room as she falls asleep on 
           his chest. It doesn’t resemble Becky’s version of the space 
           at all. All signs of her have been erased. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        What was the girl like who used to 
                        live here?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I didn’t really know her. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Was she pretty?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not as pretty as you.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        In fact, I wound up marrying her.

           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT (2006)

           Charlie and Prudence, as adults, sit at a banquet table and 
           watch as a SPEAKER gives an overly sentimental speech about 
           “getting older.”

           Charlie excuses himself.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (whispered; to Prudence)
                        I’m gonna use the bathroom. I can’t 
                        take another minute of this shit. 

           Charlie stands from the table, throws his napkin on his chair 
           and heads for the exit.

           He spots Berlice, who hasn’t changed much since she was 
           sixteen. In fact she’s wearing the same exact pair of eye 
           glasses. 

           They smile and nod to one another. 
           INT. COLFAX HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT (2006)

           Charlie meanders through the empty hallways of his high 
           school. His polished wingtips reverberate through the 
           corridor. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I never forgot the events of that 
                        year though. No one did. 

           Charlie stops before a locker. His locker. One that used to 
           belong to him anyway. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But life goes on. We come of age in 
                        spite of and because of adversity 
                        and every night when the street 
                        lights go on in Colfax, ghosts roam 
                        the avenues looking for salvation

           Charlie tries to unlock the locker with his old combo: 43 - 9 
           - 14. It doesn’t open.

           He smiles to himself and struts away.

                                                        PAINT IT BLACK:
