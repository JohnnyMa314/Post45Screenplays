           INT. MALL - DAY

           A crowded shopping mall, late afternoon. Along walks a 
           BUSINESSMAN carrying a briefcase.

           A TEENAGE GIRL suddenly comes sprinting through the atrium 
           with a crazed look in her eyes. As she runs by she SLAMS into 
           the man’s arm, spins around, GRABS him by his suit jacket.

                                 MAN
                        Uh--

                                 GIRL
                        What’s the date?

                                 MAN
                        What?

                                 GIRL
                        The date!

                                 MAN
                             (bewildered)
                        Uh. The 30th. March 30th.

                                 GIRL
                        What year?

                                 MAN

           The girl is profoundly relieved.

                                 GIRL
                        Oh, thank God. Thank God. It 
                        worked.

                                 MAN
                        What--

           The girl sprints away, out of the man’s sight. He just stands 
           there, utterly baffled.

           INT. MALL

           She’s behind an escalator now. Two other kids, MITCH and KEN, 
           each hand her five dollars. The girl’s name is GIA.

                                 GIA
                        What next?
                                 MITCH
                        Do the baby thing. I love the baby 
                        thing.

           INT. STORE - SOON AFTER

           Gia’s pushing a BABY STROLLER through an upscale clothing 
           store, pretending to shop. From elsewhere in the store, Mitch 
           and Ken watch her, clandestine-like.

           A WOMAN peruses the merchandise a few feet away. She glances 
           at Gia, then at the stroller, then back at Gia. She looks 
           puzzled. Shakes it off. Keeps shopping, looks back at the 
           stroller, finally decides to say something--

                                 WOMAN
                        Um. Excuse me.

           Gia pretends not to hear.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me. Hey.

                                 GIA
                             (turning)
                        Yeah?

                                 WOMAN
                        Uh... your--

           She points at the stroller.

                                 GIA
                        Sorry?

                                 WOMAN
                        Your... your stroller.

                                 GIA
                        What about it?

           She’s deliberately drawing this out to attract onlookers. 
           It’s working.

                                 WOMAN
                        It’s, uh... it’s empty.

                                 GIA
                        What?

                                 WOMAN
                        Your stroller is empty.
           Gia steps around to the front of the stroller to see for 
           herself. Sheer panic seizes her face. She unleashes a BLOOD-
           CURDLING SCREAM.

           INT. FOOD COURT

           Gia and Mitch are eating. Mitch is writing something on a pad 
           of paper.

                                 GIA
                        So my dad's doing the campaign for 
                        this movie, it's coming out next 
                        year. It's about -- honest to God -- 
                        it's about a bus that'll explode if 
                        it goes slower than fifty miles per 
                        hour.

           Mitch looks up and chews thoughtfully.

                                 MITCH
                        That’s either the coolest or the 
                        dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. I’m 
                        not sure which.

           INT. STORE

           Ken’s in a baby goods store next to the food court, standing 
           at the counter with the stroller from earlier.

                                 CASHIER
                        Didn’t you just buy this like ten 
                        minutes ago?

                                 KEN
                        Yes. Good memory.

                                 CASHIER
                        Why are you returning it?

                                 KEN
                        I remembered I don’t have a baby.

           INT. FOOD COURT

           Gia stuffs a handful of fries in her mouth.

                                 GIA
                             (nodding toward notepad)
                        What’s that?
                                 MITCH
                        You know. The thing.

                                 GIA
                        What thing?

                                 MITCH
                             (looking up)
                        Whitman’s class. The writing 
                        assignment.

           Gia stares blankly.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        The-- the assignment that’s worth 
                        twenty percent of our grade? Pick 
                        your favorite book and write the 
                        next chapter?

                                 GIA
                        Oh yeah. That.

                                 MITCH
                        You have no idea what I’m talking 
                        about.

                                 GIA
                        Nope.

                                 MITCH
                        Well. You’ve got...
                             (checks watch)
                        ... fifteen and a half hours. To 
                        write two thousand words.

                                 GIA
                        Deadlines are just suggestions.

           As he goes back to writing, Mitch smiles in a way that says 
           both “I really like you” and “You really don’t get it.”

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        So what’s your book?

                                 MITCH
                        Nineteen Eighty-Four.

           Gia leans back.

                                 GIA
                        “On second thought, maybe he didn’t 
                        love Big Brother after all...”

           Mitch laughs.
           EXT. BUS STOP

           Gia and Mitch are making out like the world is ending. Ken 
           watches them with the look of a scientist observing animals 
           in captivity.

           A bus approaches. Mitch opens his eyes mid-makeout to read 
           the number.

                                 MITCH
                        Oh, shit. This is the 2017.

                                 GIA
                        Fuck.

           She grabs her backpack and kisses Mitch one last time.

                                 MITCH
                        Love you.

                                 GIA
                        Course you do.

           She hurries onto the bus. Mitch notices Ken staring at him 
           with a faint smile.

                                 MITCH
                        What?

           Ken just shakes his head and looks away.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        You know, there was a time when she 
                        was only barely out of my league.

                                 KEN
                        What happened?

                                 MITCH
                        She got insanely hot, I just got a 
                        few inches taller.

           INT. GIA’S PLACE - EVENING

                                 GIA
                        Hey. I’m home.

           Her home is a high-rise condo, more like someone’s bachelor 
           pad than a place for a family.

           She enters the kitchen. It’s messy. Her dad, TOM, is there, 
           staring into a chunky proto-laptop.
                                 TOM
                        Hey kid. Where you been?

           She starts going through the pile of mail.

                                 GIA
                        You know. Hanging out with Mitch.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah? Where?

           She looks at him.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        What? You really wanna try to tell 
                        me not to keep tabs on you? You 
                        wanna know how fucking embarrassing 
                        it is when my assistant gets a call 
                        from the police--

                                 GIA
                        Fine. Jesus. We were at the mall.

           She stares at him, mostly with concern. He starts pacing.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, yeah, it’s, uh-- sorry. I’m 
                        sorry. It’s just work, you know?

           She looks skeptical. He turns to her, tries to smile, surveys 
           her grunge-inflected outfit.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        See, now here’s what I don’t get. 
                        The holes in the jeans. What’s that 
                        supposed to prove?

                                 GIA
                        That you don’t care.

                                 TOM
                        But you do care. You cut holes in 
                        your jeans.

           She finds something interesting in the mail.

                                 GIA
                             (holding up envelope)
                        What’s this?

                                 TOM
                        Uh...
                             (squints)
                        Oh. From Universal. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Passes to the first test screening 
                        of, uh, Spielberg’s dinosaur thing. 
                        It’s tomorrow I think.

                                 GIA
                        Why is it in the middle of the day?

                                 TOM
                        They just pull tourists off the 
                        street and ask ‘em if they wanna 
                        see a free movie. You get the best 
                        samples in the early afternoon.

                                 GIA
                        Are you going?

                                 TOM
                        Nah, I don’t need to. The thing’s 
                        tracking huge. Even if it’s a total 
                        shitpile it’ll make a billion 
                        dollars.

           He loosens his tie. Gia’s still examining the passes.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You okay with pizza for dinner? I 
                        get the feeling neither of us feels 
                        like cooking.

                                 GIA
                             (absently)
                        Yeah, I’ll order.

                                 TOM
                        Thanks.
                             (yawns)
                        Wake me up when it’s here.

           He stumbles into his room and collapses on the bed. Gia 
           stuffs the passes in her pocket.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

           Mitch is opening his locker. Ken walks up.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey.

           Ken nods hello. As Mitch dumps his books, he’s greeted two or 
           three times by other students walking by. None of them 
           acknowledge Ken.
                                 KEN
                        Like I’m not even here. If I had 
                        feelings they’d be hurt right now.

                                 MITCH
                        People like you. I think they just 
                        find you intimidating.

                                 KEN
                        I don’t think they find me at all.
                             (beat)
                        I need some breakfast.

           He wanders off toward a candy machine. Mitch slams his locker 
           shut, revealing GIA leaning against the neighboring one.

                                 MITCH
                        ... How long have you been standing 
                        there?

           There’s a gleam in her eye.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        What?

           She smiles.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 GIA
                        We’re not going to school today.

                                 MITCH
                        We’re not?

                                 GIA
                        We’re going on an adventure.

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah? What kind of adventure?

           She wordlessly reaches into her pocket and hands him one of 
           the tickets to the test screening.

                                 GIA
                             (sultry)
                        65 million years in the making.

                                 MITCH
                             (reading ticket)
                        Whoa.
                                 GIA
                        We’re gonna be the first in the 
                        world to see the dinosaurs.

                                 MITCH
                        Okay, but-- but we can’t cut 
                        school. I can’t.

           Gia rolls her eyes.

                                 GIA
                        Why? Because then you won’t get 
                        into Yale?

                                 MITCH
                        Well... yeah.

                                 GIA
                        Genius: they only catch you if they 
                        catch you. Which is never. They 
                        don’t care. This isn’t Ferris 
                        Bueller.

           Mitch doesn’t quite buy this logic.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        God, you’re screwed up. What’s it 
                        like to think rules exist?

           Ken returns, chewing on a candy bar.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Here. Watch.
                             (to Ken)
                        Do you wanna cut class today to go 
                        to Westwood for the first ever test 
                        screening of Jurassic Park?

                                 KEN
                             (mouth full)
                        Yeah, okay.

           Gia looks at Mitch expectantly.

                                 MITCH
                        Look. It’s not that I don’t want 
                        to. It’s just--

           She moves in closer and puts her arms around his neck.

                                 GIA
                        Mitch...
                                 MITCH
                             (weakly)
                        Oh no. No no. Please... please 
                        don’t be sexy.

                                 GIA
                             (sexily)
                        You don’t have to do this for me. 
                        Just... do it for the dinosaurs.

           Mitch closes his eyes.

                                 MITCH
                        I... no...

           She whispers in his ear, breathing heavily:

                                 GIA
                        Dinosaurs.

                                 MITCH
                        Okay. Okay. Fine.

           She smiles and starts to pull away from him, but as her gaze 
           drifts, she spots something--

                                 GIA
                        Oh, shit.

           She grabs the handle of Mitch’s locker and SWINGS it back 
           open, lightning-quick, re-concealing herself. Mitch turns to 
           see what she’s hiding from.

           It’s a teacher, MR. WHITMAN, late 30s, charismatic, walking 
           down the hallway, carrying a stack of papers. He looks up as 
           he approaches.

                                 WHITMAN
                        Mitch.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey Mr. Whitman.

           He’s about to walk on by, but he stops, thinks a beat--

                                 WHITMAN
                        Hey Mitch, listen. I read your 
                        assignment.

                                 MITCH
                        What? I put it in your mailbox, 
                        like--
                                 WHITMAN
                        Ten minutes ago, yeah. I always 
                        read yours first so I know what 
                        kind of curve I’m grading on. 
                        Anyway. Can you stick around a few 
                        minutes after class?

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah. Sure. Something wrong?

           Whitman smirks.

                                 WHITMAN
                        I’ll see you upstairs.
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Both of you.

                                 GIA
                        Fuck.

           She lets the locker fall back shut. Whitman chuckles to 
           himself as he walks away.

                                 MITCH
                        Well. Cross that little caper off 
                        the slate, huh?

                                 GIA
                        What? No. No way. We’ll just leave 
                        after first period.

           Mitch is about to protest, but instead just sighs.

                                 KEN
                        Where should I wait for you?

                                 GIA
                        Chester’s.

                                 KEN
                        Oh, good. Waffles.

           The bell rings.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        See you in an hour.

           INT. CLASSROOM

           It’s a couple minutes before the start of class. Gia and 
           Mitch walk in and sit down next to each other. Behind them, a 
           trio of male STUDENTS are talking.
                                 STUDENT #1
                        So, what, they dig up a dinosaur 
                        egg or something?

                                 STUDENT #2
                        Yeah, I think so.

                                 STUDENT #3
                        What? No. It’s amber. Amber. Like, 
                        tree sap. Dried sap. Amber.

                                 STUDENT #2
                        Amber?

                                 STUDENT #3
                        Yeah. I read the book. Prehistoric 
                        mosquitos, they bit the dinosaurs. 
                        They filled up on dinosaur blood.

           Gia smiles at Mitch, slyly. He smirks and slumps back in his 
           chair: clearly there’s no resisting the dinosaurs. 

                                 STUDENT #3 (CONT’D)
                        And then they got stuck in tree sap 
                        and the sap dried. And they’re 
                        still in there, full of dino-DNA.

                                 STUDENT #1
                        Amber.

                                 STUDENT #3
                        Yeah.

           A GIRL sitting nearby turns to face them.

                                 GIRL
                        Okay, who keeps saying my name?

           Another student, KEMP, walks by her --

                                 KEMP
                        Hey Amber.

           She twists back around and smiles up at him.

                                 AMBER
                             (swoony)
                        Hi Kemp.

           Kemp’s tall, athletic, preppy. He sits down right in front of 
           Gia and immediately turns around and starts talking to her.

                                 KEMP
                        What’re you doing this weekend?
                                 GIA
                        ... I’m sorry?

                                 KEMP
                        We’re driving up to Big Bear. 
                        Jarecki’s got a dock there and Josh 
                        Bryer’s got mushrooms.

                                 GIA
                        Really.

                                 MITCH
                        Boating and hallucinogens with the 
                        lacrosse team. That’s hard to turn 
                        down.

                                 KEMP
                        Bring your gay best friend too. 
                        Good to have a soberado, make sure 
                        no one drowns.

           Mitch stares. Kemp acknowledges him for the first time.

                                 KEMP (CONT’D)
                        What’s up Lasker. Puberty’s comin’ 
                        any day now, don’t you worry.

                                 GIA
                        Fuck off.

                                 KEMP
                        One’s gonna drop a little lower 
                        than the other. Don’t panic -- 
                        that’s normal.

           Mitch leans forward like a clever response is forming in his 
           mind, but Gia speaks before he can:

                                 GIA
                        What about those weird little white 
                        spots? Are they normal too?

           Kemp’s grin disappears.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Or have I just been misinformed?

           The bell rings. Whitman enters.

                                 KEMP
                             (staring right at Mitch)
                        Good comeback.

           He turns to face forward. The class quiets down.
                                 WHITMAN
                             (flipping through book)
                        Okay, act two, scene one. We need a 
                        Polonius and a Reynaldo.
                             (looks up)
                        Oh. Miss Moretti.

           That’s Gia.

                                 WHITMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been reminded that you’re to 
                        be remanded to the custody of Mrs. 
                        Winter for first period. She’s 
                        waiting in her office.

           Some murmuring among the students. She clearly didn’t want 
           this information to be public.

                                 GIA
                        Right. I forgot.

           She gathers her things and mouths “DINER” to Mitch. He nods, 
           distracted.

           INT. DINER

           A charming old-timey diner, empty except for a GIRL sitting 
           alone at a booth in the corner, looking anxious.

           Ken enters and heads for an empty table. The girl sees him.

                                 GIRL
                        Hey. Ken.

           He stops and squints at her.

                                 KEN
                        ... Bork?

                                 GIRL
                        Hi.

           The girl is MEGAN BORK. Ken walks over to her booth, warily.

                                 KEN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m-- we’re-- Jurassic Park. Isn’t 
                        this where we’re meeting?

                                 KEN
                        Oh.
           He slowly slides into the opposite side of the booth.

           INT. SCHOOL GUIDANCE OFFICE

           Gia’s talking to -- or rather, being talked to -- by the 
           school guidance counselor, MRS. WINTER.

                                 WINTER
                        My point is, at this stage of your 
                        academic career, a slipping average 
                        is incredibly dangerous.
                             (beat)
                        And... look, your life outside this 
                        building is none of my business, 
                        but... two drug misdemeanors on 
                        your record don’t exactly--

                                 GIA
                        You’ve got something in your teeth.

           Winter hesitates a beat, then presses on without 
           acknowledging the remark.

                                 WINTER
                        I’m just saying, you’re on the 
                        verge of losing college. Imagine 
                        the person you’ll be in ten years, 
                        and imagine how angry she’d be at 
                        her 17-year-old self for letting 
                        her life slip away.

                                 GIA
                        The person I’ll be in ten years.

                                 WINTER
                        Yeah.
                             (nods)
                        Yeah -- be honest. Ten years. Where 
                        do you wanna be?

           Gia just shakes her head, smiling to herself, like it’s the 
           dumbest question she’s ever heard.

                                 WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Where do you see yourself?

                                 GIA
                        I... don’t.

                                 WINTER
                        Really.

           Gia shrugs.
                                 WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Well. Maybe that’s what’s missing. 
                        We all need dreams.

                                 GIA
                        And I’m sure yours was to be a high 
                        school guidance counselor.

           She regrets it right away. Winter lets her pen fall to her 
           desk and leans back in her chair.

           INT. DINER

           Megan’s trying her best to make conversation. Ken’s wishing 
           he was anyplace else.

                                 MEGAN
                        ... I mean, it was so cool of her 
                        to invite me. We, like, never hang 
                        out anymore. And then when I was 
                        waiting here alone I started to 
                        think maybe it was all a joke.

                                 KEN
                        A joke?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, like, “Ha ha, we made Megan 
                        Bork skip class and sit in a diner 
                        for an hour.”

                                 KEN
                        Oh. No, her jokes are usually 
                        funnier than that.

           Awkward silence.

                                 WINTER (V.O.)
                        So, to recap...

           INT. SCHOOL GUIDANCE OFFICE

                                 WINTER
                        ... Ambition’s for suckers. The 
                        future’s a myth. Screw everything. 
                        Use it all up. Get your kicks while 
                        you can. Yes?

                                 GIA
                        A little too fortune-cookie, but 
                        yeah, you’re getting it.
                                 WINTER
                        Look, I’m not a stranger, okay? I 
                        get where this comes from. My--
                             (hesitates)
                        My dad died when I was in college, 
                        and that was painful enough that I 
                        can’t begin to imagine what you--

           Gia looks away.

                                 WINTER (CONT’D)
                             (soothing)
                        All I’m saying is if you want to 
                        hate this world, believe me, you 
                        have ample cause. But you should 
                        know there isn’t a single girl in 
                        this school who wouldn’t drown her 
                        puppy to switch places with you.

           Gia responds with an icy stare. Winter picks up her pen.

                                 WINTER (CONT’D)
                        You can go back to English class.

           Gia wordlessly takes her books and leaves. Once she’s gone, 
           Winter looks up at the door a beat, then, with her mouth 
           closed, runs her tongue over her teeth.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Gia continues down the empty hallway. First she DUMPS her 
           books in a trash can, then she KICKS OPEN the big side door 
           at the end of the hall and walks out into the daylight. The 
           door groans shut behind her.

           INT. DINER

           Ken and Megan have clearly given up on trying to have a 
           conversation.

           There’s a guy, DAN, sitting alone at the counter. He’s about 
           21, stoner-ish, wearing a BURGER KING uniform.

           Sound of the chimes on the front door. It’s GIA.

           Megan turns to look --

                                 MEGAN
                        Thank God.

           Dan turns to look --
                                 DAN
                        Oh, shit.

           Megan tries to wave, but Gia’s attention is on Dan. He gets 
           up from his stool and heads toward the door.

                                 GIA
                        Hey friend.

                                 DAN
                        Outside. Outside.

           They leave. Megan looks at Ken like “What the hell?”

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Gia follows Dan outside and into an alley next to the diner.

                                 GIA
                        I don’t need much.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah, well, I don’t deal anymore. 
                        I’m, I’m, you know. I’m out.

                                 GIA
                        What, did Burger King promote you 
                        to Head of Lettuce Operations or 
                        something? No more time for 
                        extracurricular activities?

                                 DAN
                        No, no, I’m quitting that job too.

           He fails to suppress a proud smile.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        I got into UCLA as a transfer 
                        student. Spring quarter just 
                        started. Here. Look.

           He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket, unfolds it, 
           holds it up for her.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        This is the courseload of a man 
                        with a future.

                                 GIA
                             (reading)
                        You have a three-hour class called 
                        “Trees”?
                                 DAN
                        Yeah, my trees class.

                                 GIA
                        What’s your major? “Stuff”?

                                 DAN
                        It’s not trees like trees, it’s--

                                 GIA
                        You know, I’d love to discuss this 
                        further, but I really need some 
                        drugs first.

                                 DAN
                        I told you. I’m done. I, I don’t 
                        deal anymore, I don’t even blaze.

                                 GIA
                        Yeah. Ten bucks says you’ve got a 
                        joint in your left pocket.

                                 DAN
                        I don’t.

                                 GIA
                        I see the unmistakable bulge of the 
                        Altoids tin.

                                 DAN
                        ... Fuck.

           Defeated, he pulls an Altoids tin out of his pants pocket. 
           Inside is a single small JOINT.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Twenty.

           Sound of a school BELL ringing --

           INT. CLASSROOM

           Students start shuffling out of English class. Mitch quickly 
           packs up his stuff and heads past Whitman toward the door.

                                 WHITMAN
                        Mitch.

                                 MITCH
                             (stopping)
                        Yep.

           Whitman gives him a what’s-the-deal look.
                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Oh yeah. Sorry.

                                 WHITMAN
                        You in a hurry?

                                 MITCH
                        No, no.

           He puts down his bag and leans against the wall. The 
           classroom empties out.

           Whitman grabs Mitch’s assignment off his desk, glances at it 
           a beat, then looks at Mitch thoughtfully.

                                 WHITMAN
                        Out of curiosity: what is it you 
                        think I’m about to tell you?

           Mitch hesitates.

                                 WHITMAN (CONT’D)
                        Be honest.

                                 MITCH
                        That, uh... I need to try harder. 
                        That I’m coasting?

                                 WHITMAN
                        I said be honest.

           Mitch sighs.

                                 MITCH
                        That it’s fucking brilliant.

                                 WHITMAN
                        His worst fears confirmed.

           He hands Mitch the assignment. In red marker on the first 
           page there are three big exclamation marks.

                                 MITCH
                        Whoa. Three?

                                 WHITMAN
                        I want to know how this happened.

           Mitch mulls it over.

                                 MITCH
                        It was... easy. Writing like 
                        someone else -- that’s easy. It’s 
                        all fake, right? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MITCH (CONT'D)
                        It’s not me, it’s just, you know...
                             (gestures aimlessly)
                        It’s easy when you don’t mean it. 
                        You can say anything.

           Whitman folds his arms.

                                 WHITMAN
                        You’re saying, capturing the voice 
                        of the greatest English writer of 
                        this century, that’s easy. But 
                        saying something you mean, 
                        something you actually feel -- 
                        that’s beyond your abilities.

                                 MITCH
                        Uh... yeah.

                                 WHITMAN
                        That’s messed up, man.

                                 MITCH
                        I don’t-- I mean, it’s like, what 
                        the hell can I say? I’m a kid; I 
                        don’t know anything. I have no 
                        right to express my opinions until 
                        I have all the answers.

           Whitman smiles ruefully.

                                 WHITMAN
                        Mitch. Nobody knows anything. 
                        Everyone is faking it. Every one of 
                        your heroes is actually an asshole.

           Mitch considers this.

                                 WHITMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious. If you spend your 
                        whole life waiting to become the 
                        guy you think you’re supposed to 
                        be, you’ll miss every chance to be 
                        the guy you are.

                                 MITCH
                        Can I ask you something? What did 
                        you want to be when you were 17?

                                 WHITMAN
                        I wanted to be Lisa Plover’s 
                        boyfriend.

                                 MITCH
                        Who’s Lisa Plover?
                                 WHITMAN
                        Mrs. Whitman.

           INT. DINER

           Gia slides into the booth across from Ken. She’s stoned.

                                 GIA
                        Where’s Bork?

                                 KEN
                        Bathroom. I’ve spent the last half 
                        hour trying to figure out why you 
                        invited her.

                                 GIA
                        Because I value old friendships, 
                        Ken. I don’t let the people I care 
                        about fall out of my life. We’re on 
                        this earth to look after each 
                        other. Love is the only thing 
                        that’s real.

                                 KEN
                        Why’d you actually invite her?

                                 GIA
                        She has a car.

           Megan returns and sees Gia.

                                 MEGAN
                        Hey! Finally.

           She slides in next to her and gives her an awkward half-hug.

                                 GIA
                        Hey kid.

                                 MEGAN
                        Is Mitch coming?

                                 GIA
                        Any minute. Where are you parked?

                                 MEGAN
                        Parked?

                                 GIA
                        It’s this thing with cars where you 
                        make it so they can’t roll away.
                                 MEGAN
                        Oh. I don’t have the car today. My 
                        brother dropped me off.

           An uncomfortable beat.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        ... That’s okay, right?

                                 GIA
                        Yeah, it’s awesome.

           Gia avoids Ken’s gaze and reaches for a menu.

           INT. SCHOOL

           Break’s over and the halls are empty. Mitch is standing at 
           the top of a short staircase leading down to the main doors.

           He stares at the exit, hesitating.

           To his right is the main office. He can see the secretary. He 
           has an idea.

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE

           He enters the office and leans against the secretary’s desk. 
           She takes a few seconds to notice him.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Yes?

                                 MITCH
                        Hi. If I need to leave school 
                        early, I have to, like, sign out, 
                        right?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Yes.

           She grabs a clipboard and a pen.

                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 MITCH
                        Mitch Lasker.

           He smiles. Why didn’t he think of this before?
                                 SECRETARY
                        And what’s your reason for leaving 
                        early?

           Uh oh.

                                 MITCH
                        ... Sorry, what?

                                 SECRETARY
                        We have to write down a reason. 
                        Otherwise kids would just sign out 
                        whenever they feel like going to 
                        the movies.

                                 MITCH
                        Right. Right. Yeah, it’s a, uh...
                             (swallows)
                        ... dentist appointment.

           She looks at him.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        It’s my... teeth.

                                 SECRETARY
                        And your dentist’s name is what?

                                 MITCH
                        His name?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Yeah.

                                 MITCH
                        Or her name, if it’s a...
                             (trailing off)
                        ... woman. Uh--
                             (clears throat)
                        Whalen. Dr. Whalen.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Whalen?

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah, like... “whale”, and then--

                                 SECRETARY
                        Whale N.

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah, you got it.
                                 SECRETARY
                        Okay.

           She puts down the clipboard and goes back to work.

                                 MITCH
                        So you’re gonna give him a call?

                                 SECRETARY
                        We call to confirm appointments, 
                        yes.

                                 MITCH
                        Cool. Uh, when-- when is that going 
                        to happen?

                                 SECRETARY
                        In about thirty seconds.

                                 MITCH
                             (nodding)
                        Awesome.

           EXT. STREET

           Mitch is SPRINTING down the street, panicked and desperate. 
           He finds a PAY PHONE and frantically grabs the receiver and 
           drops in a quarter. 

           There’s no dial tone. He BANGS the receiver repeatedly 
           against the phone box.

                                 MITCH
                        FUCK!

           He takes off running again.

           INT. DINER

           Ken wolfs down some waffles while he studies a transit system 
           map laid out on the table.

                                 KEN
                        It’s gonna take forever to get to 
                        this thing. The bus stops here 
                        every half hour, but somehow the 
                        same bus only stops downtown once 
                        an hour. Apparently half of these 
                        buses are getting sucked into a 
                        black hole.

                        How come your waffles came in like 
                        two minutes and I’m still waiting?

                                 MEGAN
                        You didn’t order anything.

           EXT. STREET

           Mitch has found another pay phone. He’s exhausted from 
           running. He dials a number.

                                 MITCH
                        Please, please...

           It starts ringing.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, thank God.

           A RECEPTIONIST answers the phone.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Hello, Dr. Whalen’s office.

                             (crazed and panting)
                        Hello! To whom am I speaking?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        This is Molly.

                                 MITCH
                        Molly. I need you to listen very 
                        carefully now. My name is Mitch 
                        Lasker. I’m a patient of Dr. 
                        Whalen’s. First, I have a question: 
                        in the past few minutes, has anyone 
                        called you asking about me?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Um... no?

                                 MITCH
                        Okay. Good. That’s terrific. Now, 
                        listen: very soon, you will receive 
                        such a call. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MITCH (CONT'D)
                        And there’s something very 
                        important I need you to do. Are you 
                        with me so far?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mmm-hmm.

                                 MITCH
                        Great. That’s great, Molly. Here’s 
                        what I need you to do for me: if 
                        someone calls you asking if Mitch 
                        Lasker has an appointment today, 
                        you tell them yes. Do you 
                        understand?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Oh, you want to book an 
                        appointment!

                                 MITCH
                        No, no--

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        We can’t get you in today, but 
                        maybe sometime in... May?

                                 MITCH
                        No! Listen! I don’t actually need 
                        an appointment. I just need you to 
                        say I have an appointment.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Well, but-- I can’t put you into 
                        the system for today

                                 MITCH
                        NO! You don’t need to put me in the 
                        system! Just say that I’m--

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (talking over him)
                        Sir, please listen. Sir. Please: 
                        you cannot get an appointment 
                        today. If it’s an emergency, you 
                        may go to a hospital--

                                 MITCH
                        NO! NO! LISTEN TO ME!

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE

           The school secretary dials a number. Next to her phone is the 
           phone book open to the Yellow Pages.
           Busy signal. She hangs up.

           INT. DINER

           A waitress comes by to collect Ken’s empty plate. Gia’s

           Mitch is still yelling into the phone.

                                 MITCH
                        ... who is, like, the coolest 
                        fucking girl in the world, and also 
                        the hottest, which is, you know, 
                        seriously messed up, she, she got 
                        tickets to that, that DINOSAUR

                        ME and DO WHAT I FUCKING TELL YOU!

           He sighs.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Okay. You know, the only reason I 
                        started cursing at you is I’m 
                        pretty sure you hung up on me a 
                        while ago. But if you’re still 
                        there, I sincerely apologize.

           He awaits a response. There’s a click, then:

                        You’re so fucked.

           INT. DINER

           Ken’s working out some calculations with a pencil and paper, 
           deep in thought, finger to his temple.
                                 KEN
                        Okay. So the next bus stops here 
                        in...
                             (checks watch)
                        ... three minutes. If we catch this 
                        one, we can get to Westwood by 1 
                        o’clock. If we miss it, we won’t 
                        get there until 2:45. What time 
                        does the movie start?

           He looks up at Gia. She’s on another planet. Ken reaches over 
           and grabs the passes out of her bag and reads one of them.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        ... 2:40. So. We have to go now.

                                 MEGAN
                        You think Mitch bailed?

                                 GIA
                             (distantly)
                        Not possible.

           They all take a beat to think.

                                 MEGAN
                        Okay. Here: me and Ken will go now, 
                        and you wait for Mitch and take the 
                        later bus, and we’ll save you seats 
                        for the movie.

                                 GIA
                        Yeah. Good.

           Ken sighs.

                                 KEN
                        Fine.

           He slides out of the booth.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Gia -- listen: the bus you wanna 
                        take downtown is number 2125. It 
                        stops right outside.

                                 GIA
                             (singing softly)
                        In the year 2125...

                                 KEN
                        Gia.
                                 GIA
                        Yeah, I got it.

           INT. DENTIST’S OFFICE

           The phone rings.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Hello, Dr. Whalen’s office.

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE

                                 SECRETARY
                             (into phone)
                        Hi, this is Janet Shields calling 
                        from Junipero Serra High School.   
                        Can I confirm that one of our 
                        students is a patient of yours?

           INTERCUT

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Sure, what’s the name?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Last name Lasker, first name Mitch 
                        or Mitchell.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (reading computer screen)
                        Mmm... yep, here he is. Mitch 
                        Lasker, two fillings, allergic to 
                        fluoride.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Great, thank you.

           The school secretary hangs up and puts a CHECKMARK next to 
           Mitch’s name on her clipboard.

           INT. DINER

           Mitch enters the diner. He looks around and sees Gia in the 
           corner, asleep, with her legs propped up on her side of the 
           booth. He hurries over and sits down next to her.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey.

           She’s asleep. He puts his arm around her and shakes her 
           gently. She opens her eyes and smiles at him.
                                 GIA
                        You’re late. 

                                 MITCH
                        I know. Sorry. Where’s Ken?

                                 GIA
                        He left with Bork. They’ll save us 
                        seats.

           She yawns, moves her feet to the floor, looks at Mitch. For 
           the first time she notices he’s pale and flustered.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MITCH
                        Uh. I, uh...

           He runs his fingers through his hair.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        I did a stupid thing. I tried to, 
                        to sign out, at the office, so I 
                        wouldn’t, you know, technically be 
                        cutting class, but I--

                                 GIA
                        What?

                                 MITCH
                        I don’t know, I--

                                 GIA
                             (grinning)
                        That’s so stupid!

                                 MITCH
                        Yes. I’m aware. Anyway. I’m fucked. 
                        They’re gonna know I lied to them, 
                        I’m gonna get suspended, and you 
                        know that box, the box on all the 
                        college apps, the box that says, 
                        “Have you ever been disciplined for 
                        academic dishonesty?” -- in other 
                        words, “May we toss your 
                        application into the garbage?” -- 
                        I’m gonna have to check, “Yes.”

           He looks at her. Her eyes are still bloodshot.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Are you stoned?
           She nods proudly.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Fell off the wagon pretty quick.

                                 GIA
                        What wagon? There was no wagon.

                                 MITCH
                        “Okay Mitch, I promise I’ll stop 
                        getting high every day.” What was 
                        that?

                                 GIA
                        This isn’t every day. Not every day 
                        has dinosaurs.

           Mitch just shakes his head and rubs his eyes.

                                 MITCH
                        Wait. They’ll save us seats?

                                 GIA
                        Yeah.

                                 MITCH
                        So you gave them the passes?

                                 GIA
                        ... Whoops.

           INT. BUS

           Ken and Megan are seated next to each other on the 2125 bus. 
           You can tell it’s been a silent ride so far. Ken stares out 
           the window. Megan looks at him. Waits a beat, then --

                                 MEGAN
                        What’s your problem with me?

           He turns away from the window, reluctantly.

                                 KEN
                        What?

                                 MEGAN
                        You never say hi. I pass you in the 
                        hall, you don’t even make eye 
                        contact. There’s something you 
                        don’t like about me and I wanna 
                        know what it is.

           Ken doesn’t answer. Megan’s frustration grows more visible.
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        What, am I, like, not smart enough 
                        to talk to you? Not interesting 
                        enough?

           She says “interesting” like it’s a pejorative.

           The bus slows to a stop. Two GUYS get on, both in their late 
           20s, both wearing clean white shirts and ties. They take a 
           seat behind Ken and Megan.

           Ken still hasn’t answered. The bus starts moving again.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        And even now you’re ignoring me.
                             (sighs)
                        Whatever. Screw you.

           She gives up, turns away.

                                 KEN
                        I ignore you because I’m extremely 
                        attracted to you.

           He matter-of-factly takes a big bite of his candy bar and 
           goes back to staring out the window.

                                 MEGAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 KEN
                        I mean, you’re beautiful. You know 
                        that. Nobody actually tells you 
                        that, because they’re jealous or 
                        scared or they don’t think you need 
                        to be told. As if there exist 
                        people who don’t need to be told 
                        they’re beautiful.
                             (another bite)
                        But you know it. Though, you don’t 
                        really seem like you know you know 
                        it.

           Those guys sitting behind them are talking to each other.

                                 GUY #1
                        Fuck. Where’s the phrase book?

                                 GUY #2
                        Don’t ask me.

           Megan’s trying to deal with what she’s just heard.
                                 MEGAN
                        So-- so if you like me, then why--

                                 KEN
                        I don’t want to be your friend if I 
                        can’t sleep with you. It’s mentally 
                        exhausting.

                                 MEGAN
                        Well... well, what makes you think 
                        you can’t? I mean, like, you’re 
                        right, you can’t, you’re a freak, 
                        but how-- I mean, how do you know?

                                 KEN
                        You just want me to keep telling 
                        you you’re pretty.

                                 MEGAN
                        ... Yeah, I guess.

           Ken chews thoughtfully, trying to find the right words.

                                 KEN
                        I’m pretty sure you’d be the third 
                        or fourth most popular girl in 
                        school if your name wasn’t so 
                        weird.

           INT. BUS

           Gia and Mitch are on a different bus. Her attention’s on him; 
           his attention is elsewhere.

           She leans against his shoulder and stares up at him, then 
           starts poking him lightly on the cheek. Poke. Poke. Poke.

                                 MITCH
                        Why is this happening?

           She stops and just rests against him for a long moment, then 
           looks up at him again.

                                 GIA
                        How come you haven’t asked me how 
                        it went with Winter?

                                 MITCH
                        Oh yeah. How’d it go with Winter?

                                 GIA
                        I don’t want to talk about it.
                                 MITCH
                        Okay.
                             (beat)
                        Am I supposed to insist that you 
                        tell me what happened or am I 
                        supposed to respect your desire not 
                        to talk about something that’s 
                        gonna bring you down?

                                 GIA
                        You’re supposed to know without 
                        asking.

           She puts her arms around him and leans against his shoulder 
           again. She’s deep in thought. There’s a long pause.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        When I was a kid everyone used to 
                        say I was exactly like her. I loved 
                        that. And now, it’s just... it’s 
                        like it just means...

           She trails off, but her point is clear, at least to Mitch.

                                 MITCH
                        Let’s see. Do you want above-title 
                        billing?

                        No.

                                 MITCH
                        Do you want your face on this 
                        month’s Vanity Fair?

                                 GIA
                        No.

                                 MITCH
                        Then you’re fine.

           She feels better. They ride in silence.

           INT. BUS

           One of the guys sitting behind Ken and Megan is reading 
           something out of a pocket-sized phrase book. Call him JIM. 
           His partner is ROB.

                                 JIM
                             (slowly)
                        Wa-ta-shi... no.. nam-ay... wa...
           Ken glances back at him, overhearing.

                                 MEGAN
                        You want some gum?

                                 KEN
                        What? No.

           She pulls out a pack of gum and unwraps a piece.

                                 JIM
                        Watashi no namae wa Jim Mazurek 
                        desu.
                             (faster)
                        Watashi no namae wa Jim Mazurek 
                        desu.

           Ken listens intently. Megan pops the gum in her mouth.

                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll chew a piece of gum for like 
                        five minutes and then the flavor’s 
                        gone and my jaw hurts so I spit it 
                        out. And then literally all I can 
                        think is “I really want some gum.”

                                 JIM
                             (without the book)
                        Watashi no namae wa Jim Mazurek 
                        desu.

           He forces a smile, bows slightly, offers a handshake.

                                 ROB
                        Dude--

                                 MEGAN
                        So I start chewing another piece 
                        and spit it out five minutes later. 
                        Over and over. I go through a whole 
                        pack in, like, an hour.

           She looks at Ken.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        What does that mean, do you think?

                                 KEN
                             (absently)
                        I don’t know.

                                 ROB
                        Dude. Don’t embarrass yourself. 
                        Stick to English.
                                 JIM
                        They don’t speak English.

                                 ROB
                        ... What?

                                 MEGAN
                        I think it means I’m never 
                        satisfied. Like, I always want what 
                        I don’t have.

                                 ROB
                        What the fuck? We’ve got-- we’ve 
                        got twenty minutes--

                                 JIM
                        Watashi no namae wa Jim Mazurek 
                        desu. Everything’s gonna be fine.

                                 ROB
                        Oh my God. We’re fucked. This 
                        fucking contract-- dude, this is 
                        everything--

                                 MEGAN
                        Like if there’s a boy I like and I 
                        find out he likes me then I don’t 
                        like him anymore. It’s, like... a 
                        serious problem.

                                 KEN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 MEGAN
                        Are you listening to me?

                                 KEN
                             (loudly, to Rob and Jim)
                        Hey.

           They look at him.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        This is your first meeting?

                                 ROB
                        What?

                                 KEN
                        The Japanese. You’re meeting them 
                        for the first time?
                                 JIM
                        Yeah.

                                 KEN
                        Okay. Don’t start with your name. 
                        First ask “How do you do.”
                        Hajimemashite watashi wa Jim 
                        Mazurek desu.

           His Japanese is flawless. Rob and Jim look at each other.

                                 JIM
                        What-- how?

                                 KEN
                        I grew up in Japan.

                                 ROB
                        Why?

                                 KEN
                        No reason.

                                 JIM
                        Okay... say, say, uh, say this: 
                        say, “Although we are a small 
                        firm,” uh, “we can service all your 
                        graphic design needs in the North 
                        American market.” Say that.

                                 KEN
                             (in Japanese, subtitled)
                        Although we are a small firm, we 
                        can service all your graphic design 
                        needs in the North American market.

                                 ROB
                        Holy shit.

                                 JIM
                        Okay. Okay kid. So... we’ve got 
                        this meeting, like, right now. Can 
                        you-- I mean, do you mind--

                                 KEN
                        Not for free.

                                 JIM
                        Okay. Yeah. We’ll give you...
                             (looks at Rob)
                        I dunno, a hundred bucks?

                                 KEN
                        A hundred bucks?
                                 JIM
                        Yeah.

                                 KEN
                        Really?

                                 JIM
                             (grinning)
                        Yeah.

                                 KEN
                        A whole hundred?

           Jim’s grin fades.

                                 JIM
                        Okay. Well, shit. Name your price.

                                 KEN
                        I want three percent of the 
                        contract.

                                 ROB
                        Fuck you.

                                 JIM
                        Three percent?

                                 ROB
                        Fuck you, kid. Fuck you.

                                 JIM
                        Three percent?

                                 ROB
                        Fuck you. Fuck you.

                                 KEN
                        Okay.

           Calmly, he turns his back to them. Megan’s completely 
           baffled.

                                 ROB
                        Fuck.

           He looks out the window.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        This is our stop. Fuck.

                                 JIM
                             (sighing)
                        Kid.
           Ken looks at him.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Three percent.

                                 ROB
                             (softly, shaking head)
                        Fuck you.

           Jim and Ken shake hands.

                                 KEN
                             (in Japanese)
                        This will be of great benefit to 
                        me.

                                 JIM
                        Whatever.

           The bus pulls over.

                                 KEN
                             (rapidly, to Megan)
                        It’s the Bruin Theater on Broxton 
                        north of Weyburn. Gia didn’t think 
                        to give me the passes because she 
                        was blazed out of her mind and I 
                        didn’t think to take them because I 
                        was distracted by the thought of 
                        having to share an hourlong bus 
                        ride with you, so, I don’t know, 
                        wait for them outside I guess.

                                 MEGAN
                        Wait-- wait-- what--

           Ken gets up and follows Jim and Rob toward the door.

                                 KEN
                        Oh. Hang on.
                             (smells his breath)
                        Yeah. One second.

           He walks back to Megan.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Give me some gum.

           INT. BUS

           Mitch and Gia are asleep. Their bus is stopped and empty.

           The BUS DRIVER looks at them through her rearview mirror.
                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Hey.

           No reaction.

                                 BUS DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

           Still nothing. She grabs an empty Kleenex box and flings it 
           at them. Mitch gets it in the face. He wakes up, looks 
           around, blinks.

                                 BUS DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        End of the line. Get out.

           EXT. STREET

           They groggily wander outside. The sign on the front of the 
           bus changes to “NOT IN SERVICE.”

                                 GIA
                             (yawning)
                        Where are we?

                                 MITCH
                             (looking around)
                        We’re supposed to be downtown... 
                        but...

           They’re standing next to a small field in a severely run-down 
           residential area. Not downtown.

           Mitch turns around and sees something.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, fuck me.

           Down the block are the WATTS TOWERS.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Watts? Seriously?

           The bus is starting to leave. Mitch runs up to it and bangs 
           on the door.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           The door opens. The bus driver stares at him.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Hey. I asked you if this bus goes 
                        downtown. You said yes.
                                 BUS DRIVER
                        It does. The depot’s downtown. I’m 
                        going to the depot.

                                 MITCH
                        Oh. Well, that’s fantastic. You’re 
                        a fantastic person.

           The door closes.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                             (banging on door)
                        Wait! WAIT!

           The bus pulls away. Mitch turns and looks at Gia.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        The 2525, huh?

                                 GIA
                        Fact-checking should really fall on 
                        the person who’s not on drugs.

           Mitch kicks a rock, frustrated.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        How long are you gonna be mad at me 
                        for this?

                                 MITCH
                        I don’t know. A few more seconds.

           Standing a few yards apart on the empty street, they stare at 
           each other for five or six seconds.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        All right.

           He takes her hand and they start walking.

           EXT. ALLEY

           The Nickerson Gardens housing project in Watts. Around the 
           corner from a large courtyard, an 18-year-old kid, DEV, 
           supernaturally relaxed and effortlessly charismatic, sits 
           against the wall with a WALKMAN in his hand and a yellow 
           legal pad balanced against his leg.

           He slides on a pair of headphones and hits “PLAY.”

           We hear the sound of his voice, recorded in what sounds like 
           a club full of people:
                                 DEV (V.O.)
                        -- and the trial, man -- you know 
                        what they did? They moved it -- 
                        y'all know that? -- they moved it -- 
                        to Simi Valley. Y'all know?

           He shuts his eyes and follows the rhythm of the words.

                                 DEV (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Now, I don't care if you got a tape 
                        of the fuckin' chief of police 
                        pullin' Rodney King's teeth out...

           Some laughs are heard. He scribbles something on his notepad.

                                 DEV (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The fuck you think twelve white 
                        people from Simi Valley know about 
                        injustice? What's injustice in Simi 
                        Valley, man? When you don't get a 
                        Mastercard for your tenth birthday?

           Laughter.

                                 DEV (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        When Murphy Brown's a rerun?

           Big laughs; cheers. He stops the tape, rewinds, hits play.

                                 DEV (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        -- tenth birthday? When Murphy 
                        Brown’s a rerun?

           Stop. He takes off his headphones.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                             (out loud)
                        Murphy Brown’s a rerun? When Murphy 
                        Brown’s a rerun?

           He taps his notepad thoughtfully.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Rerun. Rerun. Repeat. Repeat?
                             (beat)
                        When Murphy Brown’s a repeat? When 
                        you don’t get a Mastercard for your 
                        tenth birthday? When Murphy Brown’s 
                        a repeat?

           He sighs and writes “RERUN or REPEAT?” and circles it, then 
           puts his headphones back on and hits play.
           INT. HOTEL LOBBY

           Ken and the two graphic designers are seated on some chairs 
           in an elegant lobby. Rob and Jim look nervous; Ken looks 
           bored.

           A group of five or six JAPANESE DUDES in suits enter the 
           lobby.

                                 JIM
                        Here we go.

           The three of them stand up. Rob looks at Ken.

                                 ROB
                        Kid, if you screw us, I swear to 
                        God--

           Ken slaps him on the back.

                                 KEN
                        Relax. I’ve got a lot riding on 
                        this.

           EXT. WATTS

           Mitch stares at the side of a bus shelter. At the top there’s 
           a sign saying “MAP.” Underneath there’s a large square-shaped 
           hole in the ubiquitous graffiti, indicating where the map 
           used to be.

           Gia walks up carrying a soda and a pack of Skittles. She 
           looks at the missing map.

                                 GIA
                        That’s helpful.

                                 MITCH
                        Did you ask the guy in the store?

                                 GIA
                        Yeah. We got as far as “bus.” You 
                        wanna know what “bus” is in Korean?

                                 MITCH
                        No.

                                 GIA
                        It’s “bus.”

           Mitch slumps against the wall of the shelter. He looks off to 
           the side, where there’s a large housing project courtyard. A 
           few people are hanging out on their front porches.
                                 MITCH
                             (mumbling)
                        We could ask--
                             (clears throat)
                        We could ask one of them.

           Gia squints at the courtyard.

                                 GIA
                        Are you sure?

                                 MITCH
                        What, are you scared?

                                 GIA
                        I don’t know. This is where the 
                        riots happened. I’m pretty sure the 
                        Korean guy had a 12-gauge behind 
                        the cash register.

                                 MITCH
                        These people are the same as us. 
                        They just got a lousy hand.

           Gia chews on her Skittles.

                                 GIA
                        I got a pretty fucking lousy hand.

                                 MITCH
                        Oh really. Have you looked in a 
                        mirror lately?

           She smiles a little.

                                 GIA
                        Okay ace. Who’s the target?

           Mitch studies the people in the courtyard. There’s a tall 
           bespectacled guy in his late 20s talking to some younger 
           guys; an older couple, retirement age; two young mothers 
           chatting; two YOUNG BOYS, 13 or 14, standing on the corner.

                                 MITCH
                        The kids. They’ll respect us.

                                 GIA
                        All right.

           They start walking.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Wait, why will they respect us?
           EXT. ALLEY

           Dev paces back and forth as he silently reads back his notes. 
           In the background, Mitch and Gia approach -- the kids they’re 
           asking for directions are right around the corner.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey.

           Dev glances up to see if the hey is directed him, then goes 
           back to his notes when he sees it’s not.

           EXT. COURTYARD

           The two kids, WES and MAX, look at Mitch warily.

                                 WES
                        Ain’t got no bud, skippy.

                                 MITCH
                        Uh. No. We’re not, uh-- we were 
                        actually, uh, we were trying to get 
                        downtown -- well, Westwood--

           EXT. ALLEY

           Dev glances up again, devoting some small fraction of his 
           attention to what Mitch is saying.

                                 MITCH (O.S.)
                        ... and, uh, we got on the wrong 
                        bus, and we were just wondering, 
                        like, if you know how we could--

           EXT. COURTYARD

                                 MAX
                        Call a cab.

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah. Well, we would, but we’ve 
                        got, like, six bucks on us.

                                 WES
                        You need cab money? Tell your girl 
                        to suck three dicks.

                                 MAX
                        Shit man, look at her. She could do 
                        it in one.
                                 WES
                        I’ll flip you for it.

           They laugh. Mitch stares.

                                 MITCH
                        ... What the fuck?

                                 WES
                        Uh oh. He’s upset.

                                 MAX
                        Doogie Howser got beef.

                                 WES
                             (lispy Bugs Bunny voice)
                        This means war!

           These two are enjoying themselves immensely. Mitch looks at 
           Gia.

                                 MITCH
                        Is this really happening? Are we 
                        getting humiliated by a couple of 
                        fucking twelve-year-old dope 
                        slingers?

                                 GIA
                             (stunned)
                        Mitch--

                                 WES
                        The fuck did you say?

                                 GIA
                        Oh God.

                                 MAX
                        Faggot, I’m fourteen.

           EXT. ALLEY

           This conversation has Dev’s full attention now. He tosses his 
           notepad on the ground, folds his arms, takes a few steps 
           forward and leans against the wall to listen.

           EXT. COURTYARD

                                 WES
                        You see us slinging? You see us 
                        slinging dope right now?
                                 MITCH
                        Right, you're just a couple of 
                        South Central kids standing on a 
                        corner for no reason, telling 
                        strangers you ain't got no bud.

                                 WES
                        Correct, shithead, 'cause we ain't 
                        got no bud. Every day, you fucking 
                        people, fucking college kids 
                        drivin' down here-- 
                             (nasal voice)
                        “You sellin' weed? You sellin' 
                        weed?”

                                 MITCH
                        Nah, you’re selling... what?
                             (looks around)
                        Hell, this looks like a crack 
                        neighborhood. Too nice for smack.

                                 GIA
                        Stop it.

                                 WES
                        Motherfucker--

                                 MAX
                        “Smack.”

                                 WES
                        The fuck you know about “this 
                        neighborhood”?

                                 MAX
                             (laughing)
                        He called it “smack.”

                                 WES
                        Motherfucker gotta get taught.

           He cups his hand to his mouth.

                                 WES (CONT’D)
                        Hey yo, D.H.!

                                 MAX
                             (suddenly serious)
                        No. Man, no.

                                 WES
                        D.H.!
           The tall bespectacled guy on the other side of the courtyard 
           looks at Wes and walks over.

                                 D.H.
                             (to Wes and Max)
                        Young squires.

           He’s intensely mannered and highly intelligent.

                                 D.H. (CONT’D)
                             (nodding to Gia and Mitch)
                        Abercrombie. Fitch.

           Everyone else in the courtyard is watching now. A few people 
           have wandered out of their houses for the occasion. Dev 
           emerges from the alley to get a visual.

                                 WES
                        That one called me a dope slinger. 
                        Said this is a crack neighborhood.

           D.H. turns and faces Mitch. They take a beat to size each 
           other up.

                                 D.H.
                        Is he lying to me?

                                 MITCH
                        I--

                                 D.H.
                             (interrupting him)
                        What was it about him that gave you 
                        the impression he sells drugs?

                                 MITCH
                        I--

                                 D.H.
                             (interrupting again)
                        Was it, uh, his hair? The color of 
                        his eyes?

           EXT. ELSEWHERE IN COURTYARD

           From a distance, two YOUNG GIRLS watch D.H. and Mitch, a jump 
           rope hanging limp between them. A third GIRL riding by on a 
           bike stops when she sees the other two.

                                 GIRL ON BIKE
                             (craning neck)
                        What’s goin’ on?
                                 OTHER GIRL
                        D.H. is about to beat the shit 
                        outta that white boy.

           EXT. COURTYARD

           Mitch takes a breath. D.H. waits patiently for him to answer.

                                 MITCH
                        I--

                                 D.H.
                             (interrupting)
                        I work very hard so that the 
                        members of my family don’t have to.
                             (glances at Wes)
                        So that they can, uh, ply a 
                        different trade. You understand?

                                 MITCH
                        Yes.

                                 D.H.
                        No, because you've never sacrificed 
                        anything for anybody. I can tell. 
                        You don't know struggle. It's okay. 
                        You're still young enough to learn.

                                 DEV
                        Hey, D.H.

           Dev walks over.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Hold up, man.

                                 D.H.
                        Superstar. This ain’t yours.

                                 DEV
                        Nah, but I was right there, I heard 
                        the whole thing -- Wes and Max, 
                        they dissed the girl. Dude was just 
                        standin' up. They ain't even 
                        lookin' for bud.
                             (grins)
                        They want directions.

           Laughter from the onlookers.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        They got on the wrong bus!
           More laughter. D.H. looks at Wes.

                                 D.H.
                        You disrespected the girl?

           Wes says nothing.

                                 GIA
                        It was proposed that I suck a dick.

                                 MITCH
                        Three dicks.

           D.H. looks at Dev, then at Mitch, then back at Dev.

                                 D.H.
                        Show ‘em how to get the fuck outta 
                        here.

           INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM

           The Japanese businessmen are seating around a conference 
           table, chuckling politely at something. The one in charge, 
           MURAKAMI, says something in Japanese. Ken translates:

                                 KEN
                        Chairman Ito regrets that he can’t 
                        be here. He’s entrusted them to be 
                        his, uh, like... eyes and ears. 
                        Surrogates.

           Jim smiles at Murakami.

                                 JIM
                        That’s fine, no problem. So, should 
                        we, should we get started?

           Ken glances at him, frowning slightly.

                                 KEN
                             (in Japanese)
                        Let’s get started.

           The Japanese men nod. Jim uncaps a marker and steps next to a 
           large whiteboard. Rob watches Ken carefully.

                                 JIM
                        So, as I’m sure you’re aware, we’re 
                        a very small agency. Including Mr. 
                        Kroeker and I, we only have 
                        nineteen full-time employees. But 
                        we see this as a strength, not a 
                        weakness.
           Everyone looks to Ken for the translation. He’s still 
           frowning, buried in thought.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Ken.

                                 KEN
                        Mmm. Sorry.

           He takes a breath and turns to face the Japanese men.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        A man is lying in bed with his 
                        wife.

           The Japanese men look at each other.

                                 JIM
                        Right. So, uh, our size, our small 
                        size allows us to work with less 
                        overhead...

                                 KEN
                        The man turns to his wife and says, 
                        “I would like to have sex.”

           Murakami murmurs something to his aide.

                                 JIM
                        ... to be agile, nimble, to change 
                        with the times...

                                 KEN
                        “But I understand if you’re not in 
                        the mood,” he tells her. “And I 
                        don’t want to pressure you.”

           Murakami’s aide smiles knowingly and murmurs something back.

                                 JIM
                        ... to embrace new methods and new 
                        technology. To produce materials 
                        that will attract the attention of 
                        a fickle public.

                                 KEN
                        “So,” he says, “here is what I 
                        propose: if at any point in the 
                        night you want to have sex, simply 
                        pull on my penis one time.”

           Murakami starts to smile. The other men look guarded, 
           glancing at Murakami to gauge his reaction.
                                 JIM
                        Allow me to draw a diagram of our 
                        flat organizational structure 
                        compared to the hierarchical 
                        structure of a larger agency.

                                 KEN
                        “And if you don’t want to have sex, 
                        simply pull on my penis one hundred 
                        times!”

           Murakami bursts out laughing. The other men laugh too.

           Jim has just drawn two shapes on the whiteboard: a small flat 
           rectangle and next to it a large triangle. He and Rob are 
           baffled. Murakami bangs on the table, gasping for air.

                                 ROB
                        What the fuck is happening?

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATER

           A smiling Murakami is shaking Jim’s hand in the lobby.

                                 KEN
                        He says the lawyers still have to 
                        look at the contract, but there 
                        shouldn’t be any problems.

                                 JIM
                        Uh. Great.

           The Japanese men all smile and bow politely and start to walk 
           away. Ken looks at Jim and Rob.

                                 KEN
                        Well. I’ll be in touch.

           He turns and starts to follow the Japanese guys.

                                 ROB
                        Wait, wait. Where the hell are you 
                        going?

                                 KEN
                             (over his shoulder)
                        We’re getting lunch.

           EXT. WATTS

           Dev and Mitch walk down a street in Dev’s housing project. 
           Gia follows a couple steps behind.
                                 MITCH
                        You wanna do standup your whole 
                        life?

                                 DEV
                        Nah. I wanna be on SNL.

                                 MITCH
                        How do you get on SNL exactly?

                                 DEV
                        If you’re Dana Carvey, your uncle 
                        gets you an agent and your agent 
                        gets you an audition. If you’re 
                        Eddie Murphy, you fuckin’ blow into 
                        the producer’s office and beg.
                             (nods toward house)
                        We’re here.

           They walk up to the front door. Dev fishes a set of keys out 
           of his pocket. Mitch hangs back and looks at Gia.

                                 MITCH
                             (quiet)
                        You okay?

                                 GIA
                        What was that back there?

                                 MITCH
                        What, I was-- I was standing up for 
                        you. What do you mean?

                                 GIA
                        That’s bullshit. I can tell when 
                        you’re pissed off.

                                 MITCH
                        Of course I was pissed off. You 
                        heard what they said to us.

                                 GIA
                        Not at them. At me.

           Dev holds the door open.

                                 DEV
                        Yo, I gotta ask: of all the people 
                        in that courtyard you could’ve 
                        asked for help, why’d you pick the 
                        ones that’d give you the most shit?

                                 GIA
                        Yeah, Mitch. Tell him.
                                 MITCH
                        I dunno. I guess... I guess I see 
                        kids that age and it’s like... it’s 
                        like, they’re freshmen, I’m a 
                        junior, you know?

           Dev laughs and shakes his head.

                                 DEV
                        Freshmen. Goddamn.

           INT. DEV’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 DEV
                        I got a bus schedule somewhere.

           They walk into the living room. There’s a six-year-old kid, 
           FRANCIS, playing with some Lego on the floor.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        You can sit down. That’s Francis.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey Francis.

           While Dev hunts around for the bus schedule, Mitch takes a 
           seat at the end of the couch, expecting Gia to sit next to 
           him. Instead, she sits down cross-legged on the floor.

                                 GIA
                             (smiling)
                        Hi.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Hi.

           Noise from the kitchen as Dev searches for the schedule.

                                 DEV (O.S.)
                        It was right here.

                                 GIA
                        What’re we makin’?

                                 FRANCIS
                        A spaceship.

                                 DEV (O.S.)
                        Dammit.

           He enters the living room.
                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        I can’t find it.

                                 GIA
                        Pretty spiffy spaceship. But 
                        where’s the hyperdrive?

                                 FRANCIS
                        What’s a hyperdrive?

                                 DEV
                        Brought you all the way back here. 
                        Dammit.

           He slumps down on the chair across from Mitch.

                                 MITCH
                        It’s okay.

                        It makes your spaceship go further. 
                        You wanna go to the moon, you can 
                        go ahead and ride a regular 
                        spaceship. You wanna go to Rigel 
                        Seven, you need a hyperdrive.

                                 DEV
                        Never seen a girl that hot say 
                        “hyperdrive” before.

           He rubs his eyes, thinking.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Okay. You gotta get to Westwood. 
                        I’ll drive you.

                                 MITCH
                        What? No, no--

                                 DEV
                        Probably too late to catch the bus 
                        anyway. When does the dinosaur 
                        movie start?

                                 MITCH
                        2:40.

           Dev checks his watch.

                                 DEV
                        Yeah. So, I’ll take you. My dad 
                        drives a town car, he brings it 
                        home most days. He’s on the early 
                        shift. Be home any minute.

                        with.

                             (constructing hyperdrive)
                        Nah. I’m goin’ to Rigel Seven.

                                 MITCH
                        You know, we’ve got five passes. 
                        Our two friends are coming, but, if 
                        you want the extra one--

                                 DEV
                        For real?

                                 GIA
                        Yeah, we were just gonna sell it to 
                        some idiot tourist.

                                 DEV
                        Well, if it’s just the one, 
                        Spaceman should get it.

           Gia looks at Francis.

                                 GIA
                        Hey kiddo. What’s your opinion on 
                        dinosaurs?

           We hear someone walk in the front door. It’s Dev’s father, 
           FRANK, dressed in a suit, looking tired.

                                 DEV
                        Hey dad.

           Frank tosses his keys on the counter and notices the two 
           strangers in his house.

                                 FRANK
                        This a field trip?

                                 MITCH
                        Sort of.

                                 DEV
                        Dad, that’s, uh... Winona, and this 
                        is her boyfriend... Ethan.

                                 GIA
                        Hi. I’m Winona.

           Frank looks at Mitch.
                                 FRANK
                        How’d you get her?

                                 MITCH
                             (deadpan)
                        I’m really funny.

           Frank smiles and starts to head upstairs.

                                 DEV
                        You sleepin’?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah.

           They watch him walk upstairs and wait patiently for the sound 
           of his bedroom door closing. Dev jumps to his feet.

                                 DEV
                             (quietly)
                        Let’s go.

           INT. RESTAURANT

           Ken’s at a busy upscale restaurant with his Japanese pals. 
           He’s wearing a SUIT now. Murakami and the rest are all 
           laughing at something. Ken says something in Japanese and 
           they all laugh harder.

           He sits back and loosens his tie. He notices something a few 
           tables away: a gorgeous WOMAN and an important-looking MAN 
           having lunch, having what looks like an intense discussion.

           Ken leans over to Murakami and says something in Japanese, 
           nodding toward the couple. Murakami looks over, raises an 
           eyebrow, grins, says something back, turns and nudges the guy 
           next to him. He and his colleagues are fairly drunk.

           The couple’s conversation is becoming louder and more heated.

                                 WOMAN
                        “From now on, there’s only you.” 
                        You said this. So: fuck you.

           She takes an angry sip of water.

                                 MAN
                        It’s not possible to discuss this 
                        rationally when you’re just making 
                        stuff up.

           She SLAMS the glass of water down. The whole restaurant 
           hears. People turn to look.
                                 WOMAN
                             (loudly)
                        I’m making stuff up? I’m lying?

                                 MAN
                        And now the spectacle. I would’ve 
                        thought your appetite for 
                        performance would be satisfied by 
                        all the work I’ve brought you.

                                 WOMAN
                        Actually, very few of my appetites 
                        have been satisfied by you.

           Some uncomfortable chuckling from the crowd. She tosses her 
           napkin down on her uneaten food.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        But you’re right, there’ve been 
                        countless performances.

           She stands and starts to hastily collect her things.

                                 MAN
                        Come on. Come on, at least bag that 
                        up. It’s the last eighty dollar 
                        meal you’re gonna see for a while.

                                 WOMAN
                        Fuck you.

                                 MAN
                        Oh.
                             (to onlookers)
                        She’s not hungry. Probably has 
                        something to do with the fucking 
                        snowblower she’s got for a right 
                        nostril.

           Shocked murmurs. Mouth agape, the woman grabs her purse and 
           storms out, brushing past Ken’s chair.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry -- left nostril?

           He takes a sip of water and does his best to ignore the 
           stares. Slowly, everyone else goes back to eating.

           Ken’s gazing out into the restaurant foyer, where he can 
           partly see the woman leaning back against the wall and 
           lighting a cigarette. He narrows his eyes and takes a 
           thoughtful sip of his Coke.
           He puts his glass down, slowly pushes his chair back, and 
           rises to his feet.

                                 KEN
                             (in Japanese)
                        Gentlemen.

           He carefully buttons his suit jacket.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Today is a day for miracles.

           With supreme confidence, he strides out into the foyer.

           INT. RESTAURANT FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           The woman is the only other person there, smoking her 
           cigarette, staring off into space. She notices Ken.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m allowed to smoke here.

           He takes a couple of steps forward, not breaking eye contact. 
           Waits a beat before speaking.

                                 KEN
                        He doesn't respect you. He never 
                        did.

           She shoots him a lethal stare and takes a long drag. She 
           clearly wants to be alone. Ken presses on.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        With men like him it's never about 
                        love, or sex, or money. It's about 
                        power. They can have any woman, but 
                        they don't want any woman; they 
                        want every woman.

           She exhales elegantly toward the ceiling, pretending he isn’t 
           there. Ken takes another step forward.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Me -- I just want one.

           INT. RESTAURANT

           The Japanese guys watch the scene from their table. They can 
           see the woman from the side and they can clearly see Ken 
           putting the moves on her, but they can’t tell if it’s 
           working. Murakami murmurs something that probably means 
           “Watch this.”
           INT. RESTAURANT FOYER

                                 KEN
                        What I want is to not give a fuck 
                        about anything in this world except 
                        doing what's necessary to make a 
                        single person happy. I can tell 
                        just by looking at you that you've 
                        never been with anyone who's 
                        understood what that means.

           She shuts her eyes and blows some more smoke.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Also...

           He leans close to her ear and lowers his voice --

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        I have the hookups. Real blow. 
                        Pure. Not this cut-with-glass 
                        Hollywood ego-trip nosebleed stuff. 
                        Not the stuff that turns you into 
                        an asshole. I’m talking about God's 
                        blow. Only euphoria.

           She takes another drag.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        I can take you to places you didn’t 
                        know existed.

           She exhales again, extending it into a long sigh.

                                 WOMAN
                        How’s this: I’ll give you twenty 
                        bucks if you stop talking to me.

           INT. RESTAURANT

           The Japanese see the woman hand something to Ken. They murmur 
           excitedly.

           Ken strides back to the table, slowly and deliberately, 
           wearing a smug smile.

           The table looks up at him like, “Well?”

           He triumphantly holds up a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL. The Japanese 
           businessmen erupt in cheers.
           INT. CAR

           Dev’s barrelling down the Santa Monica Freeway in his 
           father’s employer’s Town Car. Francis is riding shotgun, Gia 
           and Mitch are in the back.

                                 DEV
                        One more mile to the 405. We’re 
                        like ten minutes out.

           Mitch’s attention is on Gia, who’s staring out the window. He 
           takes her hand. She doesn’t look at him.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        So. What do you wanna be?

           He glances at Mitch in the rearview.

                                 MITCH
                        Sorry, what?

                                 DEV
                        When you grow up. What do you wanna 
                        be?

                                 MITCH
                        Uh. I dunno.

                                 DEV
                        What do you mean you don’t know?

                                 MITCH
                        I don’t really know anyone who 
                        knows. Except you.

           Dev mulls this over.

                                 DEV
                        That’s fucked up.

           The car’s TWO-WAY RADIO crackles on.

                        Frank?

                             (looking around, startled)
                        What the fuck?

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Frank, you still on?

                        Oh, fuck. Fuck.
                                 MITCH
                        Who is that?

                                 DEV
                        It’s my dad’s dispatcher. Fuck!

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Frank, answer your goddamn radio.

                                 DEV
                        Fuck.

           He hesitantly takes the radio handset out of its cradle. 
           Wincing, he draws it to his mouth and turns it on.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                             (deep voice, into radio)
                        Hey, it’s me.
                             (beat)
                        Frank.

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        What the hell, Frank?

                                 DEV
                             (deep voice)
                        Uh, sorry I didn’t pick up. I 
                        dropped my... sunglasses--

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        You’re not down for a double shift. 
                        You switch with Manny or something?

                                 DEV
                             (deep voice)
                        Yep. Switched with Manny.

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Fine. Listen, we got a guy at LAX. 
                        Flight landed early -- when the 
                        hell does that happen, right? I 
                        need you to pick him up and take 
                        him to the Century Plaza.

                                 DEV
                        ... Fuck.
                             (deep voice, into radio)
                        No problem.

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Good. United 108, he’ll be at the 
                        terminal 6 baggage claim. The name 
                        for the card is Sheingold. S-H-E-I-
                        N. Be nice to this guy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        His company’s half our book in New 
                        York.

                                 DEV
                             (deep voice)
                        Sheingold. Got it.

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Thanks, Frank.

                                 DEV
                             (deep voice)
                        Frank out.

           Dev lets the radio handset fall to the ground.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

                                 MITCH
                        You can drop us off at the movie 
                        first, right?

                                 DEV
                        I wish, man. I’m sorry.

                                 GIA
                        You said we’re ten minutes out.

                                 DEV
                        Yeah, in the opposite direction. A 
                        rich white dude waiting twenty 
                        extra minutes with his bags is 
                        enough to lose my dad his job.

                                 GIA
                        Shit.

           EXT. GAS STATION

           Dev pulls the car up to a gas station near the freeway. Gia, 
           Mitch and Francis disembark.

                                 DEV
                        I’ll get back here as fast as I 
                        can. We can still make it.
                             (to Francis)
                        Little man, you okay to hang with 
                        Zack and Kelly for a while?

           Francis nods.
                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        All right. Back in a flash.

                                 MITCH
                        Tell Sheingold I said hi.

           Mitch shuts the passenger door and Dev drives off. Gia sits 
           down on the curb. Mitch gets a few dollars out of his pocket 
           and holds them out to Francis.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Hey buddy. Go on inside and get 
                        yourself a snack.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You need anything?

                                 MITCH
                        Nah, thanks.

                                 FRANCIS
                        I meant her.

                                 GIA
                             (trying to smile)
                        I’m okay.

           Francis goes into the store. Mitch sits down on the curb next 
           to Gia.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey.

                                 GIA
                             (soft)
                        Hey.

                                 MITCH
                        Let’s talk about what’s actually 
                        going on inside your head today. 
                        Because I’m at a loss.

                                 GIA
                        I’d rather not talk.

                                 MITCH
                        Okay, well, that’s the first thing 
                        we can discuss.

                                 GIA
                        I’m serious. I need some space.
                                 MITCH
                        Yeah. You know, I’ll dig as hard as 
                        you feel like making me, but the 
                        whole leave-me-alone-but-don’t game 
                        is deeply unappealing right now.

                                 GIA
                        Good. So just leave me alone.

                                 MITCH
                        Right.
                             (sighs)
                        Christ. You know why I put up with 
                        this shit?

                                 GIA
                             (evenly)
                        Why do you put up with this shit, 
                        Mitch?

                                 MITCH
                        Because your damage is real. Mine 
                        and everyone else’s, it’s all 
                        imaginary. So, whatever. You’re Gia 
                        Moretti. The unluckiest girl in the 
                        world. You can be as selfish as you 
                        wanna be.

           Gia stares at him coldly.

                                 GIA
                        You don’t know anything.

           EXT. AIRPORT

           Dev pulls up to the arrivals area of an LAX terminal.

           INT. AIRPORT BAGGAGE CLAIM

           He’s standing at the end of a busy baggage claim area holding 
           up a placard that says “SHEINGOLD”. He looks impatient.

           A slim young GUY wearing shades approaches from the side, 
           stopping when he sees the card.

                                 DEV
                        Finally.

           The guy looks Dev up and down.

                                 GUY
                        Shouldn’t you be wearing a suit?
                                 DEV
                        Casual Wednesday.

           The guy puts down his bags and takes off his shades.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.

           It’s CHRIS ROCK.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Chris Rock?!

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        No -- Morty Sheingold. Keep your 
                        fucking voice down.

           Dev eagerly offers a handshake.

                                 DEV
                        I’m Dev. Dev Mattick.

           Chris Rock shakes his hand unenthusiastically.

           He waits for Dev to take his bags and lead him to the car. 
           Dev just stands there grinning.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                             (dryly)
                        Tell me, Dev. What do you do for a 
                        living?

           EXT. AIRPORT

           Dev stuffs Chris Rock’s bags in the trunk of the Town Car 
           while Rock climbs into the backseat. Dev slams the trunk 
           shut, takes a calming breath, and looks up at the sky.

                                 DEV
                             (to God)
                        Listen. You fuck with me on this, 
                        I’ll kill you.

           EXT. GAS STATION

           Mitch and Gia stand around outside the gas station, not quite 
           looking at each other. They’ve been fighting on and off for a 
           while. Francis is on the curb, quietly sipping a soda. Mitch 
           checks his watch, kicks a rock.
                                 GIA
                        Why don’t you just say what you 
                        wanna say?

                                 MITCH
                        Tell me what I wanna say. Please. 
                        I’m curious.

                                 GIA
                        I talked you into cutting school 
                        and now you’ll never hit whatever 
                        fake fucking idea of success you’ve 
                        been taught to shoot for.

                                 MITCH
                        That’s not-- I don’t care about 
                        that. I mean, I do, but whatever. 
                        It’s just, I’m, I’m trying to be a 
                        part of your future. And you’re 
                        doing everything you can to make 
                        sure you don’t have one. I mean, 
                        just what the hell are you looking 
                        forward to? Sixty more years of 
                        hanging out at the mall and getting 
                        high behind the Dairy Queen?

                                 GIA
                        I’m just trying to be seventeen. 
                        I’m trying to live my life. Fuck 
                        the future -- I want you with me 
                        now. But lately you don’t give a 
                        shit about anything that isn’t a 
                        line on a Harvard application.

                                 MITCH
                        That’s not true.

                                 GIA
                        Yeah it is. You’ve been carrying me 
                        too long. I can tell. My shit’s too 
                        heavy, it’s pulling you down. Soon 
                        you’re gonna wanna drop me and keep 
                        on walking.

                                 MITCH
                        For fuck’s sake. I tell you I love 
                        you like nineteen times a day.

                                 GIA
                        You do say the words.

                                 MITCH
                        What, you think I’m lying?
                                 GIA
                        Yeah, I guess not, ‘cause you’d be 
                        the first guy in history to say “I 
                        love you” in exchange for sex. 
                        You’d have to be a genius to think 
                        of that. I mean, you’re a smart 
                        guy, Mitch, but--

                                 MITCH
                        Fuck you. I said it when I didn’t 
                        have to. I said it before you did. 
                        I, I put myself on the line--

                                 GIA
                             (laughing)
                        Yeah. It was a huge risk. Massive. 
                        You were so brave.

                                 MITCH
                        Okay.

           He nods.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        I get it now. I get what’s going 
                        on.
                             (beat)
                        Your mom killed herself ‘cause she 
                        couldn’t be a movie star and now 
                        you think the world is a colossal 
                        shitcluster where no one is happy 
                        and everything good falls apart and 
                        everyone who loves you eventually 
                        leaves you. And you’re trying to 
                        get me to prove you right.

           Gia says nothing for a long beat. She then shields her eyes 
           from the sun and gazes down the road.

                                 GIA
                        Dev said the movie’s a ten minute 
                        drive that way?

                                 MITCH
                        What?

                                 GIA
                        I’m gonna walk.

                                 MITCH
                             (incredulous)
                        What--
                                 GIA
                        You have no fucking idea who I am 
                        or what I want. You don’t even know 
                        what you want. So, stop analyzing. 
                        Stop trying to figure out stuff 
                        you'll never fucking understand.

           She starts to walk away, then stops, turns --

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh -- one more thing: learn to fuck 
                        me right.

           Jeez.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe then I can quit smoking weed, 
                        you know?

           Mitch swallows and shakes his head.

                                 MITCH
                        One day you’ll turn around, and 
                        you’ll look behind you, and all 
                        you’ll see will be wreckage.

                                 GIA
                        Uh-huh.

           He turns his back to her. She keeps walking. Francis watches 
           her leaving, and looks up at Mitch expectantly.

                                 MITCH
                             (sighing)
                        Do what you want, kid.

           Francis jogs to catch up with Gia. Mitch slumps down on the 
           curb, alone.

           INT. CAR

           Dev’s grinning at Chris Rock in the rearview mirror. Rock’s 
           spread out on the back seat with his feet up. He’s not a 
           happy man.

                                 DEV
                        So uh, Chris. You grew up in 
                        Harlem, right?

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Bed-Stuy.
                                 DEV
                        Right. I, uh, I’m from South 
                        Central. Watts. Nickerson Gardens.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Yeah? What’s your house number? 
                        P.O. box?

           Dev tries to chuckle, blinking at the surprising coldness. He 
           searches for something else to talk about.

                                 DEV
                        SNL’s been dope this season.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        No it hasn’t.

           Silence.

                                 DEV
                        You know, uh, I’m a comic too. I do 
                        standup.

           Rock has stopped acknowledging him.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        I, uh, I actually got a tape of my 
                        set here -- maybe, uh, you wanna--

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Man, look. I’m a decent guy most 
                        days. But I hate this fucking city. 
                        I only come here to sell my soul 
                        one little piece at a time. So no, 
                        I don’t wanna hear your piece of 
                        shit tape, or talk about my piece 
                        of shit show, or reminisce about 
                        how shitty my life was in the 
                        projects compared to how slightly-
                        less-shitty it is now. I wanna get 
                        to my hotel and go to my meetings 
                        and get the fuck outta here.

                                 DEV
                             (quiet)
                        Okay man. Fair enough.

           They drive in silence. Dev suddenly has an idea.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Hey. You know that dinosaur movie?

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        What?
                                 DEV
                        The dinosaur movie. Jurassic Park.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Oh. The dinosaur movie.

                                 DEV
                        What if I told you there’s a test 
                        screening in fifteen minutes and I 
                        can get you in?

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        I’ve had lunch at Spielberg’s 
                        house. You think if I wanna see his 
                        new thing I need help from you?

                                 DEV
                        So you seen it already?

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        No, but--

                                 DEV
                        You know anyone who has?

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        ... No.

                                 DEV
                        Well. Here’s your chance to make 
                        all your hot-shit friends jealous. 
                        Go ahead, pick up the phone, call 
                        your boy Steve, ask for a, whatever 
                        the fuck, a private screening. 
                        Y’all can make a day of it. Watch 
                        the movie, eat some pistachios, 
                        play a little backgammon--

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Yeah, yeah, okay--

                                 DEV
                        Or just ask me. Up to you.

           Chris Rock sighs.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Fifteen minutes, huh?

           EXT. GAS STATION

           Mitch is lying on his back staring at the sky. The Town Car 
           screeches up and Dev jumps out.
                                 DEV
                        Yo.

           Mitch sits up. Dev looks around for Gia and his brother.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Where they at?

                                 MITCH
                        Uh, they left.

                                 DEV
                        What do you mean, they left?

                                 MITCH
                        Gia’s walking to the movie.

                                 DEV
                        What? What the fuck?

           He takes a moment to think.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Who’s got the tickets?

                                 MITCH
                        She does.

                                 DEV
                        Fuck! What the fuck?!

                                 MITCH
                        What’s the problem?

                                 DEV
                        How long ‘til it starts?

                                 MITCH
                             (checking watch)
                        Two minutes.

                                 DEV
                        Shit. How long ago’d they leave?

                                 MITCH
                        I dunno. Half an hour.

           Dev sighs.

                                 DEV
                        We gotta find ‘em. C’mon.
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Mitch gets in the front passenger seat. He looks at the guy 
           sitting in the back.

                                 MITCH
                             (nodding slowly)
                        Chris Rock. Why not.

           Chris Rock offers a glum half-wave. Dev pulls out of the gas 
           station and starts speeding down the road.

                                 DEV
                        Gentlemen, we’re eyepeelin’ for a 
                        skinny white girl and a little dude 
                        who looks like me.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        What does this have to do with the 
                        dinosaur movie?

                                 DEV
                        All part of the plan.

           He glances at Mitch.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Man, I leave you alone for an hour, 
                        you turn suicidal. The hell 
                        happened back there?

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER

           Megan’s still outside the theater. She’s clearly been waiting 
           there a while. She checks her watch and sighs.

           EXT. STREET

           Gia walks down Overland Avenue with Francis. She’s struggling 
           against a barrage of stinging thoughts.

                                 GIA
                             (sharply, to self)
                        Fucked it up. Fucked it up again.

           Francis looks up at her. She notices his stare.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

           She notices something in the distance.
                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

           It’s a BUS. She rifles through her pockets and her bag.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Kiddo, you got any change left over 
                        from that soda?

           He reaches in his pocket and pulls out a pair of ONES and 
           some coins. Gia smiles. She looks up and down the street.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t see a stop.
                             (beat)
                        Stay right here.

           As the bus approaches, she STEPS OUT ONTO THE ROAD and stands 
           directly in its path. It slows to a stop in front of her.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        I feel like that guy in Tiananmen 
                        Square.

           She looks at Francis.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        This is where Mitch would say, 
                        “Yeah, except instead of standing 
                        up to a tank you’re trying to get 
                        to a dinosaur movie,” and I’d go, 
                        “Details.”

           The bus door swings open.

                                 BUS DRIVER 
                        You’re not supposed to do that.

                                 GIA
                        You going to Westwood?

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Yes.

           She takes Francis’s hand and they start to get on. Gia 
           hesitates, remembering past experience --

                                 GIA
                        Right now?

           The bus driver nods.

                        You don’t have to tell me I fucked 
                        up. I know I fucked up.

                        all this time trying to figure out 
                        what I wanna do with my life and 
                        trying to get into a good enough 
                        school to actually do it. And the 
                        one thing I know I want, the one 
                        thing I want every day, I already 
                        have, it’s there, it’s right in 
                        front of me, and I fucking lose it.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Breaks my heart.

                                 MITCH
                             (to Dev)
                        Is Chris Rock making fun of me?

                                 DEV
                        Yeah.
                             (beat)
                        Look man, it’s easy. You want 
                        something, you gotta fight for it. 
                        You gotta earn it.

                                 MITCH
                        That doesn’t sound easy.

                                 DEV
                        Yeah, it’s not.

           He stops at a light, still looking for Gia and Francis.
                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Where we at now?

                                 MITCH
                        Eleven minutes.

                                 DEV
                             (murmuring to self)
                        Where the fuck are they?

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER

           Megan’s still standing outside. From the distance she hears:

                                 GIA (O.S.)
                        BORK!

           She turns to look. Gia’s walking up with Francis.

                                 MEGAN
                             (with a weak wave)
                        Hey.

                                 GIA
                        Where’s Ken?

                                 MEGAN
                        He, uh... well, I’m not exactly 
                        sure what he did. It was 
                        impressive, whatever it was. But 
                        he’s gone. Who’s the cute kid?

                                 GIA
                        Megan, I’m like a million percent 
                        sure this is a stupid question, 
                        but: you got any weed? I need to 
                        make it so I can’t think thoughts.

                                 MEGAN
                        Sorry.

           Gia looks around, trying to get a sense of her surroundings.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Mitch?

                                 GIA
                        He’s, uh...
                             (beat)
                        “Campus Shoe Repair”? Wait...

           She turns and looks all the way down the street, shielding 
           her eyes from the sun.
                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit, that’s UCLA.

                                 MEGAN
                        Uh, yeah. I think it is.

                                 GIA
                        What time is it?

                                 MEGAN
                        2:55.
                             (points to entrance)
                        Should we, um--

                                 GIA
                             (staring into the 
                              distance)
                        Trees.

           INT. CAR

                                 MITCH
                        We’re fifteen minutes in. I’m 
                        guessing the dinosaur park is now 
                        experiencing its first malfunction.

                                 DEV
                        Okay. Fuck it. We’ll go to the 
                        theater.

           He makes a SHARP TURN onto another street and heads toward 
           Westwood Boulevard. As they approach, they see the street is 
           BLOCKED by a police barricade.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck--

           They watch a cop on a MOTORCYCLE drive by, followed by two 
           POLICE CARS, followed by a large LIMO with two American flags 
           attached to the hood. Dev makes a hasty U-turn.

           INT. LIMO

           Ken’s in his own limo with the Japanese guys, turning onto 
           Westwood, just AHEAD of the motorcade. They can see it 
           through the rear window. Ken leans toward Murakami--

                                 KEN
                             (in Japanese)
                        The guest of honor.
           EXT. MOVIE THEATER

           The town car pulls up to the theater. Megan’s standing there 
           with Francis. Mitch gets out first.

                                 MITCH
                        Hey. Where is she?

                                 MEGAN
                        She, uh... left.

                                 MITCH
                        What do you mean she left?

                                 MEGAN
                        She left. She said “I’ll be back” 
                        and she gave me all the passes and 
                        she told me to look after this 
                        little guy and she went that way.
                             (notices Chris Rock)
                        ... Where do I know him from?

                                 MITCH
                        Huh? Oh. He’s on TV.

                                 DEV
                             (walking up, smiling)
                        Hey, you must be Bork. I’ve heard a 
                        lot about you.

           She shakes his hand, unsure of how to respond.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        This is Bork? Whoa. No offense Bork 
                        but I thought you’d be ugly. I 
                        don’t know why.

           Megan’s more confused than she’s ever been in her life.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Gia walks along a hallway in a UCLA building. A PROFESSOR’s 
           voice can be heard faintly. Gia spots the room she’s looking 
           for and puts her ear to the door to listen a moment, then 
           hesitantly PUSHES THE DOOR OPEN.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           A HUGE lecture hall, filled almost to capacity. Gia walks in 
           like she’s expecting someone to notice her, but no one does.
                                 PROFESSOR
                        ... and so what we end up with is a 
                        left child, right sibling binary 
                        tree, which is the binary 
                        representation of a k-ary tree.

           Gia quickly spots DAN, sitting alone at the opposite end of 
           the back row. He’s ASLEEP. She moves along the row and sits 
           next to him.

           Dan’s head is back and his mouth is hanging open. Gia looks 
           at what he’s got in front of him: a blue plastic WATER 
           BOTTLE, a notebook, and a stapled sheaf of LOOSELEAF PAPER.

           She slides the sheaf of paper toward herself, and after 
           looking at it, FOLDS IT UP and stuffs it in her pocket.

           She then takes the water bottle and, with much delight, 
           SQUIRTS WATER INTO DAN’S OPEN MOUTH. He instantly wakes up 
           and starts gagging.

                                 DAN
                             (coughing)
                        What--
                             (sees her)
                        Oh. Wait...
                             (looks around, remembers 
                              where he is)
                        What--

                                 GIA
                        I missed you.

                                 DAN
                        You came all the way here. Jesus. 
                        That was the last of what I had. 
                        That was it, okay? I’m not lighting 
                        another spliff until graduation.

                                 GIA
                        Fine.

                                 DAN
                        ... Fine?

                                 GIA
                        Yeah. I understand. You need to 
                        focus on your future.

           He wonders what she’s up to.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Okay, that’s an hour and a half. 
                        Let’s take a ten minute break.
           Students start getting up to stretch their legs.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and please hand in your problem 
                        sets if you haven’t already.

           Dan looks around for his problem set. He lifts up his 
           notebook. Hunts through his bookbag, increasingly frantic.

           He looks at Gia.

                                 DAN
                        Where’s my homework?

           She smiles.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        God, you’re--
                             (sighs)
                        All right.
                             (beat)
                        Fuck. All right. Follow me.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY

           Mitch, Dev, Francis, Megan, and Chris Rock are being led 
           through the theater lobby by a young STUDIO ASSISTANT.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I saw the workprint last night. 
                        These dinosaurs do not disappoint.

           They reach a door with a sign saying “PRIVATE SCREENING.” But 
           the assistant only opens the door a CRACK and peers inside. 
           Everyone looks at each other, confused.

                                 MEGAN
                        Uh... can we...

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Hang on, I wanna time this right.

           Muffled sound of Laura Dern talking. John Williams’ score is 
           clearly building to something important.

                                 DEV 
                        What the fuck, man--

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Wait. Wait wait wait.
                             (pause)
                        Okay.
           He smiles and swings the door all the way open.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           It’s that famous first shot of the BRACHIOSAURUS walking 
           between the trees. The score switches from tense buildup to 
           the majestic JURASSIC PARK THEME just as they enter.

           There’s a hushed “whoa” from everyone in the theater.

                                 SAM NEILL
                        It’s... it’s a dinosaur.

           Everyone except Mitch wanders down to the nearest empty 
           seats, their eyes locked on the screen. Mitch hangs back and 
           glumly leans against the side wall. 

                                 JEFF GOLDBLUM
                        You did it. You crazy son of a 
                        bitch, you did it.

           Mitch stands there as the iconic scene unfolds, looking at 
           the screen but not really watching. His mind is elsewhere.

           The brachiosaurus lifts its front legs to eat the leaves off 
           a particularly tall tree. It drops back down with a massive 
           THUD. The audience loves it.

                                 LAWYER GUY WHO GETS EATEN
                        We’re gonna make a fortune.

           Dev, now seated, looks around for Mitch just in time to see 
           him LEAVE. He gets up and follows him out.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

                                 DEV
                        Hey man. Wait up.

           Mitch stops, turns.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 MITCH
                        I gotta find her. I can’t just wait 
                        for her to come back. It’s gotta be 
                        me coming to her. 

                                 DEV
                             (beat)
                        Yeah. You’re right.
                                 MITCH
                        Problem is, all I have to go on is 
                        Bork saying she went “that way.”

                                 DEV
                        Well. Okay. What’s that way?

                                 MITCH
                        No clue.

           The GIRL working the concession stand pipes up --

                                 GIRL
                        UCLA.

           They both look at her.

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Sorry; I was eavesdropping. UCLA.

                        It’s like right there.

                                 MITCH
                        Shit. Yeah.
                             (to self, after a beat)
                        Why would she go to UCLA?

                                 GIRL
                        Hey. I go there. It’s a good 
                        school.

                                 MITCH
                        No, I mean... why would she go 
                        there, like, physically. There’s 
                        nothing she’d--
                             (beat)

                        What?

                                 MITCH

                                 DEV
                        You think?

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah. Every time something bad 
                        happens, every time she needs to, 
                        like, turn her brain off.
                             (beat)
                        Fuck.
           EXT. ROYCE HALL

           People in suits are milling on the front portico of UCLA’s 
           Royce Hall. A few of them are wearing shades and earpieces -- 
           they’re SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. The doors to the AUDITORIUM 
           are open and a female SPEAKER is addressing the audience.

                                 SPEAKER (O.S.)
                        ... Still, all this is nothing 
                        compared to what we’ll see in the 
                        decade to come. Imagine a world 
                        where any child with a PC and a 
                        modem has access to the sum of 
                        human knowledge. A world where you 
                        can book a flight and rent a movie 
                        with the click of a mouse.

           Against the wall there’s a table with a sign saying 
           “CONFERENCE SIGN-IN.” KEN is there, being handed a bunch of 
           BADGES, one of which he puts around his neck.

           He walks over to Murakami and the others and says something 
           in Japanese and gestures toward the doors to the auditorium. 
           They all go inside.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           They take their seats. The auditorium is close to full.

                                 SPEAKER
                        Our keynote speaker has championed 
                        the Information Superhighway since 
                        long before its potential was 
                        obvious to the rest of us. Ladies 
                        and gentlemen, please join me in 
                        welcoming Vice President Al Gore.

           Applause.

                        Hi there, I’m trying to get the 
                        name of one of your employees. 
                        He’s, uh... I’m not sure how to-- 
                        he’s sort of a, uh, a stoner type--

                                 MANAGER
                        Yeah, that’s Dan. Dan Sacks.

                        Sax, like a saxophone?

                                 MANAGER
                        No, like a bunch of sacks. He just 
                        quit though. He got into UCLA and 
                        he moved into the dorms. Can’t take 
                        the commute.

                                 MITCH
                        Really. That’s fantastic.

           He gives Dev a thumbs-up.

                                 MANAGER
                        Sure, I guess.

                        Thanks a lot.

           He hangs up.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        He goes to UCLA. It’s gotta be him.
                             (to concession stand girl)
                        Is there, like, a way to look up 
                        people in the dorms?

                                 CONCESSION STAND GIRL
                        Sure, the switchboard. Here.

           She dials a number on the phone and hands him the receiver.

                             (into phone)

                             (pause)
                        No, like a bunch of sacks. It’s a 
                        common mistake.

           He grabs a pen and something to write on.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        ... five three three one. Got it.

           He pushes the receiver cradle and quickly dials again.

                                 GIRL
                        This is exciting.

           Dev looks at her like “Really?”

           Dan’s roommate BEN is lying on his bed reading a book. The

                             (answering it)

                                 MITCH
                        Hey, is Dan there?

                                 BEN
                        He’s at class.

                                 MITCH
                        Oh. Uh, listen. Let’s say I needed 
                        to, uh, pick up. Like, drugs -- 
                        marijuana --

                                 BEN
                             (not an idiot)
                        I understand what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 MITCH
                        Would Dan be able to help?
                                 BEN
                        Well, I don’t know him that well. 
                        We’ve only been living together a 
                        week. But I’m pretty sure he’s 
                        outta that game. I saw him today, 
                        he said he sold his last joint ever 
                        to this high school chick. He 
                        didn’t want to but he couldn’t say 
                        no because she’s really hot or 
                        something.

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah, that’s... familiar. So, let’s 
                        say I really needed Dan to score 
                        for me. What would he do? Would he 
                        come to you?

                                 BEN
                        Nah, I don’t touch the stuff. But 
                        uh, let’s see...
                             (beat)
                        Oh -- there was this chick at this 
                        party last night. He talked to her 
                        for a while. They smoked a joint 
                        together. Her joint. I don’t know 
                        her name though. I think she came 
                        with Amy?

                                 MITCH
                        You got Amy’s number?

                             (into phone)
                        Oh yeah! Dan! Yeah, he was super 
                        into Ivy. She told me they made 
                        plans to hang out today. He’s gonna 
                        come by Royce around 5 when she 
                        gets off work.

                                 MITCH (V.O.)
                        Royce?

           EXT. ROYCE HALL

           We see Dan and Gia walking up the steps in front of Royce. 
           Above the entrance there’s a large BANNER that says “THE 
           SUPERHIGHWAY SUMMIT: IMAGINING THE FUTURE.”
                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        Yeah, Ivy works part-time for UCLA 
                        Catering, there’s some kinda big-
                        deal thing going on at Royce Hall. 
                        Right around now I think.

                                 MITCH (V.O.)
                        You think she’s got weed?

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        Always.

           They continue down the arch-covered portico that encircles 
           the building, passing two Secret Service guys posted at the 
           entrance. Gore’s speech can be heard.

                                 AL GORE (O.S.)
                        ... but the changes yet to come 
                        will be so dramatic that we can’t 
                        be certain what the future will 
                        look like. We know the direction, 
                        but not the destination...

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Caterers are preparing for the post-speech reception. Dan and 
           Gia enter. Dan looks around and spots his friend --

                                 DAN
                        Hey. Ivy.

           He waves. IVY smiles and walks over.

                                 IVY
                        You’re three hours early. I’m 
                        impressed.

                                 DAN
                        Yeah. Sorry. I, uh... this is 
                        awkward--

                             (to Gia)
                        Hey. I’m Ivy.

                                 GIA
                        Gia. I’m blackmailing Dan into 
                        getting me weed.

           Ivy looks at Dan.

                                 IVY
                        You came here to pick up?
                                 DAN
                        Well... yeah, but--

                                 IVY
                        Not only am I at work, but the 
                        fucking vice president is 
                        downstairs. There are Secret 
                        Service agents everywhere. I had to 
                        pass a background check just to be 
                        allowed to carry an hors d’oeuvre 
                        tray around the reception. And you 
                        really thought I’d be stupid enough 
                        to have drugs on me right now?

           Dan is duly chastened.

                                 IVY (CONT’D)
                        Well, you were right. Let’s go 
                        outside.

           Before they can leave, another young CATERER walks up --

                                 CATERER
                        Hey, Ivy. Phone call for you.

                                 IVY
                        Who is it?

                                 CATERER
                        Didn’t get his name.

                                 IVY
                        Take a message. I’m going on a, uh, 
                        smoke break.

                                 CATERER
                        All right.

           Ivy leads Gia and Dan outside. The caterer walks back to the 
           phone.

                                 CATERER (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Can I take a message? She just 
                        stepped out for a smoke.

                        Was anybody with her?
                                 CATERER (V.O.)
                        Yeah, a really pretty girl and a 
                        guy who looked like Dave Grohl.

                                 MITCH
                        Thanks.

           He hangs up.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        She’s there. Gia. She’s there right 
                        now. Royce Hall.

                                 CONCESSION STAND GIRL
                        That was so cool.

           Mitch heads for the door. Dev jogs after him.

                                 DEV
                        Hold up, I’ll drive you.

                                 MITCH
                        What? No man, you stay here.

                                 DEV
                        Fuck that. She’ll be gone by the 
                        time you get there.

                                 CONCESSION STAND GIRL
                        You can take my bike.

                                 MITCH
                        ... Really?

                                 CONCESSION STAND GIRL
                        Yeah, it’s probably actually faster 
                        than driving. Here, catch.

           She tosses him a bike lock key.

                                 MITCH
                        How did I ever live without you, 
                        Concession Stand Girl?

           She smiles.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                             (to Dev)
                        Listen. There’s a room over there 
                        containing two insanely great 
                        possibilities. One is becoming 
                        friends with the exact guy you want 
                        to be in ten years. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        The other is seeing Jurassic Park 
                        before everyone else on this 
                        planet. If you don’t get back in 
                        there I swear to God I’ll give you 
                        shit about it for the rest of your 
                        life.

                                 DEV
                        Yeah.
                             (grins)
                        Yeah. All right, man.

           Mitch hurries outside. As Dev turns and starts heading back 
           into the movie, Concession Stand Girl GRABS him by the 
           shoulders, wild-eyed.

                                 CONCESSION STAND GIRL
                        The secret test movie is Jurassic 
                        Park?!

           EXT. ROYCE HALL

           Gia, Dan and Ivy are hanging out just outside Royce, in a 
           secluded spot under the arches. Ivy exhales a cloud of smoke 
           and passes Gia a JOINT.

                                 IVY
                        Yeah, that’s the thing about high 
                        school. It’s this fucked-up 
                        totalitarian state where someone 
                        else is always deciding what’s best 
                        for you. In college there’s nothing 
                        weird about blowing off a day of 
                        class to get high and see a movie. 
                        I do that like twice a week and 
                        I’ve never not made Dean’s List.

           Gia exhales after a long drag.

                                 GIA
                        Your teachers don’t care if you 
                        skip class?

                                 IVY
                        God no. For seminars maybe, but--

           Gia offers the joint to Dan.

                                 DAN
                        Uh. No thanks.
                                 IVY
                             (like a pusher in an after 
                              school special)
                        Come onnnn, man. Don’t be a 
                        squaaare.

                                 DAN
                             (sighing)
                        Fine.

           He takes a drag.

                                 IVY
                        I was kidding, but okay.

                                 DAN
                             (coughing)
                        Fuck me, that’s strong.

           He passes the joint to Ivy. She takes a drag and exhales.

                                 IVY
                        So tell me about this boyfriend of 
                        yours. Is he a cool guy?

           EXT. STREET

           Mitch RACES down Westwood Plaza on a HOT PINK bicycle with a 
           giant basket.

           INT. AUDITORIUM

           Ken watches Gore finish his speech --

                                 AL GORE
                        And so we meet today on common 
                        ground, not to predict the future 
                        but to make firm the arrangements 
                        for its arrival. Let us master and 
                        develop this new language together. 
                        The future really is in our hands. 
                        Thank you.

           He gets a standing ovation. Ken says something to Murakami 
           and walks out of the auditorium while everyone is still 
           applauding. He passes a SECRET SERVICE AGENT at the entrance.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                             (into wrist)
                        It’s done. Sundance is moving 
                        upstairs.
                                 IVY (V.O.)
                        So why aren’t you there?

           EXT. ROYCE HALL

           Gia stares at Ivy a long beat. They’re both pretty stoned, as 
           is Dan.

                                 GIA
                        ... Sorry, what?

                                 IVY
                        The movie. You came all this way to 
                        see it. Why aren’t you there?

                                 GIA
                        Because I know he’s there. And I 
                        know he hates me now. I, I keep 
                        picturing the way he’ll look at me, 
                        the look in his eyes...

           She trails off. Dan’s gazing into the distance, at a GUY IN A 
           SUIT approaching from the other end of the long walkway.

                                 DAN
                        Guys... who’s that?

                                 IVY
                             (squinting)
                        I don’t know. Nobody.

           She looks at Gia and sees her distant, morose look.

                                 IVY (CONT’D)
                        If he loved you before, he’s not 
                        gonna hate you ‘cause of one fight.

                                 GIA
                        I don’t know. I fight really really 
                        good.

           Ivy smiles, part “Trust me” and part “I believe it.” She 
           checks her watch.

                                 IVY
                        Shit. I should get back.

           Dan’s still fixated on the guy in the suit.

                                 DAN
                        Guys, seriously. I think that’s, 
                        like, a guy. A Secret Service guy.
                                 IVY
                        Dude, it’s nobody.

                                 DAN
                             (panicking)
                        No, I’m... I’m pretty sure it is. 
                        He’s gonna smell the pot, he’s-- 
                        we, we can’t stay here.

                                 IVY
                        Dan. Listen to me. You smoked too 
                        much and now you’re paranoid. 
                        Everything is fine.

           The guy’s getting closer. Dan is terrified.

                                 DAN
                        I’ll get expelled.

                                 IVY
                        Dan--

                                 DAN
                        Fuck.

           He takes off RUNNING.

                                 IVY
                        DAN!

           He sprints around the corner to the front portico, where he’s 
           noticed by the ACTUAL SECRET SERVICE AGENT posted at the  
           entrance.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                             (into wrist)
                        Got a guy running through the front 
                        arches. Probably nothing, I’ll 
                        check it out.

           He steps out into Dan’s path and holds up his hand.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Slow up, sir.

           Dan sees him, stops, glances backward, then JUMPS out of the 
           portico over a hedge and onto the lawn and continues running.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT (CONT’D)
                             (into wrist)
                        He’s evading. I got him.

           The agent SPRINTS after him and catches up quickly. Gia and 
           Ivy can see him TACKLE Dan to the grass.
                                 IVY
                        Shit.

           She looks around, then pulls open the nearby SIDE DOOR and 
           motions for Gia to follow her in.

           INT. ROYCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

                                 IVY
                             (mostly to herself)
                        He’ll be fine. He didn’t do 
                        anything they give a shit about and 
                        he doesn’t have anything on him.
                             (after a beat, to Gia)
                        Okay. Go down this hallway, turn 
                        right, and walk out the back.

                                 GIA
                        Okay.

           EXT. RECEPTION HALL TERRACE

           Businessmen and academics are networking and glad-handing 
           inside the reception hall. Ken and Murakami are out on the 
           adjacent terrace, looking like they’re waiting for something.

           Ivy walks out onto the terrace carrying a tray of drinks.

                                 CATERER
                        I was starting to think you bailed.

                                 IVY
                        He’s here.

                                 CATERER
                        Who?

                                 IVY
                        Gore. He just walked in.

           Ken, overhearing, murmurs something to Murakami.

           INT. ROYCE HALL

           Gia’s walking down a hallway in Royce. She turns a corner to 
           find a SECRET SERVICE AGENT standing there.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        Hello, ma’am. Where’re you headed?
                                 GIA
                        Uh, I was just--

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        Are you a student here?

                                 GIA
                        ... Yeah.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        What are you studying?

                                 GIA
                             (beat)
                        Trees.

           A pause.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        You mind if I look inside your bag?

                                 GIA
                        What for?

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        When people lie to me I’m supposed 
                        to figure out why.

           She reluctantly hands him her bag. He finds it right away.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        ... Christ.

           He pulls out a small BAG OF WEED.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        You think I care about this?

                                 GIA
                        You don’t-- you don’t have to, 
                        like, you know. You don’t have to

           EXT. RECEPTION HALL TERRACE

           A young AIDE to the vice president walks up to Ken and 
           Murakami on the terrace.

                                 AIDE
                        Mr. Murakami. So sorry for keeping 
                        you waiting.

           They shake hands. Ken translates into Japanese as the aide 
           speaks.

                                 AIDE (CONT’D)
                        The vice president is very 
                        interested in the work your 
                        company’s doing here in the States. 
                        He’d be delighted to give you a few 
                        minutes of his time to hear about 
                        your future plans.
                             (gestures inside)
                        Right this way.

           Ken suddenly hears a familiar voice coming from below the 
           terrace --

                                 GIA (O.S.)
                             (loud and defiant)
                        Are you listening? I don’t go here. 
                        You can’t do anything to me.

           He looks over the balcony toward the ground and sees Gia 
           being led away by a CAMPUS POLICE OFFICER. He’s 
           uncharacteristically rattled. Ivy too sees what’s happening.

                                 IVY
                        Oh, fuck.

           Murakami and the aide are watching Ken, wondering what’s up. 
           He thinks hard for a beat, then looks at Murakami.

                                 KEN
                             (in Japanese)
                        Sir. What is most important in 
                        life?

           Murakami raises an eyebrow.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Please, sir.

           Whatever this is, Murakami doesn’t seem to like it, but he 
           plays along.
                                 MURAKAMI
                        Loyalty.

                                 KEN
                        Loyalty to whom?

                                 AIDE
                        Uh, I’m sorry, what’re we--

                                 MURAKAMI
                        To one’s family.

                                 KEN
                        Loyalty to one’s family. Please 
                        indulge me further: imagine that 
                        you are in my position, in a moment 
                        such as this, and a member of your 
                        family is in distress. What do you 
                        do?

           He’s glancing at Gia with worry. Soon she’ll be too far away 
           for him to be able to follow and help. Murakami looks over at 
           her too, piecing together the situation.

                                 MURAKAMI
                        I weigh one loyalty against 
                        another. I choose the heavier. And 
                        without complaint or regret I bear 
                        the cost of my choice.

           Ken swallows.

                                 KEN
                        It has been a privilege to receive 
                        your wisdom.

           He bows.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                             (quietly, in English)
                        This is a huge fucking mistake.

                                 AIDE
                        What--

           Ken hurries inside and out of the reception.

           EXT. ROYCE HALL

           Mitch jumps off the pink bike and goes SPRINTING up the steps 
           next to Royce, toward the side entrance. He doesn’t notice 
           Ken running out the front.
           EXT. RECEPTION HALL TERRACE

           From the terrace, Ivy watches as Ken catches up to Gia and 
           follows her and the cop out of view. She heads back inside.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - CONTINUOUS

           She moves through the crowd. Another CATERER spots her.

                                 CATERER
                        Ivy. There’s a guy here, says he 
                        needs to talk to you. He can’t get 
                        in ‘cause he doesn’t have a badge 
                        but he said to give you this.

           He hands her a folded napkin. She puts down her tray of 
           drinks to look at it. On the inside is written “HAVE YOU SEEN 
           THIS GIRL?” next to a crude but effective drawing of Gia.

           She sees Mitch standing by the door and walks over.

                                 IVY
                        Let me guess. Mitch?

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah.

                                 IVY
                        I’ve got some really shitty news.

           INT. CAMPUS POLICE STATION

           This place looks more like a LIBRARY than a police station -- 
           it’s set up in an old campus building that was clearly 
           intended for academic use. No jail cells or interrogation 
           rooms, just a large open area with offices.

           Ken is sitting on a bench, staring at the ground, his leg 
           jittering. He sees Mitch enter, out of breath.

                                 KEN
                        Are you psychic or something?

                                 MITCH
                        Where is she?

                                 KEN
                        They’re, I don’t know, they’re 
                        getting her fingerprints.
                                 MITCH
                        Fingerprints? What--
                             (looks around)
                        Campus police? She’s not a student, 
                        how can they even--

                                 KEN
                        Yeah, turns out the UCPD has state-
                        wide authority. They’re real 
                        police. This...
                             (gestures around)
                        ... is an actual police station.

                                 MITCH
                        Fuck me.

           He sits down on the bench. Ken’s leg-jitter starts up again. 
           Mitch looks at him.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Since when are you the nervous one?

                                 KEN
                        I did a stupid thing. I mean, it 
                        was what I was supposed to do, but--

           GIA is led out of a room by a COP. She sees Mitch.

                                 GIA
                        Oh boy. This is awkward.

           Mitch walks over to her and gently squeezes her arm.

                                 MITCH
                             (close)
                        You all right?

           She frowns and licks her lips, not really looking at him.

                                 GIA
                        I’m thirsty.

           He stares at her.

                                 GIA (CONT’D)
                        Like... really thirsty.

           Mitch blinks and walks over to a nearby water cooler, and 
           pours out a cup while she watches. He walks back over and 
           hands it to her. She downs the whole thing in one gulp and 
           scrunches up the paper cup and tosses it on the floor.

           The cop walks over, holding a clipboard.
                                 COP
                        Okay, so. Third offense, probation 
                        violation. Depending on the judge, 
                        some correctional time is likely. 
                        Fairly certain from experience 
                        you’re gonna get expelled from your 
                        private school.
                             (glancing at her litter)
                        Also fairly certain you’re gonna 
                        pick that up and put it in the 
                        trash.

           She hides her face. Mitch looks like he got hit by a truck.

                                 MITCH
                        Excuse me. Hey.

                                 COP
                        Who’re you?

                                 MITCH
                        Pretend like it doesn’t matter.

           The cop stiffens.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        She had, what? A quarter on her?

                                 COP
                        Seven grams, yes.

                                 MITCH
                        For seven grams of pot you go to 
                        jail?

                                 COP
                        When it’s the third time in two 
                        years, yeah.

                                 MITCH
                        No. No no. That’s not how it works.

                                 COP
                             (suppressing a smile)
                        No?

           Mitch looks at Gia, then back at the cop, intensely.

                                 MITCH
                        No. No. The, the, whatever you 
                        found, the bag -- it’s not hers. 
                        It’s mine. It belongs to me.
                                 COP
                             (grinning)
                        So, what, she was holding it for 
                        you?

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah.

           The cop turns to the other police in the room.

                                 COP
                        Hey. Kid says she was holding it 
                        for him.

           The other cops chuckle. The DESK SERGEANT overhears from a 
           nearby office. He stands in his open doorway to see what’s 
           going on.

                                 MITCH
                        Stop laughing.

                                 COP
                        What?

                                 MITCH
                        Stop fucking laughing. Is this a 
                        joke to you? Destroying somebody’s 
                        life?

                                 COP
                        Watch it. You’re talking to a 
                        police officer.

           Mitch smirks.

                                 MITCH
                        Well, I apologize if my lack of 
                        respect is unconcealed. But you 
                        need to understand something. This 
                        isn’t gonna happen. It’s not. I’m 
                        sorry. Her future doesn’t belong to 
                        you. It’s not yours to ruin.

           The cop folds his arms.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna put this on me.

                                 COP
                        I can’t do that.

                                 MITCH
                        Sure you can. You’re the guy with 
                        the badge, right? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MITCH (CONT'D)
                        It’s a piece of paper in a file. I-- 
                        Christ, I don’t need a spotless 
                        fucking record. There are things 
                        I’ll pretend to give a fuck about 
                        losing, and there’s her. I mean, 
                        Jesus. College. Who cares. I 
                        already know what I’m here to do. 
                        I’m supposed to make this person’s 
                        life worth living. Fuck everything 
                        else.

                                 COP
                        Well, that’s nice. But in the real 
                        world, we don’t lie about a charge 
                        just because someone’s boyfriend 
                        decides to sacrifice himself.

                                 MITCH
                        Oh, fuck no. No. This, this isn’t 
                        sacrifice. This is total 
                        selfishness. My life’s never not 
                        gonna be strapped to hers. I’m 
                        already deep in the fucking blast 
                        radius, okay? So, you take this off 
                        of her and put it on me and it’s 
                        less of a lie than you think. You 
                        don’t, you’re pulling the pin on 
                        two lives, not one.

           The cop smiles, looks down, shakes his head.

                                 COP
                        Okay. You’re a bright kid. Here’s 
                        some free advice: find a girl who 
                        isn’t gonna drag you down to the 
                        bottom with her.

                                 MITCH
                        Hmm.
                             (nods)
                        Yeah. That’s good advice. Are you 
                        married, Officer?

                                 COP
                        Yeah.

                                 MITCH

                        Twenty-three years. Wow.
           Mitch smiles.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        You still fuck her?

                                 COP
                        ... What?

                                 MITCH
                        Do you still fuck your wife?

                                 COP
                        The hell did you say?

                                 MITCH
                        It’s a simple question. I’m just 
                        curious.

                                 COP

                        How often do you fuck your wife, 
                        Officer?

           The cop stands there FUMING, looking at Mitch like he’s about 
           to murder him. Mitch looks serene.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        You don’t treat her like garbage. 
                        You don’t do that. Sorry. Beat me 
                        to death if it’s what you feel.

           The desk sergeant finally steps in--

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Gary.

                        Yeah.

                        Take fifteen. Go for a walk.

           The cop doesn’t move.

                                 DESK SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        Now.

                        Yeah, okay.

           He stalks away, out the back exit. The desk sergeant looks at 
           Mitch.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        When he comes back, you won’t be 
                        here. Make sure of that.

           He goes back in his office and shuts the door.

           There’s a weird ELECTRONIC WARBLING. Ken reaches into his 
           suit and pulls out an enormous CELLULAR PHONE.

                                 KEN
                             (answering phone)
                        Moshi moshi.
                             (pause)
                        Hai. Hai, sugu ni iku....

           Everyone watches him get up and wander outside.

                                 FRONT DESK OFFICER
                        ... Is he from the future?

           EXT. CAMPUS POLICE STATION

           Murakami is standing outside the station, his hands in his 
           pockets. Ken walks up looking grave and apologetic.

                                 MURAKAMI
                             (nodding toward building)
                        This is a police station?

                                 KEN
                        Barely.

           Another silent beat, then Ken can’t take it anymore --

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Sir. I feel so ashamed--

                                 MURAKAMI
                        Never apologize for doing a 
                        necessary thing.

                                 KEN
                        But the meeting--

                                 MURAKAMI
                        Ken.

                        Do you really think a three billion 
                        dollar company would put me in 
                        charge of North American 
                        operations...
                             (in English)
                        ... if I didn’t speak a word of 
                        your language?

           His English is heavily accented, but solid. Ken is stunned.

                                 KEN
                        Holy shit.

                                 MURAKAMI
                        Yes.

                                 KEN
                        What-- why didn’t you tell me?

                                 MURAKAMI
                        It never came up.

           A pause. Ken’s still reeling.

                                 MURAKAMI (CONT’D)
                        Is your friend all right?

                                 KEN
                        No.

           Another pause. The wheels are turning in his mind. He has an 
           idea. He straightens his posture and takes a breath.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                             (in Japanese)
                        I must request a favor.

           INT. CAMPUS POLICE STATION

           Mitch is seated on the bench next to Gia. She wordlessly 
           takes his hand.

                                 GIA
                             (soft)
                        How’d you get here so fast? How’d 
                        you know to be here?

                                 MITCH
                        I was comin’ to find you. I wanted 
                        it to be me who came to you and 
                        said I’m stupid and I’m sorry.
                             (beat)
                        I met your friend Ivy.
                                 GIA
                        Ivy’s the coolest.

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah.

           They sit in silence for a beat.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        Listen. I gotta stop lying.

           She looks at him.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        I should never have told you I love 
                        you. Not because it’s not true, but 
                        because I don’t know if it’s true. 
                        I mean, I’m seventeen. You were 
                        right -- I don’t know anything. 
                        Neither do you. We say stuff just 
                        because we think it’s what people 
                        are supposed to say. We should stop 
                        doing that.
                             (pause)
                        Anyway. I know what I want now. I 
                        figured it out.

                                 GIA
                        Yeah?

                                 MITCH
                        I want what’s right in front of me.

           She smiles. KEN enters.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                             (to Ken)
                        Hey. We should go.

           Ken ignores him as he walks confidently to the office of the 
           desk sergeant, knocks on the door, and lets himself in. We 
           can SEE the two of them talking through the office window, 
           but we can’t hear what’s being said.

                                 GIA
                        What’s he doing?

           Ken’s grinning and gesticulating. The sergeant starts to 
           chuckle. Soon he’s laughing, hard. He begs off, like, “Stop, 
           you’re killing me.” They shake hands. Ken waves goodbye and 
           comes out of the office. His smile instantly switches off.

                                 KEN
                        You’re off the hook. Let’s go.
                                 GIA
                        What?

                                 MITCH
                        What?

                                 KEN
                        Come on. We can still make the end 
                        of the movie.

           They slowly stand up and follow him toward the door.

                                 MITCH
                        What the hell did you say to him?

                                 KEN
                        I asked him if he wanted to be head 
                        of security at the new West Coast 
                        headquarters of Zaibatsu Systems.

                                 MITCH
                        Oh. Why didn’t I think of that.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER

           The assistant we met earlier is leading Gia, Mitch and Ken 
           through the theater lobby. They pass the concession stand.

                                 CONCESSION STAND GIRL
                        Hey! Did you get her back?

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah, for now.

                                 CONCESSION STAND GIRL
                        Bummer.

           He tosses her the key to her bike lock.

                                 GIA
                        Who was that?

                                 MITCH
                        That’s, uh, Concession Stand Girl. 
                        She works here.

                                 GIA
                        Really. Tell me more.

           They reach the door to the theater.
                                 ASSISTANT
                        Okay. If this times out the way I 
                        think, it’s gonna be pretty funny.

           He swings open the door, revealing the MOVIE SCREEN...

           ... which has just begun to show the CREDITS. The audience 
           APPLAUDS and CHEERS.

                                 MITCH
                        ... Wow.

           Dev is the first of their friends to come wandering out. 
           Megan follows close behind. As soon as she sees Ken, she 
           can’t take her eyes off him; he pretends to ignore her.

                                 DEV
                        Oh, hey. What took you so long?

                                 MITCH
                        You know, a run-in with the Secret 
                        Service, some possession charges, 
                        the usual.

                                 DEV
                             (grinning, nodding)
                        I get it. You were foolin’ around.

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER

           They’re standing outside now. Gia leans against Mitch, 
           whispering something in his ear; he smiles. Chris Rock writes 
           something on a scrap of paper and hands it to Dev.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Next time you’re in New York, gimme 
                        a call. I’ll introduce you to some 
                        people.

                                 DEV
                        Next time I’m in New York? When the 
                        fuck am I gonna be in New York?

           Chris Rock stares at him.

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        I mean: thank you, famous person.

                                 CHRIS ROCK
                        Yeah, work on that.

           He gets into a cab. Nearby, Ken is finishing up his call.
                                 KEN
                             (into phone)
                        Itsudemo. Hai. Arigato.

           He hangs up and notices Megan watching him. They search each 
           other a beat.

                                 MEGAN
                        Um. Hey. Listen--

                                 KEN
                        I’m leaving the country soon. So we 
                        can’t fall in love. But we can do 
                        absolutely anything else.

           He hands her his CELL PHONE.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call you.

           He walks past her, leaving her stunned and speechless, and 
           sidles up to Mitch.

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Can I get my CDs back from you 
                        sometime?

                                 MITCH
                        Yeah, sure. Why?

                                 KEN
                        I’m moving to Tokyo in six weeks.

                                 MITCH
                        ... Oh.

           He opts not to press further. Dev walks up with Francis 
           holding his hand.

                                 DEV
                        We all set?

                                 MITCH
                        Yep.

           Silence. Nobody moves. They look one way down the street. 
           They look the other way down the street. All they learn is 
           that the sun will be setting soon, and the street is very, 
           very long.

                                 MITCH (CONT’D)
                        How the fuck do we get home?

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
