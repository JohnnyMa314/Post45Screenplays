           AN EGG.  Perfect.  White.  Reflecting bright fluorescent
           light off it's shell.  Slowly.  Rotating.  Like a planet in
           the heavens.  Until:  

           A YELLOW TAPE MEASURE --

           Rises into frame.  Moving into position against the egg.  We
           see the numbers.  Measured in millimeters.  The egg is
           precisely 49 mm across. 

           A CHRYON TELLS US WE'RE IN:  SHANGHAI, CHINA.

           Adjust to discover --

           WAE "PHILIP" REN.  35.  Holding the EGG between his thumb
           and forefinger in one hand.  Measuring with his other. 
           Precise.  Focused.  One eye closed.  Making certain.  49 MM.  

           Ren breaks into an awkward, crooked and yet completely
           endearing smile.  He needs decades worth of orthodontics. 
           Not that he could afford it.  On his salary.   

           We pull further out to see his BLUE JUMPSUIT, TOOL BELT around
           his waist, and the ever familiar WALMART LOGO emblazoned
           across his chest.  Yes.  They even have Walmart in China. 
           Ren carefully places the EGG in a carton.  11 spots to be
           filled.  And as we question why Ren needs 49 mm eggs:

                                 VOICE  (O.S.)
                        Excuse me....

           Ren turns to see:  A MAN.  To call him disheveled would be
           offensive to slobs.  Shirt torn.  Sweating.  He looks like a
           CHINESE OSCAR THE GROUCH.  Ren's immediately concerned. 
           Kind.  They speak in subtitled Mandarin:

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        Do you work here?

                                 REN
                        Are you okay?

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        Fine yes fine.  Do you work here?

                        What's wrong with saying janitor?

                                 REN
                        Some people think it's demeaning.

                        Doesn't change my job.  Still have to
                        mop.  Still have to unclog toilets. 
                        And with all the free samples here -- 

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                          (oh -- ewwww)

                                 REN
                        Oh no, I'm not complaining.  It's a
                        good job.  Good hard work.

           Oscar eyes the egg in Ren's hand.  The yellow tape measure.  

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        Are you working now?

                                 REN
                        My shift just ended -- on my way home
                        to cook breakfast for my family.  

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        I am interrupting.

           Ren checks his watch.  11:03 PM.

                                 REN
                        It's no bother really.  I have time. 
                        Please.  How can I help?

           Oscar sees the look in Ren's eyes.  Beaming that smile. 
           Ren's going to help despite any objections -- 

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        Crab?

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        You don't have it?

                        We have everything.  It's Walmart. 
                        But.  It's Walmart.

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        I could never afford good, real Crab. 
                        And.  There's this girl.  

                                 REN
                        There always is. 

           Ren smiles.  Thinking on his WIFE.  His hands subconsciously
           drawn to his WEDDING RING.  Twisting.  Understanding.      

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        But I wasn't important enough.  So I
                        worked harder.  Getting promotions. 
                        Making a plan to take her to a fancy
                        dinner at Wang Boa He.  Crab.  Propose. 
                        Then she'd see, then she'd know... 

           Ren looks to see -- the FISH SECTION -- laid out next to the
           EGGS in the refrigerated aisle.  Searching.  Finding.

                                 REN
                        Blue?  Soft shell?  Dungeness?  

           Oscar takes a pack of Blue Crab Meat.  Thanking Ren.  Gobbling
           it down.  Very much like the muppet he resembles.  Ren looks
           at Oscar, "So?"  

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        Amazing.  Thank you.  

           And with that, Oscar pulls A GUN from his jacket -- 

           But before Ren can do anything... Oscar puts the muzzle under
           his chin.  AND FIRES.  BAM!  Collapsing to the ground in a
           heap.  Blood pooling under his head --

           Ren looks down at Oscar.  SAD.  But not SHOCKED.  As if it
           wasn't unexpected.  And then.  Oddly.  Ren turns back to the
           fish.  Taking a nice filet of YELLOWTAIL.  

           INT. WALMART - CHECKOUT COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

           The checkout stands are EMPTY.  Ghost town.  No one anywhere. 
           All the video screens play the SAME EXACT COMMERCIAL. 
           Something sappy about KODAK FILM.

           Ren has his SHOPPING BAG FILLED.  Eggs.  Fish.  He stops at
           the FLOWER KIOSK.  Looking through Roses.  Daisies.  Then
           taking a large BOUQUET OF SUNFLOWERS.  When he notices:

           CONTINUED:

           BLOODY FOOT PRINTS.  Ren looks at his feet.  He stepped in
           Oscar's blood.  Disgusting.  And awful.  And Ren knows he
           should leave well enough alone.  But:  

           He grabs a RAG from his belt and gets down on hands and knees. 
           Wiping up the blood.  Compulsive.  Can't leave any kind of
           mess behind.  And as Ren CLEANS, we move to the SCREENS --
           switching from COMMERCIALS to:

           A NEWS FEED.  WE SLOWLY PAN IN UNTIL THE SCREEN FILLS THE
           FRAME -- IT'S A SATELLITE PHOTO OF THE EARTH.  We hear the

           AUSTRALIA.  The Outback.  Aborigines gathered around a
           tremendous BONFIRE.  Listening on a transistor radio:

           WE HEAR THE VOICE OF SIR JOHN BAINBRIDGE.  Classic radio
           host molded in Murrow and Cronkite.  Part poet.  Part
           philosopher.  Opinionated.  But there is a wisdom to every
           word he chooses.  Quoting T.S. ELIOT'S THE HOLLOW MEN:

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO)
                        "Between the idea and the reality.

                        "Between the conception and the creation.

           LONDON.  We must be 30 stories up.  A gorgeous view of the
           city.  Big Ben.  Parliament.  There  appears to be rioting
           in the streets.  Plumes of black smoke rising into the sky. 
           But we HEAR NOTHING.  ODD.  DISCONNECTED.  DISCONCERTING.

           We pull back to realize we're inside:

           INT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - DAY

           Floor to ceiling windows look out over London, while we float
           inside the booth to find --  

           ONE WALL is filled with HONORS for Bainbridge's career. 
           PEABODY.  PULITZER.  A GOLD CROSS -- Knight Commander Order
           of the British Empire.  We still DON'T SEE Bainbridge.   

                                 SIR JOHN (O.S.)

                        but a whimper."  T.S. Eliot.

           THE OTHER WALL is covered in BANKS OF MONITORS:

                        I speak to you with the accumulated
                        weight of history clinging to my heavy
                        heart.  200,000 years of tragedy, of
                        triumph, of perseverance despite the
                        overwhelming tide of time and tyranny.  

           The monitors stream news and images from:

           WASHINGTON.  Tanks sit sentinel outside the WHITE HOUSE. 
           Protecting the President.  But the SOLDIERS have all abandoned
           their posts.  Gone home to their loved ones.

                        I have shaken hands with men whose hands
                        shake the earth.  Presidents and despots. 
                        I passionately and dispassionately
                        witnessed their governments topple.

           BERLIN.  In the rubble of Berlin Wall, someone has left a
           bouquet of flowers in memorial.

                        Walls falling in Berlin.

           MANHATTAN.  A COCKER SPANIEL devours the HOT DOGS from a
           toppled cart.  A leash attached to its collar.  No owner.

                        Towers falling in New York.

           MECCA.  Inside the Masjid Al-Haram Mosque.  Pilgrims
           circumambulate the Kaaba.  Praying.

                        shrieking bullets murder tranquil hope.

           Then floating down from the monitors to:  

           SIR JOHN BAINBRIDGE'S HANDS.  ONLY HIS HANDS.  Old yes. 
           Scars and Liver spots.  But hardly fragile.  Thick and strong. 
           Palms pressed flat against his DESK CONSOLE.  Not reading
           from a SCRIPT.  But speaking from his heart.

                                 SIR JOHN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        My hands have bled against jagged rubble,
                        laboring to free souls trapped in the
                        wake of earthquakes and tsunamis.  The
                        spark of hope we cling to for better
                        tomorrows is flickering to oblivion...

           WE ARM UP TO FINALLY MEET:

           SIR JOHN BAINBRIDGE.  70s.  (Think ANTHONY HOPKINS.)  A FIERCE
           WISDOM forged in his steady BLUE EYES.  Unfazed by the images
           before him.  HEADPHONES on.  Speaking succinctly into his
           MICROPHONE.  Diligently performing his task.

                        this old man theater to speak his mind,
                        even when the opinion was not popular. 
                        We boldly fought the days news together --
                        facing the too often oppressive horror --
                        seeking silver linings on overcast days.   

           Bainbridge takes a long, deep sigh -- then wetting his mouth,
           the perfect orator...

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        And I shall not leave, but remain your
                        steadfast servant for these final 6
                        hours.  If you are alone.  If you have
                        no one to offer a comforting hand. 
                        Please take mine...

           Bainbridge looks up into the CONTROL BOOTH to see.  IT'S
           EMPTY.  No PRODUCER.  No ENGINEER.  No ONE.  A hint of concern
           crosses Bainbridge's eyes, but not his voice:     

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        The Prime Minister offered this statement
                        earlier in the hour.  

           Bainbridge's FINGER passes along the LIGHTS on his console. 
           Pressing an ORANGE BUTTON, we HEAR THE ELECTRONIC WHIRRRRR
           of TAPE CUEING -- as Bainbridge whips off his HEADPHONES: 

           INT. BBC - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           WE HEAR the PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT play over the hall
           speakers, as Bainbridge stalks down the hall, looking for:

           PRUDENCE FIGGINS.  30s.  Shaken by the news, but trying to
           remain calm.  Despite the mascara that is threatening to run
           down her cheek and mar her pristine alabaster skin.  

           Prudence is exiting her office.  Pulling her coat on.  Bag
           over her shoulder.  All signs indicate:

                                 SIR JOHN
                        You're off then?

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Stayed to hear your cold open.

           And even with 50 years experience, there's still a self-
           conscious artist lurking in Bainbridge's slumped shoulders.  

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                 SIR JOHN
                          (self-depricating)
                        Plagiarism.

                                 PRUDENCE
                        You're ten times the poet Eliot was.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I'm a journalist.  So are you.

           Prudence knows where this is going -- feet shuffling.

                                 PRUDENCE
                        I'm a mom.  I have a family.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        We have a duty --

                                 PRUDENCE
                        To Gerald -- to my Anton...

                                 SIR JOHN
                        To the public discourse --

                                 PRUDENCE
                        And my mum's moved in --

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Since when...?

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Two, three months now.  Can't afford a
                        nanny on mine and Gerald's wages. 

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Are you angling for a raise?

           Prudence gives an uncomfortable smirk.  She always loved
           Bainbridge's wry sense of humor.  Even today.  She's very
           fond of him.  

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Pru...  Please stay.  Who's gonna work
                        all the switches?

           Bainbridge touches Prudence's hand.  Delicate.  Lingering. 
           Shit!  Are they're having an AFFAIR?  

                                 PRUDENCE
                        You're the one who taught me.  

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:  (2)

           It's certainly feels like an affair.  Longing in their eyes.   

                                 PRUDENCE (CONT'D)
                        You could join us.

           Leave?  But this building.  The BBC.  This is Bainbridge's
           life.  And standing with Prudence.  Nearly 40 years his
           younger.  And even though she's disheveled, her beauty shines
           through.  His silver lining.  He's torn.  But then. 

                                 SIR JOHN
                        It'd be indecorous. 

           He pulls his hand away.  It breaks Prudence's heart.  A
           mascara-infused-tear escaping her eye.

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I can't leave.  I have a job.

                                 PRUDENCE
                        A knight errant till the bitter -- 

           End.  Yes.  Precisely.  Bainbridge remains -- OBJECTIVE. 
           The journalist.  It doesn't help.  Only makes Prudence cry
           more.  The gentleman, Bainbridge offers a HANDKERCHIEF --
           the chivalry of a lost generation.  Then --   

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I've got dead air in 35.  Best of luck.

           Bainbridge gives Prudence a kiss on the cheek.  Tender. 
           Heads back into the booth.  We stay with Prudence, holding
           the handkerchief.  She's trying to get her feet to motivate. 
           Then hearing Bainbridge come over the hallway speaker.  

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        We have breaking news coming in from
                        America...

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           THICK SHAFTS OF SUNSHINE bully their way through a GLADE OF
           ELMS.  Shining on:

           OLIVE WINGERT.  16.  Her roundish face is giving way to the
           striking features of adulthood.  Cheek bones and chin
           beginning to find definition out of baby fat.

           A CHYRON TELLS US WE'RE IN:  ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.

           Olive's BLACK ARMY BOOTS chew through forest floor revealing
           her STRENGTH, but her PINK-POLKA-DOT-TIGHTS and short mix-
           match SKIRT hint at her emerging femininity.  

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Is she a tomboy?  Is she a girl?  Is she a child?  An adult? 
           Olive is STUCK.  IN-BETWEEN.  At a fork in the proverbial
           road.  And in the forest.  Which way to go?  

           Left?  Uphill.  The difficult path.  Steep jagged rocks. 
           Right?  Downhill.  Clearly forged trails.  Footprints in the
           mud.  Olive considers.  And then -- heads downhill.     

           EXT. EASY FOREST TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Olive knows the trail INTIMATELY.  Not afraid to be alone in
           the woods.  There's SOLACE in the quiet RUSTLE of leaves. 
           The DRONE of a WATERFALL in the distance.  And then, Olive
           hears:        

           A GIGGLE.  A WOMAN.  Tickling Olive's ears.  Her eyes narrow
           in curiosity.  When she hears it again.  A LAUGH.  

           Olive climbs off the path.  Wading ankle deep in IVY. 
           Following the sound, careful not to make a ruckus.  Stepping
           lightly.  Tracking her prey.  A hunter.  Until she discovers.    

           THE WOMAN.  LAYING UNDERNEATH A MAN.  IN A BED OF IVY.    

           Olive hides behind a tree making certain she's not noticed. 
           Her fingers pressed against canyons of bark, peering to see:  

           The man's PANTS DOWN around his ankles.  The Woman's SHIRT
           pulled up to her neck.  Writhing.  Slowly.  The laughter
           turning to -- MOANS.  

           Olive's eyes go wide.  Holy Crap!  They're having sex?  Right
           here?  Right out in the open?  For anyone to see.  And Olive
           knows she shouldn't watch -- but she can't take her eyes
           away.  Forbidden.  Drawn to:

           The Woman's BLACK STOCKINGS and GARTER.  Sexy.  A THICK RIBBON
           OF LACE -- pulled tight around her thigh.  Olive looks down
           at her own pink-polka-dot-tights.  Thick cotton.  Faded and
           worn thin around the knees.  CHILDISH.    

           Olive studies the couple making love.  Inquisitive silence. 
           Noticing:  THE WOMAN IS CRYING.  A cocktail of joy and
           sadness.  A fountain of emotion.  The pleasure of sex.  The
           joy of being with her lover.  The sadness that the world is
           going to take this away.  Clinging to each other.  LOVE. 
           This is what LOVE really looks like.  And then:  

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                        OLIVE!  OLIVE!!!

           The COUPLE stops.  Turning their heads in the direction of
           the VOICE.  In Olive's direction.  But she's GONE...
           INT. CAR/EXT. ROUTE 94 - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           STUCK in traffic.  Horns BLARE.  Frustrations mounting.  The
           traffic is thick on both sides of Route 94.  Everyone is
           trying to get everywhere.  Maxing out at 1 mph.  WE FIND:

           Olive.  Sitting next to her little brother TYLER (10). 
           Olive's father, MR.  WINGERT (45) drives, while her father's
           girlfriend ANGELA (25) rides shotgun.  

           Angela is way too young to be Olive's mom.  And totally
           inappropriate for Mr. Wingert to be dating.  And yet.  There
           she is.  They listen to SIR JOHN BAINBRIDGE on the radio:

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO)
                        -- With Dr. Harbahajan Singh from Dubai 
                        University.  Dr. Singh -- this term --
                        gravitational fluctuation:

                                 DR. SINGH (ON THE RADIO)
                          (slight Indian accent)
                        Yes...

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO)
                        The U.N. Science Council calls them
                        imminent, but has yet to adequately
                        explain precisely what we can expect.  

                                 DR. SINGH (ON THE RADIO)
                          (stammering)
                        Yes -- so -- what we see occurring in
                        the bimodal subpulses and transient --  

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO)
                        -- Pardon my interruption, but I speak
                        for everyone when I say, this ubiquitous
                        terminology is the crux of the dilemma. 

           Bainbridge brow-beats Dr. Singh's ineffectiveness.  Not
           unkindly, but fatherly.  There's a difference.  

                                 DR. SINGH (ON THE RADIO)
                        Gravity will -- shift.  Heavier.  And
                        lighter.  With ranging frequency as we
                        approach zero hour -- the uhhhm end... 

           Mr. Wingert CLICKS OFF the radio.  Checks the clock -- 10:13
           AM.  Checks his children in the rearview mirror:

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        We'll be at church soon.  The important
                        thing is we're together.  Family.  

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Mr. Wingert is a rock.  Not giving himself an inch for fear
           or anxiety.  He can't.  His family is relying on him.  To be
           the patriarch.  Leader.  He won't let them down.  

                                 MR. WINGERT (CONT'D)
                        Right?

           They don't answer.  Angela does.  

                                 ANGELA
                        Right.

           There's a SPUTTER in Angela's voice.  Trying to emulate Mr.
           Wingert.  Siphon off his strength.  Falling short.  

                                 ANGELA (CONT'D)
                        Why don't we sing?  Sing?  Yes?    
                          (off Mr. Wingert's nod)
                        This little light of mine. 

                                 ANGELA & MR. WINGERT
                        I'm gonna let it shine.  Let it shine.

                                 ANGELA & MR. WINGERT & TYLER
                        Let it shine.  Let it shine.

           Olive eyes her Brother.  Tyler submits so easily to adults. 
           The sheep.  Following blindly.  Too young to formulate his
           own thoughts.  Unlike Olive.  Questioning every answer. 

           We adjust to reveal -- that hidden inside her sweater --
           Olive's thumbs are flying across her phone.  Texting.  

                                 OLIVE'S TEXT
                        I h8 Angela.  H8!

           (A NOTE ON THE TEXTING.  It should appear on screen like
           SUBTITLES.  Like Ren's chinese.  But in a different color
           and font.  Not small and difficult to read on Olive's phone.)  

           As the "family" continues singing without her, Olive feels
           guilty for cursing Angela.  She shouldn't have "said" that.  

                                 OLIVE'S TEXT (CONT'D)
                        Hail Mary full of grace...

           And then we see who Olive's texting:  MALCOLM'S ICON.  He's
           dreamy.  A winning smile.  Frat boy haircut.  Older.  Well. 
           Not much.  18.  Still.  Illegal.  Thus hiding her phone.

                                 MALCOLM'S TEXT

                        yrs older than Angela.  How's that fair?  

           Olive looks up at Angela and her father.  Singing.

                        Not joking.  

           Olive's torn.  Malcolm?  Family?  God?  What's the right
           answer?  Olive isn't good at committing.  She needs some
           air.  Rolling down her window -- sticking her head outside
           the car -- like a dog...

           Olive sees the traffic.  Jammed.  In each direction.  So
           much so that people are driving up and over the shoulder. 
           Laws be damned.  She wonders:

                                 OLIVE
                        Where's everyone going?  

           Olive pulls her head back in.  As if they didn't hear her:

           Mr. Wingert sees the look on Olive's face.  Confusing it for
           fear:

           EXT. STREET - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           THE GLOWING NEON is a blurry mass of light in the POURING
           RAIN.  Like getting out of an over chlorinated swimming pool. 
           Halos everywhere.  

           (ANOTHER NOTE -- there is always a striking visual palate
           difference between Shanghai and Ann Arbor.  Shanghai is
           nighttime in the city and neon and steel and rain.  Ann Arbor
           is day in the suburbs and sun and lawns.)   

           WE FIND HORDES OF PEOPLE. 

           Sitting in the middle of the sidewalk.  Sobbing
           uncontrollably.  Men -- get DRUNK -- blasting away their
           minds.  And on the roof of a car -- a couple goes at it. 
           Hot and heavy and wet.  Amongst the crazy we find:

           REN.

           Umbrella shielding him from the rain.  SHOPPING BAG tucked
           firmly under his arm PROTECTING his EGGS from stray elbows. 
           Zigging.  Zagging.  Vigilant.  Compassionate at the sight of
           the crying masses.  He'd love to stop.  To help.  And yet he
           must continue on:   

           INT. HOSPITAL NICU - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           A ROW OF PREEMIES.  Incubated.  Wires running to their tiny
           chests taking vitals.  Some WAIL.  Some SLEEP.  Some bathe
           in the PURPLE glow of the BILIRUBIN LIGHTS.  WE FIND:

           WU "ANGEL" XIAN-BO.  20s.  A shock of punk sticking out from
           her prim nurse's uniform.  A tuft of dyed pink hair.  Blue
           glitter eye shadow.  She makes her rounds when: 

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT.  A familiar knock on the door.  Angel sees:

           REN.  Standing on TIPPY-TOES -- his little head and sunflowers
           barely visible in the observation window.  Waving -- 

           INT. HOSPITAL NICU - SHANGHAI - MOMENTS LATER

           Ren DUMPS A VASE OF DYING SUNFLOWERS in the trash.  Angel
           watches him work with stunned fascination:

           Ren's swollen with emotion.  The love of his family.  His
           son.  His wife.  It's unrefined joy packets.  Angel's jealous
           of Ren's abundance.  It comes across as attitude.

                        night with a hint of sunshine... I will.   

           Ren unwraps the cellophane containing the NEW FRESH
           SUNFLOWERS.  Angel's amazed by Ren's serenity.

                                 ANGEL

           And yes, but Ren operates as if nothing's different.  That
           confidence.  Acceptance.

                        It's a small fishing village.  The thrush

                        And when I return home, I'll take out
                        my grandfather's wok.  And wake them

           A SOLDIER MOWS DOWN A HORDE OF NAZIS WITH A RIFLE.  Blood
           and guts everywhere.  But we quickly can tell, this is a

           ZEBULON FARMAR.  ZEB.  In boxers.  Using his Wii remote like

           Zeb is short attention span personified.  Playing Wii. 
           Listening to ARCADE FIRE.  While glancing at -- AVATAR --
           streaming on his computer.

                        hours playing video games?

           That is what Zeb was planning.  Sad.  But, it's kind of all
           he wanted to do.

                                 OLIVE (ON THE PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Zeb?

                                 ZEB
                        Yeah?

                                 OLIVE (ON THE PHONE)
                        Put on clothes.  Meet me at church. 
                        Oh.  And bring my bike.

           INT. ZEB'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Fake wood panels.  It hasn't been updated since 1980-
           something.  Lower-lower end of the middle class.  Zeb pulls
           on a t-shirt as he enters.  

                                 ZEB 
                        I'm going out.

           Zeb sees his DAD.  Glassy eyes glued to the TV (remember
           what it felt like at 9/11 -- now multiply that times a
           billion.) On the news is a report of A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF
           PEOPLE STANDING ON THE 5 FWY IN CALIFORNIA -- we hear the
           familiar voice of SIR JOHN BAINBRIDGE --

                        For those who cannot see -- there is a
                        formidable mob converging on the gates
                        of Camp Pendelton Army Base --

                        If events should turn violent...? 

           There's a long silence.  Followed by wary trepidation:

                                 CORPORAL BRAND (ON TV)
                        I... I don't know... I'm 19 -- 

           Not much older than Zeb.  Not much older at all.

                                 SIR JOHN

                        I'm sorry, I, just I -- 

           The line goes dead.  A beat of silence.  We hear emotion
           bleeding into Bainbridge's voice.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        We have lost Corporal Brand.  A dutiful

                        Dad?

           Zeb's Dad doesn't acknowledge him.  An empty bottle of alcohol
           cradled in his arms.  Like a child.  Zeb hears his MOTHER --
           CRYING from behind a CLOSED BATHROOM DOOR.  Zeb tries the
           door.  It's locked.

           Zeb's Mom doesn't respond.  Just crying.  Where Olive's Dad
           is forcing family togetherness.  Zeb's folks couldn't be
           more selfish and self-absorbed. 

                                 ZEB (CONT'D)

           INT. CHURCH - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS GLOW.  Every pew is JAMMED with
           people.  Standing room only.  The congregation is shrouded
           in the reds, oranges and yellows of the stained glass.  

           Some FACES are caked with tears.  Others are cold.  All are
           SINGING A HYMN -- IN THE SWEET BY AND BY.  Praying for
           salvation and deliverance from this world into the next.

           Olive sits with her family.  Tyler.  Mr. Wingert.  And ugh,
           Angela.  Olive has a BEAUTIFUL VOICE.  Malcolm's not wrong. 
           Olive eyes wander seeing --

           A LONG LINE of people wait for the CONFESSIONAL.  

           ALL OF THE VOTIVES are lit in the apse -- with more people
           still lighting candles for loved ones passed -- putting them
           on the ground -- in window sills -- anywhere:  

           WITH MORE PEOPLE still filing in through the front doors --  

           Olive checks her phone.  10:53 AM.  It's time to go.  She
           excuses herself.  Standing.  Seeing.  Her little brother. 
           TYLER.  Legs dangling above the floor.

           If all goes according to plan, Olive is NEVER going to see
           Tyler again.  Olive gives him a HUG.

                                 TYLER
                        You're just going to the bathroom.

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        Tyler!

           CONTINUED:

           Tyler knows that strict look from his father.  Knows he did
           something wrong, even if he isn't sure what.  He hugs OLIVE.

                                 OLIVE
                        I love you...

                                 TYLER
                        Don't worry, Pastor Wallace says we'll
                        all be together in the rapture...

           Olive ENVIES Tyler's innocence.  So easily digesting the
           religion he's been fed.  Olive believes too.  But.  It's
           different.  She musses Tyler's hair.  Feeling better about
           leaving him behind.  And as she's about to exit... 

           Her Father takes her hand.  Olive flinches.  Oh crap!  Does
           he know?  Is she busted?  Her Father pulls her close, his
           hand around the back of her head, whispering into her ear --

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        I'm proud of you.  

           And Olive's heart stops.  Is it the right choice?  Leaving
           her family?  It is.  Right?

                                 OLIVE
                        I love you too, Daddy.  

           Mr. Wingert gives her a kiss on the cheek and sends her on
           her way.  Olive's heart begins beating again.  Free to go. 
           Free to get married.  

           EXT. CHURCH - ANN ARBOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Olive waits at the corner.  Anxious fingers fidgeting.  She
           doesn't want to be spotted by ANYONE who knows her father. 
           She doesn't want her rebellion to be crushed before it even
           begins.  She looks down the street.  

           Where the fuck is Zeb?

           And then.  As if God heard her prayer.  Zeb rounds the corner. 
           Riding his BMX.  Steering with one hand, guiding Olive's
           bike with the other.  

           As Zeb pulls up.  She sees the bike he brought for her. 
           PINK STREAMERS, A BANANA SEAT and a BASKET.  

                                 OLIVE

                        Your bike?

           Zeb smiles.  Rings the BELL.  Dddring.  This is the shit
           only true friends can sling at one another.  And it will
           have to do for Olive.  As Olive mounts her bike:   

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - ANN ARBOR - LATER

           Large, well manicured, perfect green lawns.  A ranch style
           development.  Single story sprawl.  Inside the LIVING ROOMS,
           you can see the BLUE GLOW of TELEVISION SCREENS.  Like Zeb's
           FOLKS -- addicted to the news.  Leaving the roads desolate. 
           Free for Olive and Zeb to ride down the middle of the street.      

           Zeb's a very talented rider.  Pulling jumps onto parked cars --  

           Riding over them.  Denting trunks and roofs and hoods. 
           Setting off alarms.  BWOOP.  BWOOP.  BWOOOP.

                                 ZEB
                        You really gonna marry him?

                        something borrowed, something blue --

           Zeb jumps his bike onto another car.  It's ALARM synching
           with the other cars.  A SYMPHONY OF CAR ALARMS

           Olive pedals harder.  Pulling away.  Calling out --

                        Well yeah --

           Zeb always makes Olive smile.  And then.  Not.

                        Today has to be the best day of our
                        lives.  To get what we want while we
                        can.  Nobody can tell us no...
                          (off Zeb's look)
                        I want my something old, new, borrowed,
                        blue.  I want my wedding --

           A silence... Zeb waiting for Olive expectantly:

                                 ZEB
                        To Malcolm?

           Olive snorts.  Course.  Goes without saying.  But they both
           know.  It went without saying.  Telling.  And.  As a true
           friend, Zeb doesn't pounce.  Changing the subject...

           airing.  THE BBC -- as we hear:

                        An orthodox sect of radical Lubovitch
                        Jew and Evangelical Christians are
                        storming the Temple Mount in Jerusalem
                        to decimate the Al-Aqsa Mosque --

           Bainbridge peers down through his black-framed bifocals. 
           Reading with impudence:

           The violence is disheartening to Bainbridge.  The sheer volume

                        I was reared Catholic.  Now journalist.

           But Bainbridge doesn't uncork the scotch.  Leaving the demons

           Bainbridge does so.  Shutting his eyes.

           Olive and Zeb ride their bikes down the street -- turning
           onto a DIRT ROAD.  The SUN shines through gaps in the trees,
           warming Olive's face.  She closes her eyes:

                        Please don't let it end.  There's too

           Ren stands alone under a DIGITAL SIGN READING (translated

           over to 1 MINUTE.  GLOWING RED.  The quiet is disquieting.

                        I prayed we could put aside past
                        indiscretions.  Granting clemency to
                        all who seek atonement -- and especially
                        those who don't.

           Bainbridge opens his eyes.  And sees the violence on the
           television screens.  The fire reflecting warmly against his
           face.  Offering no comfort.  No change.

                        But people embrace hate instead of one
                        another.  Perhaps God's ending us for a
                        reason.  Perhaps God thought me
                        disingenuous.  Perhaps it's my fault: 

           Then suddenly feeling the pangs of guilt.  Swallowing his

           Ren holds onto his GROCERY BAG, like a child holding a
           security blanket.  It makes him feel safe.  Assured.  He
           looks back up at the sign.  TRAIN NOW ARRIVING. 

           And yet -- there is no "train now arriving." 

                                 SIR JOHN
                        What are you going to do?  How will you
                        spend these precious hours?

           Ren's anxious.  Should he stay?  Should he go?  If he stays,
           he's wasting time.  If he goes, he'll miss the train.  Stay? 
           Go?  Stay?  Go?  He has to make a choice.  Commit.  And so --
           And so -- and so -- 

           Ren takes out his phone.  Looks at a PHOTO OF HIS FAMILY. 
           His wife.  His son.  Smiling.  A day at the circus.  They're
           all wearing RED CLOWN NOSES.  AND THEN:       

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        What do you hold dear when our sky is
                        consumed in fire?  And whom?  What's
                        important to you in the end?  

           A SMALL RUSH OF AIR.  Curling the hair in his ears.  The
           slightest hint, but enough to make Ren smile.  As THE SUBWAY
           TRAIN ROARS INTO THE STATION.

           The dust settles like a curtain, revealing -- A FLOWER FARM.  

           A field of RED PEONIES.  PURPLE LILAC.  BLUE DAFFODILS. 
           YELLOW SUNFLOWERS -- towering over their head -- so many you
           could get lost in the stalks forever.  On and on and on. 
           Endless rainbow growing out of the soil.  It's SURREAL.

           Olive and Zeb ABANDON their bikes.  Running off.  Disappearing
           in a FIELD OF OVERWHELMING COLOR.  Pure.  Drunk.  Vibrant.

                        vices that plague our desires.  

           He pours himself a drink.  Brimming the glass.

                        I promised I would not leave you... I

                        So together we won't feel so alone.

           Securing his shopping bag with the other.  Even though:    

           The train is EMPTY.  Save for one DUDE.  100 pounds
           overweight.  Writing on the windows in MAGIC MARKER.  "Not
           with a bang, but a whimper."  The same Eliot poem Bainbridge
           quoted.  Over and over.  Like BART SIMPSON.  

           Bart eyes Ren.  Uneasy:

                        Have a seat, dude.  

           Ren realizes he's standing.  Feeling self-conscious. 
           Apologetic.  Feeling the need to justify his actions:

                                 REN
                        It's normally crowded.  Even at this
                        hour.  Someone always needs a seat.

           Bart rolls his eyes.  Whatever.  Ren realizes it is --
           awkward.  So.  He sits.  Turning back to Bart:

                        Isn't there someone you'd rather be
                        with?  A parent?  A brother?  A childhood
                        friend?  From grade school?        

           Bart thinks.  His face softening.  A memory.  But then.

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        Nope.

           Ren stands.  Not comfortable sitting.  Not comfortable with
           Bart.  Not at all.  

                                 REN
                        Guess I'm used to standing.

           EXT. FLOWER FARM - ANN ARBOR - LATER

           As Olive and Zeb finish up collecting flowers... Olive stops. 
           Looking around.  Taking it all in.    

                                 OLIVE
                        My mom came here all the time...  

           Zeb can see the pain in Olive's heart.  Expressed in her
           white knuckles clenching the flowers.  

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        She would've loved to see me get married.

           Olive plucks a blood red daisy.  Struck.  Silent.  Holding
           her bouquet.  A bride in progress.    

                                 ZEB
                        We have time to visit if you wanna. 
                        Glenn Memorial's not far off.

           Olive sighs.  That name.  Glenn Memorial.  Like death creeping
           up her spine, putting his icy hands around her neck.  And as
           the thoughts of her MOTHER weigh heavily on Olive.

           GRAVITY SHIFTS.  

           JUST LIKE THEY SAID IT WOULD.  HEAVY.  PRESSING DOWN. 
           PAINFUL.  Olive's KNEES buckle.  Sending her to the ground.     

                                 OLIVE
                        What's going on...?

           Olive looks up and sees --

           ALL THE FLOWERS.  COLLAPSING.  The GRAVITY -- flattening
           them out -- like KEEPSAKES in an ALBUM.  SMASHED.
           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           A GLOBAL EVENT.  Ren and Bart feel the strain of GRAVITY. 
           Pushing down on the SPEEDING SUBWAY.  The LIGHTS FLICKER --
           THEN CUT OUT -- BLACK -- AS THE TRAIN SKREECHES -- GRINDING
           TO A HALT -- collapsing --  

           Ren's KNOCKED OFF his feet.  

           Thrown through the air.  He holds onto his SHOPPING BAG. 
           HIS EGGS!  As he hurtles toward the front of the car --
           SMASHING into a WINDOW.  

           Landing with a THUD!

           INT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - INTERCUT

           Sir John stares at his GLASS OF SCOTCH.  THE LIQUID begins
           to CRAWL UP the inside of the glass as the force of GRAVITY
           pushes down.  Bainbridge watches curiously as the scotch
           begins pouring out over his desk and then --

           SMASH.

           THE GLASS SHATTERS under the pressure.   

           Bainbridge goes to the window and sees -- 

           THE THAMES RIVER.

           Doing the same thing as his liquor.  Overflowing out onto
           the street.  A FLOOD.  BIBLICAL.

           EXT. FLOWER FARM - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           Olive TRIES to hold onto her Bouquet.  Clinging them to her
           chest.  Cradling them.  But she feels the gravity RIPPING
           the flimsy stems out of her sweaty palms.   

                                 OLIVE
                        Zeb! 

           Olive can't hang on.  The red peonies yanked from her hand. 
           Falling from her fingertips.  Sent to the ground.  Where
           they are immediately --

           FLATTENED.  CRUSHED.  DESTROYED.  

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           SPARKS fly off the tracks.  Metal scraping on metal.  Making
           the entire subway car glow brighter than the night sky on
           the 4th of July.  As the train slows...

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           TO A STOP.  It's OVER.  GRAVITY RETURNS TO NORMAL 

           Only the green glow of the exit signs.  Ren makes sure he's
           okay.  Bruised.  Sure.  But okay.  But the grocery bag --
           dammit -- THE GROCERIES -- THE EGGS... 

           Ren digs into the bag -- frantically removing the egg carton. 
           Heart sinking.  He opens the carton -- 

           And smiles.  Nothing's BROKEN.  MIRACULOUS.  They're fine. 
           Which is more than Ren can say for himself.  Bruised.  What
           the hell just happened here?  He calls out --

                                 REN
                        You okay?  Hello?

           From the darkness he can hear Bart:

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        Should've taken a seat, dude.

           EXT. FLOWER FARM - ANN ARBOR - RESUME

           Olive gets to her feet.  Gravity restored.  Surveying the
           damage.  The entire field destroyed.  Petals torn.  Decimated. 
           The reality of the world ending finally sinking in.

                                 OLIVE
                        This is really happening. 

           There's no answer.  Olive frantically looks around for --

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Zeb?

           Finding him curled up.  Knees and face in the dirt.  Why
           isn't he getting up?

           Olive runs over.  Closing the distance between them.  Fast. 
           Her legs kicking up petals and pollen in her wake -- 

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Zeb!

           Zeb stirs, opening his body to reveal:  

           He's holding 5 perfectly preserved SUNFLOWERS.  Zeb used his
           body to try and protect them.  Save them.  For Olive.  

                                 ZEB
                        Your favorite.  Yeah?  
                          (off her look)
                        Is this enough?

           CONTINUED:

           Zeb holds out Olive's BOUQUET.  She takes them, thanking Zeb
           with a smile.  For his friendship.  

                                 ZEB (CONT'D)
                        You okay?  

           It's an intimate moment.  A man handing flowers to a woman. 
           Tinged with romance.  An uninvited flirtation.  And then:

           BUZZ BUZZ.  Olive's phone.  A text.  From Malcolm.

                                 MALCOLM'S TEXT
                        U OK?  

           Olive looks at Malcolm's ICON.  At ZEB.  Feeling the triangle. 
           Feeling the pressure.  Even though the GRAVITY has returned
           to normal.  She checks her the clock.  12:12 PM. 

           Texting and talking at the same time.

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           A HISS OF PRESSURIZED AIR RELEASES, like a long sigh after a
           torturous day -- the SUBWAY DOORS OPEN revealing:  Ren holding
           a wrench -- he's a very good CONTINUANCE ENGINEER:

           Ren and Bart step out into the darkness of the tunnel.  The
           Subway headlights are the only lights shining in the dark
           tunnel -- making long shadows. 

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        Yo.  What do you think stopped the train?

           Ren shrugs.  Not wanting to engage.  He likes most people. 
           He doesn't like Bart --  

                                 BART SIMPSON (CONT'D)
                        You think it's gonna work again?

           Ren shrugs.  Starts walking.  Bart follows him:

                                 BART SIMPSON (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 REN
                        Home.

           Ren nods -- yeah...

                        And if the train starts running...?

                                 REN
                        Then I'll move out of the way.

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        Pretty narrow here and you're...

                                 REN
                        What?

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        We could both stand to lose a few pounds. 
                        Me more than you.  But still.

                                 REN
                        I'll be careful.

           Bart follows Ren.  Like a dog.  Not wanting to be left alone.  

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        You could get lost.  I heard that
                        happened.  Homeless people got lost --
                        so they started eating each other.
                          (and then a light bulb)
                        Maybe they stopped the train!  Cannibals. 

           Ren picks up his pace.     

                                 BART SIMPSON (CONT'D)
                        You don't like me much.

                                 REN
                        I don't know you.  

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        It's okay.  The truth is...  Before
                        when you asked...  I called my friends
                        when the news came in.  No one answered. 

           Ren turns a sympathetic nod.  Touched.  But then --

                        And when I say "friends" -- I mean the
                        chicks I have internet sex with.  And
                        when I say sex -- I mean play video
                        games.

                        of them are dudes.    

           Ren rolls his eyes.  Should always go with his gut.  And
           then -- they see A SHADOW QUICKLY CROSS THE PATH AHEAD.   

                                 BART SIMPSON (CONT'D)

                        What?

           A COUPLE MORE SHADOWS CROSS THE TUNNEL.

                                 REN (CONT'D)
                        It's a shadow.  It's nothing.

           And then -- there's A CLANG!  Loud.  Echoing.

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        Cannibals.

           Ren soldiers on -- into the darkness.

                        You're gonna be breakfast man.

           Ren moves on ahead.  Cautiously now.  Step by step by step --
           into the darkness.  Bart just a step behind him.  Cowering. 
           Holding onto Ren's jacket.  Like a scared little child.    

           CLANG!

           Bart tightens his grip on Ren.  Ren pulls out the WRENCH
           from his tool belt.  Ready to defend himself (and Bart).    

           CLANG!

           The sounds getting louder now.  They're getting closer now. 
           Much much closer.  It's just around the corner.  They edge
           the wall.  Making their way around the bend.  A warm red
           glow illuminating their faces as they discover:

           NERDS!  Starched suits.  Glasses.  Computer programmers. 
           Office drones.  Holding LANTERNS -- trying to access a SERVICE

           and big glasses, greets our traveling companions.

           Ren eyes the situation.  He should go home.  He should stop
           wasting time.  But that's not Ren.  The second he sees someone
           in need, it's always the same thing:

           Bainbridge sits with his earphones on.  Manning the console. 
           Renewed with a spirit of his youth.  Pushing a lit button. 
           Though he, himself -- is not lit.  The GLASS of Scotch remains
           untouched.  As if waiting for an invitation.

                        Such a charmer. 

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Now I usually date younger women.  

                                 ANNE
                        I'm 83, John-dear.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        You're just playing hard to get.  

                                 ANNE
                        You come up here.  I have a nice pot of
                        tea on.  Key's under the sunflower pot.

           Bainbridge smiles.  Enjoying the flirtatious exchange.  The
           levity he was seeking delivered in an Old Welsh Woman.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        And what are you doing today, Anne-dear?

                                 ANNE
                        Well, I went to yoga and then to market. 
                        Got tea and milk.  And some lemons for
                        my famous linzer tarts.  Margaret Addison
                        insists that a linzer is made with
                        raspberry, but I prefer lemon.     

                                 SIR JOHN
                        No diet for you then today?

                                 ANNE
                        Oh, it's not for today no -- it's for
                        Imelda's great-grandson's christening
                        at St. Andrews this sabbath --

           On sunday?  Bainbridge isn't sure if Anne has alzheimer's or
           if she's just blissfully unaware.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        You have been listening to the broadcast?

                                 ANNE
                        Oh, I never miss you.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        There won't be anymore sundays.  

                                 ANNE
                        Didn't you say the same thing about
                        Y2K?  Satellites falling from heaven?

           And we all know how that turned out.  

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Or the weatherman telling me to bundle
                        up in my rubbers, when it's lovely out -- 

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Did you not feel the gravity?  There's
                        not quite 3 hours left.

           Anne hesitates.  We hear her sipping her tea.  

                                 ANNE
                        When that volcano erupted in Iceland
                        you said airplanes might'n fly for years. 
                        Might'n you be wrong now? 

           And in a lot of ways -- he never considered.  Mainly because:

                                 SIR JOHN
                        It's not mine to say.

                                 ANNE
                        If I've learned one thing in 83 years,
                        it's that I know nothing.  The only
                        thing I can do is my yoga.  And pray. 
                        I'm praying for you, John-dear.  You
                        sound so sad...  Talking to no one.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I'm talking to you, Anne-dear.

                                 ANNE
                        You don't know me.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Anne Keenan.  83.  Aberystwyth, Wales.

                                 ANNE
                        Hardly intimate, are we?  You work too
                        much.

           And little, old Anne Keenan in Abersytwyth Wales puts her
           finger right on it.  Working.  Even in the last hours.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Is there no one you'd rather be with?

           Bainbridge immediately thinks on Prudence.  And others --

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Or perhaps.  I ne'er considered -- Is
                        there none wanted to be with you?  

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:  (3)

           He didn't consider that himself.  

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        You sound like a kind man.

           Her pity stings Bainbridge.  Kind?  Maybe not.  Maybe that's
           all a part of being the voice.  A lie.    

                                 SIR JOHN
                        You don't know me.

                                 ANNE
                        Oh, I never miss you.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I'm doing what I've always done.  Just
                        like you and that lemon tart. 

                                 ANNE
                        And that's the problem, isn't it?  Doing
                        what you've always done?  Isn't it?

           And as the question lingers.  

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        How about a song then?  Some Badfinger. 
                        For this old Welsh lemon --  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Badfinger it is, Dear Anne.

           The scotch is nearly GONE.  Bainbridge was drinking this
           entire conversation.  So talented a drunk, we hardly noticed
           him taking sips.  A true sot.

           EXT. THE MALL - PARKING LOT - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           Olive and Zeb ride their bikes through the empty lot, weaving
           in and out of PARKING STONES -- jumping the curb -- stopping
           short of the front doors to JCPenny.  Only to discover:    

           THE DOORS ARE LOCKED.  Dammit!    

           Olive tries again.  Shaking the doors.  Like that could work. 
           If the doors just knew how much she wanted to get in --  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Can't get in that way.

           Weighing it down.  Giving it heft.  Rolling down a STEEP
           PARKING RAMP.  As we adjust to find --  

           OLIVE.  PILOTING the shopping cart nee BATTERING RAM on a
           DIRECT COURSE for the GLASS DOORS of the Mall.  Kicking
           against the ground like a kid on a SCOOTER.

           ZEB, KAT, and the DAVES -- cheer Olive on. 

           And just as the CART is about to mount the curb.  Olive
           abandons ship.  Trying not to turn her pretty face into a
           pizza.  Running to a stop.  Looking to see:

           The Cart.  SMASHING into the DOORS.  THE DOORS BUCKLE.  THE
           GLASS CRACKS.  Spidering, but not breaking.  A DENT!  They
           can crack this thing.  They can get inside.  Olive presents
           the doors like a PRICE IS RIGHT MODEL -- TAH!  DAH!

           EXT. THE MALL - PARKING LOT - ANN ARBOR - MONTAGE

           Zeb RIDES the Shopping Cart/Battering Ram with PANACHE. 
           Born skateboarder/BMX/daredevil -- Zeb handles the cart with
           ease.  Ducking into a curl.  Faster than Olive.   

           Hanging on until the very last possible moment -- jumping
           off -- x-games style -- caroming off a trash can.  Seeing:  

           Another CRACK.  Zeb raises his arms in a V!  
           EXT. THE MALL - PARKING LOT - ANN ARBOR - MONTAGE

           Little Dave's turn on the cart.  Determined to be the one to
           break through --     

           Except, he TRIPS on his SHOELACE.  Tumbling to the ground. 
           SCRAPING his knees on the asphalt.  A disgusting mess of
           road rash.  Blood speckled pebbles stuck in his flesh.  The
           Shopping Cart slows to a stop shy of the door.  Fail.

           EXT. THE MALL - PARKING LOT - ANN ARBOR - MONTAGE

           A RACE!  Zeb versus Little Dave versus Big Dave.  It's barely
           a competition.  Zeb kicking their ass.  As they race down
           the ramp we favor --

           KAT.  Watches Zeb intently.  She's WAY into him.  Trying to
           give him little hints of her interest.  A look.  A smile. 
           Cheering Zeb onto victory.  

           EXT. THE MALL - PARKING LOT - ANN ARBOR - MONTAGE

           Olive versus Kat.  Olive takes an early lead, but Kat's more
           athletic and overtakes Olive -- Kat gives a push -- heaving
           her Cart into the Mall Doors.  The clear winner.  But -- 

           Zeb can't take his eyes off Olive.  WAY into her.  Much to
           Kat's dismay.  Olive notes the odd triangle developing.

           EXT. THE MALL - PARKING LOT - ANN ARBOR - MONTAGE

           BIG DAVE rides solo.  THE BEHEMOTH.  His weight threatening
           to topple the massive parking stones.  But man -- Big Dave
           is fast as hell.  Careening toward the Mall Doors.  The
           battering ram like a ROCKET -- flying up the curb --

           CRASHING INTO THE GLASS DOORS --

           SHATTERING --

           Glass CRUMBLING to the ground!  THE DOOR OPENING!  MATCH TO:  

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           REN OPENS THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR -- 

           Revealing a set of stairs going down.  BILL GATES helps the
           NERDS rush down.  Not wasting a moment.  Not even to say
           thank you.  Assholes.  BART stares down the stairs --   

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        You really think this'll work?

                        In America they're fleeing into bomb
                        shelters.      

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        Because Americans have never been wrong?

           Gates shrugs whatever.  Bart shrugs back.  Guess this'll do. 
           As Bart and Gates head down -- Ren picks up his shopping bag --
           heading in the opposite direction.  Gates is stunned:  

                                 BILL GATES
                        Aren't you coming?

                        Bring them along.

           Ren checks his watch.  1:44 AM.  Seconds peeling: 

                                 REN
                        There's not enough time. 

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        Come on man.  Don't be an idiot --     

                                 REN
                        And if you survive -- and then what...? 

                                 BILL GATES
                        We rebuild.

                                 REN
                        Because everything -- everything and
                        everyone is gone.

                                 BILL GATES
                        Yes.  We start over.  

           Ren shivers at the thought of it. 

                                 REN
                        I can't be without my family.  Without

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        That's suicide, dude.

                                 REN

           And as Ren's about to leave -- Bart snags his SHOPPING BAG. 
           Trying to wrestle it off his arm.  Tug of war.

                                 REN (CONT'D)
                        What're you doing?

                        We'll need food. 

                                 BILL GATES
                        We have food.

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        You saying we can't use more?

                                 REN
                        Please stop -- I need these eggs.

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        They're just eggs.

                        They're for my son.  49 millimeters
                        exactly.  For my son...

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        You can get more.  We can't.    

           Bart pulls -- the bag begins to rip -- threatening to break. 
           Ren grows more paranoid -- looks at Gates for help.  

                                 REN
                        Share.  I only need three.

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        No.

                                 REN
                        The rest is yours. 

                                 BART SIMPSON
                        No!

           Bart gives one last tug -- ripping the bag -- sending all
           the eggs and fish and food tumbling to the ground.  

           THE EGGS CRACK!  Break.  Spilling yolk and white all over
           the cold and filthy ground.  Ruined.  

                                 BILL GATES
                        We must leave now --

           Bart scrambles -- picking up what he can.  Before heading
           down the stairs with Gates.  Leaving Ren alone.  

           Staring at the wreckage of cracked egg shells and yolk.

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE MALL - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           ON A BANK OF MONITORS WE SEE -- Olive, Zeb, Big Dave, Little
           Dave and Kat -- riding their bikes throughout the empty mall. 
           From screen to screen to screen to screen.     

           We notice -- 

           BIG DAVE pull a FIRE EXTINGUISHER from the wall (next to a
           portable defibrillator.)  Then disappearing from the screen: 

           It's a moment before we hear -- CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

           The DOORKNOB breaks.  The DOOR swings open.  Big Dave enters
           and grabs KEYS to the proverbial kingdom, he notices -- 

           The MUZAK SYSTEM.  There's an AUX input.  Big Dave jacks his
           phone into the muzak system.  Scrolling through his song
           selection until he finds: THE BEASTIE BOYS, "Gratitude" --
           Music Blasts.  Big Dave checks the MONITORS -- his friends
           applauding his choice.  The Beastie Boys plays over:

           INT. ESCALATORS - THE MALL - MONTAGE

           LITTLE DAVE does RAIL SLIDE down the ESCALATOR.  About to
           dismount when -- 

           Kat BLASTS him with a FOUNTAIN OF FOAM from the FIRE
           EXTINGUISHER.  Sending Little Dave falling --diving head
           first into the planters.  Kat and Big Dave bust a gut.  Little
           Dave pops back up.  Spring in his step.  Psyched.  That was
           awesome.  Ready to go again. 

           INT. FOREVER 21 - THE MALL - MONTAGE

           ON A ROW OF MANNEQUINS.  Typical mall window display. 
           Standing sentinel silence when -- AN ARROW -- pierces a
           mannequin in the HEART (if it had a heart.)  

           ANOTHER ARROW -- nails a mannequin right in the HEAD. 
           Decapitating the dummy.  WHIP PAN across the mall to find -- 

           Little Dave, Big Dave and Kat -- armed with CROSSBOWS procured
           from the SPORTING GOODS STORE.  Using the mannequins for
           TARGET PRACTICE.  As KAT takes her shot --  
           INT. FOOD COURT - THE MALL - ANN ARBOR - MONTAGE

           Little Dave tries putting various foodstuffs into a DEEP
           FRYER -- partially to see how they'll taste -- partially
           just to watch them boil -- Snickers bars.  A Hamburger.  A
           Wetzel's Pretzel.  A Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Pinkberry...

           Meanwhile, at PERRY'S PIZZA -- BIG DAVE pulls a FRESH PIPING
           HOT PIZZA out of the oven.  Big Dave looks over at Kat... 
           Giving her a smile.  She's immediately reminded of his "nip"
           comment.  Shaking her head -- no way never never never --     

           INT. BRIDAL STORE - THE MALL - ANN ARBOR - MONTAGE

           Zeb waits for Olive.  Checking his watch.  Time's ticking
           away now.  Why must the ladies take so long to get dressed? 
           Zeb hears the echoes of the Dave's laughing, while he's stuck
           with fringe and lace and tulle.  He feels like a tool.  

           Kat walks past Zeb -- eating THREE SLICES OF PIZZA at once. 
           Two slices of pepperoni with a slice of pineapple in between. 
           Pizz-wich.  Kat smiles at Zeb through a chew.  Marinara
           dripping down her chin...  

                                 ZEB
                        You've got --

           Zeb wipes his chin.  Indicating where Kat should wipe.  She
           does.  Awkwardly.  Seductive.  And not.      

                                 KAT
                        Want some?

           Kat's not a great flirt.  Worried she's come on too strong...    

                                 ZEB
                        I'm good.  

           Kat shuffles off.  Definitely too strong.  Zeb calls back:

                                 ZEB (CONT'D)
                        You almost done?

                                 OLIVE (O.S.)
                        Gimme a hand.  

           Zeb looks at the DRESSING ROOM DOOR.  Olive's NAKED ANKLES
           visible underneath.  Zeb hesitates.  It's FORBIDDEN to enter
           a girl's dressing room.  That's the rule.  The Door protecting
           Nakedness.  Like a BOUNCER standing outside a VELVET ROPE. 
           Zeb nervously pushes the door open.  Trying not to stare at:

           CONTINUED:

           OLIVE.  In her BRA.  The WEDDING DRESS gathered around her
           waist.  All sorts of skin exposed.  Olive is unashamed. 
           It's just Zeb.  Zeb tries not to stare.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Zip me up?

           Zeb can't help but stare at Olive's NECK.  How the muscles
           and flesh cascade into her shoulder.  The thin blonde hair
           standing on end in the cold.  Olive looks over her shoulder
           at Zeb.  What's taking so long?  

           Zeb snaps out of his reverie.  Mans up.  ZIPS up.

                                 ZEB
                        This is something borrowed?

                                 OLIVE
                        It's a Vera Wang knock off.  I can't
                        afford this.  If I took it, it'd be
                        stealing. 

                                 ZEB
                        Thou shall not steal, but breaking into
                        the mall is kosher?

                                 OLIVE
                        I'll pay for the door.

                        I'm religious when it's always. 
                        Spiritual.

                                 ZEB
                        Who told you that?  Malcolm?

                        They could be wrong.  Scientists.  People
                        are wrong all the time.  God isn't. 

                                 ZEB
                        You don't find that the least bit
                        hypocritical?  

                                 OLIVE
                        No I do.  All these people praying. 
                        Jews and Hindus and Muslims and who's
                        to say what's right?  It's just now I --

           Zeb has trouble with the zipper.  He needs some leverage. 
           He HOLDS Olive's shoulder.  His skin touching hers.  He never
           imagined it would feel so -- SOFT.  Zeb tries not to linger.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Everyone going around like maniacs --
                        ourselves included -- no law or morals
                        and what if it doesn't end?  Gonna be a
                        lot of apologies tomorrow.  So borrowed. 
                        Not stolen.  In case.  In both cases.    

           Zeb finally reaches the top.  Fastens the hook. 

                                 ZEB
                        You're in.  Let's take a look.

           And as Olive's about to pose for Zeb --

           GRAVITY SHIFTS.  LIGHTER.  LIKE ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE.  

           The SKIRT of Olive's WEDDING DRESS begins to FLOAT UP.  Like
           Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch.  And just like before --
           THIS IS A GLOBAL EVENT --

           INT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - DAY

           Sir John stares at his MICROPHONE as it floats up, eclipsing
           his face.  He grabs the microphone and looks up at the news
           feeds.  The same gravity event occurring around the globe: 

           MOSCOW.  The VIGIL CANDLES float up, magical, like lanterns. 
           BERLIN.  Chunks of the Berlin Wall rise up into the air. 
           PARIS.  Children cling to parents on the Eiffel Tower, as
           they're being sucked into the sky.

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           Ren stares at his broken eggs.  The EGG SHELLS begin to FLOAT
           UP -- out of the yolk.  Twisting and turning.   

           Ren rises to his feet.  Staring at the omen.  Knowing that
           this is a sign that the end is coming soon.  He takes off
           running down the tunnel.  Not wanting to waste a moment. 
           Having trouble moving -- like said astronauts --

           INT. BRIDAL STORE - THE MALL - ANN ARBOR - RESUME

           Olive tries to keep the skirt from flying up.  Trying not to
           expose her PANTIES, STOCKINGS and GARTER -- EXACTLY LIKE the
           ones Olive saw the woman in the forest wearing.  ADULT and
           SEXY.  But right now --    

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She's attempting to keep some form of modesty in front of
           Zeb.  Pushing the skirt down.  Only to have it float up
           elsewhere.  Olive can't help but --

           LAUGH.  Cracking up.  Turning red.  It's futile.  Zeb laughs. 
           Catching glimpses of what Olive's trying to hide.  And then:   

           GRAVITY RESUMES.  Everything returning to normal.  

                                 ZEB
                        Since when do you put on a garter?

                                 OLIVE
                        Since shut the hell up.

           And Zeb can tell, he's dangerously close to pushing Olive's
           buttons.  Again.  Olive standing in her wedding dress --
           being vulnerable -- and radiant -- so very radiant...

                                 ZEB
                        Malcolm's lucky. 

           And now it's Olive's turn to blush.  As she realizes -- things
           are becoming too... intimate.  Earnest.  Olive needs to
           deflect.  Because she loves Malcolm.  Yes.  Right.  So --

                                 OLIVE
                        I think Kat's super into you.  She'd
                        give it up, if you were into that.

                                 ZEB
                        Yeah maybe.  She's kinda thick.

                                 OLIVE
                        Like you're some catch.

                                 ZEB
                        Meghan Frye said I have a strong tongue.

                                 OLIVE
                        Not a compliment.

                                 ZEB
                        Pretty sure it was. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Meghan Frye said kissing you was like
                        thumb wrestling her autistic cousin.

           That stings.  Then covering.

                        Kat's not my type.  She's got a roll of
                        fat on her neck.  It looks like when
                        Scooby Doo swallows a sandwich.

           And as they laugh -- 

                                 KAT (O.S.)
                        Hey...

           They turn to see Kat.  Returned with BIG DAVE and LITTLE
           DAVE.  They have a shopping cart filled with ALCOHOL.  Awkward
           doesn't quite cover it.  They wonder just how much she heard --

                                 LITTLE DAVE
                        Big problem.  How're we going to get
                        all of this to the pond?  

           Olive checks the clock: 1:27 PM. 

                                 OLIVE
                        I've gotta go.  I've gotta --

                                 ZEB
                        I have an idea.  And --
                          (off Olive)
                        My wedding present.  Something blue...

           Off Zeb's enigmatic smile and Olive's curiosity -- 

           EXT. STREET - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           RAIN PISSES DOWN -- PELTING AGAINST THE CARS PACKING THE
           STREET.  Bumper to bumper to bumper.  People still desperate
           to get somewhere.  Anywhere.  We find:

           REN. 

           Trying to cross the street.  But he can't between the damned
           cars.  No one will let him through.  Not one to be daunted. 
           Ren climbs up onto the HOOD of a car.  Leaping from car to
           car to car.  Making his way across the street.  He finds --   

           AN ABANDONED CAR.  Right in the middle of the traffic.  Motor
           still running.    

           Ren hustles inside.  Shelter from the storm.  A way home. 
           THE RADIO IS ALREADY ON:  

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO)
                        Perhaps I have worked too much.  Perhaps
                        there is no one I'd rather be with. 
                        Perhaps no one would rather be with me.  
           INT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - DAY

           START ON: A PULITZER PRIZE.  In the dull, golden metal we
           can barely make out Bainbridge's twisted reflection amongst
           the trophies.  The peabody.  The emmy.  The Bafta.  Honorary
           doctorates from Oxford and Harvard.

           Alone.  Still alone.  Staring at the awards:

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Maybe our Dear-Anne was correct?  My
                        life's ambition to keep company with
                        silent men sculpted in gold.
                          (raising his glass)
                        Mr. Pulitzer.  Mr. Peabody.  Mr. Murrow.

           Then takes a drink.  

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        No one believes themselves a villain. 
                        As vile.  Base.  We craft stories, lies --
                        so we forgive ourselves our sins.

           Bainbridge takes hold of his 1st Peabody.  Not as shiny as
           the others.  Rusting.  Specific orders not to give it shine.

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        One name shames me.  Etched beside mine. 
                        Drew Blackwell.  We dreamed of being
                        Woodward and Bernstein before we knew
                        Woodward or Bernstein existed.

           He puts the Peabody back -- 

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I lie.  I say Drew was his own man. 
                        Drew made his own bed.  But the truth
                        is the blood on his sheets are from the
                        knife I put in his back --

           Swallowing the remainder of his drink like water.  A
           professional drunk.

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I must be a villain -- which explains
                        why no one has come...  

           And then.  A long moment of silence.  As the weight of
           Bainbridge's words drags down the corners of his mouth into
           an epic scowl.  Dead.  Uncomfortable.  Air.  The bane of a
           newsman's broadcast.  Bainbridge revels in it.  Until --    

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The phone lines dash the silence.  Lights flashing.  Many
           people wanting to chime in.  Bainbridge chooses one --

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You're on Voice of the World --

                                 REN (ON THE RADIO)
                        Someone will come. 

           Ren's English is choppy, but far from offensive.  China is
           the largest English speaking country in the world.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        What's your name, Friend?

           INT. CAR - SHANGHAI - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           Ren calms his nerves by talking with Bainbridge.  The
           windshield wipers intermittently swipe away the rain with a
           hideous RUBBER SQUEAL to reveal:  

           A HUGE TRAFFIC JAM.  Red lights everywhere.  Practically
           turning night into day.

                                 REN
                        Ren.  From Shanghai.

                        Your Mandarin -- very good.

                                 REN

                        Finest crab in the world.  

           Ren recalls Oscar -- the man who committed suicide -- sadly:

                                 REN
                        Yes -- yes...

                                 SIR JOHN
                        How is Shanghai?

                                 SIR JOHN
                        When is that not the case, yes?

           The wiper squeaks.  Red traffic lights shine on Ren.  

                                 REN
                        It takes time.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Where are you heading?

                                 REN
                        To cook breakfast for my wife and son.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Are you going to make it?

                                 REN
                        I must try.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        But realistically.  Don't lie.  What if
                        you don't?  What will you do?  

           And even the rubber squeal of the wiper SHRIEKS can't hide
           the genuine concern in Bainbridge's voice.

                                 REN
                        You're not a bad person...

           Bainbridge swallows a scowl.  Dark thoughts percolating --

                                 SIR JOHN
                        You have no idea.

                                 REN
                        Because of stabbing your friend.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        That was a metaphor.

                        I convinced Drew to take an assignment

                        Not balmy.  Politically.  Reporters
                        forge their name dodging bullets.

                                 REN
                        You helped him.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I usurped him.  

                                 REN
                        Maybe, not so good English.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Drew was heir to the coveted weekend
                        desk.  But who knew when Reginald 
                        Rutlidge would cede.  Blighter held the
                        fort since double-u-double-u-two.  And
                        then Drew got Jakarta...   

           Bainbridge pours himself another drink.

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        The remedy for hesitation is bitters. 
                        I can still taste the pint.  Effingham
                        Pub.  Think it's a Starbucks now --

           Draining the bottle... 

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        So I ply our Drew with drink.  Playing
                        the role of schoolyard bully.  Taunting
                        masculinity.  If he didn't want the
                        plumb assignation, I'd take it.  A boot
                        to the rear would've been more subtle. 

           Looking back at the awards --

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        He left.  I inherited this empty empire.  

           He raises his glass in a toast to the peabody and awards.

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        People are vile. 

           As Bainbridge takes a drink.  In Shanghai, the wiper clears
           the rain.  Ren's STUCK in traffic.  Longing:

                        A drunk.  An adulterer.  I have destroyed

                        desk.  Drew.  My own brother...  And...

           He spies a photo of PRUDENCE -- in the control booth.  He
           doesn't evoke her name.  Not wanting to say it aloud.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Trying to convince me or yourself?

           Ren smiles.  Bainbridge is right.  Ren abandons the car. 
           Following his own advice.  Going out on foot.  Into the
           pissing rain.  Trying to find another way home.  WE RESUME: 

           WITH BAINBRIDGE.  Seeking safety in his tropes. 

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        It's 17:35 Greenwich Mean Time.  2 and
                        half hours until zero hour.  News next --

           EXT. ALLEY - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           Ren HUSTLES down the back alleys.  Trying to avoid the crowds
           of the main streets.  Trying to make his way to a market
           when he finds:   

           A SEVERED HAND.  Cut off at the wrist.  Bone and sinew and
           muscle exposed.  Ren cringes.  But it's about to get worse
           as Ren finds --

           A FOOT.  Well...  

           A SHOE with the FOOT still inside.  And the path of carnage
           continues the further he walks down the street -- ARMS. 
           LEGS.  FINGERS.  Spattered blood on the sidewalk like some
           sort of fucked up Jackson Pollack homage.  WE BEGIN TO HEAR: 

           And then -- as Ren nears the end of the road -- he sees:  

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A ROW OF HEADS.  Like the Hollywood walk of fame.  But you
           know.  With severed heads.  Ren's astonished.  Frozen.  What
           in the shit happened...?  And just as Ren realizes he took
           the wrong fucking street -- 

           HE HEARS A MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REV -- splitting silence --
           feels like a chainsaw ripping through your heart.

           Ren looks down the street to find:  THE RIDER.  DARK HELMET
           OBSCURING HIS FACE.  Gripping his throttle with one hand. 
           And in the other -- A SHINING SWORD.  

           The Motorcycle takes off down the street -- heading right
           toward Ren.  What the hell should he do?  Run?  Fight?  He
           doesn't even know what's going on...?  Lost.  Scared.  

           The Rider pulls to a stop -- inches from Ren.  Removing his
           helmet.  He's JAPANESE.  Debonair.  Wearing a tuxedo.  He
           looks like JAMES BOND.  

                                 JAMES BOND
                        What's your name?

                                 REN
                        Ren. 

                                 JAMES BOND
                        Ren.  You and I... We're going to duel. 
                        Fight to the death.

           Why?  Why why why why why why why why why why?

           EXT. CAR LOT - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           START ON:  A TRICKED OUT -- DELICIOUS -- CONVERTIBLE -- BMW
           Z4 -- CHROME RIMS GLISTENING IN THE SUN.  AND BLUE!  Olive,
           Zeb, Little Dave, Big Dave and Kat stare at the cars.

                        It's no helicopter.

                                 ZEB
                        But plenty of trunk space --

                                 BIG DAVE
                        You a car salesman or something?

           Or something.  But Olive's concerned.  Not convinced of Zeb's
           plan.  The worry lines on her forehead deepening into canyons.    

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                        I don't know, Zeb.  You just got your
                        learner's permit.

                                 ZEB
                        I played Grand Theft since I was 6.

                                 LITTLE DAVE
                        You can jack a helicopter in Grand Theft -- 

                                 OLIVE
                        Enough with the helicopter.  This isn't
                        a game.  You barely passed Zelner's
                        chem class.  You can't hotwire a car.  

           Zeb runs his hands underneath the car.  Searching.

                        My Dad drags me down here every weekend. 
                        He can't afford anything this nice. 
                        But, you know, test drives are free. 
                        Coming here pretending like he's
                        interested -- like we're worth it --
                        for a 15 minute drive around town.

           A sad story, but brutally honest.  Zeb finds the hide-a-key. 
           Not very well hidden in the wheel-well.

                                 ZEB (CONT'D)
                        I know I'm not prince charming, but
                        Cinderella still needs her coach -- and
                        this is my mouse-portunity.
                          (off Olive's ?)
                        Because the mouse becomes the chauffeur
                        in the movie...
                          (off Olive)
                        Something blue.

           As Zeb gets in the driver seat.  Turns the engine on.  Roaring
           to life.

           EXT. ALLEY - SHANGHAI - RESUME

           Bond gives a RED DUCATI STREET FIGHTER 5 MOTORCYCLE the once
           over twice -- checking to make sure it still works.  Ren's
           eyes are fixed on the BLOOD STAINS on the LEATHER SEAT.

                                 JAMES BOND
                        Do you know how to ride?  Ren?

                        Same thing basically.  

           But -- no -- Ren doesn't want to do this at all -- 

                                 REN
                        I just want to get home to my family... 
                        My wife and son.  In Tangji.

                        I hope you get your chance to see him.

           .... fails.  Frustrating Ren.  Awash in confusion.

                                 REN
                        Why me?  

                                 JAMES BOND
                        Because you walked down the street.

                        You think I'm a monster.  

           Ren's sneer confirms Bond's suggestion.  Ren's not skilled
           at hiding his emotions.  Open book.

                        Then that's all the motivation you

                        deplorable evil.  Slay the dragon, Ren.

           A QUIET STREET.  A SIGN.  25 mph.  Eerily silent.  And then...

           BMW Z4 races past.  Must be going 80.  Or Faster. 
           Disappearing over the horizon just as quickly as it appeared.

           The top is down.  Olive rides SHOTGUN.  Eyes closed.  Letting

           her sunflower bouquet.

           Zeb DRIVES.  Fast.  But still.  Learner's permit.  A little
           difficult down shifting the clutch as he takes a TURN.  Herky. 
           Jerky.  Fighting his way out of a stall.  He's getting it.

           A BLACK BMW X5 zips past.  Olive barely registers Little
           Dave behind the wheel.  Kat and Big Dave laughing.  Leaving
           Olive and Zeb in their dust.  BEEP.  Another text.

           Olive scrolls through her playlist, punching in GUIDED BY
           VOICE'S "Motor Away."  As Zeb's foot hits pedal.  Going from
           35 to Light Speed.  Olive SCREAMS in joy -- like going down
           a roller coaster -- we intercut through:

           EXT. ALLEY - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           Ren sits on his motorcycle.  Feet attempting to balance. 
           Tip toeing on the asphalt.  While fumbling the sword in his
           hand.  HE SIGHS.  Fairly certain  this is how he's gonna
           die.  The victim of an odious case of testosterone gone amok.  

           Ren peers down the alley to see -- JAMES BOND.  Flipping his
           blade like a master -- show off.  A duel.  A joust.  Only
           one of them will come out of this alley alive.  

           Ren looks up at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the side of a bank:

           2:59.  The clock's electric lights BUZZ, switching to 3:00 --

           BOND TAKES OFF.  Flying down the alley.  0 to 110.  Head
           down.  Lowering his sword -- SCRAPING IT ON THE ROAD --

           EXT. PACKARD ROAD - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           THE MAIN DRAG.  A TREACHEROUS OBSTACLE COURSE OF DOOM.  Zeb
           and Little Dave jockey for the lead -- weaving in and out of
           ABANDONED CARS and AIMLESS, ROAMING PEDESTRIANS, littering
           the sidewalk and street...  Olive looks through her Phone --

           Zeb feels the heat of a a CAR CONSUMED IN FLAMES -- nearly
           burning off his eyebrows.   

           DAMN.  He has to concentrate...

           Running NECK and NECK with Little Dave.  Almost pulling ahead
           when:

           Little Dave JERK his wheel -- 

           SMASHING into Zeb's Z4.  

           The SHRIEK of METAL tearing against METAL.  Zeb and Olive's
           seat belts barely keep them inside the car.  
           EXT. ALLEY - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           James Bond is hurtling down the alley.  Inches away from
           Ren.  Sword raised.  Ready to strike.  

           Ren lifts his sword.  Trying to grip with confidence.  But
           the sweat in his palms isn't helping.  Trying to BLOCK James
           Bond's blow when:

           CLANG!

           Steel hits steel.  Ren's managed to parry James Bond's 1st
           strike.  Barely.  Ren looks down at his gut and see --   

           A BLOSSOMING BLOOD STAIN ON HIS SHIRT.  A palpable hit.  It
           stings like a mother.  But can't focus on that now.  As James
           Bond speeds back down the alley.  Ready for round two.

           Little Dave smirks.  He's going all MAD MAX on their asses. 
           Gonna RAM them again.  Lunatic.  And as Little Dave is about
           to hit them -- 

           Zeb steers out of the way.  MOUNTING THE CURB.  Driving on
           the sidewalk.  PLOWING down PARKING METERS.  A SHOWER of
           QUARTERS and DIMES and NICKELS rain down on Olive and Zeb.  

           The WINDSHIELD cracks.  Olive covers her face from the Change
           Storm.  Zeb can barely see.  Craning his neck.  Zagging back
           onto the street.      

           He looks over to Olive.  Still holding her head in her hands.

                                 ZEB
                        You okay?  Olive?  

           Olive doesn't answer.  Is she crying...?  Concern festering --

           Olive removes her hands to reveal -- SHE'S SMILING.  Zeb
           laughs too.  That was awesome.  Olive looks down the street. 
           There's no sign of Little Dave's Car.  Gone.  

                                 OLIVE
                        You gonna let him get away?

           Zeb JERKS the wheel.

           EXT. ALLEY -  SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           Ren DOESN'T MOVE.  Can't.  Too much pain.  Sitting.  Duck. 
           BOND is closing in Ren.  Picking up speed now.  When:

           CONTINUED:

           Ren gets an idea.  He grips his sword.  Like any good warrior
           and then --

           Drops it on the ground.   

           EXT. PRISTINE BACKYARD - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           An expansive lawn.  A fountain.  The nice end of town.  And
           the Z4 ripping through.  Zeb concentrating.  Trying not to
           drive into the SWIMMING POOL. 

           Olive's back seat driving.  Like an old couple.

                                 OLIVE
                        You should have taken Elm.

                                 ZEB
                        I know where I'm going.

                                 OLIVE
                        We're in someone's backyard.

                                 ZEB
                        Colin Tremmel's --

           Olive looks around realizing he's right.

                                 OLIVE
                        Oh yeah...  

                                 ZEB
                        Ran through here everyday in 7th grade
                        to get away from Robert Watkins.  God...
                        I hate that guy...

           As the car plunges into the next backyard -- 

           EXT. ALLEY - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           The SWORD on the ground.  Bond's CLOSING IN.  Ren isn't
           moving.  Standing his ground.  Ren is no killer.  Ren is a
           good man.  Idealistic.  Naive.  But good.    

           Just because the world is descending into chaos, he's not
           going to let James Bond drag him down or change him.  Standing
           tall.  Unwavering.  Powerful.  

           As BOND lifts his blade to deliver the death blow.  He's
           moved by Ren's fortitude.  Ren truly is a better man than
           Bond.  He has met his match.  And as Bond is distracted, he
           doesn't see --

           CONTINUED:

           A CAR.  Speeding through the alley.  Nailing Bond.  Sending
           him flying off his bike.  Landing on the ground.  IMPALED on
           his OWN SWORD.  

           Ren watches as two 13-year-old kids jump out of the car and
           scurry off.  Did that just fucking happen? 

           EXT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           Zeb's Z4 bursts out of an alley.  Fishtailing onto the large
           street.  Coming out inches ahead of --

           LITTLE DAVE'S X5.

           It's a race again.  Neck and neck.  Nearly at Pinball Pete's. 
           The final stretch.  

           Zeb looks at a FUMING Little Dave in his rearview.

           Little Dave attempts to pass them.  Jerking the wheel HARD. 
           But.  The High Center of gravity.  And velocity.  And 16-
           year-old behind the wheel sends Little Dave's car --  

           TUMBLING OVER --

           And OVER -- And OVER -- 

           LANDING UPSIDE DOWN IN A GRUESOME CRASH!    

           Olive and Zeb watch the whole thing in the rearview mirror. 
           Skidding to a stop.  Nearly getting into an accident
           themselves.  

           EXT. ALLEY - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           Ren walks over cautiously to Bond's body.  Making certain
           he's actually dead.  Ren sees Bond's face.  Hanging onto the
           last seconds of life.  Bond looks up to Ren -- honest:  

                                 JAMES BOND
                        Thank you.

           Ren's reverent.  He takes no joy in this moment.  Dead is
           dead.  Even for someone like Bond. 

           Ren looks down at his own wound.  Blood's pouring out.  He
           thought it was just a little cut.  A nick.  A scratch.  But
           as he pulls up his shirt -- we see --

           A DEEP GASH.  BLEEDING OUT.  REN'S DYING...
           EXT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           Olive and Zeb follow a trail of BROKEN GLASS.  TWISTED METAL. 
           And BLOOD.  Until they finally reach --

           THE WRECKAGE OF LITTLE DAVE'S BMW.

           Pure carnage.  Roof crashed in.  But thankfully -- Little
           Dave, Big Dave and Kat are still ALIVE.  Bruised.  Cut. 
           Little Dave's coughing a laugh.    

                                 LITTLE DAVE
                        Now that was all time!  Woooo!

           Kat whimpers in the back seat as.  Big Dave unbuckles his
           seat belt.  Falling with a thud.      

                                 OLIVE
                        It's okay.  You guys are gonna be okay.  

           Olive and Zeb help Big Dave and Kat get out of the car.  

                                 ZEB
                        Your turn, maniac.  

           But as Zeb goes to help Little Dave -- he notices:  

           Little Dave is IMPALED on a CHUNK OF SHRAPNEL.  Right into
           his gut.  Slowly leaking blood.  Drip.  Drip.  Drip.  Oh
           God.  They all stare in horror.  Mute panic.

                                 LITTLE DAVE
                        It's okay.  Seriously.  I'm fine.

           Big Dave puts his hands on the shard.  But then...  Staring
           at his best friend.  Stands.  Shaking his head.

           Zeb nods his head.  He knows what he's gotta do.  But Olive
           shakes her head.

           INT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - DAY

           Bainbridge holds a phone to his ear.  In the background we
           hear a RECORD on the broadcast, so Bainbridge can make this
           important phone call in PRIVATE.  We DON'T hear the other
           end of the phone call, but based on Bainbridge's posture and
           posturing, we can tell he's gotten voice mail:       

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I was hoping to reach you, but... you
                        know I've gone to tete to tete with
                        Saddam Hussein.  Thatcher.  Mandela. 
                        Two Popes.  Not boasting.  Well --

           Not trying to boast.  It's a default setting.

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I didn't blink at that lot.  But you,
                        dear Brother, you shrink me into a child.

           Bainbridge looks at the bottle of scotch...

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        We suffered under our Father's rotgut
                        tyranny.  Bound in blood.  And in blood.  

           ...Then to the SCARS and BURNS on his hands.  They aren't
           from life as a journalist, but an abusive Dad.  

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        And then you abused me.  Wrecked my
                        eyes, forcing me to read school texts
                        twice over.  Bruised my knees on church
                        pews.  Whipped me into a man.  More
                        Father than Brother.  It fit you.  The
                        patriarch.  Biblical.  

           Bainbridge takes in a long drag of air before continuing.  

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I'm certain you're surrounded by family. 
                        Kids and Grandkids.  I received the
                        invitations.  Birthdays and baptisms. 
                        Not that I attended.  Busy.  I had my
                        girl send regrets and scones.  I hid in
                        my work.  A child's game.  Didn't you
                        know I wanted you to play?

           Bainbridge looks out over London -- as if he were searching
           the city for Freddy's house.  As if he could see him. 

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I wanted a brother to enjoy my success. 
                        Not an ersatz father to admonish my
                        shortcomings.  Which I am not short on. 
                        You couldn't exorcise our father's demon. 
                        How I must haunt you -- 

           Bainbridge fingers the bottle.  How he desperately wants to
           take a drink.  A taste -- 

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I heard it in your silence.  I was your
                        failure, in spite of my accomplishments --
                        didn't need to trudge to Gowkshill for
                        an easter egg hunt to feel that pang --  

           -- But doesn't.  Trying to remain strong.

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Then the invites stopped.  My message
                        received.  And 9 years vanish in a sigh. 
                        I imagine you angry.  I rejected you,
                        your family.  I did.  I hoped --  

           Bainbridge realizes, the news he reported -- he was talking
           about himself this whole time.  Echoing his own words:

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Past indiscretions could be forgiven. 
                        Clemency granted to those who seek it --
                        and even for those who don't.

           CONTINUED:  (2)

           Bainbridge pauses.  Reflecting.  Not bad.  Not a bad little
           speech.  And then -- 

           TAKES A CARD from an OLD STYLE ROLODEX.  We quickly realize
           as Bainbridge dials, the old newsman was just practicing. 
           Getting it right before he made the call.  Always the
           professional.  Even when calling his brother.  

           The phone line rings.  And rings.  And rings.  And then -- 

                                 FREDRICK BAINBRIDGE  (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hello?

           Not voice mail.  No.  His brother.  Actually on the line.  

                                 FREDRICK BAINBRIDGE (CONT'D)
                        Hello?  John?  Is that you?  

           And for all of the bluster and poetry, Sir John is rendered
           speechless at the sound of his brother's VOICE.  Struck mute
           with overwhelming guilt.  Fredrick HANGS UP.  The line goes
           DEAD. 

           EXT. MANGLED BMW - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           Little Dave's lifeless body lies slumped in the tangled mess
           of metal and glass.  A pool of blood forming around his body.  

           Olive kneels by Little Dave's body.  Silently PRAYING.  Kat
           sits on the curb.  Crying.  Can't stop crying.  Zeb tries to
           comfort her.  But words don't mean much right now -- so all
           he can give her is an ARM around her.  

           Big Dave drains the last inches of a BOTTLE OF BEER.  Dropping
           it on the ground with CRASH!  Then reaching into the broken
           car and fishing out another bottle.  

           Olive finishes her prayer.  Opens her eyes.  Looks down at
           Little Dave and closes his eyes with her hands.

                                 BIG DAVE
                        Beer?  It's a little warm but --

                        I'll take one.  

                                 KAT
                        Two.

           Big Dave twists off the cap.  Then tosses Zeb the beer.  A
           bit SPILLS out as Zeb catches the bottle.  WE notice.  Some
           blood on his hands as he takes a long swig --

           She wants Zeb to be her rock.  Her friend who saved her
           sunflowers for her.  Despite the times.  Olive stares daggers
           at Zeb -- can't help but feel accusatory:

                        Give him a break.  

           Zeb feels enough guilt without Olive piling it on.  Taking a
           long pull on his beer.  Swallowing.    

                                 ZEB
                        It was the merciful thing to do. 

           And that word stings Olive.

                        Mercy?

                        here -- with me.

           Olive studies Zeb's face.  Her best friend.  It's like she
           doesn't even know him anymore.  Olive grabs her SUNFLOWERS
           and runs off -- down the street...

           EXT. STREET - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           Ren STUMBLES down the street.  Illuminated in the passing
           HEADLIGHTS.  Holding his WOUND.  Trying to keep his insides
           from falling out with one hand.  Trying to wave down a car
           with the other hand.  Trying to stay conscious.    

           The world seems to be spinning faster.  Dizzying.  Ren can
           barely stand.  Barely keep focus.  The neon a blur.  No one
           stops for Ren.  Not a soul.  One car nearly runs him over. 
           Ren barely gets out of the way.  Ren sees --  

           A CONVENIENCE STORE.  His chance to get EGGS.  But as he's
           about to enter.  The doors SLIDING OPEN and CLOSED with a
           DING.  Ren sees his REFLECTION.  

           He's PALE.  Sweating.  He doesn't need to be a doctor to
           know.  This isn't good.  Ren wants more than anything to get
           eggs.  For his son.  To cook breakfast.  But he must admit. 
           He has more pressing issues.  Hustling back down the street
           as we MATCH CUT TO: 
           EXT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           OLIVE RUNS DOWN THE STREET.  One hand grasping her BOUQUET
           OF SUNFLOWERS.  The other hand gripping the SKIRT of her
           WEDDING DRESS.  Careful not to trip on it or get it dirty.  

           The TRAFFIC is still INSANE.  Cars strangling road.  AND THE
           BRIDE.  Running down the median.  Surreal.  Very "GRADUATE." 
           Olive tries not to get turned into roadkill.  Tries not to
           cry.  But still cries.  Her chest is heavy.  But it's not
           the gravity.  It's just guilt and fear and anger --

           Olive checks her reflection in the STORE FRONT WINDOWS. 
           Trying to fix her hair.  Palm away the tears.  Make certain
           she looks beautiful for Malcolm.  For her GROOM.  

           EXT. STUDENT HOUSING - UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN - LATER

           Olive hustles to Malcolm's apartment.  WE SEE: FLYERS for
           bands, poetry slams, credit cards and tutors on bulletin
           boards.  College kids LITTERING THE LAWN.  

           DRUNK.  HIGH.  PASSED OUT.  Two STUDENTS are fighting.  An
           old grudge taken out in FISTS and BLOOD.  Other BRAINY
           STUDENTS haul CANS and DUCT TAPE and SARAN WRAP -- trying to
           construct a shelter, 9/11 style --      

           Olive steps over an unconscious FRAT BOY lying in a puddle
           of his own PUKE and BLOOD at the bottom of the stairs.  It
           makes her think of Little Dave --  

           She wants to stop.  Make sure he's okay.  She doesn't.  It's
           time to press on.  Holding her shit together.  Running up -- 

           THE STAIRCASE.  

           The train of her dress getting dirty as she ascends.  Her
           footsteps echoing in the cavernous, dark shaft -- hustling
           up all three flights without stopping.  

           Making a BEE-LINE for -- APARTMENT 316.  Malcolm's Apartment. 
           Ringing the DOORBELL.  Waiting.  Breath catching.  But.  No
           answer.  Olive BANGS.  Fist pounding against wood.  A hint
           of desperation in her cadence.  Where the hell is Malcolm? 
           He was supposed to be home an hour ago.  Olive listens -- 

           She hears MUSIC coming from inside.  

           Thinking back on Zeb and the car, Olive looks under the
           WELCOME MAT.  Finding the SPARE KEY.  OPENS THE DOOR -- the
           MUSIC bursts out as she enters --
           INT. MALCOLM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           THE STEREO BLARING.  IRON & WINE.  Sweet.  Romantic.  No
           wonder Malcolm didn't hear her knocking.  He was setting the
           mood for their wedding.  Olive smitten.   

                                 OLIVE
                        Our song?

           No answer.  Olive looks around the apartment.  A BOOKSHELF
           and LAMP and PLATES have all crashed to the ground -- due to
           the GRAVITY EFFECT.  Olive becomes increasingly concerned:

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Malcolm?

           She walks down a hallway -- toward the bedrooms -- standing
           in the door jamb -- watching as:

           MALCOLM FUCKS ANOTHER GIRL.  

           Olive watches.  Horrified.  But this isn't the romantic,
           tender making love Olive witnessed with the COUPLE IN THE
           FOREST.  No.  This is.  It's... 

           RAW.  Malcolm going at it with the girl under his comforter. 
           Lust.  Worse.  A BETRAYAL.  Everything Olive did today.  All
           day.  Her deepest wishes -- MARRYING MALCOLM -- shattered
           before her eyes.  An acrid acid boiling in her gut.  

           Olive picks up Malcolm's PSYCHOLOGY 101 TEXTBOOK.  Thick and
           hardbound with sharp edges.  And HURLS it at him.  NAILING
           Malcolm in the head.  Malcolm turns.  What the hell...?

           Olive doesn't stop for pomp or circumstance.  Furiously
           chucking whatever her fingers can find.  A lamp.  His macbook. 
           A glass bong.  Hoping to draw blood.  Hoping to get
           satisfaction -- Olive storms out.

           EXT. MALCOLM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           As Olive's about to head down the stairs -- Malcolm comes
           out, a sheet wrapped around his privates.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Olive.  Just.  Wait.

           Olive stops -- straddling stairs.  Sighing anger.

                        You were taking a long time so...

           Malcolm runs his hands through his hair.  Frustrated.

                                 MALCOLM
                        All I'm saying is morality is subjective.

           And Malcolm looks at Olive.  In her wedding dress.  The
           sunflower bouquet.  Beautiful.  Malcolm closes the gap. 
           Takes her hand.  Apologetic.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        You look beautiful. 

           She allows herself to enjoy his touch.  It is what she

                        Because I love you -- 

           They stare at each other.  Olive thinks.  For a fleeting

                                 MALCOLM
                        You could join us.

           Olive sharply pulls her hand away.  Walking down the stairs. 
           Taking her flowers and leaves --

           NURSE ANGEL cradles a BABY.  A PACIFIER on her finger -- her
           finger in the BABY'S MOUTH.  She hums a sweet lullaby. 
           SOOTHING THE BABY.  Working.  Even in the end.

           Angel hears a familiar BANGING at the DOOR.  RAT-A-TAT-TAT. 
           A knowing smirk.

                        I knew you'd be back, Ren.

           She turns to see -- 

           Just like before.  REN.  Standing on TIPPY-TOES -- his little
           head barely visible in the observation window.  Waving his
           BLOODY hand --

           Angel gasps.  Rushing to help Ren.  Yanking open the door.    

           INT. HOSPITAL NICU - SHANGHAI - LATER

           A NEEDLE pokes through FLESH.  Ren WINCES as Angel STITCHES
           up his side.  Cauterizing the wound as she goes with a First
           Aid Kit.  As Angel takes another pass through skin --  

           Ren sucks in air and spit through his teeth.  Trying to hide
           his pain.  Still never one to complain.  Even though it hurts
           worse than anything he could ever imagine.  Angel's
           sympathetic even if her fingers are shaky.  Making the whole
           experience that much more unpleasant.  

                                 ANGEL
                        I haven't done this since school.

           As Angel takes off her gloves.  Ren ruminates on the words. 
           ALL DONE.  Too true.  Time to concede.  Towel thrown --  

                                 REN

           She shouldn't have gloated.  Angel's heart breaks for Ren.

                        You tried.

           Meaning.  He failed.  For all his talk of faith.  And belief. 
           And will power.  Ren failed.  Angel puts a comforting hand
           on Ren's.  Kind.  Caring.  

           He stares at Angel.  She is... beautiful.  Ren leans in and --

           KISSES Angel.  The MOST loyal husband.  The MOST loyal father. 
           Gerald's words still ring into Ren's ears.  And Bart Simpsons'
           from the subway.  SUCCUMBING.  For a nano-second before
           abruptly pulling away.

                                 ANGEL (CONT'D)
                        Dude.

           Ren shakes his head.  As if he was in some sort of -- daze. 
           Instantly ashamed.  Confused.  Near tears:  

                                 ANGEL (CONT'D)
                        You lost a lot of blood.  And the
                        morphine.

           Ren's lost.  Confused.  Defeated.  Sad.  So very sad.  Angel
           lays him down on the bed.  

                                 ANGEL (CONT'D)
                        You spend so much time taking care of
                        others.  Let someone take care of you.

           Draping him in a blanket.  Nurturing.  And yet.  Saddened. 
           If anyone could accomplish the impossible.  It would be Ren. 
           And he didn't.  It makes Angel feel -- hopeless.

           EXT. END OF THE WORLD PARTY - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           THUMPING BASS thunders out of an ELEPHANT SIZED CONCERT
           SPEAKER mounted in the back of a FLAT BED.  "DJ REEBOK" is
           spinning tunes.  Not exactly LAS VEGAS.  But trying to be in
           these last fleeting moments.  Shirt off.  Wearing an old-
           school LL COOL J HAT.  KANYE pouring out of the speakers:     

           AS KIDS DRINK AND SMOKE.  Shooting beers.  Lighting up joints.  

           AND SWIM AND DANCE.  Sweating.  Writhing bodies.  Glimpses
           of PG-13 RATED FLESH poke out of the pond.  WILD ABANDON.  

           AND CRYING.  Finding comfort in friends.  Uncontrollable
           weeping.

           AND INSANE.  Judging people's suicides off Lattimer Bridge. 
           Holding up scores like OLYMPIC JUDGES.  Another two boys
           playing WILLIAM TELL with a REVOLVER and an APPLE.     

           Amongst the revelers we discover:

           BIG DAVE crosses through a sea of people.  Bringing a full
           bottle of GREY GOOSE over to:   

           OLIVE and KAT.  DANCING.  Olive's still in her wedding dress. 
           Refusing to take it off.  They all swap swigs of alcohol. 
           Drowning sorrows.  Faces contorting into scowls.  Getting
           good and wasted.

           Big Dave asks Kat to dance.  In the wake of the everything --
           Kat agrees.  Drunkenly dancing with her best friend.  Leaving
           Olive alone.  Olive burns.  Vodka pouring down her throat. 
           Rage towards Malcolm.  Bad choices ensue:    

           Dancing.  Grinding against the nearest BOY she can find.  

           Olive doesn't know this dude, but still takes off his shirt. 
           Her hands rubbing up and down his bare chest.  Making certain
           there is no misunderstanding.  Olive's only interested in
           one thing now.  As we find an angle on:  

           ZEB.

           Sitting on a BOULDER.  Knees folded into chest.  Scanning
           the crowd until he discovers.  

           Olive.  Grinding herself into some GUY.  Kissing him.  

           Zeb leaps off the boulder.  Hustling his way through the
           throng.  Seeing Olive's WEDDING DRESS through the cracks in
           the crowd.  Honing in and --

           PULLING OLIVE OFF THE DUDE.  She stares daggers at Zeb --

                                 OLIVE
                        The hell are you doing...?

                                 ZEB
                        I'm sorry about what I said before.

                                 OLIVE
                        Grand.  Excuse me --

           Olive tries to push past Zeb, but he's not moving.  

                                 ZEB
                        Don't make a mistake you're gonna regret.

                        So this is wrong?  And Malcolm is wrong? 
                        And God?  So you know so much.  What's
                        the right choice, Zeb?   

           Zeb doesn't answer.  Putting his hands in his pockets.  All
           of his bluster evaporating in the afternoon sun.  Olive knows --
           and the alcohol has loosened her tongue.    

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        You think I should be with you?

           Zeb doesn't answer.  But we all know.  Olive knows.  Zeb
           wants to be with her.  More than anything.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        A girl wants to be held.  To be cared
                        for.  And you...  you're a coward.  You
                        can't even admit you love me. 

           And Olive's not wrong.  But the alcohol has removed her
           sensitivity filter.  Going straight for Zeb's jugular.  

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        How could I ever love someone like you?  

           Hurt.  Zeb walks away.  And Olive knows she shouldn't have
           said those things.  It's like she was possessed.  Immediately
           regretful.  

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Zeb...

           But he gives Olive the BIRD as he disappears into the crowd. 
           And just as Olive can't imagine this day getting any worse. 

                                 MR. WINGERT (O.S.)
                        Olive.

           Olive turns to see her father.  Mr. Wingert.  Arms crossed. 
           Fuming angry at his daughter.  Disappointed.    

           Mr. Wingert grabs his daughter by the arm, squeezing hard
           and angry.  Walking Olive to his car.  Away from the party. 
           Away from Zeb.  Away from reconciliation.

           INT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - DAY

           The liquor bottles are empty.  Bainbridge suffers under the
           weight of a migraine.  Gathering himself.  Reporting:

                        Still alive and kicking, sir.

           And there is a levity to Corporal Brand's voice that wasn't
           present before.  As if we could hear a smile.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Last we spoke, a lottery would determine
                        admission to the continuance bunker.  I
                        can imagine the chaos that has ensued --

                        No-sir.  I've never seen anything like
                        this...  the community decided only the
                        children would be allowed in the shelter.

                        We cleared the airspace so the parents
                        could say goodbye.  Are you seeing this?  

           Bainbridge grabs a REMOTE.  Changing through the monitors. 
           Until they are all broadcasting the same NEWS FEED:

           THE BLUE SKY ABOVE SAN DIEGO.  It's filled with BALLOONS. 
           Massive HOT AIR BALLOONS.  Rainbows.  Bursting color.  There
           must be 70.  80.  And then -- 

           Millions of regular balloons are released.  Floating up. 
           Like fireworks in the middle of the day.  It's magical.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        For those of you who cannot see -- the

                        balloons.  There must be millions. 
                        These parents have given their children
                        the greatest gift.  Smiles.  

           And with that -- overwhelmed -- all the drink finally catches
           up to Bainbridge -- as he kneels over, planting his head in
           a trash can as we SMASH TO:

           INT. CHURCH BATHROOM - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           A CLOSED BATHROOM STALL DOOR.  OLIVE'S PUKING.  CHUNKS splash
           in toilet water.  Heaving half a bottle of vodka into the
           toilet.  Her 16-year-old gut can't stomach the booze.  She
           FLUSHES.  Walks out of the stall.  Blood drained from her
           face.  Pale.  Discovering:

           HER FATHER, Mr. Wingert.  A BOTTLE OF WATER in one hand --
           WET PAPER TOWEL in the other.  That DISAPPOINTED glare that
           only a father can nail.  

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        What were you thinking? 

           Olive doesn't answer.  Staring.  Silent.  Mr. Wingert extends
           the towel to Olive.  Olive takes the towel, wiping her face.

                                 MR. WINGERT (CONT'D)
                        Do you know how afraid I was?

           Again.  No answer.  Mr. Wingert hands Olive the bottle of
           water.  He's trying to be calm.  Caring, but not especially
           nurturing.  There's a difference. 

                                 MR. WINGERT (CONT'D)
                        Drink some water.

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm not thirsty.

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        Alcohol dehydrates you.  You know how
                        you get.  Soccer?

           Olive looks up at her father.  Craning her neck.

                                 OLIVE
                        You know you can't save me.  Right? 
                        Like you couldn't save Mom.

           Mr. Wingert's eyes turn sad -- looking at his daughter...
           Surprised to hear that mouth on his daughter.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        You pray and pray and pray and nothing
                        changes -- Mom never got better... 

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        You're drunk.

           A tense moment.  Olive palms a tear out of her eye.  Trying
           to be brave.  

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm going.

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        Drinking?  Sex?

                        No.  I don't know.

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        That is not an option.

                                 OLIVE
                        You don't get to make that choice.

           Olive doesn't know what she wants.  But she knows.  It's her
           choice.  Defiant.  Wingert softens: 

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        Did I do something wrong?

                        No.

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        Because, this hasn't been easy. 

                                 OLIVE
                        For either of us.

                        When you asked me about lipstick or

           The memory scraping the surface of her thoughts --

                                 OLIVE

                        Your mother should've been...  You

                        maybe Angela could...

           Wingert scowls.  So frustrated.  Overwhelmed by his failure.  

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        This isn't a job for men.  

           Olive sees her father's frustrations.  Behind the sting is
           softness.  Compassionate, Olive takes her father's hand.

                                 OLIVE
                        Doesn't mean I don't love you.  I love
                        you, Daddy.  But you have to let me go.

           Mr. Wingert let's go of Olive's hand.  Heads to the door. 
           Fishing out a SET OF KEYS --

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        We need to pray on this.  I'll be back
                        soon and -- we can spend our final
                        moments together.  As a family.

           Mr. Wingert exits, swiftly closing the door behind him. 
           Olive HEARS.  The door -- LOCKING.  What the...?  Olive runs
           to the door.  Yanking on it.  But no.  NO!  It won't budge. 
           It's locked.  Her father LOCKED HER IN.  

           As Olive BANGS on the door -- MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL NICU - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           A BANGING at the DOOR.  Angel's startled.  Who the hell could
           it be?  Angel checks on REN -- still sleeping as she makes
           her way across the room, pulling open the door to find:

           A WOMAN.  Disheveled.  Make-up staining her cheeks.  She's
           been crying.  Sobbing.  For hours.  Exhausted.

                        Pauline Yang.  Geo's mommy.

           She came back.  Just like Ren said she would.

           Angel nods a smile.  Pulling over a ROCKING CHAIR --
           indicating for the woman to SIT.  Then LAYING a blanket over
           her lap.  Making a warm nest.  

           Angel cradles Baby Geo in her arms -- wires and all --
           transferring him over to his mother's tender care.  Geo's
           mother holds her son close to her chest.  Angel looks at
           Ren.  Amazed.  He was right.  From a nearby radio we hear:

                        The long and short is -- years ago -- I
                        ran into a former female associate whom
                        I'd desecrated on occasion.  She was
                        holding the hand of a 3-year-old girl,
                        whose feckless-freckled face was my own -- 

           Bainbridge pains at the memory --

                        The mother craved nothing.  No fiduciary
                        obligations.  No diaper duty.  I was to
                        have nothing to do with my daughter. 
                        Being a gentleman, and a lout, I obliged.

                        for the finest education.  A private
                        letter to the dean of admissions for 
                        university.  Pulling strings to get her
                        CV to the top of the job pile...

           Then cradling the tea for warmth as he feels a chill --

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Ever the journalist, ever observing
                        from afar as she blossomed into a
                        beautiful and kind human being.  Honoring
                        her mother's wishes.  My daughter never
                        knew her father existed... 

           In the reflection of the glass, Bainbridge sees the PHONE
           LIGHT UP.  The single signal blinking.  A caller.  He
           swallows.  Nervous.  Could it be....?  He picks up the line:

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You're on Voice of the World.

           It's a moment before we hear: 

                                 OLIVE (ON THE PHONE)
                        Why didn't you tell her the truth?

           INT. CHURCH BATHROOM - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           Olive sits on the toilet.  In her wedding dress.  Flowers on
           the floor.  Talking on the phone. 

                                 SIR JOHN
                        What's your name, dear?

                                 OLIVE
                        Olive.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Olive-dear....

                                 OLIVE
                        Just.  Olive.  A girl needs a father --

           CONTINUED:

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I make a better angel.

                                 OLIVE
                        You didn't give her a choice.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Not hers to make --

           Olive's clinging to her hate.  Of Malcolm.  Of her Dad. 
           Especially her Dad.  It transfers easily to Bainbridge --

                                 OLIVE
                        She dreamed about you.  You know that. 
                        It's a fairy tale --   

                                 SIR JOHN
                        My daughter wanted for nothing.

                                 OLIVE
                        It's easy to pay the bills.  Harder to
                        clean the mess...

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Too right.  All the benefits, none of
                        the baggage.

           Olive sees the mess of her face in the mirror.  Takes a paper
           towel to wipe up her tears...

                                 OLIVE
                        You didn't even try.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Fatherhood was a gig best left to her
                        mother.  I had... work.  

           And that breaks Olive's heart.  How similar her own father
           is to Bainbridge -- angry:   

                                 OLIVE
                        You wouldn't know -- you never met her --

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I never said that.

           What?  But Olive assumed -- 

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I didn't steer her into broadcast.  An
                        innate genetic yen?  A higher power? 
                        But when she applied for a job here --

           CONTINUED:  (2)

                                 OLIVE
                        She works with you?

           He looks at the photo of PRUDENCE.  And holy fucking shit! 
           We quickly realize, Prudence is his DAUGHTER.  Not an affair. 
           Not some fling.  Bainbridge recalls earlier:     

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        She must know.  It can't be coincidence.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Perhaps.  She allows me my silence. 
                        Waiting on me to take the first step. 
                        It is my duty.  And I had a chance to
                        confess.  To be with my girl.  But --

           He was haunted by too many demons.  A lifetime of conflict
           stifling his soul.  Standing alone in the broadcast booth.  

                                 SIR JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You know how the story ends.

           And in the silence.  Olive hears:  THE DOOR.  UNLOCKING.

                                 OLIVE
                        Story's not over yet.  God hears
                        confessions.  So will she --   

           Olive hangs up.  WE REMAIN inside the bathroom with Olive. 
           Staring at the door.  Wondering who is going to walk through
           the threshold.  Her Dad?  

           Malcolm?  Zeb?  But no:

           It's ANGELA.  The young, inappropriate girl-friend.

                                 ANGELA
                        I'm probably one of the last people you
                        wanna see right now.

                                 OLIVE
                        No.  
                          (then)
                        The last.

           Angela can practically feel the heat coming from Olive's
           eyes -- but she presses on.  Stepping forward.

                                 ANGELA
                        I don't expect you to anything -- this
                        isn't some last minute reconciliation
                        thing.  I just -- I came to spring you --

           CONTINUED:  (3)

           She what now?  Angela?  Olive's immediately suspect:

                                 ANGELA (CONT'D)
                        Your father doesn't understand being
                        16.  And a girl.  But it wasn't that
                        long ago for me --

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah, that's not helping --

           Angela checks her watch.  3:01 PM.

                                 ANGELA
                        Can I give you a lift somewhere?

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           Angel helps Ren hobble through the parking garage.  She's
           hitting the ALARM BUTTON.  But no HEADLIGHTS are blinking. 
           Ren CRINGES.  His wounds smarting.  The stitches could come
           undone.  Stumbling along.  

                                 ANGEL
                        Geo's mom is gonna stay with the babies. 
                        Gave us her car -- though she couldn't
                        remember where she parked...    

                                 REN
                        Hang on.  Just...

           Ren needs to take a break.  Breathing through the pain. 
           Angel checks the wound.  

                                 ANGEL
                        I'll drive.  But it's up to you to fight
                        through the pain, dude.    

           Easier said than done...

                                 ANGEL (CONT'D)
                        You were right okay?  Geo's mom came
                        back.  So, you do not give up.  There's
                        still time.  Okay?  Still time --   

           Angel hits the ALARM BUTTON AGAIN.  A SMALL HYUNDAI in the
           corner LIGHTS UP.  A way home.  Angel smiles.  Offering Ren 
           a hand.  He takes it.  The speech worked.  They limp to the
           car.  Getting inside...  

                                 REN
                        We have to make one stop first...

           As Ren slams the door -- 
           INT. ANGELA'S CAR - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           POP!  The CIGARETTE LIGHTER SNAPS OUT!

           Angela pulls out the lighter.  The COIL RED and HOT.  Lighting
           a SKINNY, MENTHOL CIGARETTE.  Taking a long drag.  Olive,
           still in wedding dress and the vestiges of her BOUQUET, sits
           stunned at Angela's rebellion.  

                                 OLIVE
                        You smoke?

                                 ANGELA
                        Menthols.  I convinced your dad it's
                        just the taste of my gum...

                                 OLIVE
                        Can I...?

           Angela hands her the cigarette.  Olive doesn't really know
           how to hold it.  Fumbling.

                                 ANGELA
                        Between these two fingers.  

           Olive inhales.  Her lips awkwardly engulfing the tiny
           cigarette.  Coughing out a plume of smoke.  Before handing
           it back to Angela.  As Angela takes a drag. 

                                 ANGELA (CONT'D)
                          (off Olive)
                        Don't tell him, Okay?

                                 OLIVE
                        Honest?  I didn't think you were capable
                        of thinking for yourself.

                                 ANGELA
                        That's nice.  

                                 OLIVE

                        It's not like we took the time to get
                        to know each other.

           Very true.  Angela passes the cigarette to Olive --   

                                 OLIVE
                        We could cram it all in now?

                        a cold day with the heat turned up.  I
                        fell in love...  I love your father.

                        Because he was my friend first. 

           Sounds a lot like Zeb.  Olive can't help reflect on her best
           friend.  The bouquet of flowers he saved for her.  

                                 ANGELA (CONT'D)
                        I don't know what I wanna do when I

                        mother.  I thought I'd be good at that... 

           Angela takes a long long drag.  Olive sees Angela's pain. 
           They're not so different.  When it comes right down to it.

                        So?  Where are you going?   

           As Olive holds the cigarette in her hand.  Ready to make the
           choice she's been avoiding this entire time:

           reflected in the WINDSHIELD.

           EXT. GLENN MEMORIAL - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           TO ESTABLISH.  A SIGN.  A SLAB OF GREY GRANITE.  Like a large
           TOMBSTONE.  Etched with the words, "GLENN MEMORIAL."  STOIC.    

           Angela's CAR breaks frame -- but as we prepare to find Olive
           going to visit her mother in a Cemetery WE CUT INTO:  

           INT. GLENN MEMORIAL - MOMENTS LATER

           A DARK HOSPITAL ROOM.  Olive stands over -- VALERIE WINGERT
           (40) -- ALIVE.  Well.  Kind of.  A BREATHING TUBE running
           from her throat to a RESPIRATOR.  LIFE SUPPORT.  Eyes open
           yes, but VACANT.  Olive holds the sunflowers.

                                 OLIVE
                        I brought your favorite.

           Olive presents the SUNFLOWERS.  Then goes to the night stand
           and finds an EMPTY VASE.  Takes it to the sink -- filling it
           with WATER.  (All her actions very similar to Ren -- amazingly
           so -- how small our world really is.)  Olive speaks to her
           mother as if they were having a conversation.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Oh Angela dropped me off.  She's not
                        too bad.  Angela.  You remember she
                        worked here.  That's how they met...  

           Olive finishes filling the vase.  Turns off the water.  And
           then puts the flowers inside.  Arranging them carefully.

                        Dad was so devoted to you, but it's
                        been 7 years.  They don't kiss.  Just
                        hold hands and stuff.  Technically, you
                        and Dad are married until you...

           Olive looks at her mother's hand.  Eyeing the WEDDING RING
           on her finger.  Then puts the vase by her mother's bed -- 

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        But don't worry.  I hate her for you.

           Olive cuddles up next to her mom --
           EXT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - DUSK

           Bainbridge stares out the window.  The sky is filled with
           oranges and purples and pinks as the sun begins to head down --
           below the horizon and a swath of night begins to creep --

           Sir John talks into the microphone.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I lived my life without compromise.

           INT. A DIFFERENT WALMART - SHANGHAI - NIGHT 

           The Dairy Aisle.  Ren and Angel stand in a GRAVEYARD OF
           CRACKED SHELLS AND YOLKS.  MEASURING EGGS.  Trying to find
           one that's 49 mm.  Just one would be fine.  Ren's vigilant
           eyes on the clock -- 5:14 AM. 

           As Ren takes another egg in his hand.  Measuring.  It's not
           49 mm.  He drops it with an unceremonious CRACK.  Exhausted.

                                 REN
                        I lived my life without complaint. 

           WE INTERCUT BETWEEN OLIVE, REN and SIR JOHN:  

                                 OLIVE
                        I think I made a mess of everything.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I called it integrity.

                                 REN
                        I tried to always be helpful to others --
                        To do good in this world.

                                 OLIVE
                        I tried.  I prayed.  Every sunday. 
                        Sang in choir.  Good grades.  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I lied to substantiate my ambition --

                        People remember those who help them...

                                 OLIVE
                        You were in my every thought, Mommy.

                                 REN
                        My wife says I'm naive.  I prefer
                        compassionate.

                        I feign compassion to endear myself
                        fans, though I've long given up.

                        I say everything happens for a reason.

                        How can it be right to keep you alive? 
                        How can Dad do this to you?

                        That gangster.  Those people in the

                                 OLIVE
                        Or is Zeb right?  Is it merciful to end
                        your suffering?

                                 REN
                        The man who committed suicide.  That
                        poor man on the radio.

                                 OLIVE
                        Who's right? 

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Ren is right.

                                 REN
                        I couldn't give in to cynicism.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Fight while there is still time.

                                 REN
                        I never never complained.  Kept faith.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        And Olive is right.

                        I'm confused and -- and confused.

                        God hears our confessions.

                        I prayed that you'd die.

                        So yes.  Indecisive.  I couldn't grow
                        up without you, Mommy.

                                 OLIVE
                        I tried to cram a life in a day.

           Olive holds her mother's hand.  The RING.

                                 REN
                        Kiss my wife.

                                 SIR JOHN
                        Thank you for raising me Freddy --

                                 OLIVE
                        ...A kiss... and sex...  but I was
                        afraid.  Don't tell Zeb.

           WE RESUME WITH OLIVE.  

           And as Olive's thoughts are drawn to Zeb, again.  Staring at
           the SUNFLOWERS -- as they begin to BEND and COLLAPSE, just
           as they did on the Flower Farm...

           GRAVITY IS SHIFTING.  HEAVY.  REAL HEAVY.  

           INT. A DIFFERENT WALMART - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           THE ROOF COLLAPSES.  A LARGE CERAMIC TILE nearly CRUSHES
           Angel, but Ren pulls her away just in time.  Saving her life. 
           For the time being.  As EXPOSED WIRING  snakes to the ground. 
           Hissing with electric venom.  AND AIR CONDITIONING DUCTS are
           about to descend on them -- cutting them into ribbons --
           nowhere to run -- except -- into the WALK IN FREEZER.  

           INT. GLENN MEMORIAL - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           Feels like the building is going to collapse on top of them. 
           SHAKING.  CEILING TILES CRACK.  FLUORESCENT LIGHTS dislodge
           and SHATTER on the floor.  POWER CUTS OUT.  Drenching them
           in darkness.  Frightened, Olive takes her mother's hand.  

           Daylight intrudes as the BLINDS are pulled to the ground. 
           The MEATY SHAFTS of LIGHT blinding OLIVE.  The GRAVITY topples
           over the RESPIRATOR, yanking out Val's breathing tube.  

           Olive can't move.  The gravity is too intense.  The only
           thing Olive can do is CLASP her mother's HAND.  Holding it
           tightly.  

           EXT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - INTERCUT

           THE GRAVITY sends Bainbridge to his KNEES.  Really praying
           now.  Prostrate.  Looking out at London.  He sees -- 

           BIG BEN.  CRUMBLING FROM THE GRAVITY.  TOPPLING OVER.  And
           it's not alone.  ALL OF THE CLASSIC STRUCTURES appear to be
           dissolving under the weight (While the newer retrofit
           buildings seem to be surviving.)  

                                 SIR JOHN
                        I love you Prudence.
           INT. WALK-IN-FREEZER - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           It's a tight fit.  And getting tighter.  Ren and Angel hoped
           the STEEL LINING of the Freezer wouldn't bend.  But it is. 
           Coming down.  Threatening to turn them into pancakes.  They
           already have the milk and eggs around.  It's COLD.  They
           hang onto each other for warmth.  And fear. 

           The AWFUL sound of metal tearing.  Piercing.  Like death
           screaming.  The roof is millimeters from killing them. 
           Closing in.  Ren and Angel have to lay down.  Angel cries. 
           Ren takes her hand.  Trying to give comfort.  As he has this
           whole night.  His whole life.      

           Confident.  That everything will turn out for the best.  And
           then...

           It ends.  

           Gravity resumes.  Returning to normal.  Ren and Angel catching
           FROSTED breath.  They survived.  Surrounded by EGGS.

           INT. GLENN MEMORIAL - ANN ARBOR - INTERCUT

           Gravity normal.  Olive feels her Mom's hand.  Suddenly cold.  

                                 OLIVE
                        Mommy?

           All the life drained out of her body.  Gone.  Dead.  Finally
           dead.  Olive looks in her hand to see:

           THE WEDDING RING.

           The Gravity slipped it off her mother's emaciated fingers. 
           Olive looks up.  Is this a sign?  A message?  From God? 
           From her mother?  She closes her mother's eyes (just like
           she did earlier with Little Dave.) And then -- gives her
           mother a kiss on her cheek...  

           EXT. WALK-IN-FREEZER - SHANGHAI - INTERCUT

           Ren takes one of the EGGS.  Finds his tape measure.  Closing
           one eye so he can get an accurate reading.  And then...

           His face breaking out into that wide, awkward grin.  He can't
           believe it.  Is this a miracle?  A message?  From God?  But
           there it is...  the tape measure coming into focus:     

                                 REN
                        49 mm.
           EXT. BBC - BROADCAST BOOTH - LONDON - DUSK

           Sir John looks at the destroyed city.  Watching as the sun
           dips below the horizon.  It's warm caress vanishing from his
           face.  Drenching him in darkness.

           EXT. REN'S HOUSE - TANGJIE VILLAGE - DAWN

           The HYUNDAI pulls up in the driveway.  Ren gets out of the
           car.  His SHOPPING BAG in hand.  Looking at:

           THE HOUSE.  Still standing.  Just as he said it would be. 
           As he hobbles up the driveway.  A father returning home from
           work.  He turns back to Angel --  

           She's hanging back.  Feels like she's intruding.  Ren just
           smiles.  

                                 REN
                        Invitation's still open for breakfast.

           EXT. END OF THE WORLD PARTY - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           OLIVE pushes her way through the mass of kids.  But it's not
           dying down as we near the final seconds.  It rages harder! 
           More kids.  More chaos.  The crowd's going to swallow her. 
           When Olive finds:     

           BIG DAVE and KAT.  Kissing.  Fingers intertwined.  A happy
           ending.  Olive hates to interrupt but --

                                 OLIVE
                        Where's Zeb?

           They can't hear Olive.  She makes a "Z" with her finger. 
           Kat points off.  Olive follows it to find:

           ZEB.  Sitting on his rock.

           Olive crosses to him.  Penitent.  Apologetic.  She talks. 
           BUT.  THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD -- we can't hear what she's saying. 
           And neither can Zeb.  He has to SCREAM:

                                 ZEB
                        WHAT?

           She tries to explain again.  But the music's too loud.  He
           jumps down off his rock.  Getting closer.  Olive has to scream
           in his ear.  Choosing her words carefully.      

                                 OLIVE
                        I chose to spend the day with you because
                        you're my best friend.  And I love you.

           CONTINUED:

           Olive presents her mother's wedding ring.  She doesn't want
           to scream it.  Her eyes speak louder than words.  MARRY ME?

           INT. REN'S BEDROOM - TANGJIE VILLAGE - DAWN

           Ren walks quietly into the dark bedroom -- looking at:

           HIS WIFE.  Lying asleep in their bed.  Ren's heart practically
           leaping out of his chest.  He walks over to his wife.  Giving
           her a kiss.  She stirs awake.  Smiling at him.  He gives
           another kiss.  She looks over at a bedside clock -- 

                                 WIFE
                        It's late...  everything okay?

                                 REN
                        Perfect.  

                                 WIFE
                        I think there were some earthquakes
                        last night.    

           Ren wonders.  Does she know?  If she does -- she's not saying
           anything.  Ren wants to pretend like it's all normal.  

                                 REN
                        It's fine.  Let's make breakfast.

           EXT. FOREST - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           Just like the beginning.  Olive runs through the Forest. 
           HAND in HAND with Zeb.  Splashing through mud puddles.  Until
           they reach.  The fork in the road.  This time.  Olive climbs
           up.  THE MORE DIFFICULT PATH.

           INT. REN'S KITCHEN - TANGJIE VILLAGE - DAWN

           START ON:  AN EGG.  Perfect.  White.  Slowly.  Rotating. 
           Adjust to discover -- it's not Ren holding the egg.  But:

           HIS SON.  13.  Carefully measuring the egg.  One eye closed. 
           Reading a tape measure.

                                 SON
                        This one's good.

           Ren and his Wife make breakfast.  Frying up fish in the wok. 
           Angel helps.  Making tea.  Outside the WINDOW -- we hear the
           OCEAN.  WAVES crashing.  Ren's Son measures another EGG.

                                 ANGEL
                        Why must the eggs be 49 mm?

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Ren's Son doesn't answer.  He cracks the final egg into the
           bowl.  Begins stirring.  Avoiding Angel's question. 

                                 WIFE
                        He doesn't do well with strangers.  

                                 REN
                        It's no an excuse.  We've been working
                        on this.  Right?

           And it's hard for Ren's Son but -- he puts down the bowl. 
           Attempting to look Angel in the eye -- 

                                 SON
                        49 is 7 squared.  7 is not only a prime. 
                        A Woodall prime.  A factorial prime.  A
                        lucky prime.  And a happy number.

                                 ANGEL
                        A happy number? 

                                 SON
                        The sum of the squares of the digits
                        eventually equals 1.  7 finds it's 1. 
                        It's never alone.  It's happy.

           Ren puts his strong, encouraging hand on his son's shoulder --
           This is what content looks like.  His tears are gone. 
           Frustration vanished.  Smile refusing to go away.

                                 WIFE
                        Thank you for taking my husband home.  

                                 ANGEL
                        My pleasure.

                                 WIFE
                        He's always going on about karma. 

                                 REN
                        She thinks I'm naive.

                                 WIFE
                        You are naive.  It's your finest quality.

           INT. CHURCH - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           Mr. Wingert sits in the pews.  Praying.  ANGELA slides in
           next to him.  Takes his hand.  We think she is going to catch
           a tremendous amount of shit for letting Olive go, but:  

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        Everything go okay with Olive? 

                                                  (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He knew?  But...?

                                 ANGELA
                        I still say you should have done it.  

                                 MR. WINGERT
                        I couldn't.

           It was his idea to let Olive go?

                                 ANGELA
                        You're a great father.  

           EXT. WATERFALL - ANN ARBOR - DAY

           Tremendous.  Cascading water ROARS over a CLIFF.  Falling
           200 feet into a BASIN POOL.  White mist everywhere.  SO LOUD
           you can barely hear anything else.     

           Olive and Zeb WADE ankle deep into the water.  Zeb takes
           Olive's Mother's RING.  Puts it on her finger.  Zeb leans in
           to kiss Olive.  Olive's tentative.  Giggles.  This is very
           very awkward.  Zeb's her best friend.  Zeb SQUARES Olive. 
           Taking control.  Like Olive suggested earlier.  Protective
           and strong and --   

           INT. REN'S KITCHEN - TANGJIE VILLAGE - DAWN

           Ren takes a bite of his omelet.  Chewing.  Watching as his
           family eats.  Steam rising from the eggs.  Hot and nourishing
           and yummy.  It makes you hungry just watching them eat.  

           Ren's wife leans over and gives him a KISS as:

           EXT. WATERFALL - INTERCUT

           Zeb leans in.  Gently KISSING Olive.  WHEN:

           GRAVITY SHIFTS.  LIGHTER.  THE NOISE STOPS.  THE WATERFALL --
           STOPS.  AS IF FROZEN.  And then -- 

           The water drops FLOAT UP -- into the air -- reversing
           direction -- toward heaven.  Glistening like CRYSTALS in the
           afternoon sun.  Reflecting on:

           Olive and Zeb.  Kiss.  Deeply.  Passionate.  And we realize -- 

           They're FLOATING.  FLYING.  Inches above the water. 
           Ascending.  Kissing.  Like two angels about to return home.
           INT. REN'S KITCHEN - DAWN

           The SUN rises over the OCEAN -- bathing the kitchen in LIGHT
           streaming through the window.  

                                 WIFE
                          (shielding her eyes)
                        So bright.

                                 REN
                        Here.

           Ren moves to the shade.  Taking a moment to look at his
           family.  Practically GLOWING in the morning light.  Like
           halos.  Outside the window -- we see the OCEAN begin to FLOAT
           UP INTO THE SKY... 

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO)
                        This is goodbye, my friends.  Thank you
                        for the indulgence.  Signing off.  

           Ren LOWERS THE SHADE.  Covering the window.  Blocking out
           the sun.  Like a curtain falling down on a stage.  

           BLACK.  

           AND WE HEAR THE BEGINNING HEARTBREAKING GUITAR CHORDS OF
           DANIEL JOHNSTON'S "TRUE LOVE WILL FIND YOU IN THE END."  
           Over Black we HEAR SIR JOHN BAINBRIDGE ON THE RADIO:   

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        What're...?  What're you doing here?

           We can't really hear WHO Bainbridge is talking to.  WHOEVER
           IT IS -- they are not close enough to the microphone.  

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        You came...  I don't believe it...

           His wife?  His brother?  His daughter?  It's left to the
           imagination.  Sir John's voice.  Sparkling with happiness:

                                 SIR JOHN (ON THE RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        It's wonderful to see you.

                              THE END.
