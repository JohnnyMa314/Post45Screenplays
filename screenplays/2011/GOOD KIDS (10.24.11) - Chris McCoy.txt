          "We  were  warriors  then,  and  our  tribe  was  strong  like  a  river."

           INT.  EVANS  HOME  -  CAPE  COD,  MASSACHUSETTS  -  LATE  NIGHT

           A  profoundly  quiet  evening  at  the  EVANS  HOME.  Breezes  blow. 
           Crickets  chirp.  Trees  rustle. 

           Despite  the  peaceful  evening,  MRS.  EVANS  (early  50s)  is  VERY 
           WORRIED.  She  is  sitting  on  a  WHITE  WICKER  CHAIR  in  a  room 
           filled  with  WICKER  FURNITURE,  looking  at  a  WICKER  CLOCK 
           hanging  on  the  wall.  It  is  4AM. 

           Her  husband  MR.  EVANS  is  equally  concerned. 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        This  really  isn’t  like  Andy.   

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        Three  months  ago  this  wouldn’t  have 
                        been  like  Andy.  Now  it’s  exactly 
                        like  Andy.  We  should  have  kept  a 
                        better  eye  on  him  this  summer. 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        He graduated.

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        He’s  still  under  our  roof!  Most  of 
                        the  time!  

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        I’m  going  to  call  him  again.  

           Mrs.  Evans  takes  a  BREATH  and  DIALS  A  NUMBER  on  her  phone. 

           EXT.  TOWN  DUMP  -  SAME  TIME

           BONFIRES  and  KEGS  dot  the  landscape  of  the  WOODS  HOLE  TOWN 
           DUMP.  PARTIERS  -  all  TEENAGERS  or  in  their  EARLY  TWENTIES  - 
           are  HOOKING  UP  next  to  RECYCLING  SHEDS  and  STACKS  of  TIRES.  

           Standing  in  the  middle  of  this  post-Apocalyptic  scene  is... 

           ANDY  EVANS

           Hero  of  our  story.  Eighteen  years  old.  On  a  normal  day,  he 
           would  be  unconventionally  handsome  in  a  young  John  Cusack 
           kind  of  way,  but  today  is  not  a  normal  day. 

           Right  now,  Andy  is  SHIRTLESS  and  covered  in  ULTIMATE  WARRIOR 
           FACE  PAINT.  Red  and  yellow  ARMBANDS  strain  against  his 
           UNDERDEVELOPED  MUSCLES. 

           Andy  is  nervously  staring  at  SOMETHING  SINISTER  APPROACHING 
           in  the  DISTANCE,  when  he  gets  a  CALL  on  his  CELL  PHONE. 

           He  looks  at  the  number.  Shit.  He  looks  at  the  number  of  times 
           the  number  has  called.  Twelve.  He  picks  up. 
                                 ANDY
                             (wincing;  into  phone)
                        Hi...  mom.  

           INT.  EVANS  HOME  -  SAME  TIME

           Mrs.  Evans  is  INCREDIBLY  RELIEVED  to  have  reached  her  son. 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        Andy!  It’s  four  in  the  morning! 
                        Where  are  you? 

           EXT.  TOWN  DUMP  -  SAME  TIME

           A  FIREWORK  BURSTS  out  of  a  BONFIRE,  sending  partiers  LEAPING 
           out  of  the  way.  The  firework  explodes  against  a  pile  of 
           PLASTIC  BAGS,  sending  them  up  in  FLAMES. 

           INTERCUT  the  conversation  between  Andy  and  Mrs.  Evans. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  am...  watching  a  movie. 

           We  see  what  Andy  has  been  STARING  AT  -  walking  towards  him 
           over  the  MOUNTAIN  OF  TRASH  is  a  MOB  of  MIDDLE-AGED  MEN,  all 
           of  whom  looked  UNBELIEVABLY  PISSED. 

                                 MIDDLE-AGED  MAN
                        Time  to  die,  Andy! 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        Did  someone  just  say  ‘time  to  die?’    

           Andy  glances  at  friends  NORA  and  SPICE,  both  of  whom  are 
           deranged  from  partying  but  sober  enough  to  know  Andy  is  dead. 

                                 ANDY
                        Mom.  You  know  I’ve  never 
                        disappointed  you  before... 

                                                            OVER  BLACK:

           CAPTION:  TWELVE  WEEKS  EARLIER. 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           EXT.  WOODS  HOLE,  MASSACHUSETTS  -  SPRING  NIGHT. 

           The  Cape  Cod  hamlet  of  Woods  Hole  is  known  for  two  things: 

           It’s  the  home  of  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution 
           (i.e.  WHOI),  the  research  center  from  which  the  sub  that 
           discovered  the  Titanic  was  launched. 
           It’s  also  a  town  where  WEALTHY  SUMMER  PEOPLE  catch  the  ferry 
           to  Martha’s  Vineyard  or  Nantucket,  as  well  as  the  place  where 
           the  EVEN  MORE  WEALTHY  have  their  SUMMER  HOUSES. 

           But  for  the  moment,  we’re  only  dealing  with  locals,  because 
           this  is  the  evening  of  the... 

           INT.  WOODS  HOLE  HIGH  SCHOOL  AUDITORIUM  -  SAME  TIME

           ...Woods  Hole  High  School  graduation. 

           The  auditorium  is  packed.  The  front  of  the  room  has  been 
           outfitted  with  a  makeshift  STAGE,  in  front  of  which  sit  the 
           GRADUATING  SENIORS  of  Woods  Hole  High. 

           FOUR  CLEAN-CUT  SENIORS  -  sitting  together  -  are  holding  piles 
           of  AWARDS  on  their  laps  (English  Student  of  the  Year,  Highest 
           GPA,  Attendance  Record,  etc.)  The  TOP  of  the  class: 

           NORA  SULLIVAN  (18),  a  blonde  late-bloomer.  Whip  smart.  Over 
           the  course  of  the  next  three  months  she  will  become  a  beauty.  

           LIONEL  “THE  LION”  MILLER  (18),  academic  with  an  unexpectedly 
           well-muscled  body. 

           MIKE  “SPICE”  JENNINGS  (18),  friendly  and  slightly  portly. 

           And  ANDY  (18),  dressed  more  conservatively  than  he  was  when 
           we  met  him  before.  The  Ultimate  Warrior  facepaint  thing  won’t 
           be  happening  for  a  couple  of  months.     

           The  friends  make  eye  contact  with  their  PARENTS,  who  we  will 
           meet  in  a  bit.  School  principal  MR.  BRINKLEY  stands  on  stage, 
           at  the  podium: 

                                 PRINCIPAL  BRINKLEY
                        The  final  award  we  give  out  is  our 
                        “Roll  of  Honor”  Award,  which  goes 
                        to  the  student  who  best  exemplifies 
                        the  virtues  of  academic  excellence, 
                        loyalty  and  service  to  his  class. 
                        And  this  year’s  recipient  is... 
                             (beat)
                        ...Andy  Evans. 

           Andy’s  friends  applaud,  happy  for  him.  He  heads  to  the  stage 
           to  collect  his  award.  He  SHAKES  HANDS  with  the  Principal. 

                                 PRINCIPAL  BRINKLEY
                             (low)
                        You  and  your  friends  could  have 
                        saved  some  awards  for  the  rest  of 
                        the  class... 
                                 ANDY
                        We  worked  harder.

           INT.  ANDY’S  BUICK  -  NIGHT

           Andy,  Nora,  Spice  and  the  Lion  sit  in  Andy’s  enormous  1982 
           Buick  LeSabre,  parked  outside  of  a  7-11.  They’re  still 
           wearing  their  GRADUATION  ROBES. 

           They  are  drinking  SLURPEES  and  watching  DRUNK  CLASSMATES 
           making  snack  runs.  One  drunk  classmate  spots  them  and  LAUGHS. 

                                 DRUNK  CLASSMATE
                        Extra  large  slurpees!  I  don’t  care 
                        what  people  say  -  you  do know  how 
                        to  party. 

                                 SPICE
                        I  hate  this  town. 

                                 NORA
                        We’ll  be  gone  by  Labor  Day. 

           For  the  first  time  we  hear  THE  LION  speak  -  he  has  a 
           pronounced  SPEECH  IMPEDIMENT. 

                                 THE  LION
                             (lisp)
                        Are  you  shure  that’s  the  holiday  at 
                        the  end  of  the  shummer?  Or  is  that 
                        Memorial  Day.  I  get  them  mixed  up. 

                                 SPICE
                        You  understand  String  Theory  but 
                        forget  holidays.  You’re  like  Will 
                        Hunting  mixed  with  one  of  my 
                        demented  aunts. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Will  Hunting  didn’t  have  a  black 
                        belt.  

                                 SPICE
                        Will  Hunting  could  kick  the  crap 
                        out  of  you.  All  he  did  every  day 
                        was  solve  math  problems  and  work  in 
                        construction. 

                                 THE  LION
                        It’s  insane  you  guys  conflate 
                        mushculature  with  fighting  ability. 

                                 SPICE
                        Ok  -  how  would  you  beat  up  Will 
                        Hunting-slash-Matt  Damon? 
                                 THE  LION
                        Have  you  sheen  Matt  Damon’s  legs? 
                        Chicken  legs.  You  could  pop  out  his 
                        kneecap  with  a  Low  Thai  Kick,  not 
                        that  I  would  unlesh  he  was  putting 
                        shomeone’s  life  in  danger.   

                                 NORA
                        I  can’t  believe  you’ve  thought 
                        about  how  to  beat  up  Matt  Damon. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  watched  Talented  Mr.  Ripley.  I’m 
                        telling  you,  his  weaknesh  is  his 
                        knees. 

           Andy  is  quiet,  thinking  about  something. 

                                 THE  LION
                        You’re  brooding  shilently,  Andy.  

                                 ANDY
                        Did  we  really  not  get  invited  to 
                        any  parties  on  graduation  night? 

                                 NORA
                        If  you  miss  every  party  for  four 
                        years  straight,  you  don’t  get 
                        invited  to  the  last  one. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  know,  but  I  figured  graduation  is 
                        something  you  go  through  together, 
                        so  afterwards  it  makes  sense  you-

                                 SPICE
                        I  think  we  traded  cool  for  college. 

                                 ANDY
                        Are  we  going  to  do  anything  else 
                        tonight,  or  is  it  just  slurpees?

                                 SPICE
                        We  could  go  to  Midgetville. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  not  going  all  the  way  to 
                        Midgetville  tonight...  

                                 NORA
                        I  can’t  do  anything.  I  have  to  be 
                        at  the  lab  early  tomorrow. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  teaching  a  shelf-defense  for 
                        kids  clash  in  the  morning. 
                                 SPICE
                        I’m  making  food  for  a  gay  wedding. 

                                 ANDY
                        And  I  have  to  teach  tennis.  We  all 
                        have  things  to  do  tomorrow,  but 
                        this  is  our  graduation  night! 

                                 THE  LION
                        What  were  you  expecting  would 
                        happen? 

                                 ANDY
                        I  don’t  know.  Something  cool. 

           Andy  starts  the  car. 

           INT.  EVANS  HOME  -  ANDY’S  BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

           Andy’s  graduation  robe  is  on  the  ground.  He  sits  in  front  of 
           his  computer  reading  an  EMAIL  from  a  girl  named  DANYA.  The 
           email  is  in  imperfect  English,  but  we  get  the  point:  

                 I hope I can see you but I need money to come...     
                 Visiting  America  is  a  dream!  Here  is  picture  of  
                 graduation! 

           Andy  OPENS  the  picture,  which  shows  a  STUNNINGLY  PRETTY 
           INDIAN  GIRL  in  CAP  and  GOWN  graduating  from  her  HIGH  SCHOOL  - 
           think  a  young  Aishwarya  Rai.    

           Andy  STARES  at  the  photo.  She’s  so  hot.  He  begins  to  TYPE  an 
           EMAIL  BACK:  Congratulations!  I’m  determined  to  find  a  way  to 
           help  you  visit  this  summer... 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           SNAPSHOTS  OF  SUMMER  PEOPLE  ARRIVING  ON  THE  CAPE

           MUSIC  CUE:  “Whistle  Samba”  by  Luiz  Bonfa  &  Maria  Helena 
           Toledo. 

           -  OLD  MANSIONS  line  the  shoreline  of  PENZANCE  POINT,  the  most 
           expensive  real  estate  on  the  Cape.  There  is  nothing  McMansion 
           about  these  houses  -  these  are  OLD  MONEY,  blue  blood 
           playgrounds  for  the  elite  of  Boston  and  New  York.   

           -  LEXUS  SUVs  pull  into  the  DRIVEWAYS  of  these  houses.  Doors 
           open  and  TOW-HEADED  CHILDREN  pile  out,  followed  by  their 
           PARENTS  -  country-club  stylish  WASPS. 

           -  WINDOWS  are  thrown  open.  GOLF  BAGS  are  carried  into 
           garages.  AMERICAN  FLAGS  are  raised  up  flagpoles.  BOATS  are 
           TETHERED  to  DOCKS.  Polo  shirt  COLLARS  are  POPPED. 

           The  Summer  People  have  arrived!  
           EXT.  OCEAN  VIEW  COUNTRY  CLUB  -  MORNING

           An  old-school  Cape  Cod  country  club.  Eight  TENNIS  COURTS,  a 
           GOLF  COURSE,  a  small  RESTAURANT  and  a  CLUBHOUSE  where  the 
           PROS  have  their  office.

           Andy  has  arrived  FIRST  at  the  courts  to  get  them  ready  for 
           the  day.  He  is  wearing  his  TENNIS  WHITES  and  a  BLUE  HEADBAND. 

           [Note:  This  is  the  outfit  he  is  ALWAYS  IN  when  doing  anything 
           tennis-related.  It  is  the  STANDARD  UNIFORM  for  ALL  the  PROS.] 

           He  uses  a  hand-pushed  ROLLER  APPARATUS  to  ROLL  a  CLAY  COURT. 
           He  tacks  a  LESSON  SCHEDULE  to  an  ANNOUNCEMENT  BOARD  outside. 

           INT.  OCEAN  VIEW  COUNTRY  CLUB  OFFICE  -  LATER

           Inside  the  clubhouse,  Andy  puts  a  new  WATER  TANK  on  the 
           BUBBLER.  He  SWEEPS  the  FLOOR.  He  pulls  HOPPERS  of  TENNIS 
           BALLS  out  of  the  CLOSET.  He  makes  a  pot  of  COFFEE. 

           Andy  is  pouring  himself  COFFEE  when  the  HEAD  PRO  walks  in. 
           This  is  YACO  (mid  30s,  Spanish). 

           Yaco  is  long-haired  and  exotic,  with  an  athletic  build  and 
           shirts  one  size  too  small.  He’s  also  wearing  a  BLUE  HEADBAND. 
           He’s  basically  the  tennis  coach  version  of  Inigo  Montoya. 

           Yaco  takes  the  COFFEE  that  Andy  had  poured  for  himself,  adds 
           a  TON  OF  SUGAR  and  DRINKS  IT.  Andy  SIGHS. 

                                 YACO
                             (accent)
                        Hello  Andy. 

                                 ANDY
                        Yaco. 

                                 YACO
                        Have  you  been  looking  forward  to 
                        another  summer  together  as  much  as 
                        I  have?  Last  year,  you  were  only  a 
                        janitor. 

                                 ANDY
                        Groundskeeper. 

                                 YACO
                        ...But  this  year  you  are  a  pro. You 
                        realize  this  could  only  happen  with 
                        my  blessing.  You  are  my  apostle, 
                        and  I  am  your  Christ.  

                                 ANDY
                        That  seems  hyperbolic,  but  I 
                        appreciate  you  putting  in  a  word 
                        with  the  board.  
                                 YACO
                        After  lunch,  you  are  teaching  the 
                        Beginner  Ladies  classes.  Salvatore 
                        will  be  handling  the  men. 

                                 ANDY
                        Any  tips? 

                                 YACO
                        Don’t  let  the  women  chat  with  each 
                        other.  Once  they  start,  they  learn 
                        nothing.  They  are  like  children, 
                        but  worse  at  tennis.  

           INT.  WOODS  HOLE  OCEANOGRAPHIC  INSTITUTION  -  LATE  MORNING 

           The  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution  is  a  famous  research 
           lab  teeming  with  SCIENTISTS,  POST-DOCTORATE  STUDENTS  and 
           GRADUATE  STUDENTS  from  all  over  the  world. 

           The  labs  are  WELL-SUPPLIED  but  FUNKY  -  everywhere,  there  are 
           tanks  of  WEIRD  FISH  and  SEA  URCHINS.  Nora  is  wearing  a  LAB 
           COAT  and  GLOVES,  and  is  HUDDLED  over  a  MICROSCOPE. 

           She  peeks  over  her  microscope  at  a  BLONDE  POST-GRADUATE 
           student  putting  on  his  own  LAB  COAT.  This  is  ERLAND  (30, 
           handsome).  He’s  Swedish.  He  smiles  at  her.  She  smiles  back.  

           INT.  KARATE  DOJO  -  LATE  MORNING

           Yah!  A  LITTLE  GIRL  (8)  throws  a  PUNCH  in  her  KARATE  CLASS. 

           THE  LION  is  teaching  the  class,  walking  among  the  PRACTICING 
           KIDS  in  his  MARTIAL  ARTS  UNIFORM.  His  attitude  with  the  kids 
           is  FAKE-SERIOUS  -  he  enjoys  his  job,  and  they  love  him. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Punch!  In  the  post-apocalyptic 
                        future  in  which  we  shurvive  by 
                        eating  cats  and  the  elderly,  you 
                        will  need  to  know  how  to  punch! 

           The  KIDS  have  a  hard  time  not  SMILING,  which  Lion  NOTICES. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Shtop  shmiling!  In  the  future, 
                        shmiling  will  be  sheen  as  a  sign 
                        you  have  given  up  on  life  and  wish 
                        to  be  eaten! 

           The  Lion  looks  at  the  kids’  PARENTS,  who  are  waiting  on  the 
           other  side  of  the  DOJO  WINDOW  to  pick  up  their  kids.  The  Lion 
           looks  at  the  CLOCK.  It  clicks  NOON. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Hai! 
           All  the  kids  STOP  PUNCHING.  The  Lion  BOWS  and  they  BOW  BACK. 

                                 KIDS
                        Arigato  gozaimasu  Sensei!

           SUBTITLE:  THANK  YOU  SENSEI! 

                                 THE  LION
                        As  a  parting  thought,  remember  - 
                        “The  prickliest  cactus  can  still 
                        give  you  water.”  Clash  dismished. 

           The  kids  go  RUNNING  for  the  DOOR.  The  LITTLE  GIRL  we  saw  at 
           the  beginning  of  the  scene  gets  the  Lion’s  ATTENTION. 

                                 LITTLE  GIRL
                        What  did  that  cactus  thing  mean? 

           A  HIGH  SCHOOL  GIRL  waits  for  the  Little  Girl  to  get  done  with 
           her  question,  amused.  This  is  TINSLEY  (18,  preppy-cute). 

                                 THE  LION
                        What  do  you  think  it  means? 

                                 LITTLE  GIRL
                        Something  scary  can  be  good? 

                                 THE  LION
                        That’s  exactly  right.  You  shouldn’t 
                        be  afraid  of  shomething  for  the  way 
                        it  looks,  because  it  might  be 
                        shpecial  inshide. 

           The  Little  Girl  is  VERY  PROUD  of  herself  as  she  runs  to 
           TINSLEY.  The  Lion  NOTICES  her. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Olive,  are  you  shure  you  know  this 
                        woman? 

                                 LITTLE  GIRL
                        She’s  my  cousin! 

                                 THE  LION
                        Just  making  shure.  Rival  dojos  are 
                        trying  to  steal  my  students  all  the 
                        time  because  you’re  the  best. 

                                 TINSLEY
                        I’m  Tinsley.  Olive’s  mom  asked  me 
                        to  pick  her  up. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  the  Lion. 

                                 TINSLEY
                        You’re  not  “The  Lion.” 
                                 LITTLE  GIRL
                        He is the  Lion! 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  wouldn’t  lie  to  children. 
                             (beat)
                        I  haven’t  sheen  you  before. 

                                 TINSLEY
                        I  come  to  Woods  Hole  every  summer. 
                        I  haven’t  seen  you  before. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  local. 

                                 TINSLEY
                        I  don’t  know  if  I’ve  ever  met  a 
                        local. 

                                 THE  LION
                        They  hide  us  during  the  shummer  so 
                        we  don’t  upset  the  tourists. 

                                 LITTLE  GIRL
                        The  Lion  should  come  to  your  party! 

           Tinsley  gives  the  Little  Girl  a  LOOK.   

                                 THE  LION
                             (kidding)
                        Uh-oh.  Am  I  not  shupposed  to  know 
                        about  the  party? 

                                 TINSLEY
                        Olive  isn’t  supposed  to  know  about 
                        it.  
                             (beat)
                        But  yes,  I’m  having  a  party  at  my 
                        parents’  place  on  Penzance  Point. 
                        You  should  come.  

                                 THE  LION
                        You  have  a  house  on  Penzance  Point? 

                                 TINSLEY
                        Number  forty-four.  It  starts  at 
                        ten.  Bring  whoever  you  want.  
                             (beat;  to  Little  Girl)
                        And  you  need  to  stop  talking  about 
                        it!  I’ll  get  you  an  ice  cream  to 
                        buy  your  silence. 

                                 LITTLE  GIRL
                        Okay... 

                                 TINSLEY
                        See  you  tonight,  Lion.  
           Tinsley  walks  away  holding  the  little  girl’s  hand. 

           EXT.  WATER  STREET,  WOODS  HOLE  -  LUNCH  TIME

           Andy,  Nora  and  the  Lion  walk  down  Water  Street,  Woods  Hole’s 
           “downtown”  area.  Around  them,  TOURISTS  crowd  the  road.  BOATS 
           sail  around  a  salt  water  pound  nearby. 

           Andy  has  on  his  TENNIS  WHITES,  while  Nora  has  the  imprint  of 
           her  laboratory  SAFETY  GOGGLES  on  her  FACE.  The  Lion  looks 
           like  he’s  about  to  EXPLODE. 

                                 ANDY
                        Do  you  have  something  to  say? 
                        You’re  acting  weird. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’ll  tell  everybody  when  we’re 
                        eating. 
                             (beat)
                        Have  you  heard  from  your  imaginary 
                        Indian  pen  pal? 

                                 ANDY
                        She  wants  to  visit  in  August.  It’s 
                        a  couple  thousand  dollars  to  get 
                        here  from  Mumbai  in  the  summer,  so 
                        I’m  going  to  figure  out  a  way  to 
                        help  her  out.  Somehow. 

                                 THE  LION
                        How  did  you  meet  her  again? 

                                 ANDY
                        She’s  also  an  econ  nerd.  She  leaves 
                        comments  on  a  website  I  read,  and  I 
                        wrote  her  to  say  I  liked  her  ideas. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  can’t  believe  you  have  to  wait 
                        three  months  to  be  murdered  by  a 
                        bearded  50-year-old  sherial  killer. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  can’t  wait  to  see  your  face  at 
                        the  end  of  summer  when  I’m  hooking 
                        up  with  a  hot  Indian  girl  on  the 
                        beach  while  you’re  practicing 
                        Ninjitsu  in  your  basement. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Firsht  of  all,  you  don’t  practice 
                        Ninjitsu  in  your  basement.  Ninjitsu 
                        is  a  form  of  Japanese  eshpionage. 
                        Shecond  of-
                                 NORA
                        -Are  you  going  to  tell  her  you’re  a 
                        virgin? 

                                 ANDY
                        Easy  now! 

                                 NORA
                        I  just  think  it’s  weird  to  lose 
                        your  virginity  to  a  girl  you’ve 
                        never  met.  Plus,  she  has  more 
                        experience  than  you. 

                                 ANDY
                        How  do  you  know  she  has  more 
                        experienced  than  me? 

                                 NORA
                        Under  what  scenario  could  she  not 
                        have  more  experience  than  you? 

                                 THE  LION
                        Plush,  the  Indians  have  the  Kama 
                        Shutra. 

                                 NORA
                        Exactly.  Indians  have  the  Kama 
                        Sutra.  That  would  be  intimidating 
                        for  anybody. 

           Andy  thinks  about  this.  He  seems  a  little  DISTURBED.  Nora  and 
           the  Lion  turn  down  a  side  street  and  enter  BRASSERIE  BLEU. 

           INT.  BRASSERIE  BLEU  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           A  simply  decorated  restaurant.  A  few  tables,  some  nice 
           pictures  of  the  Loire  Valley  on  the  walls.  

           The  restaurant  isn’t  open  yet  -  a  couple  of  SERVERS  are 
           rolling  SILVERWARE  while  another  is  checking  the  WINE  STOCK  - 
           but  Andy,  Nora  and  the  Lion  are  sitting  around  a  table. 

           Nora  is  wearing  a  T-shirt  that  seems  a  LITTLE  TOO  TIGHT. 
           She’s  adjusting  it,  clearly  a  little  uncomfortable. 

                                 ANDY
                        Did  that  shirt  shrink  in  the  wash 
                        or  something? 

                                 NORA
                        I  don’t  think  so...  I  wear  it  all 
                        the time.   

           SPICE  walks  out  of  the  KITCHEN  wearing  his  CHEF’S  JACKET, 
           holding  two  plates  of  finely  prepared  BISTRO  SANDWICHES  and 
           puts  them  down  in  front  of  his  friends.  He  joins  them.  
                                 SPICE
                        Something  I’m  playing  with.

                                 ANDY
                        I  can’t  believe  you  can  make  this. 

                                 SPICE
                        If  I  can’t  impress  my  friends,  I’ll 
                        never  be  able  to  impress  the  Food 
                        Network  viewers  at  home.

                                 THE  LION
                        Alright!  I’ve  been  waiting  until  we 
                        were  all  together  to  bring  this  up, 
                        but...  I.  Have.  Information. 

                                 ANDY
                        About  what? 

                                 THE  LION
                        A  party  on  Penzance  Point! To be 
                        specific,  I  have  an  invitation  to a 
                        party  on  Penzance  point...  and  I 
                        can  bring  anyone  I  want. 

                                 SPICE
                        Who  invited  you to a party on 
                        Penzance  Point? 

                                 THE  LION
                        Cousin  of  a  pupil.  Shummer  girl. 
                        And  it’s  not  just  me  -  we  are  all 
                        invited  to  the  party. 

                                 NORA
                        I  don’t  even  think  I’ve  been  on 
                        Penzance  Point. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  have.  There’s  nobody  at  the  guard 
                        station  in  January  and  February. 

                                 NORA
                        Nobody  around  to  guard. 

                                 ANDY
                        Are  you  sure  this  is  true?  We  got 
                        invited  to  a  party? 

                                 THE  LION
                        It’s  real  and  it  shtarts  at  ten. 

                                 ANDY
                        Holy  shit.  I’m  in. 

                                 SPICE
                        I’m  out  of  here  at  eleven  so  I’ll 
                        definitely  go. 
                                 NORA
                        My  curfew  is  midnight,  so  I’m  not 
                        sure... 

                                 ANDY
                        No  way  are  you  missing  this. 

                                 NORA
                        My  parents  are  strict  about  curfew. 

                                 ANDY
                        You’re  going  to  Harvard.  The  point 
                        of  curfews  is  to  make  sure  we  don’t 
                        screw  up,  and  technically,  we’ve 
                        succeeded  in  that  department. 
                             (beat)
                        What  would  happen  if  you  broke 
                        curfew,  Lion?  Now  that  you’re  going 
                        to  MIT.  On  scholarship.  

                                 THE  LION
                        My  parents  don’t  get  home  until 
                        four  in  the  morning  most  weekends. 
                        I’m  shtarting  to  think  they’re 
                        shwingers. 

                                 ANDY
                        Stanford-bound  Spice?  You? 

                                 THE  LION
                        They’d  just  think  I  was  still  at 
                        the  restaurant.  I’ve  been  here 
                        until  two  before. 

                                 ANDY
                        Perfect.  And  these  are  rich  kids, 
                        right?  Which  means  the  party  is 
                        going  to  be  well-stocked. 

                                 THE  LION
                        What  are  you  shuggesting?  

                                 ANDY
                        I  say  that  -  starting  tonight  - 
                        everything  we  didn’t  do  in  high 
                        school,  we  do  this  summer.  
                             (beat)
                        The  reason  we  never  partied  in  high 
                        school  is  we  wanted  to  get  out  of 
                        here.  And  now  we  are.  But  I  feel 
                        like  I  missed  out  on  some 
                        experiences,  and  I  know  you  guys  do 
                        too.  So  let’s  have  them. 

           Everybody  looks  at  each  other. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  might  be  into  that. 
                                 SPICE
                        You  could  definitely  argue  we’ve 
                        earned  it.  

                                 ANDY
                        Nora...

                                 NORA
                             (beat)
                        Fine.  I’m  in  too. 

                                 ANDY
                             (grins)
                        Starting  tonight,  this  is  the 
                        Summer  of  Yes. 

           EXT.  OCEAN  VIEW  COUNTRY  CLUB  -  AFTERNOON

           Andy  is  back  at  the  TENNIS  COURTS,  this  time  teaching  a 
           LESSON  to  a  gaggle  of  chatty  WOMEN  (late  30s-40s). 

           The  women  are  STYLISH  in  the  season’s  expensive  outfits,  but 
           they  are  HORRIBLE  TENNIS  PLAYERS.  Uncoordinated.  Putting  BALL 
           after  BALL  into  the  NET  or  over  the  FENCE.  Just  fucking  make-
           your-eyes-bleed  terrible.  

           Andy  is  FEEDING  balls  to  the  women  from  the  opposite  side  of 
           the  court,  INSTRUCTING  them  on  what  to  do. 

                                 ANDY
                        Low  to  high!  Good.  Here  you  go 
                        Gabby  -  remember  to  set  your  body. 

           He  feeds  a  ball  to  the  pretty  GABBY  (early  40s),  who  takes  a 
           hard  SWING  and  sends  it  FLYING  into  a  DISTANT  PARKING  LOT. 

                                 ANDY
                        Better! 

           LATER...

           The  lesson  is  over.  Andy  is  using  a  HOPPER  to  pick  up  loose 
           TENNIS  BALLS  on  the  court,  while  the  WOMEN  are  putting  away 
           their  RACQUETS  and  drinking  from  WATER  BOTTLES.   

           Gabby  and  her  friend  KAREN  (39)  are  drinking  GATORADE  and 
           looking  at  ANDY,  messing  with  him  in  a  playful  way. 

                                 GABBY
                        Andy,  when  did  you  turn  eighteen? 

                                 ANDY
                        January.  

                                 KAREN
                        You  know  that’s  the  drinking  age  in 
                        most  of  the  world. 
                                 ANDY
                        I  should  have  been  born  foreign. 

                                 GABBY
                        Being  a  tennis  pro  automatically 
                        makes  you  foreign.  Come  get  drinks 
                        with  us.  

                                 ANDY
                             (laughs)
                        Maybe  next  time,  ladies... 

           Gabby  gives  Karen  a  LOOK. 

                                 KAREN
                             (low)
                        You’re  not...

                                 GABBY
                        I’m  thinking  about  it.  
                             (beat)
                        Andy!  Do  you  do  private  lessons? 

                                 ANDY
                        Don’t  all  pros? 

                                 GABBY
                        In  my  experience.

           INT.  ANDY’S  ROOM  -  NIGHT

           Andy  is  getting  ready  to  go  out,  IRONING  his  JEANS  and  T-
           SHIRT.  He’s  VERY  NERVOUS  about  the  party.  Every  now  and  then, 
           he  glances  over  at  his  COMPUTER,  where  he  has  his  GMAIL  open. 

           An  email  from  Danya  pops  up,  and  he  hustles  over  to  open  it: 

                Dear  Andy!  I  hope  you  are  well!  My  family  is  at  the  beach
                now! It is hot is but I did buy a new swimsuit! 

           Andy  opens  the  FILE  attached  to  the  email,  and  a  picture  of 
           Danya  standing  on  a  beach  in  a  PURE  WHITE  SWIMSUIT  pops  up. 
           She  is  ridiculously  hot. 

           Andy  checks  to  make  sure  that  his  door  is  LOCKED  and  then 
           SITS  DOWN  in  front  of  the  picture  for  some  deeper 
           consideration.  He  unbuttons  his  JEANS. 

           INT.  ANDY’S  BUICK  -  NIGHT

           Andy  and  his  friends  are  en  route  to  the  party.  They’re  all 
           NERVOUS,  and  everybody  looks  spiffier  than  they  normally  do  - 
           Spice  has  combed  his  hair,  the  Lion  has  the  pink  cheeks  of  a 
           man  freshly  shaven. 
           Nora  looks  best  of  all.  She’s  put  on  a  little  bit  of  MAKEUP 
           and  is  wearing  a  cute  MINI-DRESS...  which  once  again  seems  a 
           bit  TOO  TIGHT  around  the  TOP,  which  she’s  trying  to  ADJUST. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  shorry,  I  can’t  get  this  out  of 
                        my  head  -  there’s  a  nine  hour  time 
                        difference  between  here  and  Mumbai, 
                        correct?  And  today’s  Shaturday, 
                        which  means  it’s  Shunday  morning  in 
                        India. 

                                 ANDY
                        Okay...  

                                 THE  LION
                        All  I’m  asking  is  why  Danya  would 
                        be  shending  bikini  pictures  to  you 
                        at shix  in  the  morning  on a 
                        Shunday.

                                 ANDY
                        She  told  me  she’s  an  insomniac. 
                        It’s  not  unusual  for  her  to  email 
                        me  late. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  promish  you,  you’re  talking  to  a 
                        guy  in  his  attic  in  Worcester, 
                        wearing  clown  makeup. 

           Andy  pulls  the  car  down  a  street  marked  PRIVATE  ROAD  / 
           PENZANCE  POINT.  Through  the  windshield,  we  can  see  the  OCEAN 
           and  the  lights  of  houses  on  the  POINT  straight  ahead.  

           EXT.  GUARD  STATION  -  CONTINUOUS

           Andy  stops  the  car  in  front  of  a  small  SHED  in  which  a 
           SECURITY  GUARD  is  watching  a  SMALL  TELEVISION. 

           The  guard  gets  out  of  his  chair  holding  a  CLIPBOARD  and  walks 
           to  the  driver-side  window,  looking  over  the  Buick.  The 
           crappiness  of  Andy’s  car  clearly  makes  the  guard  suspicious.  

                                 THE  LION
                        We’re  going  to  Tinsley’s  party, 
                        number  forty-four.  The  name  should 
                        be  under  “The  Lion.” 

                                 SECURITY  GUARD
                        Very  funny.  Turn  around. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Check  your  clipboard! 

           The  Security  Guard  checks  his  guest  clipboard  -  sure  enough, 
           on  one  of  the  lines  is  scrawled  The  Lion.   
           EXT.  PENZANCE  POINT  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  drives  the  car  down  the  road  cutting  through  the  middle 
           of  Penzance  Point.  ENORMOUS  HOUSES  line  either  side  of  the 
           road  -  wooden  mansions  built  a  hundred  years  ago. 

           This  is  totally  unlike  where  Andy  and  his  friends  live. 

           Aside  from  their  size,  what  stands  out  about  the  houses  is 
           the  amount  of  property they  have  -  huge  manicured  lawns, 
           dotted  with  lush  gardens,  tennis  courts  and  swimming  pools.   

                                 NORA
                        This  is  incredible. 

                                 SPICE
                        I’m  thinking  that’s  the  place.  

           An  ENORMOUS  HOUSE  sits  at  the  end  of  a  LONG  DRIVEWAY  that  is 
           PACKED  with  PARKED  CARS.  PARTIERS  are  spilling  out  the  LAWN 
           and  LOUD  MUSIC  is  filtering  out  into  the  night. 

           Andy  parks  at  the  end  of  the  drive  and  looks  at  his  friends.

                                 ANDY
                        Here  we  go. 

           EXT.  PENZANCE  MANSION  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy,  Nora,  Spice  and  Lion  walk  down  the  ENDLESS  DRIVEWAY, 
           past  the  PARKED  CARS  -  BMWs,  Mercedes,  Lexus  SUVs.  PARTIERS 
           are  hanging  out  on  the  LAWN,  smoking  CIGARETTES  and  DRINKING. 

           [Note:  All  the  kids  at  the  party  are  about  eighteen.  It’s  not 
           a  college  party,  it’s  a  party  for  kids  who  just  graduated 
           high  school,  and  perhaps  kids  one  or  two  years  YOUNGER.]  

           Andy  and  his  friends  reach  a  WRAPAROUND  PORCH  packed  with 
           revelers.  Everybody  is  WELL  DRESSED  -  not  quite  preppy, but 
           the  clothes  are  nicer  than  they  would  be  at  a  normal  (read: 
           public  school)  party. 

           Andy  gets  the  attention  of  a  PARTIER  talking  to  a  GIRL. 

                                 ANDY
                             (enthusiastically)
                        Hey  man,  where  are  the  drinks?  

           The  partier  wordlessly  points  at  the  house  with  his  cigarette 
           - in  there,  idiot  -  and  goes  back  to  talking  to  his  girl. 

                                 NORA
                        I  probably  could  have  told  you 
                        that. 
           INT.  PENZANCE  MANSION  -  CONTINUOUS

           The  inside  of  the  mansion  is  as  stunning  as  the  outside.  This 
           is an old  house,  built  with  no  cost  spared  in  the  1800s,  and 
           the  interior  reflects  the  time  period  in  which  it  was  built. 

           The  floors,  walls  and  railings  have  all  been  built  with  FINE 
           WOOD  and  FIREPLACES  are  everywhere.  The  furniture  is  ANTIQUE, 
           the  RUGS  are  PERSIAN,  the  family  photos  are  BLACK  &  WHITE. 

           And  in  this  majestic  setting  are  hordes  of  DRUNK  RICH 
           TEENAGERS.  They’re  smoking  JOINTS,  MAKING  OUT  and  sneaking 
           off  UPSTAIRS  and  to  GUEST  BEDROOMS.  Many  of  the  partiers  seem 
           to  already  KNOW  each  other. 

           Andy  and  his  friends  get  some  LOOKS  as  they  enter. 

                                 SPICE
                        They  can  tell  we  don’t  belong. 

                                 ANDY
                        We  just  look  suspicious  because  we 
                        don’t  have  drinks  in  our  hands. 

           INT.  KITCHEN  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           The  kitchen  is  expensive.  Stainless  steel  everything,  copper 
           burners.  Like  something  out  of  a  Nancy  Meyers  movie.

           But  right  now  it’s  just  being  used  to  hold  TONS  OF  BOOZE. 
           Every  liquor  imaginable  is  sitting  on  top  of  the  GRANITE 
           COUNTERTOP,  while  a  CHEST  of  BEER  sits  nearby. 

           Andy,  Nora,  Spice  and  the  Lion  stare  at  the  offerings,  not 
           quite  sure  how  to  approach. 

           Andy  makes  the  first  move,  walking  to  the  counter  and  starts 
           pouring  himself  a  GLASS  of  STRAIGHT  VODKA. 

                                 SPICE
                        What  are  you  doing? 

                                 ANDY
                        I  have  no  idea. 

           Nora,  Spice  and  the  Lion  shrug  at  each  other,  step  up  and  DO 
           THE  SAME,  pouring  HUGE  GLASSES  of  GIN,  TEQUILA  and  SCOTCH.  A 
           couple  PARTIERS  hanging  out  by  the  FRIDGE  look  on,  IMPRESSED. 

                                 KITCHEN  PARTIER
                        Those  guys  are  hardcore. 

           Andy  holds  up  his  GLASS  to  make  a  TOAST. 

                                 ANDY
                        Starting  tonight.  Say  yes  to 
                        everything.  
           The  friends  CLINK  glasses  and  GULP  their  drinks.  ALL  of  them 
           look  like  they  want  to  SPIT,  but  none  of  them  do. 

                                 ANDY
                        It’s  actually  not  bad. 

           And  with  that  we... 

                                                          SMASH  CUT  TO:

           BEGIN  LIFE  CHANGING  PARTY  SEQUENCE! 

           We  are  in  the  FULL  GLORY  of  the  party.   

           In  the  kitchen,  everybody  does  a  TEQUILA  shot  and  SLAMS  DOWN 
           their  glasses.  The  Lion  does  it  in  REVERSE  -  sucking  the  LIME 
           before  downing  the  shot  and  doing  the  salt  LAST. 

                                 SPICE
                        I’m  telling  you,  you’re  doing  it 
                        backwards!  I’m  a  chef! 

                                 THE  LION
                        Shalt  is  a  human need  while  limes 
                        are  an  arbitrary  tropical  fruit! 
                        Why  would  I  want  a  shour  taste  in 
                        my  mouth  until  the  next  drink? 
                        Plus,  shalt  will  make  me  thirstier, 
                        which  will  make  drinking  easier!  

                                 TINSLEY  (O.C.)
                        Lion! 

           The  Lion  turns  to  see  TINSLEY  standing  in  the  living  room 
           with  her  FRIENDS. 

                                 TINSLEY
                        You  came!

                                 THE  LION
                        I  figured  I  would  slum  it  one 
                        night.  

                                 TINSLEY
                        Come  say  hi! 

                                 THE  LION
                        I will say hi. 

           Out  of  the  corner  of  her  eye,  Nora  sees  ERLAND  -  the  guy  from 
           her  LAB.  She  quickly  TURNS  AWAY. 

                                 NORA
                        Shit! 

                                 ANDY
                        What? 
                                 NORA
                        It’s  one  of  my  co-workers  from  the 
                        lab. 

                                 ANDY
                        He  seems  old  to  be  here...  Is  he 
                        your  boss? 

                                 NORA
                        No.  Post-grad  researcher. 

                                 ANDY
                        Then  don’t  worry  about  it.  If  he 
                        says  anything,  we’ll  have  the  Lion 
                        kick  his  ass. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  would  never  use  my  training  so 
                        callously.  I’m  insulted  you  would 
                        even  think  that. 

           LATER...

           Andy  and  Spice  sit  on  a  COUCH  with  STONED  KIDS  PASSING  A 
           BOWL.  Andy  is  half-drunk,  telling  a  STORY. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  don’t  lie  about  Midgetville.  It’s 
                        a  secret  neighborhood  of  tiny 
                        houses  built  by  circus  performers  a 
                        hundred  years  ago.  The  speed  limit 
                        signs  all  say  9  1/2. 

                                 SPICE
                        We’ve  always  wanted  to  steal  one, 
                        but  they’re  bolted  to  poles  high 
                        up.  

                                 STONED  KID
                        The  midgets  are  bolted  to  poles? 

                                 SPICE
                        No,  the  signs. 

                                 STONED  KID
                        Do  midgets  actually  live  there? 

                                 ANDY
                        We’ve  never  seen  any,  but  I  don’t 
                        know  who  else  could  live  in  those 
                        houses.  Maybe  they’re  empty. 

           The  pipe  gets  passed  to  ANDY,  who  takes  it,  looks  at  Spice, 
           and  takes  a  LONG,  CONFIDENT  INHALE.  By  far  the  biggest  hit  of 
           the  group.  He  exhales  a  HUGE  CLOUD  OF  SMOKE. 

                                 STONED  KID
                        Hell  yeah.  Dragon. 
           UPSTAIRS...   

           While  Andy  and  Spice  are  smoking  downstairs,  Nora  is  exiting 
           the  bathroom  UPSTAIRS,  holding  her  near-empty  DRINK.  She  has 
           a  good  BUZZ  going  -  smiling,  feeling  light-headed. 

                                 ERLAND  (O.C.)
                             (accent)
                        Nora! 

           Nora  looks  through  a  DOOR  at  ERLAND,  SMOKING  a  CIGARETTE  on  a 
           PORCH  that  extends  out  from  the  MASTER  BEDROOM. 

                                 ERLAND
                        I thought  I  saw  you!  Come  have  a 
                        cigarette? 

                                 NORA
                        I  don’t...  Wait,  I  do.  Summer  of 
                        Yes. 

           Nora  walks  through  the  bedroom  to  the...

           PORCH

           ...where  Erland  is  smoking  with  a  couple  of  GIRLS.  The  porch 
           overlooks  the  ocean  -  from  the  way  Nora  stares  at  the  view, 
           we  know  that  she’s  never  seen  this  side  of  her  home  town. 

           Erland  offers  her  a  CIGARETTE  and  she  TAKES  IT. 

                                 ERLAND
                        Claire,  Margot...  this  is  Nora.  We 
                        work  together  at  the  lab. 

                                 NORA
                        Hello.  

           Nora  puts  the  cigarette  in  her  mouth  and  Erland  LIGHTS  it. 
           She  inhales  expecting  to  cough,  but  DOESN’T.  Just  like  her 
           friends.  This  is  a  night  where  EVERYTHING  goes  RIGHT.  

                                 NORA
                        What  are  you  doing  here? 

                                 ERLAND
                        I’m  staying  with  family  friends 
                        down  the  street,  and  their  son 
                        dragged  me  along.  I  think  I’m  the 
                        oldest  person  here  by  a  decade.  

                                 MARGOT
                        You’ll  come  in  handy  if  we  run  out 
                        of  booze. 

                                 ERLAND
                        This  house  will  never run  out  of 
                        booze. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        When  did  you  get  to  town,  Nora? 

           Nora  isn’t  sure  what  she’s  being  asked,  and  then... 

                                 NORA
                        Oh...  I  live  here. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Year  round? 

                                 NORA
                        Year  round. 

                                 CLAIRE
                             (kidding)
                        I  always  just  assumed  they  closed 
                        the  bridges  in  September. 

                                 NORA
                        Maybe  they  do  and  I  just  don’t  know 
                        about  it.  It  feels  like  I  never 
                        leave. 

                                 MARGOT
                        I love  that  dress.  I  wish  I  had 
                        boobs  like  yours. 

                                 NORA
                        Boobs?

           INT.  DOWNSTAIRS  -  LATER

           Time  has  passed,  and  Andy  and  Spice  are  DEEPLY  STONED  on  the 
           couch,  LAUGHING  with  the  other  GUESTS.  A  couple  of  PRETTY 
           GIRLS  are  interested  in  them  -  such  a  foreign  concept,  they 
           don’t  even  NOTICE.  These  girls  are  ZELDA  and  EMILY. 

                                 EMILY
                        There’s  no  way.  It’s  literally  the 
                        hardest  dessert  to  make  in  the 
                        world. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  telling  you  -  Spice  could  make 
                        a  souffle  right  now  and  it  would  be 
                        delicious. 

                                 ZELDA
                        It  would  instantly  collapse.  This 
                        party  is  loud. 

                                 SPICE
                             (serious)
                        I  bet  you  a  hundred  dollars  my 
                        souffle  wouldn’t  collapse. 
                                 ZELDA
                        You’re  on. 

           Andy  and  Spice  look  at  each  other. 

                                 ANDY
                        Monsieur. 

                                 SPICE
                        Oui  oui. 

           Spice  gets  up  from  the  couch  and  unsteadily  HEADS  TO  THE 
           KITCHEN,  where  he  loudly  begins  TAKING  OUT  PANS  and  SHOOING 
           OUT  partiers.

                                 SPICE
                        Off  the  stove!  Genius  at  work! 

           Back  on  the  couch,  the  attention  turns  to  ANDY,  now  alone. 
           Emily  is  the  first  to  engage. 

                                 EMILY
                        What  are  your  hidden  talents,  Andy? 

                                 ANDY
                             (not  kidding)
                        I  can  catch  food  thrown  from  any 
                        distance  with  my  mouth. 

           Emily  reaches  towards  the  bowls  of  PARTY  SNACKS  in  the  center 
           of  the  table  -  chips,  cookies,  candy  -  and  takes  out  a 
           handful  of  GUMMI  BEARS. 

           She  TOSSES  one  of  the  bears  at  Andy,  and  he  EFFORTLESSLY 
           CATCHES  IT  with  his  MOUTH.  She  throws  ANOTHER  ONE,  and  he 
           PLUCKS  it  out  of  the  air  as  easily  as  he  did  the  first. 

                                 ANDY
                        You  can  be  more  creative  than  that.  

           EXT.  LAWN  -  LATER

           The  party  guests  are  all  gathered  in  the  BACK  LAWN,  where 
           Emily  is  LAUNCHING  GUMMI  BEARS  at  ANDY,  who  is  standing 
           TWENTY  YARDS  AWAY. 

           The  GUMMI  BEAR  SOARS  through  the  air,  catching  the  moonlight 
           in  its  red,  gelatinous  sublimity  as  Andy  calmly  TRACKS  it 
           like  an  outfielder.  

           End-over-end,  the  GUMMI  BEAR  HURTLES  TOWARDS  THE  EARTH... 
           before  LANDING  SOFTLY  in  Andy’s  MOUTH.  Andy  takes  a  BOW  and 
           swallows  the  gummi  bear  down.  He  looks  at  Emily.  She  is 
           applauding,  impressed. 
           Then,  Andy  HEARS  FAMILIAR  LAUGHTER  down  by  the  SHORE.  He 
           takes  the  short  walk  to  a  BLUFF  overlooking  the  WATER... 
           where  he  sees  Nora  SKINNY  DIPPING  with  ERLAND.  

           Their  clothes  and  a  bottle  of  booze  they  were  sharing  are 
           lying  on  the  sand. 

           In  the  moonlight,  Andy  can  make  out  the  LINES  of  Nora’S  BODY. 
           Seeing  her  like  this,  he  can’t  HELP  but  be  ATTRACTED  to  her.

                                 ANDY
                             (to  himself)
                        Stop  it  Andy...  That’s  Nora. 

           He  watches  Erland  SWIM  up  to  Nora  and  KISS  HER.  Emily  walks 
           up  next  to  Andy  on  the  bluff,  and  sees  what  he’s  seeing. 

                                 EMILY
                        Lucky  guy.  
                             (beat)
                        But  I  don’t  like  cold  water,  so  we 
                        should  take  off  our  clothes  inside. 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        Good  thinking.  

           INT.  KITCHEN  -  LATER

           SPICE  -  drunk  and  beaming  -  takes  a  PERFECT  SOUFFLE  OUT  OF 
           THE  OVEN  as  onlookers  CHEER.  He  holds  it  over  his  HEAD. 

                                 SPICE
                        It  has  risen!  I  am  the  greatest 
                        chef  alive! 

           Spice  presents  the  souffle  to  ZELDA. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Any  way  you’ll  consider  comping  the 
                        check? 

                                 SPICE
                        We  can  figure  something  out. 

           INT.  GUEST  BEDROOM  -  LATER

           The  door  is  locked.  The  bed  is  large.  Andy  is  looking  out  the 
           window  at  The  Lion  TEACHING  Tinsley  and  a  group  of  other 
           partiers  TAI-CHI,  with  a  JOINT  hanging  out  of  his  mouth. 

                                 ANDY
                        Tai-Chi? 

                                 EMILY  (O.C.)
                        Hey.
           Andy  turns  around  to  see  Emily  standing  behind  him  in  her 
           UNDERWEAR.  She  looks  incredible.  She  takes  off  her  BRA.

                                 EMILY
                        This  is  the  part  where  you  take  off 
                        your  clothes  too. 

           Andy  STRIPS  to  his  BOXERS.  He  already  has  a  crazy  TENNIS  TAN  - 
           his  ARMS  and  LEGS  are  tanned  and  there  is  a  TAN  TRIANGLE  on 
           his  CHEST  from  his  POLO  SHIRT. 

           Emily  takes  a  CONDOM  out  of  her  PURSE  and  puts  it  on  the 
           NIGHT  STAND.  Andy  looks  like  he’s  about  to  have  an  aneurysm. 

                                 EMILY
                        It’s  easier  to  bring  my  own  instead 
                        of  hoping  the  guy  has  one. 

                                 ANDY
                        Very...  sapient  of  you. 
                             (beat)
                        I  have  no  idea  where  that  word  came 
                        from. 

                                 EMILY
                        I  had  it  on  the  PSAT. 

                                 ANDY
                        You  mean  the  SAT?  

                                 EMILY
                        I  haven’t  taken  the  SAT  yet. 

                                 ANDY
                        How  is  that  possible? 

                                 EMILY
                        I’m  sixteen.  

           Andy  looks  PANICKED. 

                                 EMILY
                        How  old  are  you? 

                                 ANDY
                        Eighteen. 

                                 EMILY
                        Then  don’t  worry  about  it.  I’m  less 
                        than  four  years  younger  than  you  so 
                        it’s  legal.  Romeo  &  Juliet  rule.

                                 ANDY
                        This  does  feel  similar  to  Romeo  & 
                        Juliet. 

           They  stand  looking  at  each  other  for  a  moment.  Emily  is 
           waiting  for  him  to  make  a  MOVE,  but  Andy  DOESN’T  HAVE  ANY. 
                                 EMILY
                        You  haven’t  done  this  before,  huh. 

                                 ANDY
                        No.  But  I  need  about  10,000 
                        practice  hours  before  August. 

                                 EMILY
                        Malcolm  Gladwell?  Outliers? 

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.  I  need  to  be  an  expert. 

                                 EMILY
                        Why? 

                                 ANDY
                        An  Indian  Girl  might  be  visiting 
                        me.  

                                 EMILY
                        They  have  the  Kama  Sutra. 

                                 ANDY
                        Exactly. 

                                 EMILY
                        Get  on  the  bed.  We  can  at  least 
                        knock  a  couple  of  minutes  off  that 
                        total. 

           And  as  Andy  gets  on  the  bed  and  Emily  CLIMBS  ON  TOP  OF  HIM... 

           INT.  SUNROOM  -  SAME  TIME

           Spice  and  Zelda  are  by  themselves  in  the  SUNROOM,  MAKING  OUT 
           on  an  ANTIQUE  LOVESEAT.  Spice  DOESN’T  REALLY  KNOW  what  he’s 
           DOING,  and  keeps  awkwardly  RAISING  HIS  HIPS  towards  the  girl.  

                                 ZELDA
                             (annoyed)
                        I  get  it!  You  want  a  handjob!  You 
                        have  to  impress  a  girl  if  you  want 
                        a  handjob! 

                                 SPICE
                        I  thought  that  was  the  purpose  of 
                        the  souffle... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Maybe  if  you  tried  some  subtlety 
                        instead  of  moving  your  hips  all 
                        creepily,  you  would  have  got  one! 
                        Gross!  

           Zelda  gets  up  off  the  loveseat  and  leaves  Spice  ALONE  with 
           his  PANTS-COVERED  ERECTION. 
                                 SPICE
                             (genuinely  confused)
                        But  what’s  a  subtle  handjob? 

           INT.  GUEST  BEDROOM  -  LATER

           Andy  and  Emily  are  LYING  in  BED  next  to  each  other,  POST-
           COITAL  and  OUT  OF  BREATH. 

                                 ANDY
                        How  much  time  was  that?

                        Not  bad. 

           EXT.  SHORE  -  SAME  TIME

           NORA  and  ERLAND  are  making  out  in  a  SAND  DUNE  NAKED. 

                                 NORA
                        I  have  to  say  -  sand  is  way  less 
                        comfortable  than  it  looks  on  TV. 

                                 ERLAND
                        Your  body  is  amazing. 

                                 NORA
                        Thanks.  It’s  new. 

           They  go  back  to  MAKING  OUT  -  but  not  having  sex,  importantly  - 
           and  with  that  we  PULL  BACK  on  the  HOUSE,  the  PARTY  and  the 
           HOUSES  lining  the  shore  and...

           INT.  THE  LION’S  HOUSE  -  SAME  TIME

           The  Lion  TIPTOES  through  the  front  door  of  the  house  -  just 
           trying  to  be  quiet,  his  movements  are  STEALTHY.  Karate-like. 

           He  LOOKS  AROUND  but  his  PARENTS  are  NOWHERE  TO  BE  FOUND.  He 
           RELAXES  and  starts  HEADING  UPSTAIRS  when  the  FRONT  DOOR 
           opens... 

           It’s  his  PARENTS  returning  home  after  THEIR  OWN  night  on  the 
           town.  They’re  wearing  PROVOCATIVE  OUTFITS  -  they  really  might 
           be  swingers. 

                                 LION’S  DAD
                        Lionel!  You’re  up  early. 
                                 THE  LION
                        Just  grabbing  a  shnack...  Where 
                        were you  guys? 

                                 LION’S  DAD
                        Oh,  just  a  dungeon. 

           The  Lion’s  Mom  SLAPS  her  husband  on  the  arm.

                                 LION’S  MOM
                        So bad.

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  gonna...  go  back  to  bed. 

                                 LION’S  MOM
                        Goodnight,  handsome. 

           The  Lion  heads  to  BED,  a  little  DISTURBED. 

           INT.  NORA’S  HOUSE  -  SAME  TIME

           Nora  walks  through  the  door  and  her  parents  EMBRACE  her. 

                                 NORA’S  MOM
                        Where  have  you  been?  We’ve  been  up 
                        all  night!  

                                 NORA
                        A  party. 

                                 NORA’S  DAD
                        A  party? 

           Nora’s  MOM  stops  hugging  her  and  looks  down  at  her  OWN 
           HAND...  there’s  SAND  on  it. 

                                 NORA’S  MOM 
                        Go  to  bed.  We’ll  talk  about  this 
                        later. 

           Nora  trudges  off  to  her  ROOM. 

                                 NORA’S  DAD
                        Tell  me  that  wasn’t  sand  on  her 
                        back. 

           INT.  ANDY’S  HOUSE  -  SAME  TIME

           Andy’s  MOM  and  DAD  are  waiting  up  for  him,  bags  under  their 
           eyes.  They  sees  the  WRETCHED  condition  he’s  in  as  he  walks 
           through  the  door. 

                                 ANDY’S  MOM
                        I  don’t  even  know  what  to  say. 
                                 ANDY
                        Please  just  send  me  to  my  room. 

           Andy’s  Mom  NODS.  Andy  walks  to  his  ROOM  and  greets  his  BED. 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh  thank  God.  Thank  God  thank  God. 

           Andy  collapses  FACE-FIRST  onto  the  bed  and  is  INSTANTLY  OUT. 
           His  PARENTS  look  at  his  carcass  from  the  doorway.  

                                 ANDY’S  MOM
                        What  do  you  think  happened  to  him? 

                                 ANDY’S  DAD
                        I  don’t  know.  But  I’m  jealous. 

           INT.  SPICE’S  HOUSE  -  LATER

           SPICE  walks  through  the  door  of  his  LIVING  ROOM...  and  finds 
           NOBODY  awake  waiting  for  him. 

           He  breathes  a  sigh  of  relief  and  starts  walking  up  the 
           stairs.  In  profile,  we  can  see  he  still  has  an  ERECTION. 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           EXT.  BLEU  RESTAURANT  -  MONDAY  AFTERNOON

           Andy,  Nora  and  the  Lion  sit  at  a  SIDEWALK  TABLE  at  Spice’s 
           RESTAURANT,  eating  sandwiches.  They  all  look  a  little  TIRED  - 
           still  recovering  from  the  other  night. 

           Just  sitting,  they’re  getting  SHOUT-OUTS  from  KIDS  who’d  been 
           at  the  PARTY.  

                                 SHOUT-OUTER  #1
                        Hell  yeah  Lion! 

                                 SHOUT-OUTER  #2
                        Andy,  heads  up! 

           An  M&M  comes  flying  across  the  ROAD,  and  Andy  instinctively 
           CATCHES  it  in  his  MOUTH,  to  the  DELIGHT  of  the  SHOUT-OUTERS. 

                                 NORA
                        Why  are  people  throwing  food  at 
                        you? 

                                 ANDY
                        You  were  skinny  dipping  with  your 
                        thirty-year-old  during  my 
                        performance.  It  was  glorious. 
                                 NORA
                             (embarrassed)
                        How  many  people  saw  me  naked? 

                                 SHOUT-OUTER  #3  (O.C.)
                        Unbelievable  body  right  there!  Yes! 

           Nora  looks  across  the  road  at  a  shout-outer  who  is  pointing 
           RIGHT  AT  HER. 

                                 THE  LION
                        When  did  you  get  a  body  anyway? 

                                 NORA
                        About  three  weeks  ago,  I  think. 

                                 THE  LION 
                        It’s  crazy  that  you’re  finally  a 
                        girl.   

                                 NORA
                        Thanks. 

                                 ANDY
                        Did  you  hook  up  with  anyone,  Lion? 

                                 THE  LION
                        Nah,  jusht  did  some  teaching.  I’m 
                        shtill  waiting  for  my  moment.

                        Was  it  awkward  with  your  co-worker 
                        today? 

                                 NORA
                        Nope.  We’re  hanging  out  again  later 
                        this  week. 

                                 ANDY
                        You’re  going  to  hang  out  again?

                        It’s  the  Summer  of  Yes,  Andy. 

           Andy  is  slightly  JEALOUS,  but  trying  not  to  show  it.  

                                 SPICE
                        By  the  way,  we  got  invited  to 
                        another  party  this  weekend.  On  a 
                        BOAT.

                                 NORA
                        They’re  summer  people.  They  don’t 
                        know  that  we  weren’t  popular  in 
                        high  school.

                                 THE  LION
                        It’s  like  we  have  shecret 
                        identities. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  don’t  know  about  you,  but  I 
                        intend  to  find  out  what  it’s  like 
                        on  the  other  side. 

           EXT.  GUARD  STAND  -  LATER

           Andy  -  on  his  BIKE,  wearing  his  tennis  whites  -  walks  towards 
           Penzance  Point,  where  the  same  SECURITY  GUARD  is  working. 

                                 SECURITY  GUARD
                        You  again?   

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  teaching  a  lesson.  And  getting 
                        my  car  from  the  other  night. 

                                 SECURITY  GUARD
                        You’re  a  grifter,  aren’t  you. 

                                 ANDY
                        Even  if  I  was,  I  guarantee  people 
                        in  this  neighborhood  are  better 
                        criminals  than  I  could  ever  be. 

           The  Security  Guard  nods  -  probably  right.  He  waves  Andy  in. 

           EXT.  PENZANCE  POINT  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  BIKES  past  the  party  house.  His  CAR  is  still  parked  on 
           the  side  of  the  driveway.  He  breathes  a  sigh  of  relief. 

           EXT.  GABBY’S  HOUSE  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  bikes  down  the  DRIVEWAY  towards  Gabby’s  house.  It’s  as 
           impressive  as  all  the  other  houses  on  the  point  -  manicured, 
           pure  New  England. 
           He  gets  off  his  bike  and  walks  up  to  the  FRONT  DOOR,  which  is 
           already  OPEN. 

           INT.  GABBY’S  HOUSE  -  CONTINUOUS

           Andy  gives  a  couple  of  KNOCKS  and  looks  around. 

                                 ANDY
                        Gabby?  It’s  Andy.  Lesson  time. 

                                 GABBY  (O.C.)
                        Come  on  in  Andy!  I’m  getting  ready. 

           Andy  walks  into  the  house,  which  is  a  bit  more  MODERN  than 
           the  party  house  -  Abstract  Impressionist  paintings  on  the 
           walls,  flat-screen  televisions. 

           Andy  looks  at  a  framed  PENCIL  DRAWING  of  a  NAKED  WOMAN 
           hanging  on  the  wall.  He  looks  at  the  SIGNATURE  -  Picasso.  He 
           shakes  his  head. 

           On  the  TABLE,  he  sees  a  POST-IT  that  says  ANDY  wrapped  around 
           THREE  FIFTY  DOLLAR  BILLS.  His  eyes  go  wide. 

                                 ANDY
                        One-fifty  an  hour  is...  generous. 

                                 GABBY  (O.C.)
                        You’re  worth  it!  Come  down  the 
                        hall,  Andy!  We’ll  go  out  the  back. 

           Andy  walks  down  a  hall,  at  the  end  of  which  is  a  GLASS  DOOR 
           showing  SUN  reflecting  off  the  OCEAN.  It’s  like  he’s  walking 
           towards  a  HEAVENLY  LIGHT... 

           And  then  a  pair  of  BARE  ARMS  GRAB  HIM  and  PULL  him  into  a 
           room  off  the  hall. 

           INT.  GUEST  ROOM  -  CONTINUOUS

           Gabby  SLAMS  the  door  shut  BEHIND  ANDY.  She  is  wearing  a 
           TENNIS  SKIRT...  and  that’s  it.  Nothing  underneath.  LIGHT 
           beatifically  beams  down  on  her  vagina  from  an  OPEN  WINDOW. 

                                 ANDY
                        Holy  shit!  Gabby! 

           Gabby  pushes  Andy  down  on  the  BED  and  gets  on  TOP  of  him. 

                                 GABBY
                        Shut  up,  Andy. 

                                 ANDY
                        Okay. 

           And  as  Gabby  works  her  way  down  Andy’s  NECK... 
           A  SHORT  WHILE  LATER

           Andy  and  Gabby  lay  next  to  each  other  in  the  messy  bed, 
           sweaty  and  post-coital. 

                                 GABBY
                        Five  times  in  a  row?   

                                 ANDY
                        That’s  how  I  do  it,  apparently. 
                        Like  an  Olympic  event. 

                                 GABBY
                        The  cuntathalon.

           Andy’s  BIKE  is  in  the  TRUNK  of  his  Buick  as  he  drives  off 
           Penzance.  He’s  got  a  GRIN  on  his  FACE  and  his  hair  is  a  MESS. 

                                 SECURITY  GUARD
                        What  kind  of  tennis  lesson  only 
                        lasts  thirty  minutes?  

                                 ANDY
                        We  just  worked  on  some  grips. 

           Andy  gives  the  guard  a  small  wave  and  DRIVES  AWAY.

                                                                CUT  TO:

           EXT.  YACHT  -  NIGHT

           The  Lion  stands  on  the  BOW  of  a  SLEEK  YACHT  with  a  TAB  of  LSD 
           on  his  TONGUE,  doing  TAI  CHI  again.  This  time,  he  has  even 
           MORE  FOLLOWERS.  

           Behind  him,  the  BOAT  GUESTS  are  trying  to  REPLICATE  his 
           MOVEMENTS...  but  nobody  is  as  smooth  as  the  Lion.  

                                 BOAT  GUEST
                        Does  Tai  Chi  help  with  fighting? 

                                 THE  LION
                        Bruce  Lee  once  shaid,  “A  wise  man 
                        can  learn  more  from  a  foolish 
                        queshtion,  than  a  fool  can  learn 
                        from  a  wise  answer.” 

                                 BOAT  GUEST
                        Have  you  ever  used  it  to  fight? 

                                 THE  LION
                        When  it’s  finally  time  for  me  to 
                        fight,  I’ll  know.  
           ELSEWHERE  ON  THE  DECK

           The  boat  has  a  few  dozen  GUESTS  on  board,  but  is  more 
           civilized  than  the  shitshow  of  last  week’s  party.  Andy  is 
           standing  with  Spice,  who  is  drinking  a  large  GIN  &  TONIC. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  think  the  Lion  is  taking  acid. 

                                 SPICE
                        Yeah.  He  told  me  this  is  the  summer 
                        of  drugs.  He  wants  to  push  his  body 
                        to  its  limits. 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        Jesus.  Look  at  that. 

           Spice  looks  at  what  Andy  is  staring  at...  Nora  is  kissing  and 
           being  intimate  with  ERLAND  at  the  back  of  the  BOAT. 

                                 ANDY
                        Who  is  this  guy?  Is  he  her 
                        boyfriend  now  or  something? 

                                 SPICE
                        Who  cares?  She’s  happy. 

                                 ANDY
                        He’s  twelve years  older  than  her. 

                                 SPICE
                        So  what?  If  I  was  thirty,  I’d  be 
                        trying  to  nail  eighteen-year-olds 
                        too. 

                                 ANDY
                        It  seems  messed  up. 

           Spice  leans  close  and  EXAMINES  Andy’s  face. 

                                 SPICE
                        Holy  shit. 

                                 ANDY
                        What? 

                                 SPICE
                        You  like  Nora.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re  out  of  your  mind.  She’s  been 
                        my  friend  since  I  was  born.  Our 
                        relationship  is  asexual. 
                                 SPICE
                        Yeah,  because  until  recently  she 
                        looked  like  more  of  a  guy  than  you 
                        ever  have.  Now  she’s  getting  hot. 
                             (beat)
                        You’re  jealous.  You  tragic, 
                        sensitive  teenage  soul,  you. 

                                 ANDY
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        Three  days  ago  a  forty-two  year  old 
                        woman  paid  me  for  sex. 

           Spice’s  BRAIN  EXPLODES. 

                                 SPICE
                        No! 

                                 ANDY
                        Private  tennis  lesson.  I’ve  got  two 
                        more  scheduled  with  her  this  week. 
                        How’s  that  for  sensitive? 

                                 SPICE
                        Not  sensitive  at  all. The opposite 
                        of  sensitive. 

                                 ANDY
                        You  know  how  I  know all of you are 
                        going  to  meet  my  hot  Indian  girl? 
                        I’m  going  to  fly  her  over  myself 
                        and put her up in a Bed & 
                        Breakfast!  And  have  plenty  of  money 
                        left  over  to  seduce  her  at  dinners 
                        I  pay  for!  Ha! 
                             (beat)
                        Now  if  you’ll  excuse  me...  man 
                        overboard!  

           Andy  RUNS  for  the  RAILING  -  straight  past  Nora  and  ERLAND, 
           interrupting  their  conversation  -  and  LEAPS  OFF.  He  falls 
           twenty  feet  and  SPLASHES  into  the  Atlantic  below. 

           EXT.  UNDERWATER  -  CONTINUOUS

           Andy  SINKS  into  the  ocean.  The  water  is  DARK,  but  he  opens 
           his  eyes  anyway.  All  around  him  is  PHOSPHORESCENCE  activated 
           by  the  splash.  It  looks  like  he  is  surrounded  by  FIREFLIES. 

           EXT.  YACHT  -  SAME  TIME

           Nora  stares  down  at  the  GLOWING  WATER.  She  smiles.  Erland  is 
           next  to  her.

                                 EMILY  (O.C.)
                        Woman  overboard! 
           Emily  goes  running  past  and  JUMPS  off  the  boat.  Poof!  She 
           splashes  below  in  a  cloud  of  phosphorescence.  ZELDA  jumps  off 
           NEXT,  followed  by  SPICE. 

                                 NORA
                        It’s  beautiful. 

                                 ERLAND
                        It’s  just  a  bunch  of  plankton 
                        freaking  out  because  they’re  afraid 
                        of  being  eaten. 

                                 NORA
                        I’m  glad  people  don’t  glow  when 
                        they’re  nervous.  Every  day  of  high 
                        school  I  would  have  been  lit  up 
                        like  a  firefly.  

           More  PARTIERS  follow,  throwing  themselves  off  the  deck  like 
           cannonballs  -  poof  poof  -  until  the  sea  is  all  LIT  UP  below. 

           EXT.  UNDERWATER  -  SAME  TIME

           From  our  underwater  vantage  point,  we  see  SPICE  rub  up 
           AGAINST  ZELDA  as  he  SURFACES.  From  this  angle,  it’s  clearly 
           UNINTENTIONAL  -  it’s  just  the  way  they  dove  in... 

           EXT.  ABOVE  WATER  -  CONTINUOUS

           ...but  ZELDA  clearly  DOESN’T  SEE  IT  THAT  WAY  as  she  TREADS 
           WATER  next  to  Spice.  

                                 ZELDA
                        I  am  NOT  GIVING  YOU  A  HANDJOB!  STOP 
                        IT! 

                                 SPICE
                        I  was  just  coming  up  for  air!  I 
                        didn’t  know  where  I  was  going!  I 
                        can’t  open  my  eyes  underwater! 

           INT.  OCEAN  VIEW  COUNTRY  CLUB  OFFICE  -  DAY

           Andy  studies  the  sexual  positions  of  the  KAMA  SUTRA  as  he 
           STRINGS  a  RACQUET  using  a  GAMMA  MACHINE  in  the  small  tennis 
           club  PRO  SHOP.  LOOSE  STRINGS  jut  out  in  all  directions. 

           VICTORIA  (early  40s)  enters  the  office,  slightly  NERVOUS. 

                                 ANDY
                        Hey  Victoria.  Getting  on  a  court 
                        today? 
                                 VICTORIA
                        That’s  what  I  wanted  to  talk  to  you 
                        about.  Gabby  told  me  you’re  giving 
                        private  lessons.  

           Andy  looks  up  from  the  stringing  machine. 

                                 VICTORIA
                        $150  an  hour,  right?

                                 ANDY
                        Do  you  mean...  a  full  lesson?   

                                 VICTORIA
                        Yeah,  a  full  lesson. 
                             (beat)
                        Tomorrow  at  four  okay? 

                                 ANDY
                        Sure.  That’s  open.  

                                 VICTORIA
                        My  address  is  on  the  league  call 
                        sheet. 

           Andy  stands  at  the  Gamma  Machine,  thinking  about  what  just 
           happened,  when  another  TENNIS  LADY  pokes  her  head  in. 

                                 TENNIS  LADY
                        Andy!  There’s  something  I  wanted  to 
                        talk  to  you  about... 

                                 ANDY
                        I  can  talk. 

           And  with  that  we...

           BEGIN  GIGOLO  ANDY  SEQUENCE!

           MUSIC  CUE:  “Out  in  the  Woods”  by  Leon  Russell.  

           -  Victoria  greets  Andy  at  the  door  to  her  POOL  HOUSE  in  a 
           ROBE.  As  always,  he  is  wearing  his  TENNIS  WHITES.  She  hands 
           him  a  MOJITO,  and  he  WALKS  INSIDE. 

           -  Victoria  and  Andy  have  sex  in  the  BEDROOM  of  the  POOL 
           HOUSE.  Andy  twists  her  around,  trying  out  some  NEW  POSITIONS.  

           -  Andy  is  done  teaching  a  LESSON  to  a  group  of  KIDS  whose 
           MOMS  are  watching  from  the  sidelines.  One  of  the  TENNIS  MOMS 
           waits  around  for  the  other  moms  to  leave. 

                                 TENNIS  MOM
                        Victoria  told  me  you’re  giving 
                        private  lessons. 
           -  Andy  and  the  TENNIS  MOM  hook  up  in  a  HAMMOCK  with  a  water 
           view. 

                                 ANDY
                        Where’s  your  daughter? 

                                 TENNIS  MOM
                        Playdate.  I  thought  I’d  have  one 
                        too. 

           -  Andy  purchases  two  JUMBO  BOXES  of  CONDOMS  at  STOP  &  SHOP. 
           The  GUY  behind  the  REGISTER  gives  him  an  IMPRESSED  NOD. 

                                 CHECKOUT  GUY
                        Respect. 

           -  Andy  leaves  the  club  for  the  day  and  walks  to  his  CAR.  A 
           PIECE  OF  PAPER  is  tucked  under  his  WINDSHIELD  WIPER.  He  looks 
           at  it. 

           -  Andy  sleeps  with  the  TENNIS  LADY  in  the  NICEST  BEDROOM 
           we’ve  seen  next.  All  white.  California  King  bed.  360-degree 
           views.  A  fireplace  that’s  never  been  used. 

           He  shuts  his  eyes  to  stop  looking  at  the  HORRIBLE  PAINTING  of 
           Tennis  Lady  and  her  ELDERLY  HUSBAND  above  the  mantle.  

           -  Andy  stands  in  front  of  DIANA  (44,  attractive)  in  his 
           TENNIS  WHITES  in  a  NAUTICAL-THEMED  BILLIARDS  ROOM.  He  starts 
           to  take  off  his  SHORTS,  but  she  STOPS  HIM. 

                                 DIANA
                        Keep  the  outfit  on. 

           Diana  ZIPS  DOWN  his  FLY. 

           -  Andy  hustles  out  of  ANOTHER  BEDROOM  looking  like  he’s  been 
           through  a  HURRICANE.  He  looks  at  a  PHOTOGRAPH  of  the  WOMAN 
           he’s  just  been  with  next  to  her  HUSBAND. 

           The  husband  is  MATT  DAMON. 

                                 ANDY
                        Shit.  Matt  Damon. 

           -  Andy  puts  another  $150  in  the  GLOVE  COMPARTMENT  of  his 
           BUICK.  The  compartment  is  OVERFLOWING  with  CASH. 

           -  Andy  WAVES  at  the  SECURITY  GUARD  as  he  DRIVES  away  from 
           PENZANCE  POINT. 

           EXT.  PIRATES  COVE  MINI  GOLF  -  DAY

           Putt!  The  Lion  taps  a  GOLF  BALL  down  a  green  filled  with 
           PIRATE-THEMED  OBSTACLES  -  anchors,  buoys,  and  so  forth.  
           It  doesn’t  matter  how  many  hazards  there  are  -  it’s  like  the 
           Lion  can  control  the  ball  with  his  MIND.  It  crests  a  HILL, 
           rolls  on  the  edge  of  a  SAND  TRAP  and  lands  in  the  HOLE.

                        That’s  another  hole-in-one.  

           Andy  shakes  his  head  and  marks  down  the  Lion’s  SCORE.  It’s 
           just  a  STRING  of  HOLE-IN-ONES. 

                                 ANDY
                        Stop  using  quigong  to  influence  the

                        turn  on  and  off. 

           Nora  steps  up  to  take  her  shot.  Andy  can’t  help  but  stare  at 
           her  -  she  has  rapidly  become  beautiful.  He  shakes  his  head  to 
           himself  like  what  the  fuck?

           Andy  and  his  friends  look  at  a  group  of  their  CLASSMATES  who 
           are  also  out  mini-golfing.  One  of  them  is  a  MASSIVE  ATHLETE

                        with  you  because  he  wants  you  to

           mansion.  The  lodgings  are  small  but  cozy  -  a  bed,  a  small 
           kitchen,  lots  of  bookshelves. 

           Erland  has  his  ACOUSTIC  GUITAR  out  and  is  tinkering  with  a 
           BAD  SONG,  playing  with  rhymes  for  “Nora.”

           are  MOORED  to  the  dock,  at  the  far  end  of  which  is  a  HANGAR. 

           Erland  looks  around  to  make  sure  they  aren’t  being  watched, 
           and  pushes  open  the  door.

           Nora  and  Erland  SCRAMBLE  down  the  deck  past  the  research 
           vessels  and  scientific  equipment  to  the  HANGAR.  Erland  swipes 
           his  CARD  at  the  HANGAR,  and  another  DOOR  OPENS.

           Erland  opens  Alvin’s  HATCH  and  helps  Nora  CRAWL  INSIDE. 
           The  INSIDE  of  the  submarine  looks  pretty  much  what  you  would 
           expect  it  to  look  like  -  CONTROL  PANELS  covering  the  walls, 
           VIDEO  SCREENS  all  over  the  place.  The  control  room  has  a 
           cushioned  BENCH  SEAT  able  to  fit  THREE  PEOPLE. 

           Erland  closes  the  HATCH  behind  them.  Nora  sits  at  the 
           CONTROLS  and  looks  around  in  WONDER.

                                 ERLAND
                             (beat)
                        Of  course  I’m  your  boyfriend.  I 
                        care  about  you  Nora...

                                 NORA
                        Do  you? 

                                 ERLAND
                        I do. 

                                 NORA
                        How  much...

           Nora  and  Erland  look  at  each  other,  and  for  a  moment,  she 
           thinks  he’s  going  to  say  it. 
                                 ERLAND
                        I...

           Erland  takes  a  CONDOM  out  of  his  POCKET. 

                                 ERLAND
                        ...have  this. 

                                 NORA
                        Oh my God!  

                                 ERLAND
                        You  have  to  admit  -  you’ll  have  a 
                        virginity  story  better  than  any  of 
                        your  friends. 

                                 NORA
                        Who  says  I’m  a  virgin?  
                             (off  Erland’s  surprise)
                        Clearly  you’ve  never  been  to  a 
                        National  Young  Leaders  Conference.  

           Erland  LAUGHS.  He  kisses  Nora,  and  she  kisses  him  BACK.  She 
           pulls  him  DOWN  on  top  of  her,  onto  the  bench  seat,  and  with 
           that... 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           EXT.  TENNIS  COURT  -  AFTERNOON

           Andy  is  teaching  another  LESSON  to  his  normal  group  of  ADULT 
           WOMEN,  who  -  as  always  -  are  falling  all  over  the  court, 
           launching  balls  into  outer  space,  etc. 

           Andy’s  HEAD  is  somewhere  else.  He  is  ROBOTICALLY  feeding 
           BALLS  to  the  women,  offering  NO  INSTRUCTION. 

                                 KAREN
                             (flailing  everywhere)
                        Is  this  right? 

                                 ANDY
                             (bored)
                        Perfect  form. 

           From  the  opposite  baseline,  Gabby  looks  at  Andy  with  CONCERN.

           INT.  GABBY’S  HOUSE  -  LATER

           The  bedsheets  are  rustled.  A  pair  of  empty  Mojito  glasses  sit 
           on  the  nightstand.  Andy’s  TENNIS  WHITES  and  BLUE  HEADBAND  lay 
           on  the  bedroom  FLOOR. 
           INT.  GABBY’S  BATHROOM  -  SAME  TIME

           Gabby  and  Andy  are  taking  a  post-sex  BATH  together  in  an 
           ENORMOUS  TUB.  They  are  smoking  a  JOINT  together,  and  Andy  is 
           still  OUT  OF  IT. 

                                 GABBY
                        What’s  wrong? 

                                 ANDY
                        Just...  girl  stuff. 

                                 GABBY
                        A  client? 

                                 ANDY
                        Client? 
                             (beat)
                        You  understand  I’m  not  actually  a 
                        prostitute,  right?  I’m  going  to 
                        Dartmouth. 

                                 GABBY
                        You  should  have  waited  to  start 
                        your  sex  work  career  until  you  were 
                        in  New  Hampshire.  No  state  income 
                        tax. 

                                 ANDY
                             (concerned)
                        Do  you  think  I  have  to  declare 
                        this? 

           Suddenly,  Andy  and  Gabby  hear  the  FRONT  DOOR  open  DOWNSTAIRS. 

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND  (O.C.)
                        Gabby,  you  home? 

           Andy  and  Gabby  PANIC. 

                                 GABBY
                        Shit!  You’ve  got  to  get  out  of 
                        here. 

           Andy  LEAPS  out  of  the  BATH  and  rapidly  TOWELS  HIMSELF  OFF. 

                                 GABBY
                        You  don’t  have  time  to  dry...  just 
                        go. 

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND  (O.C.)
                        Gabby? 

           Andy  goes  for  the  BATHROOM  DOOR. 

                                 GABBY
                        Not  that  way. 
                                 ANDY
                        My  clothes  are  in  your  room! 

                                 GABBY
                        My husband  is  about  to  be  in  that 
                        room!  You’re  going  that  way. 

           Gabby  points  at  the  WINDOW.  

           EXT.  GABBY’S  HOUSE  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Completely  NAKED,  Andy  CRAWLS  out  of  the  WINDOW  and  BOLTS 
           across  Gabby’s  YARD,  dodging  behind  SHRUBS  and  GAZEBOS  as  he 
           runs. 

           The  Brazilian  LANDSCAPERS  working  the  NEIGHBOR’S  YARD  spot 
           him  and  CHEER  HIM  ON. 

                                 BRAZILIAN  LANDSCAPER
                             (in  Portuguese)
                        Homem  nu!  Corra! 

           Subtitle:  NAKED  MAN!  RUN! 

           Andy  finally  makes  his  way  to  his  BUICK  -  parked  around  the 
           CORNER  from  Gabby’s  house  -  and  JUMPS  INSIDE. 

           INT.  ANDY’S  BUICK  -  CONTINUOUS

           Andy  gets  into  his  front  seat  NAKED.  The  KEYS  are  already  in 
           the  IGNITION  -  nobody  is  going  to  steal  his  Buick  on  Penzance 
           Point.  Andy  STARTS  the  ENGINE  and  PEELS  OUT  of  there. 

           INT.  GABBY’S  HOUSE  -  SAME  TIME

           Gabby  -  wearing  a  robe  -  stuffs  Andy’s  TENNIS  WHITES  and 
           UNDERWEAR  in  the  TRASH  and  COVERS  the  clothing  with  some 
           MAGAZINES. 

           But  she  forgets  his  BLUE  HEADBAND,  which  is  hidden  next  to 
           the  LEG  of  the  BED. 

           Her  HUSBAND  (50s)  enters  the  room.  He  is  wearing  GOLF  PANTS 
           embroidered  with  WHALES  and  is  SWEATING  HEAVILY. 

                                 GABBY
                        You’re  home  early! 

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND
                             (annoyed)
                        Richard  had  a  heart  attack  on  the 
                        seventh  hole.
           EXT.  GUARD  STAND  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           The  SECURITY  GUARD  looks  on  as  Andy  ZOOMS  PAST  NAKED  in  the 
           DRIVER’S  SEAT.  

           EXT.  WOODS  HOLE  BACKROADS  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  speeds  towards  home,  adrenaline  rushing,  angry  at 
           himself... 

                                 ANDY
                        You’re  so  stupid!

           ...when  POLICE  LIGHTS  begin  FLASHING  BEHIND  HIM. 

                                 ANDY
                        SHIT! 

           MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  PARKS  on  the  side  of  the  road.  He  looks  around  for 
           SOMETHING  to  cover  his  CROTCH  with...  but  all  he  can  find  is 
           the  MINI  GOLF  SCORE  CARD,  which  he  lays  over  his  LAP. 

           He  looks  up  into  the  FACE  of  the  COP,  smiling  sheepishly. 

           INT.  WOODS  HOLE  POLICE  STATION  -  LATER

           Andy  sitting  next  to  the  COP’S  DESK,  wearing  an  ORANGE 
           JUMPSUIT  with  WOODS  HOLE  JAIL  stamped  on  the  BACK.  The  cop  is 
           looking  over  some  DOCUMENTS.  He  seems  IRRITATED. 

                                 ANDY
                        What  are  you  looking  at? 

                                 COP
                        I’m  taking  out  a  mortgage,  but  the 
                        numbers  don’t  seem  to  add  up.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  not  a  banker,  but  I’m  pretty 
                        good  at  math. 

           MOMENTS  LATER... 

           Andy  and  the  Cop  look  over  the  documents  together. 

                                 ANDY
                        Here’s  your  problem.  This  number  is 
                        based  on  a  30  year  amortization 
                        when  you  wanted  a  twenty.  Your 
                        instincts  were  right.  Clerical 
                        error. 
                                 COP
                        Thank  you.  You  probably  saved  me  a 
                        ton  of  money... 

                                 ANDY
                        You  have  good  reason  to  be  upset 
                        with  your  lender. 

           INT.  EVANS  FAMILY  VOLVO  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  rides  in  the  BACK  SEAT  in  his  orange  jumpsuit  while  his 
           parents  ride  up  FRONT.  They’re  PISSED. 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        Why  the  hell  were  you  driving 
                        around  naked? 

                                 ANDY
                        It  was  just  a  dare!  It  was  stupid. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        You  have  been  completely out  of 
                        control  this  summer! 

                                 ANDY
                        This  is  the  first  time  I’ve  been 
                        arrested!  When  he  was  young,  Dad 
                        got  arrested  twice  for  pulling 
                        parking  meters  out  of  the  ground. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        The  eighties  were  different  times, 
                        and  I  was  broke.  

                                 ANDY
                        Even  you’ve  been  arrested  once  Mom! 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        I  was  protesting  the  World  Bank!  

                                 ANDY
                        Well,  I’ve  been  protesting  clothes 
                        and  curfews.  Those  are  the  only 
                        battles  my  generation  have  left  to 
                        fight. 

           Suddenly  -  GRONK! - the  ENGINE  of  the  Volvo  makes  an  AWFUL 
           SOUND.  However  -  like  a  cat  hacking  up  a  hairball  -  it  works 
           the  problem  out,  and  keeps  rolling.  

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        You  need  to  get  that  checked. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        It’s  fine.  Volvos  run  forever. 
                             (beat)
                        Andy  -  no  more  arrests!

                        You  have  my  word.  

           INT.  OCEAN  VIEW  COUNTRY  CLUB  -  MORNING

           Andy  is  in  the  office  early,  working  on  a  BRACKET  for  a 
           juniors  tournament,  when  YACO  walks  in  and  pulls  up  a  chair. 
           Yaco  STARES  at  Andy  from  a  few  inches  away,  UNNERVING  him. 

                                 ANDY
                        What? 

                                 YACO
                        I  heard  about  your  driving 
                        incident. 

                                 ANDY
                        It  was  just  a  dare  that  went  wrong. 

                                 YACO
                        Oh,  Gabby  dared  you  to  flee  from 
                        her  house  naked? 

           Andy  gives  Yaco  a  LOOK.  Yaco knows.

                                 ANDY
                        How  do  you-

                                 YACO
                        I  too,  am  fucking  Gabby!  For  many 
                        years  now.  The  things  she  does  with 
                        her  pinky,  I  know  all  about 
                        these... 

           SALVATORE  enters  the  office,  PISSED. 

                                 SALVATORE
                        As  do  I! 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh,  God. 

                                 YACO
                        But  now  you  start  doing  the  same... 
                        and  you  almost  get  caught.  And  if 
                        you  get  caught,  suspicion  falls  on 
                        all  the  pros  at  the  tennis  club, 
                        does  it  not? 

           Yaco  and  Salvatore  STARE  at  Andy  disdainfully.  

                                 YACO
                        Such  sloppy  behavior,  we  cannot 
                        risk. 
                                 SALVATORE
                        No  more  sleeping  with  the  women! 
                        You  will  ruin  everything! 

                                 ANDY
                        You  can’t  tell  me  what  to  do... 

                                 YACO
                        No,  but  I  can.  Stop  giving  private 
                        lessons  or  you’re  fired.  Salvatore 
                        and  I  have  it  covered. 

           Andy  looks  at  Salvatore,  who  is  about  to  kill  Andy.   

                                 ANDY
                        Fine.  I’ll  stop. 

           EXT.  BEACH  PARTY  -  NIGHT

           A  party  on  a  PRIVATE  BEACH  -  makeshift  TIKI  BAR,  lots  of 
           pretty  girls  running  around  in  CAFTANS.  A  few  brave  souls 
           have  SWAM  OUT  to  a  platform  in  the  ocean,  and  are  DRINKING  in 
           their  wet  clothing. 

           There  are  a  few  FAMILIAR  FACES  here,  partiers  we’ve  seen  at 
           early  parties  -  Emily,  Tinsley,  etc. 

           Andy,  Spice,  the  Lion  and  Nora  are  standing  together  on  the 
           beach  along  with  ERLAND  and  a  couple  of  PREPPY  GUYS  from 
           Connecticut  (both  18). 

           Andy  keeps  looking  at  Erland’s  HAND  -  which  is  squarely  on 
           Nora’s  ASS.  Andy  is  drinking  a  glass  of  something  clear  -  of 
           the  group,  it  seems  like  he’s  had  the  most. 

                                 PREPPY  GUY  #1
                        Did  you  find  going  to  public  school 
                        was  a  disadvantage  when  it  came  to 
                        applications? 

                                 SPICE
                        Compared  to  private  school? 

                                 THE  LION
                        If  you’re  shmart  enough,  it  doesn’t 
                        matter  where  you  come  from. 
                             (beat)
                        Now  -  drugs. 

                                 PREPPY  GUY  #2
                             (re:  his  chest  pocket)
                        Right  here. 

           The  Lion  heads  off  with  the  Preppy  Guys  to  do  some  drugs. 
           Everybody  watches  him  go. 
                                 ERLAND
                        MIT  and  drugs  -  he’ll  probably 
                        solve  cold  fusion  his  freshman 
                        year. 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        I’m  pretty  sure  you  don’t  know  the 
                        Lion  well  enough  to  weigh  in  on 
                        what  he’s  going  to  do. 

                                 NORA
                        Andy...  

                                 ANDY
                        We’re  going  to  college  in  three 
                        weeks.  Aren’t  there  some  Valkyries 
                        around  to  escort  you  back  to  Sweden 
                        so  that  I  don’t  have  to  have  you  in 
                        my  sightline  every  moment  for  the 
                        rest  of  the  summer? 

                                 ERLAND
                        It  was  a  joke... 

                                 ANDY
                        Excuse  me. 

           Andy  heads  off  down  the  BEACH. 

           EXT.  JETTY  -  LATER

           Andy  sits  on  a  ROCK  at  the  end  of  a  JETTY  by  himself,  looking 
           out  at  the  water.  Nora  slowly  makes  her  way  over  the  rocks 
           and  takes  a  seat  next  to  him. 

                                 NORA
                        Totally  fucking  unacceptable!  What 
                        is wrong  with  you  lately? 

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll  apologize  to  him  when  I  come 
                        in. 

                                 NORA
                        No.  I  want  to  know  what  is  going 
                        on. 

                                 ANDY
                        We’ve  got  three  weeks  left 
                        together,  and  I  don’t  feel  like 
                        sharing  that  time. 

                                 NORA
                        Erland  isn’t  around  that  much. 
                                 ANDY
                        He’s  around  whenever  you’re  around.

                                 NORA
                        That’s  because  he’s  my  boyfriend! 

                                 ANDY
                        I’ve  got  a  bad  feeling  about  him. 

                                 NORA
                        I  don’t  care! Why  would  you  want  to 
                        ruin  this  for  me? 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        You  couldn’t  have  waited  three  more 
                        months  to  get  hot?  So  I  wouldn’t 
                        have  to  deal  with  it? 

                                 NORA
                             (stunned)
                        What? 

                                 ANDY
                        For  fifteen  years  you  were  an 
                        asexual  creature  -  and  then  it’s 
                        like  in  the  space  of  three  weeks 
                        this  happens!  You’re  the  class 
                        valedictorian!  You  are  supposed  to 
                        blossom  for  the  reunion!  Not  now! 

                                 NORA
                             (totally  shocked)
                        I had no  clue  you  felt  that  way. 
                        How  do  you  feel  that  way? 

                                 ANDY
                        I  don’t  know.  I  do. 

                                 NORA
                        That  would  be  so  weird!  You  and  me? 
                        What  the  hell?  

                                 ANDY
                        It wouldn’t  be  weird!

                                 NORA
                        Oh  yeah? 

           Nora  puts  her  hand  on  ANDY’S  CROTCH  and  he  ALMOST  LEAPS  OFF 
           THE  JETTY. 

                                 ANDY
                        JESUS!  Nora! 

                                 NORA
                        See?  Totally  not  meant  to  happen! 
                        Here’s  another  example: 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NORA (cont'd)
                             (beat)
                        I  want  you  to  fuck  me. 

                                 ANDY
                        Holy  crap  stop! 

                                 NORA
                        Now  you  try.  Say  something  dirty. 

                                 ANDY
                        Agh!  Alright!  I’m  convinced! 

                                 NORA
                        See?  You  can’t.  I’m  telling  you  - 
                        we  know  each  other  too  well.  Holy 
                        shit  Andy!  Let’s  forget  about  this. 
                        Good  lord. 

                                 ANDY
                        Fine. 

                                 NORA
                        You’ve  got  a  beachful  of  girls  out 
                        here  that  think  you’re  cool.  Only  I 
                        know  the  truth. 

           Andy’s  PHONE  rings.  He  looks  at  the  number. 

                                 NORA
                        You  get  service  out  here? 

                                 ANDY
                        Verizon. 

                                 NORA
                        Who  is  it? 

                                 ANDY
                        Private  tennis  lesson. 

                                 NORA
                        Somebody  is  calling  you  about  a 
                        private  tennis  lesson  at  this  time 
                        of  night? 

                                 ANDY
                        I  agree  it’s  unusual. 

                                 NORA
                        Does  it  maybe  have  something  to  do 
                        with  why  you  were  driving  around 
                        naked? 

           Andy  looks  at  Nora  and  NODS  slowly.  Nora  BURSTS  OUT  LAUGHING. 

                                 NORA
                        You. Whore.
                                 ANDY
                        I’m  just  trying  to  get  some 
                        experience. 

                                 NORA
                        Come  on.

           Nora  stands  and  pulls  Andy  up.  Together,  they  carefully  make 
           their  way  over  the  ROCKS  back  to  the  beach. 

           INT.  BEACH  HOUSE  -  LATER

           This  is  the  BEACH  HOUSE  serving  as  the  base  for  the  beach 
           party,  filled  with  partying  kids.  

           Andy  is  holding  an  empty  cup  and  walking  down  the  hallway 
           looking  for  the  DRINK  COUNTER.  As  he  walks,  the  partiers  TOSS 
           CANDY  at  him  -  GUM,  MILK  DUDS,  whatever’s  around. 

           Andy  PLUCKS  all  the  PROJECTILES  out  of  the  AIR  with  his  MOUTH 
           and  is  CHEERED  HEARTILY  with  every  catch.  He  passes  ERLAND, 
           who  is  talking  to  a  GIRL  who  isn’t  Nora.  

                                 ANDY
                        Erland! 

           Erland  turns  to  look  at  him. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  sorry  about  what  I  said  out 
                        there.  But  I  still  don’t  trust  you. 

                                 ERLAND
                        You’re  an  ass,  Andy. 

           Andy  gets  himself  another  drink. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  promise  you  -  if  you  hurt  her,  I 
                        will  kill  you.  I  will  fly  to 
                        Stockholm  if  I  have  to.  I  will  rent 
                        huskies  and  I  will  track  you  down 
                        to  your  igloo.  Watch. 

           Andy  tosses  a  handful  of  pretzels  at  Erland  and  heads  out  the 
           door. 

           LATER...

           Andy  stands  with  SPICE  on  the  beach.  He  and  Spice  are 
           watching  the  Lion,  who  is  on  his  BACK,  BALANCING  a  girl  on 
           his  FEET  Cirque  du  Soliel-style. 

                                 ANDY
                        Man.  The  Lion  has  really  gone  full-
                        blown  crazy.  
                                 SPICE
                        I  know.  He  taught  me  the  Quivering 
                        Palm  technique  the  other  day. 

                                 ANDY
                        The  Touch  of  Death? 

                                 SPICE
                        Yeah,  the  Touch  of  Death. 

                                 ANDY
                        Seems  irresponsible.

                        He  was  really  high  at  the  time. 

           Andy’s  PHONE  rings  again.  He  looks  at  the  number,  and  then  at 
           Nora  and  Erland  sitting  next  to  each  other  on  a  couple  of 
           BEACH  CHAIRS. 

                                 ANDY

                        that’s  okay.  See  you  soon.

                        It’s  not  a  lesson!

                        After  this,  I’m  out.

                        One  last  big  job  before  retirement. 
                        That  always  works  out  well. 

           Andy  laughs,  finishes  off  his  drink  and  heads  off  down  the 
           Beach. 
           EXT.  BEACH  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  walks  along  the  sand  by  himself,  looking  up  at  the 
           HOUSES  above  the  BLUFF.  From  the  shore,  all  the  houses  look 
           pretty  similar  -  weathered,  big  decks,  flag  pole. 

                                 ANDY
                        There  it  is.  

           Andy  spots  Diana’s  house  ascends  the  PRIVATE  STEPS  to  her 
           BACK  DOOR.  

           EXT.  HOUSE  /  BACK  PORCH  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  KNOCKS  LIGHTLY  on  the  back  door  to  the  house.  It  is  DARK 
           inside,  but  Andy  can  see  a  LIGHT  FLASHING  in  the  LIVING  ROOM. 
           He  knocks  again.  No  answer.  He  slides  open  the  GLASS. 

                                 ANDY
                        Diana? 

           INT.  HOUSE  -  CONTINUOUS

           Andy  makes  his  way  through  the  house  to  the  LIGHTS  of  the 
           living  room.  LOUD  MUSIC  is  playing,  drowning  out  his  VOICE. 

                                 ANDY
                        Diana,  you  in  here?...  Diana,  it’s 
                        Andy!  

           The  MUSIC  PAUSES  and  Andy  finally  SEES  the  scene  inside  the 
           living  room. 

           One  of  Andy’s  high  school  CLASSMATES  (18)  is  sitting  on  the 
           COUCH  playing  GRAND  THEFT  AUTO  with  a  BOY  (11).  Both  of  them 
           are  LOOKING  at  Andy,  perplexed. 

                                 CLASSMATE

                        I  was...  looking  for  Diana. 

                                 CLASSMATE
                        You  mean  Mrs. Bradfield?  She  lives 
                        next  door. 

           Andy  winces  -  shit. 
                                 CLASSMATE
                        Weird  person  to  be  looking  for  at

                        Who  is  this  guy? 

                                 CLASSMATE
                        This  is  Andy.  We  went  to  high 
                        school  together.  Sort  of.

                        He  and  his  friends  had  their  own 
                        group.  We  didn’t  have  much 
                        interaction.  They  didn’t  exactly 
                        come  to  our  parties.

                        show  up.  Actually  -  you  should  come 
                        to  the  Summer  Dump  party.

                        When  is  it?

                        sure  Diana  is  waiting  for  you. 
                             (beat)
                        You  should  have  brought  her  to 
                        prom.  She  could  have  chaperoned  and 
                        been  your  date. 

           Andy  walks  out  of  the  house  like  a  zombie,  not  sure  what  just 
           hit  him. 
           EXT.  HOUSE  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  walks  out  of  the  house.  He  BEGINS  to  type  out  a  TEXT 
           MESSAGE  -  Hey  Diana,  don’t  think  I’ll  be  able  to  make  it 
           tonight...   

           Then,  he  looks  at  DIANA’S  HOUSE  next  door  and  REJECTS  that 
           idea.  He  begins  the  trek  across  the  LAWN  to  her  HOUSE.

           the  windowsills,  and  VACUUMING  the  FLOOR.  Then  -  barumpf!  - 
           something  CLOGS  her  VACUUM. 

           She  stops  the  vacuum  and  checks  for  the  source  of  the  jam. 
           It’s  ANDY’S  BLUE  HEADBAND,  from  the  last  time  he  was  with 
           Gabby.

           we  saw  earlier. 

           The  Lion  seems  to  be  RESIDUALLY  HIGH.  Perhaps  he  didn’t  get 
           high  this  morning...  but  there’s  definitely  some  chemicals 
           still  floating  around  in  his  bloodstream.

           The  Lion  sees  himself  in  the  MIRROR  of  the  Dojo,  and  like  a 
           PARAKEET,  he  becomes  FASCINATED  with  his  own  REFLECTION.  

           Without  his  instruction,  the  kids  STOP  KICKING.  Behind  him, 
           the  class  GRINDS  to  a  HALT.  His  BOSS  (40s,  blonde,  karate 
           outfit)  STARES  at  him  from  the  DOJO  OFFICE,  shaking  his  HEAD.

                        She’s  eighteen.  I  know,  it’s  almost 
                        like  it’s  not  right. 

           Nora  looks  around  a  CORNER  and  sees  Erland  on  the  PHONE.

                        Not  quite  -  we  got  invited  to 
                        Summer  Dump. 

           Nora,  Spice  and  the  Lion  are  SHOCKED.

                        We  got  invited  to  Summer  Dump? 

                                 NORA
                        We  have  never  been  invited  to  the 
                        Summer  Dump! 

                                 SPICE
                        Our  classmates  must  be  able  to 
                        smell  that  we’re  popular  now,  and 
                        they  want  to  see  it  for  themselves. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  think  we  should  go.

                                 THE  LION
                        They  don’t  like  us! 

                                 ANDY
                        I  don’t  care.  I  want  to  see  it 
                        once.   

           Then,  Andy’s  PHONE  rings.  He  looks  at  the  number. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Who  is  it? 
                                 ANDY
                        It  says  ‘unknown.’ 

                                 NORA
                        That’s  terrifying. 

           Andy  picks  up  the  phone. 

                                 ANDY
                        Hello? 

           INT.  LOGAN  INTERNATIONAL  AIRPORT  /  BOSTON  -  SAME  TIME

           ...And  on  the  other  end  of  the  line,  DANYA  (18,  Indian, 
           smoking  hot)  is  calling  him  from  the  AIRPORT. 

                                 DANYA
                             (accent)
                        Andy?  It’s  Danya! 

           INT.  BLEU  RESTAURANT  -  SAME  TIME

           Andy  looks  at  his  friends  in  COMPLETE  AND  TOTAL  SHOCK.  Holy! 
           Fucking!  Shit! 

                                 ANDY
                        Hi...  Danya! 

           Andy’s  friends’  JAWS  hit  the  floor. 

           INTERCUT  the  CONVERSATION  between  ANDY  and  Danya. 

                                 DANYA
                        I’m  at  the  airport! 

                                 ANDY
                        You’re  at  the  airport? 

                                 DANYA
                        You  said  to  come  at  the  end  of 
                        August,  yes?  Are  you  close?  I  can’t 
                        wait  to  see  you! 

                                 ANDY
                        I  can’t  wait  to  see  you  either!  I 
                        actually  had  some  car  trouble  so I 
                        won’t  be  able  to  get  there  for 
                        about  an  hour,  if  you  can  wait... 

                                 DANYA
                        I  can  wait...  The  plane  was  early 
                        anyway. 

                                 ANDY
                        I noticed  that!

                        Okay...  just  hold  on.  I’ll  be  there 
                        soon! 

                                 DANYA
                        Okay  Andy!  I’m  excited! 

                                 ANDY
                        Me  too!  Bye!

           Andy  hangs  up  and  POINTS  one-by-one  at  his  SHOCKED  FRIENDS. 

                                 ANDY
                        Danya  is  real  and  she  is  here  and I 
                        am  leaving  right  now  to  get  her!

                        She  just  showed  up? 

                                 ANDY
                        Indians  are  spontaneous.

                        I  think.  I  have  no  data  to  back 
                        that  up. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  coming.  I  have  to  shee  this. 

                                 NORA
                        I’m  coming  too.  I  can’t  go  back  to 
                        the  lab.

                        You  all  have  to  stay  here.  You’ll 
                        freak  her  out  if  you  come. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  promish  we’ll  let  her  have  the 
                        front  sheat. 

           EXT.  INTERSTATE  93  /  INT.  ANDY’S  BUICK  -  LATER

           Andy  speeds  the  Buick  down  the  interstate  as  the  Lion  and 
           Nora  sit  in  the  BACK,  being  chauffeured. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  done  with  drugs  and  alcohol.  A 
                        warrior  needs  his  mind  to  be  sharp. 
                        What  if  shomebody  had  attacked  me 
                        in  that  class? 

                                 NORA
                        Nobody  was  going  to  attack  you  in 
                        karate  lesson  for  third  graders.  
                                 THE  LION
                        You  can  never  be  shure.

           Nora  gets  a  CALL  on  her  phone.  It’s  from  ERLAND.  She’s 
           already  declined  THREE  of  his  calls.  She  clicks  it  off  again.

                                 ANDY
                        What  are  you  going  to  do  about 
                        Erland? 

                                 NORA
                        He  has  to  go  back  to  Sweden 
                        eventually. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  would  have  liked  to  hear  shome  of 
                        his  shongs. 

                                 NORA
                        They’re  not  that  good. 

           Andy  and  Nora  make  eye  contact  in  the  REAR  VIEW  MIRROR. 

                                 NORA
                        Please  don’t  say  ‘I  told  you  so.’ 

                                 ANDY
                        Can’t  trust  the  Swedes.  They 
                        supported  the  Nazis  during  WWII. 
                        Axis  power. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Actually,  they  were  officially 
                        neutral.  They  mostly  just  shupplied 
                        iron  ore  to  Germany-

                                 NORA
                        Please  shut  up.  My  relationship  has 
                        nothing  to  do  with  Nazi  Germany. 

           EXT.  LOGAN  INTERNATIONAL  AIRPORT  -  LATER

           Danya  is  standing  with  her  LUGGAGE  on  the  PICKUP  CURB  at  the 
           AIRPORT.  She  looks  beautiful  -  stylish  dress,  long  legs, 
           boots. 

           As  the  Buick  approaches,  Danya  SEES  Andy  through  the 
           WINDSHIELD  and  begins  WAVING  HAPPILY.  In  the  back  of  the  car, 
           the  Lion  and  Nora  can’t  believe  what  they’re  seeing. 

                                 THE  LION
                        You.  Hero.  

           Andy  is  GRINNING  HUGELY  as  he  pulls  up  to  the  CURB.  He  POPS 
           the  TRUNK  and  looks  BACK  at  his  friends. 
                                 ANDY
                        This  is  why  the  internet  is 
                        awesome. 

           Andy  gets  out  of  the  car.  As  soon  as  he’s  out,  Danya  runs  up 
           to  him  and  THROWS  her  ARMS  around  him.

                                 DANYA
                        Andy! 

                                 ANDY
                        Danya!  I’m  sorry  about  the  wai-

           Danya  KISSES  Andy.  The  Lion  and  Nora  watch  from  the  BACK 
           SEAT...  and  a  FLICKER  of  JEALOUSLY  crosses  Nora’s  FACE. 

           Andy  helps  Danya  with  her  bags...  and  for  the  first  time  she 
           notices  Nora  and  the  Lion  sitting  in  the  back  seat  like 
           neglected  children. 

                                 DANYA
                        Who  are  those  people? 

                                 ANDY
                        Don’t  know.  They  came  with  the  car. 

           INT.  ANDY’S  BUICK  -  LATER

           Andy  and  Danya  are  chatting  easily  in  the  front  seat  while 
           Nora  and  the  Lion  ride  in  the  back,  still  unable  to  believe 
           what  they’re  seeing. 

                                 DANYA
                        You  can’t  understand  anything  about 
                        the  world  if  you  don’t  read  Amartya 
                        Sen’s  Inequality  Reexamined.

                        I  read  Development  is  Freedom.

                                 DANYA
                        That’s  just  an  appetizer for 
                        Inequality  Reexamined. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  guess  you’ll  have  to  feed  me 
                        dinner. 

           Danya  LAUGHS.  Nora  is  silently  jealous.  The  Lion  leans 
           forward  in  his  seat. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Have  you  ever  read-

                             (rebuking)
                        Lion!
                                 THE  LION
                        Shorry. 

           The  Lion  slumps  back  in  his  seat. 

           INT.  OCEAN  VIEW  COUNTRY  CLUB  -  AFTERNOON

           On  the  DECK  of  the  country  club,  Gabby’s  Husband  is  having 
           DRINKS  with  a  group  of  OTHER  HUSBANDS.  He  takes  the  HEADBAND 
           out  of  his  pocket  and  puts  it  on  the  table. 

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND
                        I  called  Yaco  about  it.  He  swore  up 
                        and  down  it  wasn’t  his. 

                                 DIANA’S  HUSBAND
                        I  have  it  on  authority  that  Yaco  is 
                        gay.  He  would  never  touch  your 
                        wife. 

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND
                        And  she’s  not  into  Italians,  so 
                        Salvatore’s  out.

                        Did  you  ask  her  about  Andy? 

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND
                        The  high  school  kid?  No,  I  did  not. 
                        Why? 

                                 VICTORIA’S  HUSBAND
                        Because  when  Victoria  was  drunk  the 
                        other  night,  she  told  me  she  slept 
                        with  him.

           EXT.  BLEU  RESTAURANT  -  LATE  AFTERNOON

           Andy  drops  off  The  Lion  and  Nora  in  front  of  Spice’s 
           restaurant. 

           Spice  stands  on  the  sidewalk  next  to  his  friends,  WATCHING  as 
           Andy  and  Danya  waves  goodbye  to  the  three  of  them.  Danya 
           KISSES  Andy  on  the  cheek.

                        Her  nail  polish  was  chipped... 

           Spice  and  the  Lion  look  at  Nora  like  she’s  out  of  her  mind. 

           INT.  BED  AND  BREAKFAST  -  LATER

           Andy  checks  Danya  into  a  charming  BED  AND  BREAKFAST.  He  is 
           piling  FIFTIES  and  TWENTIES  into  her  open  PALMS  -  paying  for 
           the  whole  transaction  in  CASH. 

                                 INNKEEPER
                        And  she’ll  be  staying  a  week? 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  hoping  for  forever,  but  we  can 
                        start  with  seven  days. 

           Danya  LAUGHS. 

           MOMENTS  LATER...

           Andy  and  Danya  enter  the  cute  BEDROOM.  It’s  what  you  want 
           from  a  Bed  &  Breakfast  -  comfortable,  great  bathroom,  lots  of 
           antiques. 

           Danya  throws  herself  on  the  BED.  She  looks  at  Andy. 

                                 DANYA
                        Where  did  you  get  so  much  cash? 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        I’m  a  sperm  donor. 

           Danya  laughs. 

                                 ANDY
                             (re:  bathroom)
                        I’m  gonna  go  in  there,  and  then  I’m 
                        going  to  come  back  out  here,  and 
                        then  I’m  going  to  lay  down  there. 

           INT.  BATHROOM  /  BED  AND  BREAKFAST  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  stands  in  front  of  the  TOILET,  UNZIPS  his  PANTS,  starts 
           to  PEE...  and  YELLS  in  PAIN!  

                                 ANDY
                        Agggghhhh! 
           Oh  it  BURNS! 

           MOMENTS  LATER...

           Andy  walks  out  of  the  bathroom  a  little  gingerly.  Danya  looks 
           at  him  with  concern. 

                                 DANYA
                        Are  you  okay? 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  fine.

           Andy  walks  over  to  the  MINI  BAR  and  opens  the  DOOR. 

                                 ANDY
                        Diet  coke? 

           LATER...  

           Andy  sits  on  the  BED  watching  House  Hunters  International 
           with  Danya  snuggling  up  next  to  him.  Several  empty  bottles  of 
           DIET  COKE  sit  on  the  bedstand  next  to  him.  

           Danya  is  clearly  in  an  amorous  mood...  but  Andy  isn’t 
           reciprocating.  

                                 DANYA
                        I’m  so  glad  to  be  here...

                                 ANDY
                        Me  too. 
                             (beat)
                        Be  right  back.  Have  to  pee  again. 

           MOMENTS  LATER...

           Andy  PEES  again,  with  the  SAME  RESULTS. 

                                 ANDY
                        Agggghhhh! 

           It  BURNS!  Andy  walks  out  of  the  bathroom  and  looks  at  Danya 
           lying  on  the  bed.  Perfect.  Beautiful.  Right  here. 

                                 ANDY
                        So...  I  need  to  go  do  something, 
                        but  I’ll  be  right  back.  I’m  so 
                        sorry.  Just  got  a  call. 

                                 DANYA
                             (disappointed)
                        You’ll  come  back? 
                                 ANDY
                        I’ll  be  back  so  soon... 

           Andy  kisses  Danya  on  the  cheek  and  hustles  out  of  the  room. 

           EXT.  WOODS  HOLE  HOSPITAL  -  LATER

           Andy  speeds  his  Buick  into  the  PARKING  LOT  of  the  local 
           HOSPITAL. 

           INT.  EXAMINATION  ROOM  /  WOODS  HOLE  HOSPITAL  -  LATER

           Andy  sits  in  a  MEDICAL  GOWN  on  the  EXAM  TABLE.  A  DOCTOR  (40s, 
           female)  takes  his  information  down  on  a  CLIPBOARD. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        How  long  have  you  been  sexually 
                        active? 

                                 ANDY
                        Two  and  a  half  months. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Number  of  partners? 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        Twenty-two. 

           The  doctor  looks  over  her  clipboard  at  Andy.  Andy  SHRUGS, 
           embarrassed.  The  doctor  snaps  on  a  pair  of  sterile  gloves. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Open  your  robe. 

           INT.  DOCTOR’S  OFFICE  -  LATER

           Andy  is  back  in  his  clothes,  sitting  across  the  desk  from  the 
           doctor.  She  is  looking  over  his  RESULTS  and  writing  him  a 
           SCRIPT.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Looks  like  you  have...  a  yeast 
                        infection. 

                                 ANDY
                        A yeast  infection? 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Men  can  get  yeast  infections  too, 
                        particularly  if  you’re  having  a  lot 
                        of  intercourse  and  your  immune 
                        system  is  repressed,  which  would  be 
                        the  case  if  you’ve  been  drinking  a 
                        lot  of  alcohol. 
                                 ANDY
                        Oh my God.   

                                 DOCTOR
                        Just  be  glad  it  isn’t  something 
                        worse.  Lucky  for  you,  it’s  curable 
                        with  a  seven  day  course  of 
                        treatment. 

           The  doctor  gets  out  her  PRESCRIPTION  PAD.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’ll  prescribe  you  pills,  but  many 
                        women  also  have  success  putting  non-
                        sweetened  pro-biotic  yogurt 
                        directly  on  the  infection.

                                 ANDY
                        -How  did  this  happen?  I’ve  been 
                        careful  every  time...

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’ve  been  having  a  lot  of  sex, 
                        Andy.  Things  happen. 

           The  Doctor  HANDS  Andy  the  prescription. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Lay  off  sex  for  the  next  week  and 
                        you’ll  be  fine.  You  don’t  want  to 
                        give  this  to  your  partner.  

                                 ANDY
                        Lay  off  the  next  week?  I  can’t! 

           The  Doctor  looks  at  Andy  like  he’s  crazy. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes,  you  can. 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        Can  I  pay  for  this  visit  in  cash?  I 
                        don’t  want  it  to  pop  up  on  my 
                        parents’  insurance  bill. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’ve  slept  with  twenty-two  women 
                        in  the  last  two  months  and  you 
                        carry  that  kind  of  cash? 
                             (beat)
                        Who  are  you? 

           INT.  ANDY’S  BUICK  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  takes  the  LAST  of  his  CASH  out  of  the  glove  compartment 
           and  sadly  WALKS  BACK  to  the  hospital  to  PAY. 
           INT.  BED  AND  BREAKFAST  -  NIGHT

           Andy  stands  outside  Danya’  ROOM,  distressed  about  his 
           situation.  

                                 ANDY
                             (to  himself)
                        What  are  you  going  to  say  to  her...

           He  takes  a  deep  breath  and  quietly  opens  the  door...  and 
           finds  Danya  ASLEEP  on  the  bed.  Tuckered  out  from  a  long 
           flight. 

                                 ANDY
                             (to  himself)
                        Thank  God...

           Andy  LIES  DOWN  next  to  her  and  CLOSES  his  eyes. 

           BEGIN  ANDY-WITH-DANYA  SEQUENCE!

           -  Andy,  Nora,  the  Lion  and  Spice  are  on  the  BEACH,  sitting  in 
           chairs,  looking  out  at  Danya  standing  on  a  FLOATING  PLATFORM 
           in  the  ocean.  She  is  in  a  BIKINI.  She  looks  UNBELIEVABLE.

                                 THE  LION
                        Are  you  shertain  she’s  not  a  spy 
                        sent  to  kill  you  or  shomething? 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  not  sure  I’m  a  high-value 
                        target. 

           Danya  JUMPS  into  the  water.  The  Lion  and  Spice  stare.  

                                 NORA
                        I’m  going  for  a  walk. 

           Nora  gets  out  of  her  chair  and  starts  to  head  down  the  beach. 
           Andy  watches  her  go.

           -  Andy  and  Danya  watch  a  MOVIE  together  at  a  local  MOVIE 
           THEATRE.  They’re  the  only  people  in  the  room.  She  KISSES  him 
           and  he  kisses  her  BACK,  though  he’s  a  little  UNCOMFORTABLE. 

           -  Andy  DIPS  his  COCK  in  some  ACTIVIA  YOGURT,  battling  his 
           yeast  infection. 

           -  In  the  room  back  at  the  Bed  &  Breakfast,  Danya  tries  to 
           take  off  Andy’s  CLOTHES.  He  STOPS  her  from  doing  so,  fake-
           wincing. 

                                 ANDY
                        Sunburn!  I’m  sorry. 

           -  Andy  SHOWERS  by  himself,  BANGING  his  head  against  the  TILE 
           WALL  in  SEXUAL  FRUSTRATION. 
           -  At  the  Woods  Hole  Aquarium,  Andy  and  Danya  stare  at  the  SEA 
           LIONS.  Danya  seems  TOTALLY  BORED,  but  Andy  is  really  WATCHING 
           those  things,  obviously  just  trying  to  kill  time  and  not  make 
           eye  contact  with  Danya. 

                                 DANYA
                        Andy...  we  have  been  here  an  hour. 

                                 ANDY
                        Is  that  it?  I  could  stay  here  all 
                        day. 

                                 DANYA
                        Do  you  want  to  go  back  to  the  hotel 
                        with  me?  

                                 ANDY
                        The  workers  are  going  to  feed  them 
                        soon... 

                                 DANYA
                             (sadly)
                        Okay...

           Danya  goes  back  to  looking  at  the  sea  lions.  Andy  steals  a 
           GLANCE  at  her  and  GRIMACES,  HATING  HIMSELF. 

           INT.  WOODS  HOLE  OCEANOGRAPHIC  INSTITUTION  -  DAY

           Nora  has  her  LAB  COAT  on  and  is  working  at  her  MICROSCOPE, 
           when  ERLAND  comes  walking  over  to  her. 

                                 ERLAND
                        Hey,  where  have  you  been?  I’ve  been 
                        calling  you. 

                                 NORA
                        I’ve  been  looking  for  your  dick 
                        with  this  microscope. 

                                 ERLAND
                        What? 

                                 NORA
                        I  heard  you  talking  to  a  girl  on 
                        the  phone  the  other  day.  You  were 
                        talking  about  how  I  was  only 
                        eighteen  and  you  could  use  a 
                        “replacement,”  I  believe  was  how 
                        you  put  it. 

           Erland  stares  at  Nora  like  she’s  out  of  her  mind. 

                                 ERLAND
                        Come  with  me. 
           Erland  walks  away  from  Nora.  She  follows.  He  stops  in  front 
           of  a  TANK  in  which  a  STRANGE-LOOKING  FISH  is  SWIMMING. 

                                 ERLAND
                        This  a  Nassau  Grouper,  a  severely 
                        overfished  species  native  to  the 
                        Caribbean.  I’m  studying  it  to  find 
                        out  how  we  can  sustain  its 
                        population. 
                             (beat)
                        The  average  lifespan  of  the  Nassau 
                        Grouper  is  sixteen  years.  This  one 
                        is  eighteen.

                        Therefore  I  may  need  a  replacement.   
                        I  was  talking  to  an  Oceanographer 
                        colleague  at  the  University  of 
                        Delaware. 

                                 NORA
                        Oh. 

                                 ERLAND
                        But  if  you  find  my  dick  under  that 
                        microscope,  please  make  sure  you 
                        return  it  to  me.  I  need  it  for  my 
                        next  girlfriend. 
                             (beat)
                        You  and  your  friends  are  crazy. 
                        Good  thing  you  have  each  other.  

           Erland  walks  away  from  Nora,  who  feels  like  an  idiot. 

           EXT.  ROAD  LEADING  TO  DUMP  -  NIGHT

           The  Buick  rumbles  down  a  LONG  DIRT  ROAD  towards  the  TOWN 
           DUMP.  Andy  is  driving,  Danya  is  in  the  passenger  seat,  and 
           Spice,  Nora  and  the  Lion  are  in  the  back. 

           The  road  is  full  of  POTHOLES  and  everyone  in  the  car  is  being 
           JOSTLED  VIOLENTLY.  Andy  gives  Danya  a  REASSURING  LOOK. 

                                 DANYA
                        In  America...  does  everybody  party 
                        in  the  garbage? 

                                 THE  LION 
                        No,  tonight  is  shpecial. 

           EXT.  DUMP  /  REFRIGERATOR  GRAVEYARD  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  pulls  into  a  corner  of  the  parking  lot  filled  with 
           BROKEN  RUSTING  REFRIGERATORS.  Crappy  CARS  are  parked  all  over 
           this  place.  A  GAP  in  the  REFRIGERATOR  PILE  shows  the  WAY. 
                                 ANDY
                        I  guess  this  is  where  we  start. 

           EXT.  DUMP  /  FORBIDDEN  PATH  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  and  his  friends  make  the  HARROWING  JOURNEY  through  the 
           dump  to  the  party. 

           The  path  is  NIGHTMARISH  -  they  pass  piles  of  CAR  BATTERIES 
           and  BROKEN  TVs.  A  heap  of  DIRTY  MATTRESSES  blocks  their  way, 
           and  they  have  to  find  another  way  around. 

           Danya  nearly  tumbles  into  a  pit  of  LIGHTBULBS  -  but  the  Lion 
           GRABS  her.  She  smiles  gratefully. 

                                 SPICE
                        We  should  turn  back. 

                                 ANDY
                        We’re  not  turning  back. 

           An  endless  field  of  PROPANE  TANKS  stretches  in  front  of  them, 
           and  Andy  forges  the  passage  through,  stepping  around  them 
           like  they’re  land  mines. 

           It  seems  like  they’re  never  going  to  make  their  way 
           through...  and  then  they  see  FIRES  up  ahead. 

                                 ANDY
                        Keep  going!  I  see  a  light! 

           EXT.  SUMMER  DUMP  PARTY  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Andy  and  his  cohorts  crest  a  HILL  and  arrive  at  the  promised 
           land  of  the  Summer  Dump  Party,  and  it’s  a  scene  out  of  Lord 
           of  the  Flies.  

           The  party  is  taking  place  in  the  part  of  the  dump  where  CARS 
           go  to  die.  DERELICT  VEHICLES  pepper  the  landscape  and  pieces 
           of  TWISTED  METAL  catch  the  moonlight. 

           It’s  a  remote  place  for  a  party,  which  is  why  it’s  happening 
           here. 

                                 NORA
                        How  did  the  cars  get  here? 

                                 ANDY
                        There  must  be  an  access  road 
                        somewhere. 

                                 NORA
                        Why  didn’t  we  take  the  access  road?    
                                 ANDY
                        We  didn’t  know  about  the  access 
                        road.

           FIRES  roar  in  metal  BARRELS.  FIREWORKS  explode.  MUSIC  blares. 
           HUNDREDS  of  HIGH  SCHOOL  KIDS  are  running  around  in  various 
           states  of  undress. 

           The  party  orbits  around  the  SEVEN  KEGS  at  its  center,  which 
           are  actively  being  drained.  A  CAR  HOOD  serves  as  a  makeshift 
           TABLE  for  additional  alcohol. 

           As  soon  as  Andy  and  his  friends  CREST  the  HILL  above  the 
           party,  a  SPOTLIGHT  shines  their  FACES.  Somebody  SHOUTS  at 
           them  through  a  MEGAPHONE. 

                                 MEGAPHONE
                        IDENTIFY  YOURSELF. 

           Andy  and  his  friends  have  their  HANDS  in  front  of  their  faces 
           to  block  the  SPOTLIGHT. 

                                 ANDY
                        It’s  Andy,  Nora,  Spice  and  the 
                        Lion. 

                                 MEGAPHONE
                        WHO  IS  THE  HOT  GIRL.

                                 ANDY
                        Nora! 

           Danya  shoots  Andy  a  LOOK. 

                                 ANDY
                        ...And  Danya!  Danya. 

           The  spotlight  PANS  AWAY  from  their  FACES. 

                                 MEGAPHONE
                        HOLY  SHIT.  IT’S  THE  SMART  KIDS.  

           The  party  ROARS  in  APPROVAL.  

                                 MEGAPHONE
                        HAVE  YOU  COME  FOR  METAL  FOR  YOUR 
                        ROBOTICS  LAB?  

                                 ANDY
                        We  came  to  hang  out. 

           Another  ROAR. 

                                 MEGAPHONE
                        YOU  HEARD  THEM,  THEY  WANT  TO  HANG.  
                        THEY  HAVE  EXTRA  BRAIN  CELLS.  FIND 
                        THOSE  CELLS  AND  DESTROY  THEM. 
           There  is  a  final  ROAR  from  the  crowd.  Andy  and  his  friends 
           descend  the  hill  to  the  party.  It’s  on. 

           BEGIN  SUMMER  DUMP  PARTY  SEQUENCE

           -  As  Andy  and  his  friends  get  to  the  bottom  of  the  hill,  they 
           are  WARMLY  EMBRACED  by  their  CLASSMATES. 

                                 HUGGY  CLASSMATE  #1
                        I  can’t  believe  you’re  here!  Why 
                        have  you  never  come  before? 

                                 ANDY
                        Because  everybody  hated  us... 

                                 HUGGY  CLASSMATE  #2
                        Are  you  serious?  Everybody  liked 
                        you!  You  guys  never  just  hung  out. 
                        I  always  thought  you  were  the 
                        unapproachable  ones. 

                                 THE  LION
                        There’s  no  way  that’s  true. 

                                 HUGGY  CLASSMATE  #1
                        The  fact  you’re  smart  doesn’t 
                        automatically  mean  you’re  an 
                        outcast. 

                                 HUGGY  CLASSMATE  #2
                        So  you  had  a  few  people  that  gave 
                        you  a  hard  time.  Everybody  does. 
                        But  the  rest  of  us  would  have  loved 
                        to  have  you  come  party.  

           Andy  and  his  friends  are  ROCKED  by  this  revelation  -  they 
           could  have  always  come.  People  liked  them. 

           -  Andy,  Nora  and  Spice  accept  SHOTS  from  their  CLASSMATES  - 
           who  absolutely  LOVE  having  them  here.  That  said,  the  Lion 
           ABSTAINS. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Shtaying  sharp.  

           Andy,  Nora  and  Spice  DRINK  with  their  classmates,  who  are 
           getting  a  huge  KICK  out  of  this.  One  DRUNK  CLASSMATE  gives 
           Nora  a  look  that  lasts  a  COUPLE  SECONDS  TOO  LONG. 

                                 DRUNK  CLASSMATE
                        You  got  hot! 

                                 NORA
                        Thank  you! 

                                 DRUNK  CLASSMATE
                        You  used  to  not  be  hot!
                                 NORA
                        I  know! 

                                 DRUNK  CLASSMATE
                        But  now  you’re  HOT! 

                                 NORA
                        Thank  you! 

           -  The  music  is  blasting  and  everybody  is  DANCING.  In  his  own 
           dancing,  Andy  is  (physically)  located  somewhere  between  Nora 
           and  Danya.  He’s  mostly  dancing  by  himself,  but  he  dances  with 
           Danya  for  a  moment,  then  with  Nora.  Danya  looks  upset. 

           -  Andy’s  phone  VIBRATES.  He  takes  it  out  and  looks  at  it,  but 
           it’s  just  his  ALARM.  He  takes  his  ANTIBIOTICS  out  of  his 
           pocket,  gets  a  PILL  and  washes  it  down  with  some  CHEAP  VODKA 
           he  stole  from  the  booze  table.  

           -  The  CLASSMATE  who  convinced  Andy  to  come  to  the  party  at 
           the  beach  GRABS  him  and  PULLS  him  towards  a  PILE  of  DIRTY 
           MATTRESSES.  The  CLASSMATE  is  now  holding  the  MEGAPHONE. 

                                 CLASSMATE

           The  crowd  ROARS. 

                                 ANDY
                        Ron...  I’m  not  doing  this.

           A  pair  of  RING  GIRLS  rip  off  Andy’s  SHIRT  and  tie  ARM  BANDS  - 
           broken  balloons  -  around  his  BICEPS.  One  of  the  girls  paints 
           his  FACE  with  her  LIPSTICK,  giving  him  the  ULTIMATE  WARRIOR 
           appearance  we  saw  in  the  beginning. 

                                 CLASSMATE
                        AND  TO  DEMONSTRATE  THOSE

                        YOUR  CLASS  PRESIDENT  ANDY...  WILL 
                        BE  WRESTLING  STEROID  TOMMY! 

           Across  the  PILE  OF  MATTRESSES,  Andy  sees  his  opponent  STEROID 
           TOMMY  -  the  ripped,  drunk  classmate  who  harassed  Andy  and  his 
           friends  earlier  at  the  mini  golf  course. 

                                 STEROID  TOMMY
                        Think  you’re  smart? 

                                 ANDY
                        If  I  was,  I  wouldn’t  be  here. 

           Andy  and  Steroid  Tommy  square  off  across  the  mattresses  as 
           everybody  WATCHES,  and... 

           MOMENTS  LATER...

           Andy  is  GETTING  KILLED.  Pro  wrestling-style,  Steroid  Tommy  is 
           hitting  him  with  ELBOW  DROPS  and  EUROPEAN  UPPERCUTS. 
           Dropkicks.  Shining  Wizards. 

           Steroid  Tommy  is  treating  this  SERIOUSLY,  looking  to  cause 
           some  PAIN.  And  he  is. 

           Andy  is  almost  unconscious,  when  -  his  head  spinning  -  he 
           sees  NORA  on  the  SIDELINES,  looking  CONCERNED.

                                 NORA
                        Get  up,  Andy! 

           Andy  looks  at  NORA.  He  looks  at  her  BREASTS,  her  LEGS,  her 
           LIPS  -  parts  OFF-LIMITS  to  him.  He  begins  SHAKING  like  HULK 
           HOGAN  getting  off  the  MAT. 

                                 ANDY
                        Arrggghhh!

           Andy  unsteadily  climbs  to  his  FEET.  He  looks  at  Nora’s  HIPS, 
           her  NECK,  her  HAIR.  Finally,  he  faces  off  against  Steroid 
           Tommy  AGAIN.  The  crowd  CHEERS.  It’s  exactly  like  Rocky. 

           Steroid  Tommy  LUNGES  at  Andy  one  last  time,  but  Andy  PARRIES 
           the  attack,  climbs  on  Tommy’s  BACK  and  CHOKES  HIM  OUT.  

           Steroid  Tommy  DROPS.  Andy  throws  up  his  hands  in  TRIUMPH. 

                                 CLASSMATE
                             (through  megaphone)
                        LADIES  AND  GENTLEMEN  -  PRESIDENT  OF 
                        THE  HONOR  SOCIETY,  ROLL  OF  HONOR 
                        RECIPIENT  AND  MATTRESS  WRESTLING 
                        CHAMPION  -  ANDY  EVANS! 

           Andy  stands  on  the  pile  of  mattresses  like  it’s  the  TOP  ROPE, 
           throwing  his  arms  up  in  triumph  to  the  audience. 
           -  Spice  drunkenly  pours  himself  a  ladle  of  PUNCH  at  the 
           alcohol  table.  He  TASTES  the  punch  and  almost  SPITS  it  out. 

                                 SPICE
                        Horrible... 

           Spice  grabs  some  of  the  assorted  MIXERS  people  have  brought  - 
           ginger  ale,  Sunny  D,  Hawaiian  Punch  -  and  begins  pouring  them 
           into  the  PUNCH  BOWL. 

           He  tastes  the  punch,  likes  the  direction  it’s  heading,  adds  a 
           bit  more  Sunny  D. 

           ZELDA  walks  over,  also  tipsy.  

                                 SPICE
                        What  are  you  doing  here? 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  was  invited!  What  are  you  doing 
                        with  that  punch? 

                                 SPICE
                        Improving  it,  I  hope.  Want  to  try? 

           Spice  pours  Zelda  a  cup  of  the  punch.  She  starts  to  sip  it... 
           and  then  GLUGS  it  DOWN. 

                                 ZELDA
                        It’s  great!

                                 SPICE
                        Thank  you! 

           Spice  gets  himself  a  cup  and  pours  Zelda  another  one.  They 
           clink  glasses... 

           -  ...and  we  cut  to  Zelda  giving  Spice  an  EPIC  STANDING 
           HANDJOB  behind  a  PILE  of  DISCARDED  AIR  CONDITIONING  UNITS.  

                                 ZELDA
                             (jerking)
                        Grab  onto  a  bigger  air  conditioner! 
                        You  need  a  steadier  base! 

                                 SPICE
                             (in  ecstasy)
                        I’m  solid!  Just  keep  going! 

           -  The  Lion  is  drinking  a  COCA-COLA  -  and  that’s  is  ALL  that 
           he  is  drinking.  He  is  wandering  through  the  party,  when  he 
           comes  upon  Danya  sitting  BY  HERSELF,  clearly  UPSET. 

                                 DANYA
                        Hey,  Lion. 

                                 THE  LION
                        You  okay? 
                                 DANYA
                        I  came  from  France  thinking  this 
                        was  going  to  be  this  big,  romantic 
                        trip...  but  I  don’t  think  Andy  even 
                        likes  me. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I’m  shure  he  likes  you.  How  could 
                        he not...

                                 DANYA
                        I’ve  been  here  a  week,  and  he 
                        hasn’t  touched  me. 

                                 THE  LION
                             (surprised)
                        He  hasn’t  touched  you? 

           Danya  shakes  her  head.  The  Lion  looks  at  Andy,  who  isn’t 
           paying  attention. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Do  you  want  to  go  shomewhere  to 
                        talk  about  it? 

                                 DANYA
                        Aren’t  we  talking  about  it 
                        somewhere  now? 

                                 THE  LION
                        Yeah.  But  there  are...  other 
                        shomewheres. 

           Danya  and  the  Lion  make  eye  contact.  It’s  on.  

           -  Andy  REFILLS  his  drink  at  the  table,  having  the  time  of  his 
           life...  when  he  sees  the  HEADLIGHTS  of  a  CAR  driving  down  the 
           long  SERVICE  ROAD  towards  the  party.

           The  headlights  give  him  a  BAD  VIBE.  He  STARES  at  them  for  a 
           moment...  and  then  they  TURN  OFF.  Blackout.  Andy  furrows  his 
           brow.  Hmm. 

           -  The  Lion  and  Danya  are  HOOKING  UP  in  the  BACK  SEAT  of  a 
           DECREPIT  CAMARO.  The  frame  of  the  car  may  be  a  disaster... 
           but  the  upholstery  is  completely  fine. 

           For  a  moment  he  STOPS  MAKING  OUT  with  Danya. 

                                 DANYA
                        What  is  it? 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  thought  I  shensed  shomething. 

           The  Lion  continues  HOOKING  UP  with  Danya. 
           -  Andy  looks  out  over  the  PARTY.  His  classmates  are  dancing, 
           and  he  is  half-doing  the  same.  Having  fun.  Fitting  in  with 
           his  classmates. 

           Then...  he  SEES  SOMETHING  APPROACHING,  and  this  should  take 
           us  STRAIGHT  BACK  to  the  FIRST  SCENE  of  the  movie:  Andy  is 
           concerned.  This  is  not  good. 

           Andy’s  PHONE  BUZZES.  Still  looking  into  the  distance,  he 
           pulls  it  out  of  his  pocket  and  CHECKS  IT.  It’s  his  MOM.  She’s 
           called  a  DOZEN  TIMES. 

           He  looks  down  at  the  phone,  and  then  at  the  APPROACHING 
           THREAT.  He  sighs.  He  PICKS  UP  THE  PHONE,  and  we’re  RIGHT  BACK 
           where  we  BEGAN  THE  MOVIE.

                                 ANDY
                             (wincing;  into  phone)
                        Hi...  mom. 

           EXT.  DUMP  SERVICE  ROAD  -  SAME  TIME

           A  MOB  of  ANGRY  HUSBANDS  descends  the  service  road  towards  the 
           party  below. 

           The  LEADER  of  the  mob  is  Gabby’S  HUSBAND,  but  there  are  more 
           than  a  DOZEN  of  them  here  -  MATT  DAMON  included  -  carrying 
           CHAINS  and  pieces  of  WOOD.  Murder  in  their  eyes. 

           [Note:  I  obviously  realize  we’re  not  going  to  get  Matt  Damon 
           here,  but  I  feel  a  recognizable  celebrity  should  be  a  part  of 
           this  throng.] 

           EXT.  SUMMER  DUMP  PARTY  -  SAME  TIME

           By  now,  Andy  knows  exactly  what’s  coming,  staring  up  at  the 
           approaching  MIDDLE-AGED  MEN. 

                                 ANDY
                        Mom,  you  know  I’ve  never 
                        disappointed  you  before...  but  if 
                        anything  happens  to  me  tonight,  and 
                        you  discover  why  it  happened,  you 
                        might  be  a  little...  vexed.
                             (beat)
                        I’m  sorry.  I  have  to  go. 

                                 ANDY’S  MOM  (O.C.)
                        Andy! 

           Andy  CLICKS  OFF  his  phone  and  prepares  for  the  advancing 
           swarm.  He  STRETCHES  and  takes  a  LONG  SWIG  of  his  CHEAP  VODKA, 
           preparing  to  die. 

           Nora  spots  him,  half  in  the  bag  herself. 
                                 NORA
                        What  are  you  doing? 

           Andy  NODS  his  head  at  the  LYNCH  MOB  coming  to  kill  him. 

                                 NORA
                        They’re...  looking  for  you? 

                                 ANGRY  HUSBAND  (O.C.)
                        I’m  going  to  eat  your  brains,  Andy! 

           Andy  looks  at  Nora  and  shrugs.  Yup. 

                                 NORA
                        What  are  you  going  to  do? 

                                 ANDY
                        Die,  probably. 

                                 NORA
                        I  would  offer  to  help  you,  but  I’d 
                        be  useless. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  pretty  useless  myself  in  this 
                        situation. 

           The  mob  is  getting  closer.  Andy  can  see  their  EYES. 

                                 ANGRY  HUSBAND  #2
                        I  see  you,  Andy! 

           Andy  balls  his  hands  up  into  FISTS,  even  though  he  has  no 
           idea  what  the  hell  he’s  doing. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  love  you,  by  the  way.  I  know  you 
                        know  that,  but  I  want  to  express 
                        it.  Verbally.  

           Nora  smiles.  Finally. 

                                 NORA
                        You  know  you’re  the  first  guy  to 
                        ever  tell  me  that? 

                                 ANDY
                        There  will  be  so  many  more.  How 
                        could  anybody  not? 

                                 NORA
                        You  should  probably  tell  Danya  the 
                        same...  

                                 ANDY
                        I  don’t  love  Danya.  I  never  even 
                        hooked  up  with  her.  
                                 NORA
                        Why? 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        I  have  a  yeast  infection. 

                                 NORA
                        A yeast  infection?  

                                 ANDY
                        It’s  fully  curable.  

                                 NORA
                        Fully  curable? 

           Before  Andy  can  EXPLAIN,  the  furious  THRONG  of  HUSBANDS  is 
           RUSHING  at  him,  FISTS  AND  WEAPONS  OUT!  Andy  TIGHTENS  his 
           FISTS,  preparing  to  GO  DOWN  FIGHTING,  like  a  MAN...  

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND
                        Glad  we  found  you,  Andy... 

           The  dozen-plus  men  CHARGE  Andy,  out  for  blood.  And  just  as 
           they’re  about  to  get  to  him...  

           THWACK  THWACK  THWACK  THWACK  THWACK!

           THE  LION  appears  in  the  CENTER  OF  THE  MOB  and  DROPS  the  FIRST 
           THREE  HUSBANDS  with  a  CRAZY  COMBINATION  of  PUNCHES  and  KICKS. 

           The  time  has  come  for  the  Lion  to  fight. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Leave  him  alone! 

                                 GABBY’S  HUSBAND
                        This  has  nothing  to  do  with  you! 

                                 THE  LION
                        If  it  hash  to  do  with  my  friend,  it 
                        hash  to  do  with  me. 

                                 ANDY
                        Lion?  You  sure  about  this? 

                                 THE  LION
                        Yeah.  This  is  a  totally 
                        jushtifiable  use  of  force. 

                                 ANDY
                        Fantastic. 

           The  Lion  takes  a  FIGHTING  STANCE  as  he  SQUARES  OFF  against 
           the  DOZEN  remaining  HUSBANDS. 
           Danya  watches  from  the  SIDELINES,  ADJUSTING  her  clothing. 
           Andy  NOTICES  her  fiddling  with  her  dress  -  what  the  fuck?  - 
           and  then... 

           The  CHARGE  IS  ON! 

           The  HUSBANDS  charge  the  Lion  from  ALL  SIDES,  and  the  Lion 
           immediately  becomes  the  GREATEST  MARTIAL  ARTIST  of  all  time. 

           BANG  BANG  BANG  BANG  BANG  BANG!

           The  Lion  takes  out  ALL  the  husbands  in  RAPID  SUCCESSION.  ARM 
           BARS.  ROUNDHOUSE  KICKS.  HEAD  BUTTS.  FLYING  KNEES. 

           He  takes  out  MATT  DAMON  with  a  THAI  KICK  to  the  KNEE.  Matt 
           Damon  DROPS.  The  Lion  looks  at  his  friends. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I told  you!  Matt  Damon’s  knee! 

           BANG  BANG  BANG!  Within  seconds,  ALL  the  husbands  are  SPLAYED 
           OUT  on  their  BACKS.  The  Lion  has  just  taken  out  FIFTEEN  GUYS 
           without  BREAKING  A  SWEAT. 

           Looking  around  at  his  DEFEATED  OPPONENTS,  the  Lion  takes  a 
           BREATH  and  KISSES  Danya. 

                                 ANDY
                             (watching  kiss)
                        That’s  interesting. 

           Then:  WHOOOP! 

           POLICE  CARS  stream  down  the  ACCESS  ROAD,  sending  kids  FLEEING 
           through  the  DUMP. 

           The  Lion  stands  in  the  middle  of  all  the  defeated  husbands 
           writhing  on  the  ground.

                                 ANDY
                        Lion,  we’ve  got  to  go! 

                                 THE  LION
                        No.  I  did  this,  I  accept 
                        reshponsibility. 

           The  Lion  winks  at  Danya,  who  SWOONS.

                                 ANDY
                        Fine.  If  you’re  staying,  so  am  I. 

                                 SPICE
                        Me  too. 

                                 NORA
                        And  me. 
           The  four  friends  -  and  Danya,  by  default  -  STAND  TOGETHER  as 
           the  COP  CARS  come  to  a  STOP  in  front  of  them.  Everybody  else 
           has  run  away.  They’re  alone  amidst  the  ruins  of  the  party. 

           The  front  police  car  opens  up,  and  the  COP  who  picked  Andy  up 
           for  driving  nude  gets  out  with  his  PARTNER.  The  Cop  looks 
           around  at  the  UNCONSCIOUS  MEN  lying  on  the  GROUND. 

                                 COP
                        Who  did  this? 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  did,  shir. 

                                 COP
                             (beat;  impressed)
                        They  deserve  it? 

                                 NORA
                        They  were  coming  to  kill  Andy. 

                                 COP
                             (to  Andy)
                        We  got  the  mortgage.  Twenty  year 
                        fixed.  Thanks  again. 

                                 ANDY
                        My  pleasure. 

           The  Cop  turns  to  his  PARTNER  and  the  COPS  in  the  SECOND 
           CRUISER. 

                                 COP
                        Looks  like  nothing  to  see  out  here, 
                        is  there? 

                                 PARTNER
                        Hate  these  false  reports. 

                                 COP
                        You  kids  want  a  ride  out  of  here? 

                                 ANDY
                        Absolutely. 

           Andy  and  his  friends  get  into  the  BACKS  of  the  Police 
           Cruisers,  leaving  the  HUSBANDS  knocked  out  on  the  GROUND.  AS 
           they  depart,  Andy’s  classmates  APPLAUD  and  CHEER. 

                                 CLASSMATE
                             (through  Megaphone)
                        YES!  LEGENDS! 
           EXT.  EVANS  HOME  -  LATER

           The  POLICE  CRUISER  rolls  up  in  front  of  the  Evans  home. 
           Inside  the  house,  we  see  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Evans  FREAK  OUT  and 
           head  for  the  DOOR. 

           Andy  hops  out  of  the  BACK  of  the  cruiser  -  still  looking  like 
           the  Ultimate  Warrior  -  and  shuts  the  door. 

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks  guys! 

                                 COP
                             (waving)
                        Good  luck  at  college,  Andy! 

           The  cruiser  pulls  away  just  as  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Evans  emerge  from 
           the  front  door. 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        Andy! 

                                 ANDY
                        Hi  Mom.  I’m  safe... 

                                 MRS.  EVANS 
                        What  was  that  on  the  phone? 

                                 ANDY
                             (beat)
                        I  had  a  little  too  much  to  drink. 

                                 MR.  EVANS 
                        If  I  even  smell  alcohol  on  you 
                        before  you  leave  this  house,  I’m 
                        sending  you  to  rehab  instead  of 
                        Dartmouth. 

                                 ANDY
                        Agreed. 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           EXT.  LOGAN  INTERNATIONAL  AIRPORT  -  DAY

           Andy  sits  in  the  DRIVER’S  SEAT  of  his  Buick,  an  irritated 
           look  on  his  FACE. 

           On  the  curb,  The  Lion  is  SAYING  GOODBYE  to  Danya.  They  are 
           ALL  OVER  EACH  OTHER  -  hugging,  kissing,  whispering  intimate 
           things. 

                                 DANYA
                        The  last  few  days...  I’ve  never 
                        experienced  anything  like  it. 
                                 THE  LION 
                        I  had  no  idea those  positions  had  a 
                        use  outside  of  karate. 

           Andy  rolls  his  eyes. 

                                 DANYA
                        Visit  me  as  soon  as  you  can.  

                                 THE  LION 
                        Let’s  shoot  for  winter  break.  I 
                        plan  on  being  a  millionaire  near 
                        the  end  of  first  shemester,  so 
                        we’ll  go  shomewhere  nice. 

           The  Lion  and  Danya  have  a  final  KISS  GOODBYE,  and  she  starts 
           heading  towards  the  TERMINAL.  She  stops  next  to  the  Buick. 

                                 DANYA
                             (cursory)
                        Bye,  Andy.  Good  luck  at  university.  

                                 ANDY
                        Have  a  safe  flight,  Danya. 

           Danya  rolls  her  LUGGAGE  through  the  AUTOMATIC  DOORS  and  is 
           GONE.  The  Lion  gets  in  the  PASSENGER  SEAT,  a  GRIN  on  his 
           face. 

                                 ANDY
                        You.  Ass.  Do  you  know  how  much  it 
                        cost  me  to  fly  her  over,  and  then 
                        you  end  up  with  her?  

                                 THE  LION
                        As  the  Japanese  proverb  goes: 
                        Nokorimono  ni  wa  fuku  ga  aru.

                                 ANDY
                        What  does  that  mean? 

                                 THE  LION
                             (smile)
                        Luck  exists  in  the  leftovers.

           Andy  shakes  his  head  and  STARTS  the  car. 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           BEGIN  PACKING-FOR-COLLEGE  SEQUENCE

           INT.  SPICE’S  ROOM  -  NIGHT

           Spice  is  in  his  room,  putting  his  CLOTHES  in  SUITCASES, 
           getting  ready  to  leave. 
           Both  his  MOM  and  DAD  are  sitting  in  the  room  with  him, 
           helping  him  decide  what  to  take,  and  so  forth.  A  family. 

           There  is  a  KNOCK  on  the  DOOR  downstairs.  Spice’s  dad  ANSWERS  - 
           it’s  ANDY. 

                                 SPICE’S  DAD
                        Andy. 

                                 ANDY
                        Hi  Mr.  Jennings...  do  you  mind  if  I 
                        borrow  Spice  -  Mike  -  for  a  couple 
                        hours? 

                                 SPICE’S  DAD
                        He’s  leaving  for  Stanford  tomorrow. 

                                 ANDY
                        That’s  the  reason  I  need  him. 

                                 SPICE’S  DAD
                             (considers  this)
                        Mike!  Andy’s  here. 
                             (beat)
                        When  do  you  leave  for  school? 

                                 ANDY
                        Also  tomorrow.  We  all  do. 

           INT.  THE  LION’S  BASEMENT  -  LATER

           The  Lion  is  jamming  all  his  MARTIAL  ARTS  EQUIPMENT  into  BOXES 
           -  punching  bags,  grappling  hooks,  etc. 

           He  pauses  in  front  of  a  FIGHTING  AXE  hanging  on  the  wall, 
           debating  whether  to  take  it  to  school.  His  PARENTS  are  there 
           to  make  the  decision  for  him. 

                                 LION’S  MOM
                        I  think  you  should  leave  the 
                        Fighting  Axe  at  home,  honey. 

                                 LION’S  DAD
                        At  least  until  you  get  a  sense  of 
                        your  roommate. 

           The  Lion  reluctantly  accepts  their  advice.  

                                 THE  LION
                        You’re  probably  right. 

                                 LION’S  DAD
                        I  don’t  know  what  we’re  going  to  do 
                        without  you,  kiddo...

                                 LION’S  MOM
                        ...Well,  maybe  we  do. 
                                 THE  LION
                             (shudders)
                        Please  don’t  turn  the  bashement 
                        into  a  weird  sex  room. 

           The  Lions  parents  give  each  other  a  look.  They’re  definitely 
           going  to  turn  it  into  a  weird  sex  room. 

           There’s  a  KNOCK  on  the  door  that  leads  to  the  outside.  Lion’s 
           Dad  answers,  to  find  ANDY  and  SPICE  standing  there. 

                                 ANDY
                        We  need  the  Lion  for  a  couple  of 
                        hours. 

           INT.  NORA’S  HOUSE  -  LATER

           Nora  goes  through  her  clothing  with  her  MOM.  Because  of  her 
           brand  new  body,  a  lot  of  her  clothes  DON’T  FIT  anymore.  She 
           throws  it  in  a  bag  marked  SALVATION  ARMY.

                                 NORA’S  MOM
                        ...You  promise  me  you  didn’t  have 
                        plastic  surgery  this  summer. 

                                 NORA
                        Yes,  mom. 

                                 NORA’S  MOM
                        I’d  be  worried  about  you,  if  all 
                        the  guys  at  Harvard  weren’t  latent 
                        homosexuals. 

                                 NORA
                        You  met  dad  at  Harvard. 

                                 NORA’S  MOM
                        Yes,  but  he  was  a  transfer.

                                 ANDY  (O.C.)
                        Nora?  Mrs.  Sullivan? 

           Nora’s  mom  looks  out  her  daughter’s  room  and  sees  ANDY,  SPICE 
           and  THE  LION  poking  their  heads  through  the  FRONT  DOOR. 

           EXT.  NORA’S  HOUSE  -  NIGHT

           Andy,  Spice,  Nora  and  the  Lion  WALK  across  the  lawn  towards 
           Andy’s  BUICK. 

                                 ANDY
                        Do  you  want  to  know  where  we’re 
                        going? 
                                 NORA
                        Like  I  don’t  know  where  we’re 
                        going. 

           EXT.  DARK  CAPE  COD  ROAD  -  NIGHT

           Andy  drives,  Nora  rides  shotgun  and  Spice  and  the  Lion  sit  in 
           the  BACK  as  Andy  pilots  the  car  over  a  RAILROAD  CROSSING  and 
           down  an  UNPAVED  ROAD. 

           There  is  TENSION  in  the  car  -  nobody  is  talking,  everybody  is 
           on  edge.  The  Lion  is  holding  a  WRENCH.  

           The  car  rolls  up  to  a  SIGN  that  says  PRIVATE  ROAD  -  UPPER 
           CAPELAND  NEIGHBORHOOD  ASSOCIATION. 

                                 ANDY
                        You  guys  ready? 

           Everybody  nods,  and  Andy  drives  the  car  DOWN  THE  ROAD. 

           EXT.  MIDGETVILLE  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Behold!  Midgetville! 

           Andy  drives  the  car  down  a  semi-paved  road  flanked  by  TINY  
           GINGERBREAD  and  VICTORIAN  HOUSES  on  either  side. 

           Many  of  the  houses  have  UNDERSIZED  TRUCKS  in  their  driveways. 
           SWING  SETS  hang  NOTICEABLY  LOW  to  the  ground.  The  friends 
           look  at  a  TINY  DOG  tied  to  a  TREE. 

                                 SPICE
                        I  see  one. 

           Spice  points  at  a  SPEED  LIMIT  9  1/2  SIGN  bolted  HIGH  UP  on  a  
           TELEPHONE  POLE. 

                                 NORA
                        Why  are  they  always  so  high? 

                                 ANDY
                        Probably  to  keep  people  from 
                        stealing  them. 
                             (beat)
                        Lion,  do  you  think  you  can  climb  up 
                        there?  

                                 THE  LION
                        Absolutely.  

                                 ANDY
                        Then  let’s  go  steal  it. 

           MOMENTS  LATER... 
           The  Buick  is  PARKED  UNDERNEATH  the  SPEED  LIMIT  SIGN,  and 
           Andy,  Spice  and  Nora  are  outside  the  Buick,  keeping  watch. 

           The  Lion  is  standing  on  the  ROOF  of  the  car,  using  it  to  make 
           up  some  of  the  distance  on  the  ASCENT  up  to  the  SIGN.  The 
           Lion  wraps  his  ARMS  around  the  POLE  and  starts  to  CLIMB. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Agh!  Shplinters!  

                                 ANDY
                        Shhh...

           The  Lion  finally  reaches  the  sign  and  begins  to  go  to  work 
           with  his  WRENCH  on  the  BOLTS.  He  BANGS  one  of  the  bolts  a  few 
           times,  making  a  CLANGING  METAL  SOUND. 

                                 SPICE
                             (whisper)
                        Don’t  make  so  much  noise... 

                                 NORA
                        Try  to  hurry. 

                                 THE  LION 
                             (straining)
                        The  bolt  won’t  give...

           Andy,  Nora  and  Spice  are  staring  up  at  The  Lion,  watching  him 
           strain  against  the  sign.  Andy  looks  around  to  make  sure 
           they’re  still  in  the  clear... 

           ...and  then  he  SEES  SOMETHING. 

                                 ANDY
                        Lion.  Stop  what  you’re  doing  right 
                        now. 

                                 THE  LION
                        I  think  I’ve  almost  got  it... 

                                 ANDY
                        I  mean  it.  Stop.

           The  Lion  stops  what  he’s  doing,  and  everybody  turns  to  see 
           what  Andy  is  looking  at. 

           ALL  AROUND  THEM  -  in  every  doorway,  every  window  -  LITTLE 
           PEOPLE  are  WATCHING  the  Lion  STEAL  THE  SIGN.  Shaking  their 
           TINY  HEADS.  Totally  DISAPPOINTED  in  what  they’re  seeing.

                                 ANDY
                        Get  down  from  the  pole. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Doing  it.  
           The  Lion  gets  down  from  the  pole  and  hops  off  the  BUICK.  More 
           and  more  Little  People  are  emerging  from  their  HOUSES  to 
           STARE.  Their  LITTLE  CHILDREN  are  upset.  LITTLE  DOGS  are 
           barking. 

           Andy,  Nora  and  Spice  open  the  car  doors  and  climb  inside. 

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry  about  that!

                                 NORA
                        Very  sorry! 

                                 SPICE
                        Bad  idea! 

                                 THE  LION 
                        Shorry!

           Andy  and  his  friends  get  in  the  car  and  drive  away,  humbled.

           MOMENTS  LATER... 

           The  friends  ride  in  silence,  overcome  by  what  they  have 
           witnessed.  Reeling  from  the  judgement  of  DOZENS  of  TINY  EYES.  

                                 ANDY
                        We’ll  get  it  next  summer. 

           Everybody  nods.  Yes  they  will.  And  with  that... 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           EXT.  THE  LION’S  HOUSE

           ...it’s  time  to  say  goodbye. 

           Andy  pulls  into  The  Lion’s  driveway.  Spice  shakes  his  hand. 
           Nora  leans  into  the  back  seat  and  gives  him  a  hug.  Andy 
           shakes  his  hand. 

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks  for  saving  my  life. 

                                 THE  LION
                        You’d  do  the  shame  for  me. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll  start  weight  training  in  case 
                        I’m  ever  called  upon. 

                                 THE  LION
                        Good  shummer,  everybody. 

           The  Lion  smiles.  He  gets  out  of  the  car  and  closes  the  door. 
           One  friend  is  gone.  Three  to  go. 
           EXT.  SPICE’S  HOUSE  -  LATER

           Andy  parks  outside  Spice’s  place.  Nora  gives  him  a  hug. 

                                 NORA
                        I’ll  miss  you. 

                                 SPICE
                        I’ll  miss  you  too. 

           Spice  reaches  into  the  front  seat  and  shakes  Andy’s  hand. 

                                 SPICE
                        Sir. 

                                 ANDY
                        When  I  visit  you  in  California, 
                        people  better  be  calling  you  Spice. 

                                 SPICE
                        I  may  start  them  out  with  “Mike” 
                        and  see  how  it  evolves  from  there.  
                             (beat)
                        See  you  at  Christmas  guys. 

           Spice  gets  out  of  the  car  and  waves  goodbye  to  his  friends. 
           Only  Nora  and  Andy  are  left. 

           EXT.  NORA’S  HOUSE  -  LATER

           Andy  pulls  up  in  front  of  Nora’s  house.  They  look  at  each 
           other,  and  both  GET  OUT. 

           Andy  and  Nora  HUG  each  other  in  the  driveway. 

                                 NORA
                        The  next  time  I  see  you,  you’ll 
                        have  an  enormous  Dartmouth  meathead 
                        beer  gut.  

                                 ANDY
                        The  next  time  I  see  you,  you’ll  be 
                        pregnant  by  a  Kennedy. 

                                 NORA
                        We’ll  hang  around  admiring  each 
                        other’s  bellies. 

           They  hug  each  other  again. 

                                 NORA
                        Love  you  too,  by  the  way. 

           Andy  looks  at  her,  searching  for  something... 
                                 ANDY
                        But  you  don’t  mean  that  in  the  same 
                        way  that  I-

                                 NORA
                             (cutting  him  off)
                        Andy... 

           Andy  stops  himself  from  saying  anything  else.  He  smiles. 

                                 ANDY
                        Don’t  make  any  new  friends  at 
                        school. 

                                 NORA
                        You  either. 

           Andy  and  Nora  look  at  each  other,  and  give  each  other  a  HUG. 

           Nora  begins  the  walk  to  her  house.  Andy  gets  back  in  his  car. 
           He  watches  to  make  sure  she  gets  inside  safe.  She  waves  to 
           him  from  the  front  door,  and  with  that... 

                                                                CUT  TO:

           INT.  EVANS  FAMILY  VOLVO  -  MORNING

           MUSIC  CUE:  “Black  Fur”  by  Fredrik. 

           Andy  sits  in  the  BACK  SEAT  of  the  Volvo,  CRAMMED  against 
           SUITCASES  and  BOXES  of  STUFF  for  COLLEGE.  Dry-erase  board. 
           Desk  lamps.  A  mini-fridge.  

           The  car  crosses  the  SAGAMORE  BRIDGE.  Andy  stares  out  the 
           window,  looking  at  the  CANAL.  The  water  looks  like  a  mirror. 

           In  the  front  seat,  Andy’s  Mom’s  eyes  are  WET.  

           THE  NEXT  THREE  HOURS... 

           Andy  looks  out  the  window  as  the  car  heads  to  Dartmouth.  Past 
           the  Boston  Garden.  Along  the  coast  near  Newburyport.  Across 
           the  border  into  New  Hampshire.  Passing  rural  countryside  - 
           meadows,  ruins  of  old  barns,  herds  of  cows. 

           It’s  around  the  time  that  they  pass  a  sign  that  says  HANOVER:  
           THREE  MILES  -  when  the  CAR  starts  to  FAIL. 

           The  engine  makes  the  same  GRONK  sound  it  made  after  Andy’s 
           arrest,  but  this  time  it  isn’t  RECOVERING  so  easily. 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                        I  told  you  to  check  this  out! 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        I  checked  it  out  myself! 
           The  car  LURCHES  forward  over  and  over,  willing  itself 
           onwards. 

           EXT.  DARTMOUTH  COLLEGE  -  DAY

           The  Volvo  LURCHES  through  the  leafy,  manicured,  most-New-
           England-Place-ever  campus  of  Dartmouth  College.  Colonial 
           architecture.  Nine  libraries.  Endless  grass-covered  fields.  

           The  SPUTTERING  CAR  approaches  Brown  Hall  -  Andy’s  DORMITORY. 
           There  is  a  LINE  of  STUDENTS  and  PARENTS  outside,  standing 
           with  their  own  piles  of  STUFF,  waiting  for  MOVE-IN  CARTS. 

           Finally,  the  car  rumbles  up  to  the  CURB  and  DIES. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        Shit!  Shit!   

           Everybody  in  line  turns  to  LOOK  at  ANDY’S  DAD  start  a 
           SWEARING  FIT  behind  the  wheel.  He  turns  the  IGNITION,  but  the 
           ENGINE  WON’T  START. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        SHIT! 

           Andy  gets  out  of  the  BACK  SEAT  and  gives  a  chagrined  WAVE  to 
           the  line. 

                                 ANDY
                        Hello!  First  impressions,  right?  

           Andy  opens  up  the  BACK  of  the  Volvo  and  starts  UNLOADING  his 
           stuff  onto  the  CURB,  while  his  DAD  pops  the  HOOD  and  begins 
           FIDDLING  with  the  engine. 

           Andy’s  new  classmates  continue  to  watch  his  dad  freaking  out. 
           Andy  offers  an  embarrassed  SMILE  to  the  line. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        Shit! 

           Andy  quickly  finishes  emptying  out  the  Volvo.  His  dad  gets 
           behind  the  wheel  and  turns  the  IGNITION  one  last  time.  The 
           ENGINE  STARTS. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        YES! 

           Leaving  the  car  running,  Mr.  Evans  gets  out  of  the  driver’s 
           seat,  closes  the  hood,  and  hugs  Andy. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        I  don’t  know  if  I’ll  be  able  to  get 
                        the  car  started  again.  You  going  to 
                        be  okay  if  we  head  back. 
                                 MRS.  EVANS 
                        We  haven’t  even  helped  him  move  in!  
                        I told  you  to  get  the  car  checked! 

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll  figure  it  all  out.  You  guys 
                        go. 

                                 MRS.  EVANS
                             (hugging  Andy)
                        I  love  you  so  much. 
                             (getting  emotional)
                        I’m  gonna  go  before  I-

                                 ANDY
                        I  love  you  too  mom. 

                                 MR.  EVANS
                        Love  you,  kiddo. 

                                 ANDY
                        Love  you  too,  dad. 

           Andy’s  parents  get  back  in  the  Volvo  and  with  a  wave  goodbye, 
           they’re  gone,  leaving  Andy  alone  on  the  curb,  standing  next 
           to  his  STUFF.  

           He  looks  at  the  freshmen  queued  up  with  their  parents  outside 
           the  dorm.  The  end  of  the  line  is  far  off.  He  grabs  the  fold 
           of  one  of  his  HEAVY  BOXES  and  starts  DRAGGING  it  towards  the 
           BACK  OF  THE  LINE. 

           A  PRETTY  FRESHMAN  (18)  steps  out  of  her  place  in  line  and 
           walks  over  to  Andy.  

                                 PRETTY  FRESHMAN
                             (accent)
                        Do  you  need  help?  I  saw  what 
                        happened. 

                                 ANDY
                        I  think  everybody  and  their  parents 
                        did. 

                                 PRETTY  FRESHMAN
                        Not  mine.  I’m  also  a  move-in 
                        orphan. 

                                 ANDY
                        Is  your  accent  French? 

                                 PRETTY  FRESHMAN
                        Swiss. 
                             (beat)
                        Long  way  from  home. 

                                 TINSLEY  (O.C.)
                        Hey  Andy,  heads  up!  
           Andy  turns  around  just  in  time  to  see  a  neon  green  SOUR  PATCH 
           KID  flying  STRAIGHT  AT  HIM  from  THIRTY  FEET  AWAY.   

           He  EFFORTLESSLY  CATCHES  it  in  his  MOUTH  and  smiles  at  the 
           thrower  -  TINSLEY,  the  girl  who  invited  everybody  to  the 
           first  party  at  Penzance  Point. 

           The  LINE  of  incoming  freshman  APPLAUDS  at  Andy’s  mouth-
           catching  abilities.  The  pretty  French  freshman  is  IMPRESSED. 

                                 PRETTY  FRESHMAN
                        Bravo! 

                                 ANDY
                        It’s  what  I’m  good  at. 

                                 PRETTY  FRESHMAN
                        I’m  sure  there  are  other  things. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m  Andy. 

                                 PRETTY  FRESHMAN
                        Lisette. 
                             (beat)
                        Which  box  do  you  want  me  to  take? 

                                 ANDY
                        All  of  them,  if  you  can. 

                                 PRETTY  FRESHMAN
                             (laughs)
                        I’ll  start  with  this  one. 

                                 ANDY
                        Perfect. 

           And  as  Lisette  picks  up  one  of  his  BOXES  and  walks  with  him 
           to  the  end  of  the  line,  we...  

                                                              CUT  TO  BLACK.

                                         THE  END
