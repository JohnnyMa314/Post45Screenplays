           A child’s hands sift quickly through a pile of hundreds of 
           puzzle pieces, feeling, searching, discarding... finding one.    

                                 YOUNG BOY (O.S.)
                        Sick on Thursday...

           JUSTINE, 10, severely autistic, long tangled hair, sits cross-
           legged in a child’s arm chair... she squirms, arms flap.   A 
           frustrated PRETTY NURSE kneels in front of her, works the 
           child’s Keds onto little bare feet. 

                                 PRETTY NURSE
                        Justine, please, your father wants 
                        shoes on you.

           The Nurse ties a sneaker, turns, stares at something os.

           A YOUNG BOY, 10, glasses, kneels on an area rug, working an

           Seated in a chair behind him, his LITTLE BROTHER, 7, swings 
           his legs, casts bored eyes about the room.

           Young Boy’s eyes ping-pong from the unseen puzzle to the

                        kids are often labeled as “geeks”,

                        rocking?  And that... that chant... 

           Young Boy’s eyes flit to the staring Nurse, making eye 
           contact for a split second before returning to the puzzle.

                        It’s called “stimming.”  Short for 
                        self-stimulation.  He does it to 
                        comfort himself.  To focus.  
                        Perfectly natural behavior.

           Little Brother notices Nurse staring at his big brother.  He 
           doesn’t like it, doesn’t like her.

                            (rope’s end)

                        treatment?  Drugs?  Something? 

           Nurse stands, task finished.  She gives Little Brother a 
           sympathy-smile, acknowledgement of a long-suffering sibling.

                        Is our son capable of living a 
                        normal life? 

           Little Brother’s stare burrows into the walking Nurse, eyes 
           cold, predatory.  A malevolent smile slowly forms.

           Young Boy’s eyes dart, suddenly alarmed, searching the floor, 
           the space around him... anxiety rising... panic...

           Justine GRUNTS, flaps a hand in the direction of a chair, 
           Little Brother clues in... follows her eyes.  An errant 
           puzzle piece.  

           Little Brother snags it, hands it to Young Boy... relief.

           Young Boy snaps the piece into place.  He cuts his eyes in 
           Justine’s direction, a small smile of thanks.

                        I know people think farmers make 
                        all sorts of money, what with food 
                        prices so high... but between 
                        insurance, fertilizer costs...

           A nameplate reads “Christian Wolff, CPA.”

           White shirt, tie, pocket protector, glasses -- CHRIS WOLFF -- 
           30, handsome, sits at a desk, rocking slightly; he fixates on 
           the tax forms scrolling down a CRT monitor. 

           Across from him sit FRANK and DOLORES RICE, 60s, sun-
           weathered Midwesterners... worried.

           He works the Dekalb hat in his calloused hands... Dolores 
           looks at Chris, a plea in her eyes.  

           Chris averts eye contact.

                                 DOLORES

                        our credit card? 

           Frank EXHALES, shaking his head... unmanned.  Dolores puts a 
           comforting hand on her husband’s forearm.  

           Chris notices the touch... shifts... uncomfortable.  He 
           double-clicks a mouse... the 1040 replaced with STREAMING 
           VIDEO of a STORAGE LOT.  

           The rocking stops.

                        Dolores?

                        Not at all.  We think it’s quite 
                        lovely. 

           Frank, thinking he’s part of the “we”, allows a weak smile.

           She smiles politely, not buying it.

                                 CHRIS
                        Ever sell one?

                        What?

                                 CHRIS
                        Mr. Rice, what is the approximate 
                        size of your dining room...
                            (pointed)
                        Mrs. Rice’s office.

                                 DOLORES
                        Oh, I can’t say as I’d call it an--

           Chris GRUNTS his exasperation.  Dolores, taken aback, looks 
           to her husband.  

           Seeing Chris’ play... the farmer straightens--

                                 FRANK
                        At least two-- 

           Chris SHAKES HIS HEAD, stares at his desktop. 

                                 FRANK
                        Three hundred square feet!

           Chris settles, adjusts his glasses.

                                 CHRIS  
                        Let’s discuss your company car.
           INT. COSMETIC DOCTOR’S OFFICE - MORNING  

           An ACTUAL-SIZE .45 CAL  PISTOL TATTOO low on a woman’s tan 
           hip... barrel angled at a panty-covered crotch.

                                 COSMETIC DOC (O.S.)
                        Nine millimeter?

           MARYBETH MEDINA, early 30s, Hispanic, attractive, stands, 
           holds the bottom of her blouse up, top of the panties down. 
           She suffers the moment... rolls a wrist, checks the time. 

                                 MARYBETH
                        Forty-five.  Doc, I’m in a hurry 
                        this morning, what the verdict?

           A COSMETIC DOC, 40s, paunchy, squats on a rolling stool in 
           front of her, takes too long inspecting, touching. 

                                 COSMETIC DOC
                        We can do it with a Q-switched
                        laser... but delicate, thin skinned 
                        areas are more prone to scarring.
                            (glances at her)
                        That would be a real crime. 

           She snaps her panties up, reaches for her skirt lying on the 
           exam table.  He rolls back, watches her get dressed.

                                 COSMETIC DOC
                        If you don’t mind me asking... why 
                        remove it?   Only the lucky few 
                        will see it. 

           He punctuates his remark with a finger-gun, fires it at her.

           She grins to herself, steps into the skirt, adjusts.

                                 MARYBETH
                        The guys a gun tat turns on don’t 
                        turn me on.  They all seem to 
                        lack... “heft.”

           He nods, fights to prevent the insult from showing.

                                 MARYBETH
                        I got it when I was sixteen.  I’m 
                        not that person anymore. 

                                 COSMETIC DOC
                        What do you do again?

           She slings her purse over a shoulder, heads for the door, 
           pauses to put her own finger-gun an inch from his head.
                                 MARYBETH
                        Federal agent.  I’ll make an 
                        appointment.  Thanks, Doc.  

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY   

           The Capitol... White House... Lincoln Memorial... Treasury. 

           INT. TREASURY - FINANCIAL CRIMES DIVISION - DAY

           Marybeth carries a box of personal items, trails a fast-
           walking bulldog of a FEMALE ADMIN into unfamiliar territory.

           SUPER: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network... Department of 
           the Treasury.

           Steady hum of high-gear busy.  Glass-walled offices.  Rows of 
           desks, shirt/tie wearing men, women in business suits... talk 
           on phones... flat-screen monitors stream financial data.  

           They approach the alpha-dog corner office... through glass 
           walls she sees Deputy Director RAY KING, 50s, crisp white 
           shirt, tie, pacing, talking.  

           INT. RAY KING’S CORNER OFFICE 

           The Admin deposits Marybeth in the open doorway.  Ray glances 
           over, calm, crooks a finger at her... she enters.  

                                 BANK PRESIDENT
                            (over speaker phone; 
                             irate)
                        Mr. King, you’ve wandered so far 
                        outside your legal purview... 

           Marybeth shifts the box in her arms, waits... scans the neat 
           room, commendations, plaques... an aura of power. 

                                 BANK PRESIDENT
                        The Abayed family have been clients 
                        of ours for years.  As president of 
                        Southern Trust Bank, I intend to 
                        protect my customer’s privacy--  

           Ray plucks the phone from the receiver, speaker killed.     

                                 RAY
                            (into phone; low boil)
                        Stop talking.  You have a cavalier 
                        attitude for the president of a 
                        bank with such a piss poor capital 
                        cushion.  Now, I want a record of 
                        every transaction Abayed has had in 
                        the last two years;

                        or Bahrain, it’s now Treasury 
                        business.  If I don’t have those 
                        S.A.R.s in twenty minutes my next 
                        call’s to Marty over at the 
                        F.D.I.C. in which I’ll be comparing 
                        Southern to the Bank of Kabul.  
                            (beat; listens)
                        Threat?  Here’s a threat; you 
                        explaining to the press the term 
                        “critically undercapitalized.”  I 
                        want what I want.  Immediately.      

           Ray smiles at the bankers’ response, he turns to his desk.

                                 RAY
                        I appreciate it.  

           He hangs up, drops into his chair, motions to Marybeth.

                                 RAY
                        “Purview.”  Sit, already. 

           He pulls a lower drawer open, searches... moving on...

           She puts the box on the floor... takes a seat facing him.

           Ray retrieves a fat folder, slide-slams the drawer shut.

                                 RAY
                        Slide closer, Ms. Medina.  Am I 
                        saying that correctly, “Medina?”

           She moves her chair closer to his desk.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Yes, sir.

           Ray places the thick file on his desk, studies her.

                                 MARYBETH
                        If I may, I’ve read all your case 
                        files, Deputy Director King.  

           He rolls monogrammed cuffs, continues to watch her.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Impressive work.  Very.

                        agent, they send me a junior agent.

           Chris stands by the open door, eyes down, the relieved Rices 
           leaving.  The receptionist sits, novel open, waiting.

                        I meant what I said, you’re welcome 
                        out to the place anytime.  You fish 
                        any?  We got a two-acre pond thick 
                        with bass and catfish.     

                                 CHRIS 
                        No, we don’t fish.  Sometimes we do 
                        a little target practice.

                                 FRANK

                        want to do a little plinkin’.   

           Frank offers a hand to Chris, they shake good-bye.

                                 FRANK
                        Take care, son.

           Chris produces a smile, weak but sincere.

           They nod to the receptionist and leave... Chris closes the 
           door... watches the couple through the sidelight.

                        Focus.  Not all are arrests.

           wait... back to the first... every photo... in the 
           background, not the target of the camera... we see the same

           glasses, dark suit, briefcase, walks away.

           She stops, confused... looks up at Ray.
                                 MARYBETH
                        “Accountant”?  What, like “CPA 
                        accountant”?  You’re kidding.  

           He gathers his thoughts, the explanation important to him.

                                 RAY
                        Hypothetically.  Say for a second  
                        you’re running the Sinaloa Cartel. 

                                 MARYBETH
                        I’m Joaquin “Shorty” Guzman.

           He suppresses most of a “not bad” smile, rolls on.

                                 RAY
                        The cartels count their cash by 
                        weighing it in eighteen wheelers, 
                        Medina.  But one sunny Mexican day, 
                        your in-house money-scrubber tells 
                        you you’re thirty million light.  
                        That money could have been siphoned 
                        off through half a dozen different 
                        leaks.  So who can you trust to do 
                        the forensic accounting, track your 
                        stolen cash?  Deloitte and Touche?  
                        H&R Block?     
                            (thoughtful beat)
                        No, you somehow, someway contact an 
                        individual capable of walking in 
                        cold, un-cooking years of books... 
                        and getting out alive.   

           She digests this, the enormity of that feat settling on her. 

                                 RAY
                        Recall what objects were rolled 
                        into a crowded Juarez nightclub a 
                        few years ago? 

                                 MARYBETH 
                        Half a dozen severed heads.

                                 RAY
                        Shorty G., plugging leaks.  Leaks 
                        found by...

           He taps a photo on the desk, “Lou Carroll”.

                                 MARYBETH
                            (skeptical)
                        The analysts think it’s the same 
                        person?  This Carroll.
                                 RAY
                        What you need to know, is I do.

                                 MARYBETH
                        The language barriers alone... he’d 
                        have to speak five, maybe six--

                                 RAY
                        Everybody speaks English, it’s the 
                        international language of money.

                                 MARYBETH
                            (flashes a photo; soft)
                        Not in Yemen.

                                 RAY
                        Four agents have worked on this.  
                        All came away with the same non-
                        conclusion:  Smoke.  Doesn’t exist.
                            (pointed)
                        Bullshit.

           She empties all opinion from her face, knows the drill.    

                                 RAY
                        I want to know who he is.  How he 
                        does it.  Who survives this kind of 
                        clientele?  The secrets this guy 
                        has will make your career, Medina.  
                        I retire in seven months.  Before I 
                        do, we will bring this man to 
                        justice.  You reading me, agent? 

                                 MARYBETH
                        One hundred percent.

           EXT. CHRIS’ RANCH HOME - SUNSET

           Middle-class suburb of cookie-cutter 1970’s ranchers.  End of 
           a cul-de-sac... a Ford F-150 pulls into a driveway.  

           INT. BARREN TWO-CAR GARAGE

           Chris parks the pickup truck in the usual spot. 

           Above the other spot, a tow chain hangs from a large pulley 
           connected to a rafter-high 4X6 beam.  Suspended from the 
           chain, what appears to be a TARP-COVERED TRANSMISSION.   

           The garage door closes. 

           INT. CHRIS’ HOME - NIGHT  

           Spartan.  Stock photos of staged model families smile out 
           from picture frames.  Furniture immaculate.   
           INT. KITCHEN  

           3 burners, 3 hot skillets... 3 pancakes bubble, 3 pieces of 
           bacon sizzle, 3 eggs fry.

           Chris, T-shirt and shorts, opens a cabinet... 1 plate, 1 
           bowl, 1 glass.  He takes the plate and glass. 

           INT. DINING NOOK

           Silence.  

           Chris sits at his table, preparing to eat.  He BLOWS TWICE on 
           his fingers -- lightly.  Picks up his fork.

           INT. CHRIS’ HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT  

           Chris, t-shirt and boxers, sits in the center of a queen-
           sized bed, legs extended... he rolls a cut-down BROOM STICK 
           up and down scarred shins... up... down... mind elsewhere.   

           His digital clock rolls 10:00.  He suddenly turns to his 
           nightstand. To the prescription bottle: “CHRISTIAN WOLFF... 
           PROZAC.”  He swallows one dry.  

           INT. RICE HOME - DAY 

           BINOCULAR LENS POV -- A FAT CANTALOUPE perched atop a sun-
           bleached fence post comes into focus... a SMILEY FACE inked 
           on it... three posts, three smiling cantaloupes.  

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                            (chuckles)
                        Somebody’s seen too many westerns.

                                 DOLORES (V.O.)
                        Leave the boy be already.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        He must be... what... a mile out?  
                        Not on my best day c--  

           The CANTALOUPE SILENTLY VAPORIZES IN A YELLOW MIST.  Three 
           seconds later, a distant ECHOING CRACK.   

           EXT. RICE FARM - DAY 

           Chris, jeans and sweatshirt... prone position... earplugs... 
           stares down a Leupold scope on a .50 CALIBER BARRETT SNIPER 
           RIFLE... KA-BOOM!  The heavy weapon bucks... KA-BOOM!

           INT. RICE HOME 

           BINOCULAR LENS POV -- The last canteloupe EXPLODES. 
           A mile of farmland blurs by as the lens searches... focuses: 
           Chris stands at the edge of the timber... gun in hand... 
           staring at the lens... he raises a hand “good-bye”... turns.  

           At a window, Frank lowers binoculars from stunned eyes.  

                                 DOLORES (O.S.)
                        Wouldn’t kill you to go out and 
                        give him a few pointers, y’know...  

           EXT. STORAGE LOT - SECURITY GATE - SUNSET

           Window down, Chris’ pickup idles up to a guard shack...      
           Inside, a bored GUARD nods toward the truck...

                                 GUARD
                        Watcha got there, Mr. Wolff?

           Chris looks in the direction of the nod... considers the fat 
           rolled rug leaning against the passenger seat... turns...

                                 CHRIS
                        Fifty-caliber sniper rifle inside 
                        an eighteenth century Turkish rug.  

           The guard gives a lazy “whatever” smirk... the gate lifts.

           EXT. STORAGE LOT 

           A wide lane bordered by storage buildings... fifty identical 
           14-foot-high overhead doors on each side. 

           INT. STORAGE UNIT   

           Dark.  Interior lights glow from the windows of a 34-foot 
           AIRSTREAM TRAILER.

           INT. AIRSTREAM -- SERIES OF SHOTS

           Mini wall-mounted Bose speakers... low classical music.

           Strands of Christmas tree lights sparkle along upper blonde 
           wood walls... the lighting diffused... warm... home.   

           DINING AREA... a laptop open on the table... a framed RENOIR 
           hangs on a wall... a tiny CAMERA high in a corner.    

           TOY HAULER AREA... Tie-downs leash a CONFEDERATE WRAITH 
           MOTORCYCLE... a CRAFTSMEN tool chest... on wall racks: the 
           Barrett... scoped DAKOTA T-76... pistol-grip MOSSBERG 12 
           GAUGE... KALASHNIKOV with banana clip. 
           INT. AIRSTREAM - BEDROOM  

           An original “Star Wars” LIGHT SABRE mounted on the wall... on 
           the handle, a signature in black marker... George Lucas. 

           Light from a Tiffany lamp on a bedside nightstand.

           Chris lies on the bed, a worn hardback book -- READING BODY
           LANGUAGE -- open on his chest.  He stares up at... a large 
           framed JACKSON POLLOCK mounted flush to the ceiling.

           He daydreams... lost in chaotic swirls of viscous paint. 

           INT. DETENTION CENTER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Dark.  Small.  Institutional.  

           BUNK BEDS.  Bottom bunk, beneath a thin sheet, FRANCIS 
           SILVERBERG, 70s, bare-chested and frail, reminisces...      

                                 FRANCIS
                            (New York accent)
                        All the world's a stage, and all 
                        the men and women merely players:
                        They have their exits and their 
                        entrances; and -- listen to me now -
                        - one man in his time plays many 
                        parts.

           In the top bunk, Chris, t-shirt, floats some bait... 

                                 CHRIS
                        What are we talking about, again? 

                                 FRANCIS
                        Life, Forrest Gump!  Life!  Pay 
                        attention, would you?  This stuff 
                        is gold--    

           Chris chuckles, Francis catches on... laughs.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Okay, putz.  You know, you oughtta 
                        be kissing my ass, you’re getting a 
                        Harvard PhD in black money.  

           The two enjoy each other’s company.  The old man quiets... 
           staring up... melancholy sets in...

                                 FRANCIS
                        My wedding anniversary was Friday.  
                        Would have been fifty years. 
                            (sentimental beat)
                        My Esther.  She’d have liked you.
           Chris ponders the statement, struggles with a response. 

                                 FRANCIS
                        This is where you say, “So, you’re 
                        another year older, Francis... get 
                        over it.”  And I say, “You’re 
                        right.  What’s another year?”  And 
                        then you say...?

                                 CHRIS
                            (matter-of-fact)
                        You’re sad.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Yes.  Yes, Einstein, I’m sad!  
                        Christ... If you ever get out of--
                            (hot)
                        You can’t just wander through life 
                        with no one to care about.

           Silence for a long beat.  Francis regrets his tone...

                                 FRANCIS
                        We’re all just dashes on 
                        headstones, kid.  You remember 
                        that.  Life is lived between the 
                        numbers.  

                                 CHRIS

                        Meyer Lansky!  

           Francis HOWLS, shoves the bottom of Chris’ bunk... Chris 
           smiles.  LOUD BANGING at the door.

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        HEY!  Lights out, in there!

                                 FRANCIS
                        HEY!  Fuck you, out there!

           Francis turns on his side, settles in with a SIGH...  

                                 FRANCIS (O.S.)
                        Night, Carl.  

           Chris stares at the ceiling... wears boxers, no sheet on him.  
           Around an ankle: a DIGITAL MONITOR... its red light blinks.
                                 CHRIS 
                        Good night, Francis.

                                                             RETURN TO:

           On the other end of the phone a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKS...

                        Legit for a switch.  Hope it’s not 
                        too dull.  Director’s cut is 
                        waiting for you.  Go to work, you

           A granite “CREATIVE ROBOTICS” sign... a tree-lined campus... 
           a large ultra-modern glass structure. 

           The sound of two people walking fast... talking fast...

                        Bad idea, worse timing.  Not one of

           Chris, suit and tie, pocket protector, stands compliant, arms 
           outstretched.  A SECURITY GUARD waves a metal-detector baton 
           over him. 

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        Apparently, the kind who produces 
                        results.

           RITA BLACK, 60s, handsome and EDWIN “ED” CHILTON, 60s, large, 
           no smile, sit together... face Chris around a large table.

                                 CHRIS
                        No, sir.

           Rita cracks a smile... Chris forces a stare, parrots the 
           smile. 

                                 ED
                        Uh, Mr. Wolff, I half suspect we’re  
                        wasting your time. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We’re certain you’re not.

                                 ED
                            (defensive)
                        And you know this how?

                                 CHRIS
                        We’re on the clock.

           Rita’s smile reaches her eyes. 

           Chris lifts his briefcase onto the table, pops locks, lid...

                                 ED
                            (insincere laughter)

                        wasting ours then... 

           Chris pulls a folder from the case... opens it...

                                 ED
                        We have a complicated accounting 
                        system... depreciation schedules, 
                        charge-backs, Department of Defense 
                        classified accounts-- 

           Chris interrupts, slides an itemized list to Rita.

                                 CHRIS
                        We’ll need your books for each of 
                        the last ten years, a complete list 
                        of vendors and clients for that 
                        same period, bank statements... and 
                        two dry erase boards.  Extra large.
                                 ED
                        Whoa now.  This was all brought to 
                        my attention only last week... a 
                        junior cost accountant stuck her 
                        nose where it didn’t belong and 
                        obviously had no idea what she was 
                        looking at.  Lamar’s overreacting, 
                        there is no missing money!

                                 RITA 
                        Never hurts to be sure.

           She traps Ed with a confrontational look.

                                 CHRIS
                            (reads; to Ed)
                        This org chart shows you as the CFO
                        for the last fifteen years.

                                 ED
                        That’s right.

                                 CHRIS
                        The books for the last fifteen. 

           The air is sucked from the room...

                        Well, you’re awful Goddamn blunt.  

           Chris glances at him... unfazed by Ed’s anger. 

                                 ED
                            (leans forward; calm 
                             menace)
                        I’m Lamar Black’s oldest friend.  
                        I’ve been by his side since he was 
                        turnin’ out RC robots Radio Shack 
                        called crap.  I wouldn’t take a 
                        dime without his say so. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You’re angry.

                                 ED
                        This is bullshit.

           Rita stares at Chris, holds a hand up to Ed.   

                                 RITA
                        You charge a retainer of one 
                        hundred thousand plus two and a 
                        half percent of all tracked funds?
           Chris maintains eye contact, nods.

                                 ED
                        “Tracked?”  Not recovered?

                        We’re an accountant, not a repo-
                        man.

                                 RITA
                        Unusual way of making contact with 
                        you, Mr. Wolff.

           He blinks at her... not reacting to her tone.

                                 RITA
                        I.T. tells me the address was 
                        probably routed through Moscow.

           She studies him... nothing... considers her words.

                        We custom made prosthetics for Mr.

                        Maybe you’re aware -- she lost both 
                        legs to a car bomb in Kosovo.  He 
                        told my brother you were nothing 
                        short of supernatural.  His word.
                            (meaningful beat)
                        Tell me, what type of accounting 
                        does one do for a former KLA 
                        warlord wanted by The Hague?  

           Silence.  The question hangs... he looks away, then back.

                                 CHRIS
                        We don’t discuss client business.

           She stares at him for a beat, nods, satisfied.

           A wall clock reads 4:03... the division hums with activity. 

           At her bullpen desk, Marybeth stares at her monitor... 
           scrolls through profiles of the THUGS in the Accountant file.   

           Faces flash, words, figures pop... terrorist... hawala... $20 
           million... extortion... $45 million... organized crime... 
           smurfing... $70 million... narcotics kingpin... murder.

           computer... engaged.  Ray paces in his office, phone pressed 
           to the side of his head, giving someone hell.  Pressure.

           She scoots back to her desk... resolved.  Clicks her mouse, 
           brings up a surveillance photo, locates the Accountant.  

           She MAPS his face, SLIDES THE DIGITAL IMAGE to a desktop 
           folder.  Click... next photo... maps... slides. 

           INT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - PROSTHETICS LAB VIEWING ROOM 

           Chris looks through one-way glass as a WHITE-COATED DOCTOR 
           works on one of two prosthetic arms on a seated shirtless 
           (and armless) MAN, 20s.

           The prosthetic is Terminator-high-tech. 

           Chris turns as LAMAR BLACK, 60s, enters the viewing room.  
           Lamar, in khaki pants, plaid shirt, oozes decency, warmth. 

           Lamar stands next to Chris, watches the lab.

           The doctor removes one arm and walks to a side bench.  The 
           patient looks off-balance without the arm, incomplete. 

                                 LAMAR
                        What do you think that young man is 
                        thinking right now? 

           Chris watches the man sit on his stool, stare into space. 

                                 LAMAR
                        Why do I still feel my arm?  How 
                        did everything go so wrong so fast? 
                            (sympathetic beat)
                        Where did I go? 

           Silence as the two study the man.

                                 CHRIS
                            (serious)

                        In Vietnam, the survival rate of a 
                        soldier with a catastrophic injury 
                        was one in twenty.  Now, if an

                                 LAMAR
                        You’re unusually well informed.

                        Whatever, Sorkis.  I need it now.

                                 SORKIS (V.O.)
                            (over phone)
                        You don’t do this yourself because?

                                 MARYBETH
                        Because Homeland has everybody’s 
                        files; NSA, the Bureau, Spooks... 
                        we don’t have dick around here.

           INT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - CHRIS’ OFFICE - MORNING 

           Chris, in a suit, carrying a briefcase, steps inside a 
           converted conference room.

           Two large dry-erase boards fill a wall. 

           On a long table... tall neat stacks of files.

           A plate of carefully arranged doughnuts... napkins... coffee. 

           SNORING.  Hidden by the files... a woman, 20s, business suit, 
           sits slumped forward, head down on the table, sleeping. 

           Chris watches her for a beat, unsure how to proceed.

                                 CHRIS
                            (clears throat)
                        Hello?

           She shifts, her snoring slows... stops... starts.

                                 CHRIS
                        Excuse me?  Hello... ma’am?

           Nothing.  He looks at the doorway... no assistance.

           He studies her for a beat... pretty.  He gently rocks her 
           shoulder.  Mostly-asleep, she swipes his hand away.

           Chris circles... uncomfortable... deciding.  He leans over, 
           his mouth to an ear, prepares a gentle whisper... 

                                 CHRIS
                            (shouts)
                        GOOD MORNING!

           DANA CUMMINGS, bolts up.  Bookish-attractive,  wild-eyed and 
           dripping drool.  She gets to her feet, unsteady.

           Palms out, Chris steps back... out of his element... 

                                 DANA
                            (self-conscious; groggy)
                        Hello... good morning.  I’m Dana.  
                        Dana Cummings.  You’re the 
                        consultant?  Mr. Wolff?

                                 CHRIS
                        Chris.

           She wipes her mouth, pushes tangled hair out of her face.
                                 DANA
                            (shaking hands)
                        Sorry.  Chris, then.  I’m Dana.

                                 CHRIS
                        Cummings.

                                 DANA
                        Uh-huh.  That’s right.   

           Chris remembers to smile, glances at the reports... 

                                 DANA
                        I made copies of all the files you 
                        wanted.  Cross referenced them for 
                        you alphabetically and by year. 
                        Maintenance put in the boards.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Thank you.

           Awkward.  He scans the room, searches for a compliment...     

                                 CHRIS
                        Must of taken you all night.

           Bleary, she gestures no big deal... silence as he waits...

                                 CHRIS
                            (genuine)
                        Were you... are you... waiting for 
                        us to say something else? 

                                 DANA
                            (confused beat)
                        Am I...?  Oh, Mr. Black thought I 
                        could be of some help to you.  I 
                        first spotted the missing... what I 
                        think are irregularities, I mean...
                            (collects her thoughts)
                        Some things just didn’t make sense--   

                                 CHRIS
                        We’ll find it.

                                 DANA
                        Right.  Sure.  You want to come 
                        to... make your own assessment. 

           Awkward.  His eyes bounce around the room and back to her. 
                                 DANA
                        If you’d like, if it would be 
                        helpful I mean, we could have 
                        lunch, and I could answer any 
                        questions you might have.

                                 CHRIS
                        We brought lunch.  Thanks.

                                 DANA
                            (grins)
                        You have a mouse in your pocket?

                                 CHRIS
                            (puzzled beat)
                        No.  We do not.

                                 DANA
                        Uh... you said “we”... I was 
                        just...
                            (regroups)
                        I bring my own lunch, too.  Okay... 
                        well, if you need anything, I’m 
                        down in Accounting.  

           Embarrassed, she backs out of the room.

                                 DANA
                        Some doughnuts there for you.

           He nods, bounces eye contact, produces a polite smile.

                                 DANA
                        Absolutely no problem.

           She turns, glad to be leaving... exits.  

           He walks to the door... closes it, relieved.  He turns to the 
           blank boards, a slight smile of anticipation.

           INT. TREASURY BUILDING - PRESS ROOM 

           Press conference in full swing... cameras... REPORTERS.

           The SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, 60s, mans a podium emblazoned 
           with the Treasury insignia... Flanking him, Ray, and a half-
           dozen agents.  

           Marybeth stands in a crowd at the rear of the room.

                                 TREASURY SECRETARY
                            (pointing to a reporter)
                        Yes, Helen?
                                 REPORTER 1
                            (stands)
                        Sir, how did you first discover Al-
                        Qaeda was funneling money into 
                        these charitable fronts?

                                 TREASURY SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Why don’t I turn this over to the 
                        head of the task force and the man 
                        most responsible for these arrests.  
                        Financial Crimes Deputy Director, 
                        Raymond King...  

           Cameras click... reporters SHOUT... Ray grips the podium top, 
           at ease, in command.  The room quiets.

                                 RAY
                        Folks, there’s no mystery here...

           Marybeth’s MOBILE VIBRATES inside her purse. 

                                 RAY (O.S.)
                        Nothing fancy.  Just a team effort 
                        comprised of long hours of good old-
                        fashioned investigative work.  
                        Questions.

           The room ERUPTS with shouting reporters.

           INT. TREASURY BUILDING - HALL - DAY

           Marybeth bangs out of the Press Room... answers her mobile. 

                                 MARYBETH
                            (into phone; brusque)
                        Give me something, Sorkis.

                                 SORKIS (V.O.)
                            (over phone)
                        Ordinarily I’d jump all over--  
                            (background noise spikes)
                        Oh!  God, that gives me the heebies 
                        every time! 

           INT. HOMELAND SECURITY - TECH CUBICLE - SAME

           Sorkis hidden by a cluster of standing TECH GEEKS who crowd 
           his cubicle... all staring at his monitors...

           AUDIO: car tires SCREECH... horns BLARE...      

                                 FEDERAL AGENT (V.O.)
                            (at a distance; shouts)
                        Wait, let me call it in! 
           The group hushed... shocked faces... IMPRESSED faces. 

           INTERCUT MARYBETH WITH HOMELAND

                                 MARYBETH
                            (slowing)
                        Who is that?  Where are you?

                                 TECH 1
                            (awed; low)
                        Again.  Play it again...

           Sorkis, headset on, stares at his monitors... all three 
           screens synced for a B&W SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.  

           DON (aka Partner), a middle-aged Fed, enters the frame, runs 
           across the busy street, gun in hand, towards the Raven.  He 
           glances back at the camera... END VIDEO. 

                                 SORKIS
                            (into headset)
                        M.B... babe, you gotta see this.

           Sorkis double-clicks his mouse...

                                 MARYBETH
                            (stops walking; urgent)
                        What did you find? 

           RAVEN FOOTAGE... taken from across the street... an 
           occasional passing van or truck blocks the footage. 

           A slender man in a white shirt -- back to the camera -- walks 
           toward the Raven’s entrance.  Flanking the Raven’s double 
           doors, two large ENFORCERS. 

           The Enforcers exchange glances, push off the building, move 
           to block the man... 

           Enforcer 1 extends an arm toward the man... 

           The TECHS GRIMACE... BRACE... 

           IMPOSSIBLY FAST -- the man grabs Enforcer 1’s straightened 
           arm, jerks him close, his free hand darting to the big man’s 
           neck... PIVOTS around him... a MINI-VAN passes.

           Enforcer 1 sinks to his knees... shocked... clawing at the 
           STEAK KNIFE BURIED IN HIS THROAT...   

           Enforcer 2 fumbles desperately under his jacket for a gun... 

           The man closes... too fast.

           Enforcer 2 bails on the gun, loops a vicious roundhouse...    
           The man ducks the swing, comes up with sharp jab to the 
           Enforcer’s throat.  He stumbles him... 

           Enforcer 2, clutches his shattered larynx...

           The man grips Enforcer 2’s head, forcing him down... snapping 
           his own knee up into the Enforcer’s face... CRUNCH.

           OS: brakes lock... TIRES SCREECH... HORNS BLARE.

           Reaching under the slumping Enforcer’s jacket, the man 
           EXTRACTS A PISTOL... the body hits the pavement... 

           The man checks the gun’s slide for a chambered round... 

           The man moves to the door... 

           A brief pause as he pushes the bridge of his glasses up... 
           enters the Raven. 

                                 FEDERAL AGENT (V.O.)
                            (at a distance; shouts)
                        Wait, let me call it in! 

           From inside the Raven, the muted sound of TWO QUICK GUN 
           SHOTS... silence... and then a FULL-BLOWN GUNFIGHT. 

                                 MARYBETH
                        SORKIS!  Talk to me... the hell do 
                        you have?

           Sorkis rewinds the footage... a mini-van reverses...

                                 SORKIS
                        Nine dead Corleones and a fifty 
                        three-point-three percent match.  

           On the center monitor... the KILLER’S FACE frozen mid-
           pivot... it could be Chris...

                                 SORKIS (O.S.)
                        What in God’s name are you into?

           INT. FAYETTEVILLE, NC BAR - DAY

           Wino heaven.  Dim.  Calm.  A jukebox plays low country.  A 
           veteran HISPANIC BARKEEP.  A few regulars smoke, drink.                    

           OS: a little bell above the entrance tinkles.

           Three SOLDIERS BARGE IN, early 20s, civilian clothes, 
           military haircuts, full of muscle, youth... themselves.

           Three GIRLFRIENDS, early 20s, tight jeans, trail.
                                 SOLDIER 1
                            (surveying the bar; loud)
                        Rammer jammer yellow hammer!  Boys, 
                        we finally found it!  

           A bar customer averts timid eyes as the trio of men push by.

           A man, late 20s, downs a shot at the bar... mobile phone, 
           keys, next to a half-empty bottle of tequila... BRAXTON 
           “BRAX,” lean, short-sleeve shirt open over a wife-beater, 
           porkpie hat... face of an unshaven angel.  

           Brax is absorbed by a Bonanza rerun on the bar TV. 

                                 SOLDIER 1
                            (nods toward Brax)
                        The only queer bar at Fort Bragg!

           The men and two girls LAUGH... the third shakes her head in 
           distaste.  They flop down at one of the many empty tables.   

                                 SOLDIER 2
                            (to the bartender; shouts)
                        Hey, Paco! Couple a pitchers and 
                        rapido it up!   

           A regular nods “good-bye” to the bartender and retreats.  

           The THIRD GIRL reluctantly joins the group. 

                                 THIRD GIRL
                        Do you have to be so obnoxious?

           Soldier 3 puts an arm around her, she pulls away.

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        No, I don’t have to.  I choose to.

           The bartender delivers pitchers and glasses... leaves.  

           Rebuffed by his girl, Soldier 3 turns pissy... joins in... 

                                 SOLDIER 3
                            (to Brax; loud)
                        Hey, sweetie, nice lid.  Your 
                        boyfriend give you that?

           The men bump fists... two of the girls light cigarettes...

                                 SOLDIER 1
                            (to Brax; aggressive)
                        Nancy.  Platoon Leader Johnson’s 
                        addressin’ you.

           Brax CHUCKLES... his eyes never leave the TV.
                                 SOLDIER 2
                        Fuck’s so funny?

                                 BRAX
                        You are.  I am.  We all are. 

           The soldiers exchange grins. 

                                 BRAX
                        This little scene we’re playing out 
                        here.  I find it funny as hell.  
                            (pours a shot)
                        In the role of the iconic, 
                        presumably conflicted loner minding 
                        his own business... me.  You, 
                        leader of louts, one-dimensional in 
                        your grooming, grammar, homophobia.    

           The men’s grins fade... Brax stares at the TV. 

                                 BRAX
                        Two of your gals... attractive in a 
                        heels-behind-the-head reverse-
                        cowgirl Internet-porn way.  The bad 
                        skin, the muffin-tops... all 
                        evidence of a local diet rich in 
                        Marlboros, Mountain Dew and semen.

           Faces slacken.  Girls 1 and 2 look at each other, trying to 
           determine who should be most offended. 

                                 BRAX
                        Then there’s the requisite even 
                        prettier reluctant-to-join-in-the-
                        ”shucks, sheriff, we was only 
                        funnin’”-townie who finds me more 
                        panty-dampening than her beau du 
                        jour: Platoon.  Leader.  Johnson.    

           Soldier 3 swivels to Girl 3... she avoids eye contact. 

           Chair legs scrape the floor... the soldiers stand, advance. 

                                 BRAX
                        We’re cliches.  All of us.  This 
                        same scene, right down to the  
                        predictable but nevertheless 
                        gratifying beat-down I’m all but 
                        forced by destiny to mete out, is 
                        replayed twenty four-seven...   
                            (nods at the TV)
                        ... in syndicated splendor.
           Brax leans forward, grabs a handful of unshelled peanuts from 
           a bar bowl... a shirt sleeve rides up... a small but visible 
           tattoo -- a TRIANGLE BISECTED BY A BLADE. 

                                 BRAX
                            (sotto; mock sigh)
                        I’m a modern day Josey Wales.

           Soldier 2 sees the tattoo... all the fight leaves him.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                            (to Soldier 1)
                        Forget it, dude, let’s pound some 
                        beers.  Let the man be.

           Soldier 1 scowls... leans over a nut-cracking Brax.   

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        Maybe you watch too much TV.  

                                 SOLDIER 2
                            (low; nervous)
                        Danny, he’s Delta.

                                 BRAX
                            (sotto; pops a peanut)
                        “Too much TV”?

           Soldier 1 blinks at his buddy, confused, confidence draining.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                            (silently; points at Brax)
                        He’s!  Delta!  Force!

                                 SOLDIER 1
                            (to Brax; fearful beat)
                        Hey, brother, I’m, uh... I’m sorry.   
                        I didn’t... we got... I got nothin’ 
                        but respect for--

           Brax’ phone:  MICHAEL BUBLE croons “I’ve got the world on a 
           string, I’m sitting on a rainbow...”

           They all stare at the phone... the jaunty ring-tone at odds 
           with the Delta rep... Brax picks up.   

                                 BRAX
                            (into phone)
                        Brax here.

           The men slink back to their table.

                                 GIRL 1 
                        Are you just gonna let him say 
                        those hurtful things about us?!
                                 SOLDIER 1
                        Shut it, Amberly-Lynn!

                                 BRAX
                        Leave the staffing to me.  There’s 
                        an endless supply of talent since 
                        our welcome ran out in Iraq. 

           Brax disconnects, downs his shot... slides off his stool, 
           turns to the table of six, smiles, tips his hat...

                                 BRAX
                        Ladies.  Ladies.

           The men absorb the insult with weak smiles, nods.

           Brax strolls out, the little bell above the door chimes.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                            (relieved; laughs)
                        Whew!  Man, I hope to tell ya, I do 
                        not need any a that Black Ops shit!

           Girl 3... disappointed at Brax’ sudden departure.

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        Guy’s lucky he left when he did.  I 
                        don’t take nobody’s shit...   

                                 SOLDIER 3
                        Hooah to that, big man.

           OS: entrance bell tinkles...

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        ‘Cludin’ any special forces prima-- 

           Soldier 1 glances up to see... BRAX KICK HIM IN THE FACE...  
           LIGHTS OUT... the women SCREAM...

           EXT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - LAKE SIDE - DAY

           Ducks paddle across a man-made pond, circled with trees.

           Dana sits on one of two park benches facing the water.  An 
           insulated carry-all next to her, she eats a yogurt.   

           Chris, sack lunch and thermos in hand, approaches the 
           benches.  She turns... he sees her, slows.  She inches her 
           carry-all closer to her, making room.

           Frustration slides across his face, solitary routine 
           compromised.  He beelines for the empty bench, unpacks lunch. 
           An awkward beat for Dana, then --

                                 DANA
                        Any progress?

           He half nods, half shrugs, then turns from her, blows twice 
           on his fingertips.

           He unwraps a sandwich, takes a bite, watches the ducks... 
           glances at Dana... back to the ducks. 

           She cuts her eyes to him... the ducks...       

                                 DANA
                        So, how did you get into... the 
                        whole financial consulting thing? 

           He swallows, hesitates, then grinds out a response...

                                 CHRIS
                        According to Department of Labor 
                        statistics, accounting services are 
                        among the top growth professions.  

           She nods, unsure how to reply to this odd sterile answer.

                                 CHRIS
                        The actuarial sciences should also 
                        continue to see high demand.

                                 DANA
                        Uh... okay...   

           She spoons some yogurt, hesitates... waits for the customary 
           follow-up question.  It doesn’t come.   

                                 DANA
                        I like... I like balance.  But I 
                        really enjoy finding things.  
                        Things that are hidden... on 
                        purpose.  Not that I get to do a 
                        lot of that-- 

           He SIGHS, wanting her to get on with it.

           Dana stopped by the sigh... confused... surely not...

                                 DANA
                        My father... he was an accountant.  
                        Had the whole schtick... little 
                        amortization book, green eye-shade-- 
                            (laughs; back on track)
                        This dorky pocket protector he--

           Both suddenly aware of Chris’ pocket protector.  
           He looks at it, then to her, unfazed.  She stammers-- 

                                 DANA
                        Not... not a nice one like yours.  
                        That one you’ve got... that’s 
                        really... something.  
                            (winces; trailing off)
                        He, uh, he talked me into-- 
                        encouraged, he encouraged me.    

           Silence for a long beat... the ducks QUACKING for scraps.

           She struggles to fill the dead space. 

                                 DANA
                        I wanted to study art.  At the Art 
                        Institute of Chicago.  But...

           He stops eating his sandwich, looks at her.  He holds her 
           gaze, for the first time interested.   

                                 DANA
                        “Art won’t pay the mortgage, young 
                        lady.”  Dad’s tastes ran more to 
                        Dogs Playing Poker.  

                                 CHRIS
                        I like Dogs Playing Poker.

                                 DANA
                        No, I... I like Dogs Playing Poker, 
                        too, it’s just, you know, it’s not, 
                        real... art.

           His blank stare throws her, she abandons her point.

                                 DANA
                        I took accounting at the University 
                        of Chicago... “Where fun goes to 
                        die.”

           They sit in silence for a beat, Chris considers her words, 
           watches the ground.

                                 CHRIS
                        Why?

                                 DANA
                        Why what?

                                 CHRIS
                        Does fun go to the University of 
                        Chicago to die?

           She pauses, not knowing if he’s screwing with her or not. 
                                 DANA
                        It’s just an express--

                                 CHRIS
                        We’re kidding.

           She reddens, laughs, brief eye contact between them, smiles. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Why not do what makes you happy?

                                 DANA
                            (beat; rationalizes)
                        We do a lot of good here.  

           Chris nods his understanding.

                                 DANA
                        My first week, I went down to the 
                        prosthetics lab.  Mr. Black was 
                        working with a man, a boy really, 
                        maybe nineteen, twenty tops.   
                            (somber beat)
                        A Marine.  Skin and bones.  Both 
                        arms amputated at the shoulder.  
                        Depressed, wouldn’t eat...   

           He watches her remember, sees the emotion rise...  

                                 DANA
                        He put his arm around that boy and 
                        said, “Son, we can build you the 
                        fanciest arms you ever saw, but if 
                        you don’t start eating every thing 
                        your mother puts on your plate I’ll 
                        put my foot straight up your a--

                                 CHRIS
                        Surface area.

           She clears her throat, embarrassed, her eyes wet...

                                 DANA
                        Pardon?

                                 CHRIS
                        The more surface area for the 
                        prosthetics to attach to, the 
                        better they work.

                                 DANA
                        Surface area?  What are you-- 
                                 CHRIS
                            (enthused)
                        The Marine.  Lamar wanted him to 
                        gain weight in order for his new 
                        arms to fit effectively.  Smart.

           She stares at him for a dumbfounded beat... zips her carry-
           all, stands, forces a tight smile.

                                 DANA
                        Call me if you need anything.

           He watches her leave... damn.  He silently chides himself. 
           Returns to the ducks.

           INT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - REAL TIME CRIME CENTER - DAY 

           Audio: A GUNFIGHT... men curse in anger, shout in fear.

           SUPER: One Police Plaza, New York City

           Marybeth, headphones on, listens, absorbed by the audio 
           violence.  She sits to one side of a desk manned by...   

           DON, 50s -- same guy on video -- stocky, shirt and tie, 
           stares at the spiking audio waves on his desk monitor... he 
           tap-tap-taps a pencil on his desk... annoyed... restless.

           The floor busy.  Noisy.  A mostly male, shirt-and-tie crowd.

           Over her headphones... the gunfire stops, silence... then,

                                 FRIGHTENED MAN (V.O.)
                            (over headphones; static)
                        Stop!  You’re not hearing me... I 
                        wasn’t even there... I didn’t touch 
                        that old man--

           The audio ends.

                                 DON
                        That’s it.  Anything else?  

           She slides the phones off her ears and around her neck.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Help me understand... The subject 
                        shivs the fir--

                                 DON
                        Steak knife.  From Amighetti’s. 
                        Catty-corner cross the street.
                                 MARYBETH
                        In front of which you and your 
                        partner were parked, listening to a 
                        bugged Raven Social Club...

           Don nods, stares at his desk... tap-tap-taps his pencil. 

                                 MARYBETH
                        Unofficial headquarters of the 
                        Gambino crime family.   

           Another nod.

                                 MARYBETH
                        He kills a second man, takes his 
                        weapon, enters -- for all intents 
                        and purposes, an armed fortress --  
                        and kills another seven men.  Using 
                        their weapons.  Alone.

                                 DON
                        That’s what I’m telling you.

                                 MARYBETH
                            (incredulous beat)
                        Who does that?

                                 DON
                        Not my problem.

           She can’t accept this, opens her mouth to say so--

                                 DON
                        I worked the Organized Crime Task 
                        Force.  Whoever this guy was... he 
                        wasn’t Organized Crime.  It was 
                        just him, and he ran the table on 
                        all our organized criminals.   

                                 MARYBETH
                        And you weren’t a little curio--

                                 DON
                        Place was a toilet.  Somebody wants 
                        to work the flusher, fine by me.  

                                 MARYBETH
                            (tiring of Don)
                        Now... you’re an officer of the 
                        law.  Don.  And, if I recall the 
                        video footage correctly... armed.

           He smiles to himself, shakes his head... here it comes. 
                                 MARYBETH
                        You saw two men die.  Watched their 
                        assailant arm himself, walk into a 
                        building you were surveilling, turn 
                        it into the corner butcher shop... 
                            (blows across her palm)
                        ...pull a Keyser Soze, and all you 
                        can think to say is “fine by me?” 

           Don wheels his chair close to her, looks around the room, 
           leans in, conspiratorially... she leans in... close. 

                                 DON
                            (whispers)
                        Fuck.  You.

           Inches apart, their eyes lock, neither blink.

                                 DON
                            (low; intense)
                        This guy dismantled two mob 
                        enforcers -- known murderers -- in 
                        under five seconds.  No huffing and 
                        puffing.  No rolling around on the 
                        sidewalk.  He bled them out and 
                        strolled into a den of stone-cold 
                        killers like he was the Fed-Ex guy.   

           He reaches into a bottom drawer, pulls out a file folder...

                                 DON
                        I have a wife, agent.  Three kids.  
                        We drive to Gulf Shores every July.  
                        Not a great life, but it’s mine.

           He pulls a short stack of photos from the file, holds them up 
           to her, one by one: GRAPHIC KILL SHOTS of Raven victims.

                                 DON
                        Steak knife in the throat... nasal 
                        bones in the brain.  Head-shot. 
                        Head-shot. Head-shot... 

           He stops... stares... the photo in his hands extra gruesome.

                                 DON
                        Somewhere along the line... got his 
                        hands on a cut-down twelve gauge.  

           Shuffles the deck, another photo... another dead mobster.  

                                 DON
                        Anthony “Little Tony” Benedetto. 
                        Acting capo of the family.  Both 
                        orbital ridges splintered.

                        Forensics lists cause of death as 
                        massive blunt force trauma.   

           She looks from the photo to Don, puzzled...

                                 DON
                        Kicked him to death.

           He returns the photos to his desk drawer.

                                 DON
                        So you tell me, Treasury Barbie: 
                        who does that?

           He stands, pulls a pack of cigarettes from a shirt pocket.

                                 DON
                        Both you and Bloomberg can kiss my 
                        ass.  I’ll be outside.   

                                 MARYBETH
                        Why didn’t you pursue this guy?

                                 DON
                            (dumbfounded)
                        What exactly do you do over there?  
                        Talk to King, you guys shut it 
                        down.

           Confused, she watches him leave.

           INT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - CHRIS’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           Open briefcase... contents: Files.  Laptop.  Pens.  Tape.  
           Two rows of dry-erase markers; a dozen RED, a dozen BLACK.  

           All the LEDGERS open, spread out over the tables.  Chris 
           stands, bending over a ledger, running his hand quickly down 
           the page... hunting.  He flips the page, scans it... faster 
           now... stops... RIPS THE PAGE OUT.  

           He stands, stares straight ahead, two markers -- red and 
           black -- in his shirt pocket.  Adrenaline flows... he rolls 
           his sleeves up, undoes a shirt button, tucks his tie in.    

           In his mind... the faint notes of MUSIC... from a hundred 
           different sources.... disjointed... growing louder... 

           He pulls the markers, one in each hand.  Practiced thumbs pop 
           the caps.  In front of him, two pristine dry-erase boards.

           The music coalesces... a specific BEAT emerges... swells...  

           SERIES OF SHOTS:
           With two large BOLD SWIPES of the black marker he forms an 
           accountant’s classic “T” account.  

           Numbers and names go up... Ambidextrous... credits in black 
           marker, debits in red.  

           A ledger page in one hand, marker clenched between teeth, he  
           furiously transcribes figures onto the board.  

           Ripped ledger pages drift to the floor, accumulate.

           Outside: workers file out, hit the parking lot, head home.

           The board fills with thousands of numbers, names... his 
           actions energetic... JOYOUS... numbers stream sideways, up, 
           down, angled... chaos.  

           Ragged ledger pages taped to the walls.

           Outside: nightfall.  A single office window illuminated. 

           His left hand connects a board-length red line to a set of 
           figures, the right hand does the same with a black line.

           He LAUGHS, whips a spent marker across the room... advances 
           on the board... eyeing it up... twisting... bending over... 
           searching for fresh perspective... LOVING it.

           The music builds... 

           INT. MARYBETH’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT   

           Kitchen table... unopened bills... half-eaten T.V. dinner. 

                                 FRIGHTENED MAN (V.O.)
                            (over laptop; static)
                        Stop!  You’re not hearing me... I 
                        wasn’t even there... I didn’t touch 
                        that old man--

           Marybeth t-shirt, jeans, sits at the small table, stares at 
           the screen of a laptop... DIGITAL AUDIO SIGNATURES. 

           She finger-swipes the pad, REWINDS... gunfire, screaming... 
           digital waves spike.  She deletes each signature wave... 
           listens... static... nothing.  

           Tired, she leans back in her chair, eyes closed... doesn’t 
           see the WHISP of an audio spike on the monitor.  Then,   

           A VOICE.  Faint... ghostly.  Her eyes snap open.  She bangs 
           her chair forward, REWIND... presses the UP volume key, holds 
           it... ear to a tiny speaker... a voice... barely audible.      

                                                               CUT TO:
           INT. MARYBETH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           She cables her laptop to tall speakers. CRANKS IT. 

           A LOUD HISS... she paces, hands in her hair... anything... 
           freezes as a WHISPERED CHANT FILLS THE ROOM-- 

                                 CHRIS (V.O.)
                        Solomon Grundy born on a Monday...

           INT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - CHRIS’ OFFICE - MORNING

           Dana stands in the doorway... staring... stunned.

           The dry-erase boards (and a portion of wall) packed with red 
           and black... thousands upon thousands of numbers, names.  The 
           numbers collide, flow across the boards... some writ large, 
           some small... strangely BEAUTIFUL... a veritable FINANCIAL 
           JACKSON POLLOCK.

           Chris stands where both boards meet, lost in thought, 
           repeatedly CIRCLING the sole empty space available.    

                                 DANA
                            (soft)
                        Chris?

           He turns to her, his unshaven face brightens.    

                                 CHRIS
                        Come take a look!

           He’s across the room in a snap, grabs her wrist, and half 
           walks, half drags a surprised Dana through hundreds of strewn 
           ledger pages to the boards.  

           She looks at his hands, his shirt, stained from marker... the 
           destroyed annual reports.

                                 CHRIS
                        It’ll jump right out at you.

           She’s confronted with indecipherable boards.  

                                 DANA
                            (confused nod)
                        Uh-huh...

           He moves quickly to the bottom far left hand side of the 
           boards and a CIRCLED figure... raps his knuckles on it.

                                 CHRIS

                        before interest, tax, depreciation. 
           He moves right, another circled figure, raps his knuckles. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Nine years ago.  Sales increase, 
                        profit declines.  Declines? 

           Dana stares at him, at the board... amazed.

           He moves about the board, underlining various numbers...

                                 CHRIS
                        No large capital investments 
                        dragging profits down.  No spike in 
                        raw materials, labor costs, tax...

           Continues to move... raps a third circle, and a fourth...

                                 CHRIS
                        Eight years ago, seven... sales up, 
                        profits up, but not at a comparable 
                        rate.  X no longer equals Y. 

           Her eyes race, trying to keep up... failing.

           He SLAMS circled figures on the second board...  

                                 CHRIS
                        Six years ago, five, four, three! 
                        We’re making money, but there’s a 
                        drain, a slow leak... and...  

           He hustles the length of both boards, underlining figures...   

                                 CHRIS
                        Here.  It.  Is.

           She studies the name scrawled near the number.

                            (taps several figures)
                        Notice anything? 

           Her eyes ping-pong - nothing.  He hints... taps the second 
           number in an underlined figure... a “3.”  

           She studies... he TAPS again, harder.

                                 DANA
                        Second number in each is a three.

                                 CHRIS
                        Human error.  Most people, when 
                        asked to pick large numbers at 
                        random, rely on certain patterns.

           She stares at the board, touches his arm...  

                                 DANA
                            (smiles; looks at him)
                        I was right?

           Momentarily thrown by her touch... he recovers, steps away, 
           struggles to re-establish eye contact, blinking. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We’re guessing you reviewed income 
                        statements from two years ago.  You 
                        saw Cambridge had been paid an 
                        amount for parts that exceeded what 
                        Creative was producing at the time.  
                        Call.  No one will answer. 

                                 DANA
                            (dumbfounded)
                        I studied those ledgers for months.  
                        It was only one fiscal year.   
                            (beat)
                        You went through ten.  Overnight.   

           He moves to the center of the boards and the EMPTY CIRCLE...

                                 CHRIS
                            (excited)
                        None of this is even the most 
                        interesting part of the--
                                 RITA (O.S.)
                            (sharp)
                        Cummings.

           Rita in the room, staring at the boards, taken aback. 

                                 RITA
                        I believe you’re needed in whatever 
                        area I’m paying you to be needed 
                        in.

           Dana checks Chris with an embarrassed glance, heads for the 
           door, giving Rita an apologetic smile on the way out.  

           Rita slowly approaches the boards... looks at Chris.

                                 RITA
                        And?

           Chris points to circled figures, quickly adding in his head.  

                                 CHRIS
                        One million, three hundred forty 
                        five... two million, three hundred 
                        ninety seven... four million...  

           He ticks off the remaining eight circles as if they were 
           elementary school math, doing impossible figures in seconds.

                                 CHRIS
                        Twenty million, seven hundred 
                        ninety nine thousand...
                            (uncharacteristic)
                        ...and some change. 

           Rita stiffens, nods. 

                                 RITA
                        Your best guess?

                                 CHRIS
                        Mr. Chilton.  

           She squares up to him, confrontational.

                                 RITA
                        And?

                                 CHRIS
                        You or Mr. Black.

           She looks at him for a beat, the boards... turns to go.

                                 RITA
                        You’ll have a report for me?
           He looks at her, away, then back... nods.

           INT. ED CHILTON’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT  

           Dark.  Ed, pajamas and bed-head, shuffles across the large 
           room.  In bed, his wife sleeps. 

           INT. BATHROOM  

           Ed yawns, stands in front of his toilet, urinating... the 
           sound of his urine stream stops.... starts... stops...  

           INT. BEDROOM  

           Ed heads back to bed... a faint NOISE outside the room... he 
           stops... listens.

           INT. LIVING ROOM  

           A huge river stone fireplace anchors the home of a wealthy 
           man.  Light from a plasma TV left on... the volume low.  Ed, 
           in a long bathrobe, frowns at the TV.

           He kills it, heads for the...

           INT. KITCHEN  

           Light spills out from an open Sub-Zero.  Ed rummages in the 
           fridge for a snack.  

                                 BRAX (O.S.)
                            (low)
                        You’ll have the lemon meringue pie.

           Ed whirls around, frightened... Brax and two THUGS. 

           Brax waggles the barrel of a silencer-fitted hand-cannon at 
           the interior of the Sub Zero.

                                 BRAX
                        And those two bottles of insulin. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN (LATER)

           Grouped on the kitchen table-- a wedge of lemon pie on a 
           plate, two vials of insulin, a syringe.  

           Brax and a nauseous Ed seated at the table, face each other 
           over the pie, medication.  Thugs stand in the bg.
                                 BRAX
                            (checks watch; low)
                        I would think you’d appreciate 
                        being treated like an adult. 

           Bile rises in Ed’s throat... Brax motions to THUG 1, silent 
           familiar shorthand... 

           Thug 1 places a waste-basket next to Ed... he retches into 
           it, recovers... Brax signals for water.  

                                 BRAX
                        You administer an accidental 
                        insulin overdose, die with dignity, 
                        in the comfort of your home, your 
                        wife the beneficiary of, I assume, 
                        a generous insurance policy.   

           Thug 1 delivers water and a paper towel.  Ed takes a shaky 
           drink, wipes his mouth.

                                 BRAX
                        I need the appearance of an 
                        accident.  If we lay hands on you 
                        you’ll fight, squeal, wife wakes 
                        up... 
                            (shrugs)
                        Then my hands are tied.  One 
                        accidental death is just that.  
                        Two?  I could stage a murder-
                        suicide but you don’t fit the 
                        profile and quite honestly I have 
                        neither the will nor the 
                        inclination to do so.  No, I’ll 
                        have little choice but to rock and 
                        roll a simple home invasion, 
                        violate your wife a dozen different 
                        ways, kill you both and burn this 
                        place to the ground.  FISHDO, baby. 

           Ed trembles, confused by Brax’s last statement. 

                                 BRAX
                        Fuck it, shit happens, drive on.

           Ed, no dummy, connects the jargon, grasps at straws...

                                 ED
                        You... you’re military? 

                                 BRAX
                        Was.  

                                 ED
                        I’m a... I’m Marine Corps.
           Brax uses the barrel of his gun, pushes the syringe to within 
           inches of Ed.

                                 BRAX
                        We all have our cross to bear.

                                 ED
                        Wh... whatever you’re being paid--

                                 THUG 1
                            (loud)
                        We know, you’ll double it, they al--

           Ed cuts panicked eyes to the kitchen entry... tears...

                                 ED
                        Shh!  No, please...

           Brax turns in his seat, pins Thug 1 with a look that radiates 
           menace even in the dim light.  Thug 1 shuts up, cowed. 

                                 BRAX
                            (back to Ed)
                        I have a fiduciary duty to my 
                        client.  Something you and your 
                        sticky fingers obviously struggle 
                        with.  Make a decision, sir.

           Realization dawns on Ed... resignation. 

           INT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - CHRIS’ OFFICE - DAY

           A MAINTENANCE WORKER, bucket at his feet, dutifully cleans 
           numbers off the wall. 

           The dry-erase boards gone.  

           Chris stands, stares at the board-less wall.  On edge... his 
           puzzle gone...   

                                 LAMAR (O.S.)
                        Why do you do this, son?  

           Chris turns.  Lamar stands watching him, his eyes red, puffy.

                                 CHRIS
                        We’re good at it.

           Lamar nods, considers the response... not convinced.

                                 LAMAR
                        Little doubt about that.

           He pulls a check from his shirt pocket.
                                 LAMAR
                        The balance of your contract. 

           He sets it on the table... rubs his eyes, anxiety building. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We’re sorry for your loss...

                                 LAMAR
                        But?

                                 CHRIS
                        We haven’t finished.

                                 LAMAR
                        Ed was a diabetic for the last 
                        thirty years.  You think he didn’t 
                        know how to check his own blood 
                        sugar?  No, whatever unresolved 
                        issues remain, my friend was 
                        poisoned enough by them to kill 
                        himself.  As far as I’m concerned 
                        whatever he did is forgiven.    

           He extends a hand, Chris looks at it... takes it, then grips 
           Lamar’s forearm with his free hand... forces eye contact.   

                                 CHRIS
                        Sir.  Please... we need to finish.

           Lamar is momentarily taken aback, searches Chris’ face, then  
           realizes the depth of his need.   

           Movement at the door... the two turn.  Dana stands in the 
           doorway, pale.

                                 DANA
                        I’m sorry, I’ll come back--

                                 LAMAR
                        Come in, dear.  We’re finished.

           He removes himself from Chris’ hold, moves to the door.

                                 LAMAR
                            (sympathetic smile)
                        Mr. Wolff, you’re very good.  But, 
                        I hope our paths don’t cross again.

           Lamar leaves, pausing to squeeze Dana’s shoulder.

                                 DANA
                            (to Chris; shaken)
                        I heard what Mr. Black said.  Do 
                        you think it’s true?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANA (CONT'D)
                        That Mr. Chilton killed himself?  
                        It, it can’t be.

                                 CHRIS
                            (distracted; sincere)
                        It’s difficult for us to say why 
                        people do what they do.

                                 DANA
                        But... doesn’t it bother you? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Doesn’t what bother us?

                                 DANA
                        That we’re somehow, I don’t know... 
                        responsible.  If I hadn’t--

                                 CHRIS
                        Why apologize for the truth?

           Dana is halted by his apparent indifference... disappointed.

                                 DANA
                        Good-bye, Chris.

           Chris looks at her, searching for the right words. 

           She walks out.  He stares at the doorway, glances at the 
           empty wall.  

           INT. TREASURY BUILDING - RAY’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Ray at his desk, transfixed by the images on his monitor--  
           Raven surveillance.  The Raven killer turns -- freezes.  

                                 MARYBETH (O.S.)
                            (excited)
                        That’s him, that’s the accountant.

           Marybeth sits in her usual chair, facing Ray. 

                                 RAY
                        Where did you get this?

                                 MARYBETH
                            (bracing)
                        A friend at Homeland.

           He holds the Antwerp photo, compares it to the monitor image.

                        Nice work.  You spoke with the 
                        officer in charge?
                                 MARYBETH
                        Seems unhappy in his work.  Said to 
                        ask you... that we somehow killed 
                        the investigation into someone who 
                        just killed nine men.  

           Ray stands, walks to a tall file cabinet, slides open a  
           middle drawer, fingers the folders, pulls an age-yellowed 
           tabloid-size 1968 LIFE magazine.

           He flips through the pages as he walks to his desk, folds it 
           open, hands it to her.   She reads-- 

                                 MARYBETH
                        The mafia?  1968?

           Marybeth’s POV: the heading: LA COSA NOSTRA... a B&W photo of 
           two older men flanked by a younger man, names captioned.

                        Carlo Gambino and Meyer Lansky.

                                 RAY
                        And?

           The third man; Francis, handsome, smiling. 

                                 MARYBETH
                        “Francis Silverberg?”

                                 RAY
                        Francis kept the books for the 
                        Gambino family for forty years.  
                        It’s estimated that in the sixties 
                        they were doing five hundred 
                        million tax-free dollars a year.
                            (beat)
                        He was Treasury property.

                                 MARYBETH
                        How? 

                                 RAY
                        The men he originally worked for, 
                        the Lanskys and Gambinos of the 
                        world, were businessmen.  
                        Intelligent.  Nowadays... greasers 
                        in track suits who watch too much 
                        T.V. Spring of 2000 Francis walked 
                        into New York’s FBI headquarters 
                        and... started talking.  Taken into 
                        protective custody...

           She stares at him, absorbed. 
                                 RAY
                        ...given immunity.  The Bureau 
                        convicted Big Tony Benedetto and 
                        two dozen other mobsters on 
                        Francis’ testimony.  Then the 
                        Towers came down and everything 
                        changed.  The Patriot Act allowed 
                        us to detain him indefinitely.  
                        F.B.I. farmed him out to Treasury 
                        to develop a link between mob money-
                        laundering fronts and arms 
                        shipments to terrorists.     

                                 MARYBETH
                        Who has him now?

           INT. BASEMENT   

           Poorly lit.  Cinder-block walls.  A blood-smeared nail gun 
           balanced on a saw horse.  

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        Bureaucracy.  Paperwork mistake, I 
                        don’t know.  One day he was just... 
                        processed out.  

           Francis, naked from the waist up, slumps in a straight-back 
           wooden chair, hands nailed to the chair’s arms.  Blood 
           streams from his scalp and pulped face, the gray hair on his 
           heaving chest matted with sweat, blood.   

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        No money, no family, no friends.  
                        No options.  Benedetto’s crew had 
                        him in less than four hours.  

           Around him, FOUR MOBSTERS stand, laughing.  A BLOW TORCH is 
           lit.  Francis strains against the nails.  Cries.  

                                                             RETURN TO:

                                 RAY
                        Anyway, with Benedetto dead,  
                        Treasury called off the 
                        investigation, shut down all 
                        wiretaps... Buried our fuck up with 
                        Francis.        

           He looks at her for a beat, picks up a sheet of paper.   
                                 RAY
                        You’re intriguing, Medina.  I 
                        called my friend Russ Johansen at

           INT. ZZZ ACCOUNTING - DAY

           Chris, unshaven, eyes red, sits alone, behind his desk.  He 
           stares into space, rocking back and forth, thinking.

           OS a phone RINGS.

                        handle 401K roll-overs.       

           He continues to rock, staring straight ahead.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)

                        Sir?  Yes, we do...

           INT. BASEMENT 

           A STROBE-A-SCOPE fills the dark room with disorienting 
           pulsing light.  Deafening HARD ROCK plays.  
           Chris -- shorts, no shirt -- hangs beneath an overhead I-
           beam, fingertips curled around the beam’s lip.  He rips 
           through pull-ups; upper legs held parallel to the floor, a 
           cinder block suspended between bare feet.  Abs contract... 
           veins cord.

           He is extraordinarily muscled... 

           On his back... beneath a shoulder... a group of three nickel-
           sized starburst scars. 

           Eyes squeezed shut, he WINCES in pain.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT  

           The nightstand clock rolls 10:01.

           A beat.

           Chris hurries in, soaked in sweat.  He beelines for his 
           bottle of PROZAC. 

           He sits on the bed, stops.

           He considers the bottle... the pills inside.  His grip 
           tightens... resentment mounting.  He ROARS in FRUSTRATION... 
           fires the bottle at a wall.    

           The bottle CRACKS open, capsules scatter.

           He squeezes his head between his forearms, fingers laced over 
           his head... he rocks back and forth... in pain.

           EXT. FARM ROAD - DAY

           Chris’ pickup slows at a gravel driveway.  He wheels in, 
           passing a MAILBOX reading “RICE.”  

           EXT. RICE FARM - DAY

           Parked at the base of a giant sycamore, Chris sits on the 
           open gate of his pickup, Sharpie in hand, putting the 
           finishing touches on the third smiley-face canteloupe.  

           His Sharpie trails off mid-smile... mind elsewhere, he lays 
           back.

           CHRIS’ POV -- thousands of wide leaves flutter in the breeze.

           EXT. FARM ROAD - DAY

           A dark late-model sedan slows at the Rice mailbox.  Pulls in, 
           gravel popping beneath tires.
           EXT. RICE FARM - DAY 

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           Chris lies in the truck bed, staring up, calculating. 

           CHRIS’ POV -- the canopy of sycamore leaves dance.    

           Thousands of numbers play amongst the leaves.   

           A breeze blows, the limbs bend, leaves shift.  The numbers 
           flow, circle, whirl about a hole in the canopy.  

           Sunlight streams through the hole... the puzzle. 

           INT. RICE HOME - DAY

           The two thugs who assisted Brax with Ed sit at the kitchen 
           table, hunched over plates of apple pie, eating.  

                                 THUG 2
                        What the hell’s he doin’ out there 
                        anyway?

           A frightened Frank and Dolores sit together at the table.  
           Frank’s mouth swollen, a smudge of blood beneath a nostril.

           Dolores fingers the homemade necklace at her throat.

                                 THUG 1
                            (to Dolores; chewing)
                        You.  Call the bean-counter in. 

           Trembling, she searches Frank’s face for help... he nods.

                                 DOLORES
                            (to Thug 1; tentative)
                        He’s too far... he won’t--

                                 THUG 1
                        Now.

           She rises... walks to the door.  Thug 2 follows, gun drawn. 

           EXT. FRONT YARD 

           Dolores stands, shields frightened eyes from the sun, looks 
           at the timber line... Thug 2 behind her.

                                 DOLORES
                            (calls out)

                            (jabs her with his gun)
                        Again.  Louder.

           INT. RICE HOME 

           A helpless Frank watches his wife out the open door...

                                 THUG 1
                            (grins; watching Dolores)
                        Older women give me such a hard--

           PUFF!  Thug 2’s head disappears... VAPORIZED... his headless 
           body kneels, falls forward... as it hits the ground, the 
           report of a distant RIFLE CRACK.  

           Thug 1 stunned... forkful of pie frozen midway to his mouth.

           EXT. UNDER THE SYCAMORE 

           Chris coolly stares down the scope on the big BARRETT .50 
           CALIBER balanced on the hood of his pickup.  

           INT. RICE HOME 

           Thug 1 reels, chair falling... he pulls his pistol, angry, 
           scared, confused... levels the gun at a ducking Frank...

                                 FRANK
                        Please!  Don’t... 

           EXT. FRONT YARD

           Dolores stares at the decapitated corpse, horrified.

           INT. RICE HOME 

           Thug 1 unsure of his next move... bolts for the door... 
           BRAKES HARD... points an unsteady gun at Dolores... 

                                 THUG 1
                        Get... get your ass in here!  MOVE!

           Crying, Dolores enters the house... Frank reaches her, holds 
           her close... 

           The thug circles, at a loss...

           He looks at the pair, tears Dolores SCREAMING from Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Stop it!  Leave her be...

           The gunman jams a hand into his pocket... car keys... drags 
           her to the open door... peers out at his sedan.
                                 THUG 1
                            (to Dolores; snarls)
                        When I say move, you better--

           THUNK! BOOM!  THUNK! BOOM!  The sedan rocks as fifty-caliber 
           slugs punch baseball-sized holes through the engine block.  

           Thug 1 stares in disbelief... the car steams... his retreat 
           cut off.  He SLAMS the door shut.

                                 THUG 1
                        FUCK!  OH, FUCK ME!  Think, think, 
                        think...

           Panicked, he swings his gun toward the shrinking Rices. 

                                 THUG 1
                        We’re all going!  Old man, get out 
                        there!  Bring your car around to 
                        that back window.  Go, Goddammit! 

           Frank stumbles to the door, exits.  Thug 1 waves his gun at 
           Dolores, motions her to him... impatient, he snatches her 
           close, backs them to a rear window... eyeing the open door... 

                                 THUG 1
                            (breathless; furious)
                        Everybody thinks they’re tough with 
                        a gun.  I get my hands on--
                            (opens the window)
                        I’ll show that pussy what t--

           WHOOMP! He’s VACUUMED out the open window... Dolores looks 
           around, suddenly alone... the house still.

           EXT. BACK YARD 

           Chris’ arms encircle a prone Thug 1’s thick neck... Chris 
           exerts pressure... whispers in the terrified big man’s ear.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Say “yes” when you hear the name of

                            (gasps)
                        Y... yes.

                        Solntsevskaya Bratva... Camorra...  
                        Gambinos... Juarez Cartel...   

           No answer... Chris frowns, squeezes... the man purples...
                                 CHRIS
                        You’ve a clear understanding of the

                        My pants pocket... left.

           Chris removes an arm, digs into the man’s pocket... comes out 
           with a small photo of... DANA.

                                 THUG 1
                        Do you both... that’s all we--

           Chris re-applies his free arm, TWISTS... SNAP.

           INT. CHRIS’ PICKUP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

           Chris rockets down a crowded Chicago highway... one hand on 
           the wheel... he holds his mobile sideways, eyes the screen:  

                                 CHRIS

                        trailer.  You don’t have much time.

           EXT. STORAGE LOT- SECURITY GATE - SUNSET 

           Chris SCREECHES to a stop in front of a startled Guard.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Whoa!  In a hurry, Mr. Wolff?

           Chris ignores him, grips the wheel, the muscles in his arms, 
           neck bunch as he stares straight ahead, out the windshield.

           The security bar lifts... fifty yards from his trailer, his 
           life.   

                                 SECURITY GUARD 
                        Mr. Wolff?  You al--

           Chris EXPLODES... shaking the wheel, snarling, screaming...

                                 CHRIS
                        SHE IS NOT OUR PROBLEM!

           INT. DANA’S APARTMENT BLDG. - LOBBY - DAY 

           Dana, hair down, jeans and a t-shirt, enters the elevator, 
           carrying a bag of groceries, purse over a shoulder.    

           Two large MEN enter the elevator behind her, move to the rear 
           of the car... push no buttons.  She hugs her groceries.

           The elevator door begins to close...

           Chris bursts into the lobby... turns... sees Dana, the men... 

           The elevator door closes.
           INT. STAIRWELL 

           Chris runs up the steps, two at a time. 

           INT. HALLWAY

           Chris barges through an EXIT door, looks down the long 
           hall... the elevator bank... the door opens... he walks...  

           Dana exits the elevator... nervous glance over a shoulder, 
           MAN 1 smiles, follows.  MAN 2 stays, holding the elevator.

           Chris tilts his head down, moving quickly toward Dana. 

           She doesn’t notice Chris.  She shifts the groceries... 
           anxious... rummages in her purse.

           Man 1 reaches under his jacket...  

           Chris SPRINTS... Man 2 sees, draws a gun.

           Dana pulls her keys, sees Chris running... turns... Man 1 
           levels a gun at her... paralyzed with fear... groceries fall. 

           Man 1 swings his weapon at Chris... too late. 

           Chris wrenches his gun hand up -- PHHT!  A SILENCED ROUND 
           pierces the ceiling.        

           Dana futilely tries to key her lock, hands shaking...

           Chris drives his instep down on the inside of Man 1’s knee, 
           snapping the leg... he GASPS in pain... the gun falls.

           Man 2 races down the hall, gun leveled.

           Chris bends for Man 1’s gun... PHHT! PHHT! shots furrow the 
           floor between him and the weapon... Man 2 closing fast.

           Chris straightens, spins a crippled Man 1 around to face his 
           partner... instantly wraps Man 1 in a FULL NELSON and drives 
           him down the hall toward Man 2.        

           Man 1 SCREAMS, his shattered leg bending unnaturally with 
           each step.  Chris shields himself, forces the man’s head side 
           to side, like a METRONOME.    

           Fifteen feet apart...

                                 MAN 1 
                            (to Man 2; in agony)
                        Stop!  You’ll hit--

           Ten feet apart...
           Man 2 stops, flustered... aims... Chris and his groaning 
           partner almost on top of him... the muzzle of his gun tracks 
           Chris’ head... 

           NOW... Chris reverses head motion... PHHT!   

           Man 1 drilled in the forehead... Chris thrusts the dead 
           weight onto Man 2, slamming him into the wall.  

           Man 2 shrugs off the corpse, brings up his gun, Chris grabs 
           the arm... PHHT!  PHHT!  Shots divot drywall... 

           Man 2 drives an elbow into Chris’ face, snaps his head 
           back... Chris hangs onto the gun hand...  

           The gun neutralized... the men fight, all knees and elbows... 
           Man 2 uses his greater weight, drives Chris across the hall, 
           slams the back of his head into the wall.   

           A dog furiously BARKS from one of the apartments.

           Chris wraps up Man 2’s free arm with his own... tightens his 
           neck muscles and uppercuts the top of his head beneath the 
           larger man’s chin, dazing Man 2.  

           Chris follows with a savage head-butt... the man’s nose 
           bursts, driving him back... Chris spins him, controlling the 
           gun hand, the muzzle lining up with Man 2’s forehead...

                                 MAN 2
                        No, wait--

           PHHT! PHHT!  Chris double-taps him... FIGHT OVER.

           Amid spilled produce, a nearly crazed Dana still fumbles with 
           her keys... focused on opening her door...  

           He hesitates... puts a hand on her shoulder... she SCREAMS.

           He jerks his hand back... she turns to him... crying.  He 
           gathers himself, unsettled by her tears, pressured by time--

                                 CHRIS
                        Dana.  We must go.

           INT. CHRIS’ PICKUP TRUCK (MOVING VERY FAST) - DAY

           Chris drives... Dana in the passenger seat.

                                 DANA
                            (near hysterics)
                        No!  We’re going to the police!  
                        That’s what normal taxpaying people 
                        do!  Slow down!
                                 CHRIS
                        An hour ago, two men tried to kill 
                        us.  Fifteen minutes ago, two men 
                        tried to kill you.  Creative is our 
                        only common denominator.  Whoever 
                        took that money wants us dead...

                            (talking over him)
                        No, no, no, no, no, no...

                                 CHRIS
                        We have one option; disappear.

                                 DANA
                        That’s not an option for me!  I 
                        can’t just walk out on my life! 

                                 CHRIS
                        The police can’t protect you from 
                        someone who had an extra twenty 
                        million dollars at their disposal.

                                 DANA
                        I thought Ed took it!  He is dead!

                                 CHRIS
                            (on edge)
                        No one person removes that much.

                                 DANA
                            (incredulous)
                        That bitch!

                                 CHRIS
                        We haven’t determined that.

                                 DANA
                        You said “had.”  

                                 CHRIS
                        We did.

           Limit reached, she FREAKS--

                                 DANA
                        What the fuck is up with this “we” 
                        shit?!  What are you-you-you 
                        talking about, “had”?!  Had!  What 
                        had?!

           He RECOILS, winces at her volume... 
                                 CHRIS
                        Whoever took the money was putting 
                        it back.  

           She sinks back in the seat, confused, overwhelmed.  Silence.  
           She glances at his near sleeve... fixates... blood spots.  

                                 DANA
                        Who were they?  Those men?

                                 CHRIS
                        Ex-military probably.  The kind 
                        used to soft targets.

                                 DANA
                        Soft?

           Chris glances at her... she gets it.

                                 DANA
                        What will she do now?

                                 CHRIS
                        Call the other kind. 

           INT. O’HARE INTL. AIRPORT - DAY

           Brax sits at a gate, reads a Vanity Fair, empty seats around 
           him.  A trio of suitcase-rolling BUSINESSMEN approach.

           He disconnects, expression thoughtful.

           INT. STORAGE UNIT - DAY    

           Dana stutter-steps backward as Chris roll-slams the overhead 
           door down.  Dark... light sneaks in from the imperfect seal 
           under and around the big metal door.
           She follows him to the trailer door... he jerks it open, 
           steps up, turns on her...   

                                 CHRIS
                        You wait here.

           He disappears inside, the door slams shut on a speechless 
           Dana.  Lights pop on within the trailer.

           INT. AIRSTREAM - MAIN CABIN 

           Chris, in a black fidget, hustles towards his bedroom. 

           INT. STORAGE UNIT

           Nerves frayed, Dana hugs herself, paces, walks to the 
           trailer, looks in a window.  She resumes pacing.  

           INT. AIRSTREAM - BEDROOM

           Chris SLAMS the door shut, pulls a bulging duffel from his 
           closet, dumps it onto the bed.     

           INT. STORAGE UNIT

           Dana stops pacing, shakes her head... this is ridiculous.  
           Heads for the trailer door.

           INTERCUT DANA AND CHRIS

           Chris unzips the duffel, double-checks the contents... 
           clothes, cash, laptop, silencer-equipped pistol.

           Dana walks the trailer, scans her surroundings... Christmas 
           tree lights... speakers...    

           He digs a bottle of meds out of the duffle, shakes it to 
           confirm the amount. 

           She looks around... pulls open a drawer; knives, forks, 
           spoons-- LOOSE DIAMONDS.  She slides the drawer shut.  Pulls 
           the pantry drawer out-- shrink wrapped Yen, Euros, dollars.  
           Shoves it shut.

           He glances to the closed door, concerned.  He rifles an open 
           drawer full of neatly arranged PASSPORTS.

           Her face pressed to the port-hole window of the trailer’s Toy 
           Hauler room... a view of the gun racks... the PISTOL GRIP 
           SHOTGUN... the KALASHNIKOV... scoped Dakota.

           He slips into a clean shirt... quick look around the room... 
           takes the Light Sabre down, hides it in the closet.
           Dana inspects the Renoir.  Is this... real? Her fingertips 
           brush the canvas, down... his SIGNATURE... she recoils, the 
           piece shifts slightly... she bangs the table, turns-- 

           Looks down the barrel of a silenced 10 mm Glock, Chris on the 
           other end.  She freezes.  

                                 DANA
                            (disintegrating rapidly)
                        Who are you?

           He swallows, hesitates for a beat... torn by the desire to 
           rid himself of the intruder in his sanctuary.  

                                 CHRIS
                        You shouldn’t be in here.  

           He quickly lowers the gun, points to the kitchen seat.

                                 CHRIS 
                        Right there!  Sit right there!  

           She sits, he starts to leave, turns on her again.

                                 CHRIS
                        Do not move!

                                 DANA
                        My apartment... those two men...

                        We’ve benefited from military

           He walks, she ignores orders and bolts up, follows.

                        It was nothing for you. 

           He groans, exasperated by her inability to follow directions.

                        We don’t approve of violence, but 
                        when it’s in self defense... we 
                        call it intelligence. 

           Moving quickly, he enters...

           INT. AIRSTREAM - TOY HAULER 

           Chris moves quickly around the motorcycle... she’s on his

           He pulls open a tool chest drawer... SHOTGUN SHELLS... he 
           takes a box... Dana watches... increasingly frantic... 

                                 DANA
                        Payment?  For what?

                        What kind of accountant gets paid

                                 CHRIS
                        Our kind.  We like Renoir.

                        And those guns, why do--

           He heads back...

           INT. AIRSTREAM - MAIN CABIN

           Chris motors, Dana following, crowding... his irritation 
           meter redlining, he rubs his head with his free hand.

                        people, math kills people? 

           Chris works the shotgun and shells into the duffel.

                        so, no, we’d say guns kill people.

                        WHY AREN’T YOU MORE UPSET?!

           He zips the duffel... turns... gives her his full attention.

                                 CHRIS
                        Dana, we need to move our home to a

                        Are you safer with or without us?

           She gapes at him... the painting on the ceiling catches her 
           eye... she looks up... stares... 

                                 DANA

           A male IRS AGENT, 50s, starched white shirt, tie, flips

           He types in the new specs... hits ENTER...

                        Of those, seven are between the 
                        ages of twenty-five to forty-five. 

           They both follow the tax forms...

                                 MARYBETH
                        Of those seven... only one has an 
                        income stream that’s cash heavy or 
                        can be readily laundered.  And he--

                        Died three years ago.

           The IRS Agent leans back, weary... checks his watch.

                        “Sometimes it’s useful to know how 
                        large your zero is.”

           She hands him several sheets of paper.

                                 IRS AGENT
                        What’s this?

                        can to get you out of here.

           He squints at the monitor, hands poised over his keyboard.

           Large.  Luxurious.  Stunning view of downtown Chicago.

           A low fire crackles in the fireplace.

           A sterling silver room-service tray holds the remains of 
           dinner... hamburgers, fries, milk-shakes in tall glasses.  

           In the center of the tray, long-stemmed orchids in a vase.

                        you’re just going to put it back?

           Chris and Dana sit close on a long couch, studying the screen 
           of the open laptop on his lap.  Onscreen, a flow-chart.

                        Sorry.

           He shuts the laptop, puts it down, thinking...
           She kicks off her shoes, tucks her legs beneath her.  She 
           looks at him... reluctant to interrupt his thoughts...

                        The people who paid you with them.  
                        They didn’t buy them at auction.

                        How did you...?  You know...

           She pantomimes firing a gun with her thumb and forefinger.

                                 CHRIS
                        Our mom left us when we were ten.  
                        Father was an officer, in the Army.  
                        Psychological Operations.  Bangkok, 
                        Munich, Tel Aviv, Jordan... thirty-
                        two homes in seventeen years.   

           She watches him stare into the middle distance, remembering.

                                 CHRIS
                        We learned things... from 
                        “specialists.”  

           He glances at her, then away... opening up... difficult...

                                 CHRIS
                        If we can’t... master something, 
                        can’t solve a puzzle...

                        We have a... a problem.

           He quick-checks her face to gauge a reaction... she smiles.

                                 DANA
                        When I was a senior? In high 
                        school?
                            (out on a limb)
                        I wanted a special dress for prom.  
                        I know what you’re thinking-- 

           She looks at him, face devoid of emotion.

                                 DANA
                        Maybe not.  Anyway, I told myself 
                        spending a few hundred dollars on 
                        some satin bridesmaid knockoff I’d 
                        wear once and to an event I thought 
                        was silly in the first place--   

                                 CHRIS
                        Impractical.

                                 DANA
                        Aha!  See?  You get it.  But Vera 
                        Wang on the other hand, she made a  
                        black strapless classic you could 
                        wear to all sorts of future events.    

                                 CHRIS
                        An investment.

                                 DANA
                        Yes!  Where were you when I was in 
                        high school?

                                 CHRIS
                        Israel.  Maybe North Carolina.

           Becoming accustomed to him, she’s back on track.

                                 DANA
                            (incredulous expression)
                        Only problem... six hundred dollars 
                        they wanted for that dress!

           She waits for the usual empathy face... nothing. 

                                 DANA
                        I didn’t have it, so--

                                 CHRIS
                        You asked your parents for the

                                 CHRIS
                        Borrowed it from--? 

                                 DANA
                        Wait.

           Chastened, he waits... she gathers herself, dives in.

                                 DANA
                        Blackjack.  You know, twenty-one?  

           He starts to question, she sees it coming--

                                 DANA
                        Never played a hand.  Went to the 
                        library, checked out as many books 
                        as I could find on strategy.

           She stands, enthused, gesturing...

                                 DANA
                        I turned the Naperville North math 
                        club into a little Vegas!  I could 
                        tell you when to hit, stand, split, 
                        re-split, then moved on to card 
                        counting, shuffle tracking, even 
                        hole carding.  

           She flops down on the couch, closer to him than before.

                                 DANA
                        I took my last hundred and eighty-
                        three dollars and drove down to 
                        Harrahs in Joliet.  

           She squares up to him, arriving at her point.

                                 DANA
                        I know what it means to obsess, 
                        Chris.  To want something so 
                        entirely it becomes part of you.

                                 CHRIS
                        The dress meant that much to you?

                                 DANA
                        It wasn’t about the dress.  I 
                        wanted to walk into that gym and 
                        have people say “wow.”  I just... I 
                        just wanted to fit.  You know?  
                        Belong.  Everybody does.
           Their eyes meet... he knows... understands.

                                 DANA
                        Lost all but twenty bucks in ten 
                        minutes.  Fed the rest into nickel 
                        slots on the way out and won seven  
                        hundred dollars.

           He smiles, chuckles.

                                 DANA
                        Paid for the limo.
                            (beat)
                        Wore the dress just the one time.

                                 CHRIS
                        Why only once?

                                 DANA
                        Never had a reason.  In college my 
                        idea of fun was quiz bowls, art 
                        museums, speed math.  Not 
                        sororities and such.

                                 CHRIS
                        Speed math?

                                 DANA
                        You know... what’s...   
                            (dreams up a number)
                        Two-hundred ninety-eight thousand, 
                        five hundred sixty seven times... I 
                        don’t know... ninety-two.  The goal 
                        was to see how fa--    

                                 CHRIS
                        Twenty-seven million, four hundred 
                        sixty eight thousand, one hundred 
                        sixty four. 

           She stares at him for a dumbfounded beat.

                                 DANA
                        That’s so incredibly sexy.

           She blushes, nervous-laughs, avoids eye contact... he smiles, 
           embarrassed.

                                 DANA
                        I’m sorry, I... How do you do that?

           He searches for the words... wanting to share.

                                 CHRIS 
                        We see it. 
           She watches him, hangs on the explanation.

                                 CHRIS 
                        Each number has its own shape.  
                        When you combine them... they form  
                        patterns.  Like notes on a page. 
                            (thoughtful beat)
                        When you can read them... you can 
                        hear them.  There’s a rhythm, a 
                        beat... some fast, some slow.  All 
                        familiar.  Always there.  

           She’s entranced, drawn to him...

                            (soft)
                        Chris... why did we come here?

           He compels himself to make and keep eye contact.  They look 
           at each other, attracted...

           They close to within a few inches...

                                 DANA
                        This is crazy.  Isn’t it?

                            (uncharacteristic)
                        Uh-huh.  

           Her eyes close, his don’t... he touches Dana’s face, looks at 
           her... she opens her eyes.  They look at each other...

           Both kiss... Chris awkward... first timer... they break.  Eye 
           contact.  Then, lips lock, again.... they recline.  

                                 DANA
                            (whisper)
                        We should go slow.

           His body shifts onto hers, she responds, passion increases.

           He stops moving, whispers in her ear--
                                 CHRIS
                        Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

           Her eyes snap open.

           He bolts up, relieved and renewed... his puzzle solved.

                                 CHRIS
                        Crazy Eddie Antar! Ran a chain of 
                        electronics stores on the East 
                        Coast back in the ‘80s, Crazy 
                        Eddie’s.  Started skimming money 
                        almost from the day his first store 
                        opened. 

                                 DANA
                        I’m not following you.

           He stands, paces, excited...  

                                 CHRIS
                        He deposited millions in skimmed 
                        money into bank accounts in Tel 
                        Aviv then laundered them through 
                        Panamanian shell companies that 
                        drafted money into his stores.   

                                 DANA
                        Why?  Why would he take it out just 
                        to put it back?

                                 CHRIS
                        He started skimming and hiding like 
                        anyone else does, to avoid taxes.  
                        But after several years, he had a 
                        better idea.  As soon as he stopped 
                        taking money his profit margin 
                        rose.  When the laundered funds 
                        from Panama hit the books it looked 
                        like it was raining cash. 

           She stands, turned on by his problem solving, his enthusiasm.

                            (nods; smiling)
                        Eddie took the company public at 
                        eight dollars a share.  A year 
                        later it was trading at seventy-
                        five.  He put twenty-five million 
                        back in and made ten times that.  

           They meet in the center of the room, close.

                        place if she thought you’d figure 
                        it out?

                                 CHRIS
                        We’ll ask.

           A beat... even closer... he makes eye contact, holds it.

                                 DANA
                        “We” as in you and I or... you?

           They lean into each other, kiss, eyes closed... 

           INT. PENINSULA HOTEL - BEDROOM

           Mostly dark, ambient light of the city through windows.

           Chris and Dana lie on their sides in the king bed, under a 
           sheet, naked, kissing.  He moves on top of her... their 
           breath short... they begin to move together, find a rhythm... 
           eye contact held.

           INT. PENINSULA HOTEL - BEDROOM (LATER)

           Chris and Dana in bed.  She sleeps, he stares at the  
           ceiling, working the numbers... slips quietly out of bed.

           EXT. MARINA CITY TOWERS - NIGHT  

           The corncob-shaped twin towers... sixty-five stories high.  

           INT. CHRIS’ PICKUP TRUCK  

           Parked a block from the Towers.  Chris, ear-piece in, alone, 
           gloved hands screw a suppressor onto his semi-automatic.

                                 CHRIS
                        If we don’t act, Dana will die.

                        Francis knew it.
           INT. RITA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Rita, in a nightgown, reading glasses, sits at a small desk 
           studying financials.  A slight NOISE outside the room.

           She opens a drawer on the desk, pulls a .38.  She deftly pops 
           the cylinder, checks the loads, wrist-snaps it shut. 

           INT. HALLWAY   

           Rita thunders down the darkened hallway, gun in hand...   

                                 RITA
                            (loud; grins)
                        Please, God, let somebody be in my 
                        apartment that doesn’t belo--

           PHHT! A silenced round slams into her forehead... she drops.

           In the darkness, a mobile phone lights up as it’s flipped 
           open... the owner brings it to his ear... BRAX.

           INT. LAMAR’S HOME - KITCHEN 

           Lamar sits at a granite counter, humming, working on the 
           mechanism of a PROSTHETIC HAND with a tiny screwdriver.   

           His mobile RINGS...   

                                 LAMAR
                            (into phone; avuncular)
                        Yes, hello?

                                 BRAX (V.O.)
                            (over phone)
                        Done, you sick twist. 

           The line GOES DEAD.  Lamar exhales, returns his phone to his 
           pocket, leans on the counter. 

           He cries.  Softly at first, then, overcome with grief, sobs.  
           The tears quickly subside.    

           He clears his eyes, wipes his nose... takes up his 
           screwdriver, begins to tinker with the hand... humming.

           EXT. MARINA CITY TOWERS - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT  

           Chris stands on the curb ready to cross the street.  He sees 
           a man exit the Towers, walking fast, staying in the shadows.  

           Possible recognition plays across Chris’ face... Rita 
           forgotten. 
           Chris paces the man on the opposite side of the four lane 
           street.  Traffic passes between them. 

           On the other side, Brax walks, his peripheral vision catching 
           Chris’ figure on the opposite sidewalk, behind parked cars.

           Brax stops.

           Chris stops.

           Brax resumes his pace, grins to himself... PHHT! PHHT! -- 
           snaps off two NO-LOOK rounds across the street.  A car window 
           shatters... ALARM sounds... He looks... 

           Chris is gone.  

           Brax pauses, impressed with the vanishing act.   

           INT. RITA’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT  

           Dark.  Rita’s lifeless body lies on the floor, eyes open, 
           dime-size hole in the forehead.

           Chris lowers into a squat next to her, forearms on his legs, 
           gun held between his knees... he blinks back eye contact as 
           he closes her lids with a gloved hand.   

           Her eyes closed, he looks at her face... rises quickly.

           INT. FINANCIAL CRIMES - EARLY MORNING

           Faint sound of a vacuum cleaner.  Deserted save for a lone 
           cleaning woman in the bg.  

           Ray, Brooks Bros. suit, strides through his empire... folded 
           Washington Times in one hand, Starbucks in the other.

           INT. FINANCIAL CRIMES-RAY’S OFFICE 

           Ray, sans jacket, lowers himself into his chair, starts his 
           morning routine... opens the Times, sips his coffee-- 

           BAM!  His door bangs open, startling him, spilling coffee.  
           Marybeth steams in, clothes wrinkled, circles under her eyes.

                                 RAY
                        Jesus H. Christ, Medina!

                                 MARYBETH
                        Christian Wolff!

           She circles the desk, slaps a list down on his desk.
                                 MARYBETH
                        Christian Wolff, last year ran 
                        $447,543 through his accounting 
                        firm-- 

                                 RAY
                        Slow down.  Who is Christian Wolff?

                                 MARYBETH
                        The Accountant.  

           For the first time, Ray appears off balance, he recovers.

                                 RAY
                        Four-forty seven?  No, no, chump 
                        change.

                                  MARYBETH
                            (hovers over him)
                        Agreed.  But, another $287,765 
                        through partnerships with Kim’s 
                        Nails, $345,112 at the Mandarin 
                        Garden, and -- you’ll love this -- 
                        $756,999 through Al’s Laundromat.  
                        Al’s Laundromat?!  Are you kidding 
                        me?  He’s playing with us!

           Ray skeptically reviews the list...

                                 RAY
                        “ZZZ”... Why--

           She straightens, paces, punchy from lack of sleep.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Because he doesn’t care about 
                        traffic, it’s a front, all these 
                        companies are in the same strip 
                        mall south of Chicago!  “Christian 
                        Wolff,” “Lou ‘Lewis’ Carroll.”  
                        He’s using names of famous 
                        mathematicians as cover!

                                 RAY
                        There are famous mathematicians? 
                            (reads)
                        Charitable deduction to Harbor 
                        Neuroscience Institute?  One point 
                        five million dollars?

                                 MARYBETH
                        I don’t know, why do these whack 
                        jobs do anything?
                                 RAY
                        Let me know how that rationale goes 
                        over with the judge you ask to 
                        issue the warrant.

                                 MARYBETH
                        I got him.

                                 RAY
                        All that’s still less than what... 
                        two million?  And he’s giving away 
                        almost all of it?   

                                 MARYBETH
                        What if he’s taking other means of 
                        payment... drugs maybe--

                                 RAY
                            (warming to it)
                        Diamonds... 

           She looks at him, expectant... Ray turns it over in his head.

                                 RAY
                        Freshen up fast.  We’re going to 
                        Chicago.  Move it.

           She bolts out the door, energized. 

           He drops heavily into his chair, thinks for a beat, gnaws a 
           thumbnail, wipes at his coffee stain.

           INT. PENINSULA HOTEL - SUITE - EARLY MORNING

           Chris, jeans and jacket, sits on the edge of an easy chair, 
           rocking back and forth.  He watches Dana sleep.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY (FLASHBACK)   

           A DOZEN KIDS cluster -- 10, 11, 12 years old -- a SLAP!

                                 BULLY (O.S.)
                        C’mon, pussy...

           Young Boy picks broken glasses from the ground, stands... his 
           nose bleeding, he faces--

           BULLY, 12, thick in the chest, brow.

                                 BULLY
                        Not so smart out here are you?
           Bully slaps Young Boy in the side of the head... Young Boy 
           tries to side-step, walk away... a second Bully blocks his 
           way, herds him back. 

                                 BULLY
                        How ‘bout some of that “we” and 
                        “us”, huh?  I can’t get enough of 
                        your batshit weirdness.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER (O.S.)
                        He’s not weird... 

           Knot of kids parts as Little Brother steps in, passes Bully 
           and stands with his older brother.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        And he’s not gonna hit you because 
                        he promised our father he wouldn’t.

                                 BULLY
                        Guess your old man’s as big a fag 
                        as he is.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        Yeah... that’s not it.  See he 
                        broke a kid’s skull in Berlin.

           Young Boy puts his broken glasses on, blinks.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        Put a grown-up in the hospital in 
                        Thailand.   
                            (to Young Boy)
                        Thailand?

           Young Boy wipes his nose, glances up, averts his eyes.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                            (to Bully)
                        Let’s call it Thailand.

           Bully rotates his shoulders, prepares to brawl.

                                 BULLY
                        Let’s see what he’s got.

           Little Brother smiles, turns to his brother... the world 
           reduced to the two of them.

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        It’s never going to change.  You 
                        know that, don’t you?     

           Young Boy looks at his younger brother, eye contact easy. 
                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                            (to Bully)
                        In Vietnam I watched a murder of 
                        crows -- that’s a “flock” to you 
                        illiterates -- surround a lamb.  
                        Then the meanest crow pecked out 
                        the little lamb’s eyes.  The lamb 
                        went into shock, laid down, and the 
                        crows ate it alive. 

           The crowd of children exchange uneasy looks. 

                                 BULLY
                        So now I’m a crow picking on your 
                        little lamb brother?

           Little Brother lunges forward, spears a thumb into one of 
           Bully’s eyes...    

           Bully SCREAMS, the crowd flinches, shrinks back... Little 
           Brother whips his other thumb into the kid’s remaining eye as 
           the Bully drops, crying... CHILDREN SCATTER.

           Little Brother straddles the prone Bully, grabs a fistful of 
           hair, a bloody fist cocked... lips curled, he hisses--  

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        No, motherfucker, I’m the crow,  
                        you’re the lambs.

           He punches, savage, little arm like a piston... glances up at 
           his older brother. 

                                 LITTLE BROTHER
                        It sucks, but sooner or later, 
                        everybody hates different. 

           Little Brother continues his work.

           Young Boy’s eyes well with tears, he gazes through broken 
           lenses, watches alarmed teachers sprint towards them.  

                                                             RETURN TO:

           Chris’ rocking slows, stops.  A yearning in his eyes, 
           sadness.

                                                               CUT TO:

           Chris carefully places a folded sheet of paper next to a 
           sleeping Dana.  Gently touches her face.  Touches his fingers 
           to his own face.  He takes a long last look at her.  
           INT. PENINSULA HOTEL - SUITE - MORNING  

           Dana sits on the side of the bed, eyes red, open sheet of 
           paper in hand.  She stares straight ahead... at nothing.

           INT. CHRIS’ RANCH HOME - DAY

           Marybeth snaps on a pair of latex gloves... holds a wrinkled 
           pair out to Ray... he declines. 

           Three FBI AGENTS wearing FBI jackets and latex gloves, roam.  

                                 RAY
                        Thanks for tying it down, Pat.

                        We’ve been here twenty minutes, 
                        might as well be twenty hours.   

                                 MARYBETH
                        Computers?   

                                 FBI AGENT-IN-CHARGE
                            (shakes his head)
                        No bills, magazines, TV, dirty 
                        dishes... if somebody did live 
                        here, they’ve got no reason to come 
                        back.

           Ray wanders, looking around, pensive...

                                 MARYBETH
                        Phone?

                        of outgoing or incoming calls, not 
                        even tele-marketers.

                            (loud; from the kitchen)
                        In here.

           INT. KITCHEN 

           VELCRO SEPARATES... FBI AGENT 1 carefully retrieves a pistol 
           from the open cupboard... the agents watch.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Won’t see that on Martha Stewart.
           Agent 1 flips the cylinder open, looks...

                        Hydra-Shok Magnums.

           Marybeth looks at Ray... he seems in a trance, ignoring the 
           gun, fascinated by the cabinets’ spare contents. 

           EXT. CHRIS’ RANCH HOME - DAY 

           Ray and Marybeth survey the property... he turns to the 
           common ground, the woods beyond. 

                                 MARYBETH
                        This is our guy.

                                 RAY
                        Why would a man who’s been up to 
                        his elbows in cash, live here? 

           The automatic garage door lifts... 

           INT. GARAGE 

           The agents file in, look around the space... bare but for--

           The TARP-COVERED OBJECT suspended from the rafter beam.  

                                 MARYBETH
                        It’s the smart move.  Given his 
                        clientele, he figures blending in 
                        will extend his shelf life.

           Ray jerks a thumb over a shoulder toward the common ground.

                                 RAY
                        The woods would bother me.  No 
                        protection if--

           An agent pulls off the tarp... a huge 6-BARREL MINI-GUN 
           suspended in mid-air... pointed at Ray and Marybeth.

                                 FBI AGENT-IN-CHARGE
                        Jesusmaryandjoseph.

           Agent 2 pushes the heavy gun... it glides smoothly across the 
           garage... links of 7.62 mm ammo uncoil, trail behind.    

                                 RAY
                        Don’t see that every day.

           INT. PENINSULA HOTEL - SUITE - DAY 

           Dana sits at a writing desk by a window, focused on the   
           sheet of paper atop the desk.  
           She reaches a decision.  
           Dials her mobile.  

           Phone to an ear, she stares at the city.  On the other end of 
           the connection, a phone rings... connected... CLICKING OF A 
           KEYBOARD...  

                                 BRITISH FEMALE (V.O.)
                            (over phone)
                        Hello, Dana.  You must have made 
                        quite an impression.

           EXT. LAMAR’S HOME - DAY

           Upscale.  Lamar’s McMansion next to equally impressive homes.

           INT. LIVING ROOM 

           Lamar stands, staring out a picture window... anxious. 

           Five MERCENARIES lounge on Lamar’s antique furniture, loading 
           clips, checking actions on suppressor-equipped pistols.

                                 MERC 1
                        Gotta tell ya, Brax.  Your call 
                        surprised me.  After our little 
                        dustup in Tikrit, I kinda thought 
                        you’d be gunnin’ for us.   

           Brax lays on one of two stretch couches... cowboy hat pulled 
           over his eyes, feet up... two .45s on a nearby coffee table.

           He grins a toothy grin.

                                 BRAX
                        Who knows where the day will take 
                        us?

                                 LAMAR
                        He’s only an accountant.  You 
                        should be watching his home.  

                                 BRAX
                        I recommended you leave the 
                        country.  You declined.

           Lamar turns to Brax, angry... scared.

                                 LAMAR
                        He’s a number-cruncher!

           He turns back to the window, regretful, frustrated, irate... 
                                 LAMAR
                        I could see it in his eyes.  The 
                        freak wasn’t going to let it go.       

           Brax tenses at “freak,” jaw muscles flexing.

                                 BRAX
                            (playfully grim)
                        Ever see a three-thirty-eight Lapua 
                        Magnum round traveling three 
                        thousand feet per second come 
                        through a window?

           The mercs glance at each other... concern creeping in.

                                 BRAX
                        Nobody does.

           Lamar scoots away from the window.

           INT. CHRIS’ RANCH HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           A frustrated Marybeth leans against the couch, thinking.  

                                 FBI AGENT-IN-CHARGE (O.S.)
                        No problem, Ray.

           OS the front door SHUTS.  Ray enters the room, drops onto the  
           couch, exhales.

                                 RAY
                        God, I was too old for this job ten 
                        years ago. 

           Ray slouches, loosens his tie, kicks his shoes off, puts his 
           feet up on the coffee table.  His aura dims. 

                                 RAY
                        Good game, kid.  

           She turns, looks at him, puzzled.

                                 RAY
                        Marybeth Ascension Medina.  Ward of 
                        the state of Maryland’s foster care 
                        and juvenile detention system from 
                        the age of four to eighteen.  
                        Assault and battery, possession, 
                        solicitation, weapons charges.  

           She glares at him... but doesn’t rattle.

                                 RAY
                        Hell of a tattoo by the way, forty-
                        five, right?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                            (empathetic beat)
                        That why you move every couple of 
                        years?  Somebody unseals those 
                        records?  Why-- 

                                 MARYBETH
                        Don’t I go into the private sector?  
                        Why should I?  Why should you be 
                        able to tell me what I can and 
                        can’t do?  Hmm?  Because you were 
                        brought up in a normal home, you 
                        have the right to be successful, I 
                        don’t?  
                            (emotion rising)
                        You can help people, I can’t?  I 
                        don’t deserve a break?  I’m a damn 
                        good agent.

                                 RAY
                        Yeah.  I never thought you’d get 
                        this far.  Nobody else has.
                            (beat)
                        Sit.

           Pissed, she continues standing. 

                                 RAY
                            (softer)
                        Marybeth.  Please sit down. 

           She sits.

                                 RAY
                        Hypothetically...

           EXT. RAVEN SOCIAL CLUB - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Horns HONK, brakes SCREECH... 

                                 FEDERAL AGENT (O.S.)
                            (at a distance; shouts)
                        Wait, let me call it in! 

           Muted pops of gunfire.

           Fast footfalls on the pavement... guns drawn, backs to us, 
           two Feds run, pass two dead men on the sidewalk, pooling 
           blood.  

           INT. RAVEN SOCIAL CLUB (FLASHBACK)

           LOUD GUNFIRE... a fear-stricken Don grips his gun, looks 
           across the hall at his partner... RAY KING.  Ray licks his 
           lips, advances.
                                 DON (O.S.)
                        Fuck this... let’s go.

           Ray looks, sees a terrified Don eyeing the entrance door... 

                                 DON 
                        We didn’t sign on for--

           BOOM!  A shotgun blast... Ray automatically swivels to the 
           sound, both hands grasp an unsteady gun held in front of 
           him... a warren of rooms...

           Don hesitates, considers following, but instead runs for the 
           entrance door.

           Ray looks up... from the second floor... SHOUTS OF PANICKED 
           MEN... RUNNING. 

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        I had no business being in there.

           He approaches a doorway, swallows hard...

           INT. RAVEN - GROUND FLOOR (FLASHBACK)

           Ray sweeps the room with his pistol... early Elk’s Lodge, 
           small bar, a few tables... stopping on... 

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        Put me in a 7-Eleven with a cherry 
                        Slurpee and a stack of ones 
                        bleached to look like fives... I’m 
                        hell on wheels. 

           A MOBSTER sits on the floor, back to the bar, head lolls to 
           the side, two bullet holes in his face.  

           From the second floor... A PUMP SHOTGUN BOOMS and reloads...  
           AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE responds.  

           Ray spots a staircase...

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                            (sober)
                        Not in there... not with people 
                        like that.  Like him.

           INT. SECOND FLOOR (FLASHBACK)

           No gunfire.  No cursing.  Only unsettling quiet.

           Ray advances down the dim hall... sweating, hands trembling, 
           shoulders aching, labored breath loud in his ears.

           Blood-spatters spiderweb the walls on both sides.  
           Dead mobsters litter the floor.  

           Ray GASPS, startled.  At his feet, a DYING MOBSTER with a 
           gaping chest wound grips Ray’s pant cuff. 

                                 DYING MOBSTER 
                            (weak rasp)
                        Please... help...

           Ray jerks the leg free, wipes flop-sweat from his eyes. 

           From a room at the end of the corridor... a desperate, 
           frightened voice...

                                 BENEDETTO (O.S.)
                        Stop!  You’re not hearing me... I 
                        wasn’t even there... I didn’t touch 
                        that old man--

           Sound of a THWACK... a second THUMP... quiet.

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        Little Tony Benedetto.  I’d been 
                        sitting in a cramped van for six 
                        months listening to the arrogant 
                        son of a bitch belch, fart, and 
                        brag.
                            (beat)
                        Didn’t recognize his voice with all 
                        the fear in it. 

           Ray inches along the wall to the doorway... his pistol tight 
           against his chest... licks dry lips... tenses... ready... 

           CLICK. 

           A .45 cocks.  Ray freezes.  A barrel pressed against the back 
           of his head.  He squeezes his eyes shut... opens.    

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                            (wounded; whisper)
                        Your name?

                                 RAY
                            (trembling; hoarse)
                        Ray.  Raymond King.  

           OS the faint sound of POLICE SIRENS.

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Who employs you, Raymond King?  

           A fat drop of blood hits the thin industrial carpet.  
                                 RAY
                        I... I’m a Treasury Agent.

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Are you a good one?

                                 RAY
                        Not particularly.  No.

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Is that it?

                                 RAY
                        I’m married... was married. 

           The barrel digs into Ray’s skull.

                                 RAY
                            (desperate; emotional)
                        A dad, I’m a dad.  I have two kids.

                                 CHRIS
                        Grown?

           Ray chokes back an involuntary sob... nods slightly...

                                 RAY
                        Yes.  They’re all... all grown up.

           Another drop of blood adds to a spreading carpet stain. 

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Were you a good dad?  Ray King?

           He blinks back tears, sure of death.  He remembers, smiles...

                                 RAY
                        Yeah.  Yeah, I’ve been a good dad.  
                        Been a lousy agent... and... and a 
                        weak man, but that... that I didn’t 
                        screw up.  That I did right.

           The sirens LOUDER... closer...

           Ray waits.  Death or a question.  

           Seems like an eternity, but... NOTHING. 

           He turns... the hallway empty of life.  He slides down the 
           wall, a pant leg stained with urine, still holding his gun.

           He puts his face in his hands, CRIES with relief. 

                                                             RETURN TO:
           Marybeth gapes at Ray.

                        Why were you there to begin with?

                                 RAY
                        I’ve asked myself that question a 
                        million times...

           INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY   

           A microwave cooks a breakfast burrito.  An unshaven, wrinkle-
           shirted Ray holds a five dollar bill up to the overhead 
           fluorescent lights, studies it.

                        Suppose you were a Treasury agent 
                        in the twilight of a spectacularly 
                        dismal career... You tell yourself 
                        you’re justifying  two failed 
                        marriages and a fondness for malt 
                        liquor by doing the least possible 
                        amount of work necessary to hang 
                        onto your pension.  But that’s not 
                        true.  The reality is, you lack 
                        both talent and ambition.

           INT. TREASURY CONFERENCE ROOM 

           Windowless, dingy.  Francis sits at a long oblong table,  
           talks, doing his best to explain.  He pauses, worry in his 
           eyes. 

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        Then one day... here comes that 
                        break you’ve been looking for...  

           Sitting opposite Francis, a despondent Ray puts pencil to 
           paper, nods his understanding, doodles.  

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        Made the new handler for a mostly 
                        depleted source that could turn 
                        your career around if only you’d 
                        listen.  You don’t.

           A numb Francis wears a dated suit.  He stands, waiting, cheap 
           suitcase by his feet.  The bus pulls up.   

                                 RAY (V.O.)
                        You recommend he be released... 
                        maybe even believe you’re doing him 
                        a favor.  You’re not.

           A coroner pulls back a sheet, winces.  An ashen Ray stares 
           down at an unseen corpse. 

           One of Francis’ ruined hands is exposed.  Ray’s eyes shine, 
           he takes the hand in his, gently tucks it beneath the sheet.

                        wait for a shred of evidence to use

                        Hardest thing to accept?  Even

                        wouldn’t have had the balls to step

           A speechless Marybeth watches Ray wrap it up.

                                 RAY
                        Tells me she works for the 
                        accountant.  That a shipping 
                        container of Chinese nationals is 
                        passing through the Port of New 
                        York.  Four months later, one ton 
                        of uncut Juarez Cartel product is 
                        entering Miami.  So on... so forth.

           She leans back, overwhelmed... at a loss.

                                 MARYBETH
                        All those cases you put together.  
                        The legend of Ray King. 

                                 RAY
                        Smoke.  He doesn’t exist.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Who is he... this “accountant”?

                                 RAY
                        Honestly, I don’t know.  I dug.  
                        But not much.  Found out Langley 
                        had him first.  Sprung him from 
                        Leavenworth maximum security.

                                 MARYBETH
                        The military prison?  For what?
                                 RAY
                        His file’s restricted.  Special 
                        Access.  Usually reserved for 
                        covert operations.  I do know we 
                        got him after 9/11 to track 
                        terrorist money launderers.  He 
                        stayed in the same off-site 
                        detention center with Francis.  
                        Some sort of math savant.  Multi-
                        lingual.  Did the work of five 
                        analysts.

                                 MARYBETH

                                 RAY
                        “Carl Gauss” when he worked for us.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Gauss.  He’s on my list. You’re 
                        saying even when he worked for us, 
                        we didn’t know who he was?

                        The day after Francis’ body was 
                        found, Gauss -- whoever -- 
                        fractured his handler’s skull with 
                        a coffee thermos and disappeared.

                        particular sense of right or 
                        wrong... children seem to be a soft

                                 MARYBETH
                        I do.  You’re his insurance policy.

           Ray doesn’t like the thread, knows where it’s going... 

                                 MARYBETH
                        He knows as long as he spoon-feeds 
                        you you’ll stonewall any 
                        investigation.

           She stands, begins to pace, think it through. 

                                 MARYBETH
                        I dig into the detention center 
                        records, subpoena the brass at 
                        Leavenworth, sift through the usual 
                        bullshit.  And I’ve got him.  I’ll 
                        jump two pay grades overnight.
                                 RAY
                        You could.  Maybe you should, I 
                        don’t know.  It’s the kind of case 
                        that can make a career.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Why are you telling me this?

                        I retire in a few months.

                        And...?  

                                 RAY
                        She’ll need someone to call.

                                 MARYBETH
                        What about me makes you think I’d 
                        carry on your charade?  

                                 RAY
                        I realized something that day... 
                        sitting in my cubicle... deciding 
                        what to do... 

           Their eyes meet, his smile fades.

                                 RAY
                        I’d spent the better part of my 
                        life recognizing my lucky breaks 
                        only after they were gone. 

           She digests this for a beat, wavers.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Any idea on the woman?  The Brit?

           Chris strolls up the flagstone path to the door.

           A FEMALE NEIGHBOR tends to her roses.  She smiles and waves 
           to him.  He mimics the smile and the wave.

           He KNOCKS on the oversized front door... 

           MERC 1 opens the door halfway, looks around...

           Chris steps forward, grabs the doorknob, jerks the door shut 
           on a surprised Merc 1.  He pulls a pistol from under his 
           jacket PHHT! PHHT! pumps two quick rounds through the door.  
           He JAMS the door open... pulls his second pistol...

           walls, furniture...  

           INT. BEDROOM  

           The relentless MUFFLED GUNFIRE sounds like a giant sewing 
           machine set to “high”... 

           Brax laughs, SHOUTS over the noise to a horrified Lamar and 
           an antsy Merc 3.

           Chris reaches around the corner PHHT! drops Merc 2.  

           INT. BEDROOM 

           Brax opens the door, a dead Merc 2 stares in... Lamar pales.

                        That’s no good. 
                            (turns to Lamar)
                        Back in a jif.

           Lamar starts to object, but Brax is gone.  
           Merc 3 kicks the door shut, pistol leveled... Lamar cowers 
           behind him.  Behind the door the GUNFIGHT rages...   

           A Merc CRIES OUT... all is quiet.  Merc 3 swallows hard, his 
           gun steady on the door, Lamar peeks from behind him...

           The door bursts open... Chris ENTERS, a wounded Merc in front 
           of him, Chris’ gun barrel jammed against the man’s head.

                                 LAMAR
                        SHOOT HIM!

           Merc 3 holds his aim... unsteady...

                                 LAMAR
                        Shoot them!  Goddammit shoot!

           CLICK.

           A .45 cocks... a gun barrel pressed to Chris’ skull... Chris 
           releases the gasping Merc. 

           Lamar and Merc 3 breathe SIGHS OF RELIEF... the old man sits 
           down heavily on his bed. 

           Then, 

                                 BRAX
                            (emotional; low)
                        Ten years.  Ten years I’ve looked 
                        everywhere for you.

                                 CHRIS
                        Braxton?

           Lamar looks up... puzzled.

                                 BRAX
                        In the flesh, brother.

                                 LAMAR
                            (soft; worried)
                        Kill him.

                                 BRAX
                        What are the odds?

                                 CHRIS
                        Statistically speaking, given our 
                        respective professions, not-- 

                                 BRAX
                        Christ!  It’s rhetorical.

           Lamar’s eyes dart, he stands, yells to the Mercs...
                                 LAMAR
                        KILL HIM!

           PHHT!  PHHT!  Brax shoots one Merc; Chris caps the other.  
           The goons drop at Lamar’s feet.

           Lamar is stunned... frightened, flustered, sober.  He looks 
           up, his eyes meeting Chris’.

                                 CHRIS
                            (snaps his fingers; points 
                             at Lamar)
                        Not happy.

           Chris turns to Brax, they face each other for a beat... Chris 
           looks into Brax’ eyes with ease.  

           Brax moves forward, embraces his brother.  Chris’ head sinks 
           into his brother’s shoulder... familiar, comfortable.

           Lamar reaches for a fallen gun.

           Brax and Chris simultaneously point their weapons at Lamar, 
           freezing him.

                                 LAMAR
                        How--how is this possible? 

                                 CHRIS

                            (amused)
                        “Karma,” he says. 
                            (then)
                        Still solving puzzles?

                        Still making friends?

                                 BRAX
                        An accountant?  Didn’t realize it 
                        was such a dangerous profession.

                                 CHRIS
                        Art won’t pay the mortgage.

                                 BRAX
                            (grins)
                        What’s a mortgage?

           Chris starts to answer, Brax rolls his eyes, cuts him off. 
                                 BRAX
                        Been by to see dad?

                                 CHRIS
                        Dad’s dead, Braxton.

                                 BRAX
                        I know he’s dead.  Always so 
                        literal.  His grave, have you been 
                        by his grave?

                                 CHRIS
                        No.  Should we?

                                 BRAX
                        You should.

                                 CHRIS
                            (nods at Lamar)
                        You know him how?

           Brax holds his left eyelid open, TAP-TAP-TAPS the surface of 
           his left eye with his right index finger.

                                 LAMAR
                        That woman held her nickels and 
                        dimes over my head since the day 
                        Creative was born!  Always carping 
                        about a “return on her investment.”  
                        This company was nurtured with my

                        I’m taking Creative public.  As 
                        sole owner, my stock will be worth 
                        roughly one billion dollars.  A 
                        billion dollars, Mr. Wolff, that I
                        decide how best to use.  Neuro-
                        prosthetics, nanotechnology... 
                        limbs, eyes, ears... only better

                        Show you what wouldn’t stand up to 
                        public scrutiny.

           Chris stares at the old man for a beat... satisfied.
                                 CHRIS
                        Fair enough.

           Lamar blanches, tragically.

           Chris heads for the door...

                                 BRAX
                        How shortly?

                                 CHRIS
                        Two hours.  

           Brax winces.

           Chris stops, faces Brax...

                                 CHRIS
                        We’ve missed you, Braxton.

           Brax turns to Lamar.

           INT. HALLWAY 

           Chris strides down the bullet-ridden corridor.

                        Stop.  I... I’ll double our agr--

           INT. TREASURY BUILDING - PRESS ROOM - DAY                        

           The Secretary of the Treasury at the podium.  Flanking him,  
           Ray, Marybeth, and a half-dozen agents.  Seated REPORTERS jam 
           the room... standing room only in back.

                            (stands)
                        Sir, are the conspiracy and fraud 
                        charges against Lamar Black that 
                        led to his suicide in any way 
                        related to last week’s murder of 
                        his sister Rita?    

                                 TREASURY SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Helen, this is an ongoing 
                        investigation.  Suffice it to say 
                        that the American public demands a 
                        new level of vigilance in 
                        safeguarding our financial system.   
                        Let me introduce the agent who 
                        spearheaded the investigation.    
                        Senior Agent Medina?  

           Cameras click... reporters SHOUT... 

           Marybeth takes the podium... nervous... clears her throat.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Good afternoon.

           She glances at Ray, he stares back... waits.

                                 MARYBETH
                        Um... as much as I’d like to take 
                        credit for this... I... I can’t. 

           She hesitates... cameras click... puzzled faces...

                                 MARYBETH
                            (finding her groove)
                        Because this was a team effort 
                        comprised of long hours of good old-
                        fashioned investigative work. 

           Ray beams, the proud father.

           EXT. CABIN - DAY   

           The cabin familiar to us, well-maintained.

           A small sun-bleached wooden sign... the words “Harbor 
           Neuroscience” weathered, aged. 

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S MOM (V.O.)
                            (strained emotion)
                        He was just like our other two, 
                        such a happy baby.  Now, he rarely 
                        speaks.  We thought--   

           Coming into view, adjacent to the property...
           A sprawling modern campus. Suspended between two entry-way 
           pillars, a welcome arch: “Harbor Neuroscience Institute.”

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S DAD (V.O.)
                        We thought... we hoped he’d catch 
                        back up, but... he didn’t. 

           INT. HARBOR NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE - WAITING ROOM - DAY 

           Sun streams in floor-to-ceiling windows... warm, inviting.  

           Alone, a 6-YEAR-OLD BOY plays with toys on a carpeted floor.

                        frustration of a parent with an 
                        autistic child, but...   

           The boy stands, casts his eyes about, heads for a doorway... 

           On the floor, two dozen blocks, animals, cars, trucks, planes 
           -- have been arranged in a perfectly straight line.

                        all the other NT’s have told you 
                        about your son...

                        What if they’re wrong? 

           INT. HARBOR NEUROSCIENCE

           The boy walks the tiled sunny corridor, exploring.  He runs 
           his small hand against the wall, the windowsills... feeling 
           the wood grain, the sun on his face.

                                 AUTISM DOC (V.O.)
                        What if we’ve been using the wrong 
                        tests to quantify intelligence in 
                        children with autism?  Your son’s 
                        not less-than.  He’s not broken.   
                        He’s just different.  

           A nurse passes, smiles at him.  Stone-faced, he continues 
           past open classrooms... children with headphones, wired to 
           state-of-the art computer stations, WRITE CODE...
           Kids role play BODY-LANGUAGE scenarios...

           An ORCHESTRA of kids, a child at a piano, eyes closed, hands 
           playing beyond his 7 years.

                        And the reason we pity, try to cure 
                        rather than accept him is that he 
                        doesn’t understand how to tell us 
                        what he feels, what he’s capable 
                        of.  Or we haven’t yet learned how 
                        to listen. 

           He rounds a corner, tile turns to carpet, a residential feel.   

           A door left ajar... he stops.

           INT. JUSTINE’S ROOM - DAY   

           The boy steps in to a cozy home.  The walls a warm pink, 
           overhead, multiple MOBILES slowly spin... cast prisms of 
           light on the walls... a CHE GUEVARA poster.      

           A GRUNT.  He turns, freezes.  

           Dark eyes glare out behind wild thick hair... JUSTINE, now 
           30s, thin, sweats and t-shirt.  She nests cross-legged in an 
           easy chair by a desk.  On the desk, a flat screen monitor.  

           He stares at her, frightened, unable to move.

           Justine rocks back and forth, eyes glued to the boy. 

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S MOM (O.S.)
                            (relieved)
                        Honey, for the hundredth time, 
                        don’t wander off like that.

           The boy’s PARENTS, 30s, and the DOCTOR, 50s, in the cabin.  
           The couple look at Justine, pained smiles on their faces.

                        It’s all right.  Can he visit with 
                        you for a while, Justine?

           Justine ducks her head, flaps a hand, grunts unintelligibly.

                        C’mon, folks, I’ll give you the 
                        nickel tour.
           He holds the door for the reluctant-to-leave parents... Dad 
           scans the room one last time... they exit.

                        We accept every child on the autism 
                        spectrum, no one is turned away.  
                        Most of our kids just spend their 
                        summers with us, Justine’s one of 
                        our few full-time residents.  She 
                        stopped talking thirty years ago, 
                        communicates with a digital 
                        translator now.  

           The boy slowly approaches Justine, passes a large suitcase- 
           size computer, CRAY emblazoned on the front... her desk... 
           the monitor... potted cactus plant... a small FRAMED PHOTO.

                        Doctor, how is Harbor funded? 

                                 AUTISM DOC (V.O.)
                        Privately.  We’re fortunate to have  
                        very generous individual donors.  
                        Some more than others.

           Two people in the old photo: 10-YEAR-OLD JUSTINE, her little 
           girl’s sober face stares out from behind long tangled hair... 
           next to her, a 10 YEAR-OLD YOUNG BOY... CHRIS.

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S DAD (V.O.)
                        I’ll say they’re generous.

                                 AUTISM DOC (V.O.)
                        Why’s that?

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S DAD (V.O.)
                        That woman -- Justine...

                                 AUTISM DOC
                            (proudly)
                        My daughter.

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S MOM (V.O.)
                        She’s your daughter?

                                 AUTISM DOC (V.O.)
                        The reason I started the Institute.

                        Justine’s computer--

           Justine rocks, emits a low KEENING sound, averts her eyes...

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S DAD (V.O.)
                        ..it’s a Cray CX1.

                        That’s right, you’re a software 
                        engineer.  I’m sorry, is that good?

                                 AUTISTIC BOY’S DAD (V.O.)
                        Good?  Doc, she could backdoor the 
                        Pentagon with that rig. 

           Justine paws at the air, contorts... pulls a WIRELESS 
           KEYBOARD tucked within the chair.  Her hands blaze over the 
           keys... SPEAKERS on her desk produce the familiar VOICE:

                                 BRITISH FEMALE/JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        Hello, young man.  And just who 
                        might you be?  

           The boy looks at her with bright, intelligent eyes.

           INT. CHICAGO OFFICE - DAY

           A crowded cubicle-farm of temps, accountants, admins...

           Dana sits at her desk, studying a ledger on her monitor.  She 
           tilts her head away from the screen... daydreams. 

           EXT. HAPPY TRAILS RV PARK - DAY

           Dana stands, stares at the empty spot where the Airstream 
           once parked.

           INT. DANA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Dana, in a business suit, tired, slides a key in her 
           apartment lock... a shadow falls across the door... she 
           whirls around, frightened... the Fed-Ex guy. 

           Fed Ex holds his palms up... whoa... hands her a rectangular 
           CARDBOARD BOX, size of a small flat screen TV but much 
           lighter.  She takes it... no return address. 

           INT. DANA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT  

           Dana sits on a love seat, reaches into the Fed-Ex box, 
           pulls... a frame, followed by... Dogs Playing Poker. 

           INT. DANA’S APARTMENT-BEDROOM - NIGHT   

           Dana finishes nailing a picture hanger into the wall.  She 
           hangs Dogs on the hook, straightens it.  

           She steps back to gauge her work.  She LAUGHS, remembering... 
           her laughter fades, in her eyes a touch of sadness.  An 
           imperfection catches her eye... small bubble in an upper 
           corner. 
           She fingers the bubble, something beneath... she picks at a 
           tiny flap of paper... inspects... FREEZES... then slowly 
           tears the print the length of the frame...  

           Dana shocked... stares at the half-revealed RENOIR hanging on 
           her wall.  Nervous, she moves to the window, grabs the shade 
           pull, hesitates... she looks out the window, GRINS.    

           INT. AIRSTREAM (MOVING) - SUNSET 

           Sun leaks through drawn shades, warms blonde wood.  The 
           kitchen wall empty, the Renoir gone. 

           INT. SUV (MOVING) - SUNSET

           Windows down, radio on, Chris, T-shirt and jeans, drives,   
           gently taps his fingers to the music, daydreams. 

           Colorado’s San Juan Mountains visible through his windshield.

           EXT. DURANGO, COLORADO - SUNSET  

           The SUV trailers the Airstream down a steep grade, the 
           picturesque town of Durango nestled at the base of the pass.  
           The road curves, the SUV and Airstream follow the switchback 
           behind the mountain, disappear.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                 THE END
