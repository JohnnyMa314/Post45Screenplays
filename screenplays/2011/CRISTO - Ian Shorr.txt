           INT. TENEMENT BATHROOM - MORNING

           For a moment, everything is jittery, unsettling: a trembling 
           hand turns on a faucet, cold water splashes us in the face. 

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Ok... Ok... 

           WHAM WHAM -- we whirl to the door, someone banging on it.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Zero-hour, Coleman, hurry up!

           REVERSE to our hero: COLEMAN, age 13. Too young for this. 
           Wiry frame, haunted eyes, pale buzzcut, wearing an oversize 
           jumpsuit. Looks at his hand... and somehow makes it go still.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...ok.

           THROWS open the bathroom door, game-face on, strides out--

           INTO A GRUNGY TENEMENT 

           --where a gang of grimy, hope-to-die TEENAGE BANGERS in khaki 
           jumpsuits pack up cases of POWER TOOLS (which all look not-
           exactly-of-our-era.) Coleman gets razzed as he goes through:

                                 GANG MEMBERS 
                        Gonna pop that cherry?/Needa’ puke, 
                        it’s cool, puked my first time-- 

           A sheep in a wolfpack, Coleman follows them out to...

           AN URBAN SLUM STREET

           ...where a junked-out FUTURISTIC CAR rumbles by. CCTV DRONE-
           CAMS hover in tropical smog. A siren screams, as a POLICE AIR-
           CRUISER swoops overhead, levitation panels (AKA “repulsors”) 
           thrumming on its underside. Ladies and gents, we are in...

                       MIAMI, OPA LOCKA DISTRICT -- A WAYS FROM NOW

           As Coleman and the rest of the “Fuck-The-World-Day” Parade 
           push through the teeming corridors of this American favela, 
           we hear PHENG’S VOICE, oozing sleazy British joi de vive.

                                 PHENG (V.O.)
                        Gentlemen, long ago, back when this 
                        country still had the firepower to 
                        scare a bit of act-right into the 
                        rest of the world, the idea was: 
                        you worked hard, you got rewarded. 

           The crew brushes aside a TANGLE OF VINES, dripping down into 
           an alleyway from a FOLIAGE CANOPY above; this neighborhood is 
           so neglected, the jungle has started to reclaim it.
                                 PHENG (V.O.)
                        No matter what you were born as, 
                        you could become something better.

           On they go, past store-front churches where PREACHERS screech 
           in Haitian-Creole, past DOBERMANS barking behind razor-wire, 
           past gimlet-eyed THUGS throwing dice, some with modified 
           robotic limbs -- the garish result of back-alley Robocopping.

                                 PHENG (V.O.)
                        To that I say: take it out behind 
                        the shed, put it down and make a 
                        bath-mat out of it, because that 
                        dog does not hunt. 

           Up to a SEMI-TRUCK they march, into the cargo hold, Coleman 
           glancing over his shoulder before the door SLAMS DOWN.

                                 PHENG (V.O.)
                        You’re born what you are, you die 
                        what you are... and everything else 
                        is just noise.

           WHHHHROOOM go the truck’s repulsors as we CUT TO:

           EXT. MIAMI, AIERIAL VIEW - MOMENTS LATER

           The semi rises past a weed-strewn ABANDONED FREEWAY and heads 
           for the shimmering oasis of SOUTH BEACH. Opulent TOWERS loom 
           and ANTI-GRAV CARS crisscross along sheets of white LASER-
           LIGHT; air-roads, to keep the traffic from going willy-nilly. 

           From the sides of buildings, 3-D ADS bloom: hawking “vacation 
           shuttles” to distant planets, contact-lens video cameras, 
           synth-limb cosmetic surgery, while on a massive news-screen, 
           images of food-riots rage. In this future, the rich got 
           richer, the poor got poorer, and the middle class evaporated. 

                                 PHENG (V.O.)
                        Take heart, gentlemen. These people  
                        up here had the game rigged 100 
                        years before you got a hand dealt. 

           The truck joins a stack of cars going into a SKY FUNNEL -- 
           like two massive elevator shafts with sheets of white laser-
           light for walls, traffic rising toward the heavens as...

           INSIDE THE SEMI-TRUCK TRAILER

           Pacing past his seated crew: PHENG -- 30, platinum shades to 
           match his teeth, a 22nd-century slickster Fagin. Enough charm 
           to make you think crime not only pays, it might tip as well. 
                                 PHENG
                        But if there’s one thing I’ve 
                        learned in my years, it’s this: 
                        these people up here tend to 
                        forget. They forget that people 
                        lower on the ladder than them still 
                        exist. They forget that those who 
                        cook their meals and clean their 
                        homes and raise their spoiled spawn 
                        all come from somewhere.

           A crew member stuffs a rag into a LARGE GLASS JUG full of 
           amber fluid and passes it down the row of his cohorts...

                                 PHENG
                        They forget that when they go on 
                        vacation, for example, their 
                        security guards might be 
                        conveniently looking the other way. 

           The Molotov cocktail ends up in Coleman’s sweaty hands. 

                                 PHENG
                        They forget that people like us can 
                        still get to them.

           Pheng motions him up, Coleman follows to the loading door as 
           it’s HAULED OPEN. Sunlight blazes in, Coleman gazes out...

                                 PHENG
                             (hand on his shoulder)
                        Today, we make them remember.

           We PULL OUT AND AWAY to reveal...

           AN AIRBORNE SUBURBIA

           ...hovering a mile above the pollution line. Estates the size 
           of city blocks, powered by lev-panels. A gated community in 
           the sky, what Pandora might look like if the bad guys won. 

           Each unit encased in what looks like a massive translucent 
           bubble, which clouds pass like water around a rock; “security 
           domes.” We WHOOSH through one, down to the lush grounds of...

           EXT. MCCORMICK ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           ...the MCCORMICK ESTATE: this one is bigger than the others, 
           housing several Italian villa-style masterpieces separated by 
           woodland glades. We push down towards--

           THE SECURITY UNIT

           --a simple guard shack outside the first mansion. Two guards 
           (CLEAN CUT and SKETCHY) play cards, occasionally glancing at 
           the monitors. Sketchy throws a full house, Clean Cut moans--
                                 CLEAN CUT 
                        That is straight-up highway robbery-

           VROOM! A big shadow passes over the shack. Freaked, the 
           guards turn to the door, throw it open, looking up to see a 
           gallon-jug Molotov cocktail SLAMMING into the dome above, 
           sending flaming gasoline trailing down the invisible slope--

                                 SKETCHY
                        Jesus, whatthe-- they trying to 
                        burn down the dome?

                                 CLEAN CUT 
                        Nope.

           Sketchy turns to see Clean Cut aiming his REVOLVER at him.

                                 CLEAN CUT
                        ...it’s a signal.

           BLAM! Clean Cut blows Sketchy away, and without a wasted 
           movement, he taps a code into a keyboard, as outside--

           EXT. MCCORMICK ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           --the dome FLICKERS and VANISHES, sending fiery Molotov fluid 
           raining as the TRUCK ROARS IN LOW. Paratrooper-style, the 
           crew LEAPS in pairs from the semi as it swoops over the lawn. 

           Coleman fights vertigo, LAUNCHES OUT, stumbles hard while 
           others hit the ground running. Behind, Pheng hops out of the 
           truck, joined by Clean Cut, leading them to the front door--

                                 CLEAN CUT
                        --you got three minutes before the 
                        emergency seal goes up, after that 
                        you’re permanent residents. And 
                        don’t touch any safes, ‘less you 
                        want the calvary called in early.

                                 PHENG
                        Bravo, ten percent well earned.

           Clean Cut leans into the security eye-scanner. CLICK! Locks 
           retract. WHIR-POP! Clean Cut’s felled by a shot from Pheng’s 
           chunky HOMEMADE MAG-PISTOL (uses magnets, not gunpowder, to 
           fire bullets). Coleman forces himself not to react.

                                 PHENG
                        Look who just saved us ten percent.

           Coleman eyes the dead guard before he’s PULLED INTO--
           INT. MCCORMICK MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           THE ROBBERY: like a documentarian on bathtub speed, we follow 
           feral young thieves looting everything valuable in sight. We 
           note framed magazine covers on walls: futuristic versions of 
           Fortune, Forbes, Car and Driver, touting the advancements of 
           McCormick Industries. One features CEO GREGOR MCCORMICK next 
           to an anti-grav car: “We were promised flight. He delivered.”

                                 PHENG
                        Two minutes, thirty seconds!

           CRASH! A museum-style glass case gets SMASHED OPEN and a 
           gleaming ANTIQUE CAR ENGINE gets carried out, Coleman eyeing 
           the apparatus with something that seems almost like interest--

                                 PHENG
                        Go north, young man.

           Pheng sends him hustling up the stairs and into--

           THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

           --where Coleman empties out the bedside table; finds a 
           HANDGUN inside a velvet-lined box. Bags it, as--

                                 BRAIDS (O.S.)
                        Here, here, take this shit--

           A KID WITH BRAIDS bursts by, hands him an x-ray scanner. 
           Coleman follows him up onto the bed, they scan the walls: 
           seeing piping, insulation... and a SMALL HIDDEN COMPARTMENT.

                                 BRAIDS
                        Bingo.

           Braids YANKS a dime-thin TV away, revealing the SAFE hidden 
           behind it -- just as Pheng calls from the doorway:

                                 PHENG 
                        Don’t touch, it’ll set off the back-
                        up alarm.
                             (to Coleman)
                        You, closet, now. You, downstairs--

           As Braids hurriedly follows Pheng out with the TV, Coleman 
           lunges for the teak doors of the--

           WALK-IN CLOSET

           --throws them open, sees a neatly hung array of DESIGNER 
           BUSINESS SUITS, rows of ITALIAN SHOES. WHAM -- bagged.

                                 PHENG (O.S.)
                        Two minutes!
           WHOOSH! Coleman grabs an armful of suits, bags them. Grabs 
           the next few... and STOPS. Because there’s a live animal in 
           the closet. A collie, hind quarters sticking out under rows 
           of suits. What the hell? Coleman pushes them aside to see--

           --the dog’s being clutched by a 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL. 

           This is ELISE. Sunny, adorable, and right now, utterly 
           terrified, squeezing the dog’s jaws shut to keep it quiet. 
           Time freezes as she and Coleman stare at each other.

                                 ELISE
                             (a trembling whisper)
                        ...please.

           Coleman gives a glance to the door... then looks back to her 
           fear-stricken face, mind whirring, as we SMASH TO:

           OUT IN THE HALLWAY

                                 PHENG 
                        ONE MINUTE! ALL OF YOU OUT, NOW!

           Stragglers slip-streaming past him, Pheng storms into... THE 
           BEDROOM, where Coleman’s got the closet door shut and is 
           already gathering his loot-bags, turmoil internalized.

                                 PHENG
                        Chop-chop, train’s leaving.

           Pheng hustles the kid out, when... there’s an ANIMAL WHIMPER.

           Pheng pauses. Turns. HAULS OPEN the closet, looks in...

                                 PHENG
                        ...My God, Coleman.
                             (turns, smiling)
                        You almost left a goldmine sitting 
                        in here. Amazing what parents will 
                        pay once you’ve sent them a few of 
                        their kid’s fingers. C’mere, sweety-

           Pheng lunges to grab her, she scrambles back, he’s almost got 
           her when... CLICK-CLICK! 

           Pheng pauses. Turns to see Coleman, aiming the revolver he 
           stole from the drawer, trying to keep his hand steady.

                                 PHENG
                        Oh, now you decide you don’t have 
                        the stomach for this? Put that damn 
                        thing down before I feed you to the-

           BLAM! Coleman fires a round straight into the wall-safe, 
           setting off its alarm with an ear-splitting RIIINNNGGGGG! The 
           sound fills the house, shouts rise from downstairs--
           BAM! Pheng knocks the gun out of his hand and DECKS HIM into 
           the wall, just as SIRENS RISE IN THE DISTANCE. Pheng gives 
           him a smile as he makes a fast exit...

                                 PHENG
                        Give my regards to the police.

           Coleman, reeling, struggles to find his feet as we CUT TO:

           EXT. MCCORMICK MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Work-boots pound the grass as the remaining crew breaks for 
           the semi, Pheng bringing up the back, not even bothering to 
           shut the door as the truck’s repulsors CRESCENDO, while--

           COLEMAN

           --rushes to the window as the TRUCK RISES outside, leaving 
           him behind. Sirens getting closer, he BOLTS FOR THE DOOR... 
           then DARTS back into frame a beat later. Facing the girl. 
           Like there’s something he has to tell her. But all he has is:

                                 COLEMAN
                        Sorry about your house.

                                 ELISE
                        It’s not my house, I’m just taking 
                        care of the pets.

           She’s scared of him. He doesn’t want her to be. SIRENS closer-

                                 COLEMAN
                        What’s your name?

                                 ELISE
                        Elise.

           The howling sirens are practically right on top of them.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...have a good life, Elise.

                                 ELISE
                        You too.

           In a better world, they could’ve been something one day. In 
           this one, Coleman turns to flee as we SMASH TO:

           EXT. MCCORMICK MANSION, GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

           CRASH! A paperweight SHATTERS a sliding glass door, Coleman 
           runs through, into the gardens surrounding the mansion, as--

           --BODY-ARMORED COPS drop from the hovering cars on QUICK-
           DRAWS, sprinting, TASER-DARTS flying from their rifles as--
           --Coleman THROWS HIMSELF up onto the adobe wall surrounding 
           the property and RUNS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE ESTATE, one step 
           from a mile-deep drop into the city, searching for a way out--

           --and sees, 25 feet below, a brick-shaped DELIVERY VEHICLE 
           heading for the “flight path” of cars descending to earth -- 
           about to pass right under him. If he times this just right...

                                 COPS (O.S.)
                        HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!/HANDS UP!--

           He has two options: A -- arrest, B -- suicide. But to a gang 
           kid from the favelas, they’re the same thing. 2 seconds until 
           the cops pounce, Coleman steels himself, heart in his throat--

           AND JUMPS.

           FALLING. ARMS SPIRALING. WIND WHISPERING.

           KA-BAM! He slams into the roof of the cube-truck’s container, 
           but his momentum’s too strong and he’s sent ROLLING--

           STRAIGHT OFF THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE

           --and grabs hold of METAL HANDLES ON THE REAR SHIPPING DOORS. 
           SLAMS into the paneling, leaving him dangling as--

           THUNK! The handles SNAP DOWN and the doors SWING OPEN, 
           Coleman clings to the door as it arcs out from the truck, 
           opposing air-traffic BLURS PAST, wind pulls hard at him--

           --HIS HANDS SLIP FREE.

           And CRASH! His fall is stopped cold... having just landed on 
           the HOOD of A COP AIR-CRUISER. As he dazedly looks around...

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...shit.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           A blank police interrogation room. Coleman sits at the steel 
           table, shackled. It’s clear that the cops have not been 
           gentle with him. There’s a CLANG and...

                                 PERKINS 
                        ...fine, don’t listen, have at it--

           TWO MEN walk in: OFFICER PERKINS, fat, hatchet-faced, tissue 
           stuffed into his busted nose, leading GREGOR MCCORMICK -- the 
           guy from the magazine cover, 40’s, slyly intelligent, 
           seersucker suit, peering down at Coleman like he’s a menu... 

                                 GREGOR
                        So you’re the reason I had to come 
                        back from Barbados early.
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREGOR (CONT'D)
                             (examines his face)
                        Looks like someone else had a rough 
                        day too, huh?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Should see the other guy.

                                 PERKINS
                             (makes to grab him)
                        Sonofabitch--

                                 GREGOR
                        Mind giving me a minute with our 
                        handcuffed, underage suspect here, 
                        Officer Perkins?

           That straightens Perkins out. Gives Coleman a malevolent 
           wave, see ya soon fucko, and he exits. As Gregor sits down...

                                 COLEMAN
                        Cool -- your very own policeman.

                                 GREGOR
                        Not bad, huh? Comes standard when 
                        you join the rich-guy club.

           Coleman plays it quiet, cagey. He does this around adults, 
           authorities, anyone with money, power, whatever he never had. 

                                 GREGOR
                        I suppose I should be thanking you 
                        guys for not getting into the 
                        garage. Imagine the headline: Top 
                        Auto Manufacturer Loses Entire Car 
                        Collection To Gang Of 13-Year-Olds. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Couldn’t have got all of ‘em.
                             (off his look)
                        The PX-22, maybe. Thing’s way too 
                        easy to hotwire.

                                 GREGOR
                        You’ve hotwired a PX-22?
                             (Coleman shrugs)
                        There’s about ten guys in the world 
                        that could circumvent the security 
                        system on that thing. I’d know, 
                        they’re all working for me.

                                 COLEMAN
                        They notice the key-scanner can’t 
                        tell between a thumb and a thumb-
                        print on a sheet of cellophane?
           Gregor takes that in, impressed and hiding it. Then...

                                 GREGOR
                        Well, I hope you’re better at 
                        stealing cars than you are at 
                        robbing houses, ‘cause from my 
                        limited knowledge of your trade, 
                        purposefully triggering the alarm 
                        seems like kind of a rookie move.

           That gets Coleman’s attention.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I didn’t--

                                 GREGOR
                        Neighbor says you did. Says you 
                        saved her life.
                             (beat)
                        I’m curious: some feral little 
                        bastard from the favelas robs a 
                        house, then risks his ass to save a 
                        witness... make any sense to you?

           Coleman just gives him that 100-yard stare. Gregor gets up...

                                 GREGOR
                        Been nice talking to you, Coleman. 
                        Just wanted to tell you face to 
                        face that I’m not pressing charges.

           Hearing this, Coleman’s facade disintegrates.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...you aren’t?

                                 GREGOR
                        Stop sounding disappointed, you’re 
                        going back where you came form--

                                 COLEMAN
                        I can’t.
                             (sputters it out)
                        After today, I go back there, I’m 
                        gonna get...

           Suddenly, Gregor gets it. And for the first time, he sees  
           what Coleman is: a scared kid, in over his head. Finally...

                                 GREGOR
                        You know about cars.
                             (off his nod)
                        Know anything about fixing them?

           Off Coleman, wondering where this is going, we CUT TO:
           INT. MCCORMICK MANSION, GARAGE - DAY

           A door rises, spills light across a row of gleaming CLASSIC 
           CARS. Gregor leads Coleman into the garage at the McCormick 
           Estate, toward a rusty, once-beautiful Porsche Spyder.

                                 GREGOR
                        My wife spotted her in a scrap 
                        yard, next thing I knew she was 
                        having it unloaded into our garage. 
                        That’s the kinda woman she was.

           Coleman glances at him, Gregor moves the conversation on.

                                 GREGOR
                        You help fix this thing, you work 
                        hard, and you don’t do anything 
                        colossally stupid, you earn 
                        yourself a month. You don’t live up 
                        to your end of the bargain, I send 
                        you back to the favelas wearing a 
                        pink bow on your head. Sound fair?

           Coleman’s about to respond, when--

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Don’t make any deals with this guy, 
                        he’ll screw you every time.

           They turn to see Gregor’s son MAX MCCORMICK at the sunlit 
           entrance -- 15, hip, spoiled, likable. He’s inherited his 
           dad’s wit, but where Gregor’s springs from self-confidence, 
           Max’s reads as the overcompensation of an underloved kid.

                                 MAX
                        I seem to remember a promise about 
                        us going sailing on my birthday? 

                                 GREGOR
                        And I seem to remember you almost 
                        burning down the sun-room about a 
                        week beforehand. How peculiar...
                             (motions)
                        Coleman, Max, Max, Coleman. Gonna 
                        be helping with the Porsche.

           Max examines Coleman for a beat, like he’s doing an equation 
           in his head. Then, quick as a magic trick--

                                 MAX 
                        Nice to meet you, Coleman. C’mon...
           EXT. MCCORMICK ESTATE - DAY

           A prince in his domain, Max leads Coleman through the lush 
           grounds of the estate, WORKERS using laser-blade tools to 
           trim hedges of the courtyard around them.

                                 MAX
                        ...ok, so, courtyard, has trees and 
                        shit in it, the guy trimming the 
                        hedge is either Vincente or 
                        Vincenzo, I get them mixed up. 
                        Out here’s the employees quarters--

           Tossing a ball to the dog we saw earlier in the closet, Max  
           leads him up to the perimeter grounds where there’s a TWO 
           STORY GUESTHOUSE. Coleman takes it in when, off-handedly...

                                 MAX
                        Real step up from the favelas, huh?

           Coleman looks to him, on guard now; this guy has his number.

                                 MAX
                        Relax. My mom always told me to 
                        give everyone the benefit of the 
                        doubt til they prove you wrong.
                             (mischievous)
                        ‘Course, if you do that, I will be 
                        forced to end you.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Fair enough.

           Max smiles a little bit. Ditto Coleman. They could get along. 
           For now. As Max turns and heads back for the house...

                                 MAX
                        Welcome to the ‘burbs. 

           EXT. MCCORMICK ESTATE, LAWN - NIGHT

           WHACK! Gregor, on the moonlit lawn of his estate, swings his 
           9-iron and sends a golf ball for a long drive into the night.

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Y’know, I was thinking about that 
                        time when I was 10 and I found that 
                        terrier wandering by our old place.

           Gregor turns to see Max approaching.

                                 MAX
                        I wanted to keep it for a pet. 
                        Remember what you told me?
                                 GREGOR
                        ...“We don’t take in strays.”

                                 MAX
                        How long’s he staying?

                                 GREGOR
                        Depends on him.
                             (off his silence)
                        You worried about something, kiddo?

           Max is worried about something... but he doesn’t voice it.  

                                 MAX
                        Naw, it’s cool. Guess I’ll have 
                        someone to go running with now.

                                 GREGOR
                        That’s m’boy. 
                             (tosses him a club)
                        And thus we begin today’s round of 
                        humiliating your aged father...

           Clear that these night games are a long-standing tradition 
           between these two. As Max tees up, we PULL BACK...

           INT. MCCORMICK ESTATE, EMPLOYEE’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           ...into a window to see Coleman, in his sparse new room in 
           the EMPLOYEE’S QUARTERS. Gazing at the father and son on the 
           moonlit lawn. Max sends a drive into the security dome, faint 
           ripples echo in its wake. Gregor slaps his back. 

           Coleman watches them for a long beat. Then he lays back down, 
           an unfamiliar ache in his heart, as his eyes flutter and we--

           INT. MCCORMICK ESTATE, EMPLOYEE’S QUARTERS - MORNING

           MATCH TO Coleman’s eyes opening -- older now: 2O’s, cleaned 
           up, tight haircut, still rail-thin and tinged with rogueish 
           charisma. With the discipline of a man determined to not blow 
           his chance, he’s out of bed before his alarm goes.

           CUT TO THE EMPLOYEE DINING ROOM

           His routine: studies over breakfast in the empty dining hall. 
           No one else is awake. Title of the textbook he’s got open: 
           MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. He’s making notes while sketching out 
           the DIAGRAM SCHEMATICS of some sleek, futuristic vehicle. 

           CUT TO THE GARAGE

           Coleman, hands grease-stained, labors on Gregor’s collection 
           of cars. 
           Nearby, we see the old Porsche Spyder is now fit for a photo-
           op. As Coleman works, he wears earbuds and a wireless device, 
           playing an audiobook: The Odyssey... in Latin.

                                 AUDIOBOOK (IN LATIN, SUBTITLED)
                        ...for shame, how the mortals put 
                        the blame on us gods, for it is 
                        they, rather, who by their own 
                        recklessness, win sorrow...

           CUT TO THE BACK DECK OF THE HOUSE

           ...where Coleman, done with his morning duties and changed 
           into workout gear, jogs up the steps past Gregor -- now going 
           a little gray, enjoying a cup of French-press and a digi-
           hologram newspaper. A familiar ease has developed here.

                                 GREGOR
                        Tell me you didn’t wake up at five 
                        in the morning again.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Early bird gets the worm--

                                 GREGOR
                        --but the second mouse gets the 
                        cheese. Siddown, have some coffee.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Love to, but I promised Max I’d get 
                        his ass out of bed.

                                 GREGOR
                        Good luck with that.

           CUT TO MAX’S BEDROOM

           Coleman strides into a messy room to wake up a hungover Max.

                                 COLEMAN (IN LATIN, SUBTITLED)
                        Onward, Athenian, destiny awaits--

                                 MAX
                        Do not start talking Latin at me--

           WHOOSH! Coleman opens the blinds, sunlight spills in.

                                 MAX
                             (groans, sing-songy)
                        I’m gonna have you mur-dered...

           CUT TO THE GLADES SURROUNDING THE ESTATE

           Coleman and Max go for their AM run. Max has grown up: hazy-
           eyed, handsome, insouciant charm. Despite his hangover, he’s 
           sprinting to outrun his opponent. For Coleman, it’s friendly 
           competition; for Max, deep down, it’s not-so-friendly.
                                 MAX
                        That all you got? Damn, I oughtta 
                        just chop my legs off--

           As Coleman BOLTS AHEAD, Max tackles him. A horseplay brawl, 
           Max taunting a domesticated tiger to see if it’ll bite.

                                 MAX
                        Come on, come on, what’re you gonna 
                        do? Gonna give me that ass-beating 
                        I so richly deserve?

           Max SMACKS HIM in the mouth. WHAM! Coleman overpowers him and 
           rolls him over, pinning him, fist REARING BACK. Then...

                                 COLEMAN
                        Think I’m really gonna hit you on 
                        your graduation day?

           They bust up cackling, Coleman helps him up to his feet and 
           they run on, Max again sprinting to outrun him as we CUT TO:

           EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY

           A graduation reception in a lush college campus. In the sky, 
           the same way we see planes floating along, SPACE SHUTTLES 
           drift skyward. In the courtyard, Gregor stands with Max, 
           Coleman and a few FRIENDS/BUSINESS ASSOCIATES (including BOB, 
           a 50’s silver-haired hard-ass.) Champagne flutes raised:

                                 GREGOR
                        To Max: who, despite the ever-
                        present specter of academic 
                        probation, and engaging in enough 
                        frat-debauchery to kill several 
                        marines, still somehow graduated...

           It gets a laugh from the group. Max laughs too, but if his 
           thoughts were subtitled, they’d say “Fuck You.” But he lets 
           it go as Gregor delivers the money-line:

                                 GREGOR
                        ...and who, this time next week, 
                        will become the youngest member of 
                        my R&D team.
                             (over their applause)
                        Bob, I trust you’ll keep him from 
                        reducing the lab to a pile of 
                        rubble.

                                 BOB
                        Got my eye on this one.

           Bob gives the kid a finger-gun, Max shoots him one back.
                                 GREGOR
                             (turns)
                        And while we’re on it, here’s to 
                        Coleman -- who’ll be wearing the 
                        ol’ wizard sleeves soon enough. 
                        Looks like he’s finishing a four-
                        year program in three.

           This gets a few “oohs” from the party. Coleman looks a bit 
           embarrassed; Max looks like he’s swallowed a razor blade.

                                 GREGOR
                             (extends his glass)
                        To Max and Coleman. Your futures.

           CLINK! The group sips, gets to talking. To Coleman, “joking”:

                                 MAX
                        Always gotta be the bride at the 
                        wedding and the corpse at the 
                        funeral, huh?

           Coleman glances at him, not knowing what he means, when--

                                 ELISE (O.S.)
                        What the hell is he doing here?

           They turn to see ELISE DEMARCO -- the girl Coleman saved, now 
           all grown up, in a flattering summer dress, spunky, whip-
           smart, sexy as hell. The sight of her has a visible effect on 
           both the guys. Smirking at Coleman as she approaches.

                                 ELISE
                        Shouldn’t you be out causing 
                        mayhem, stealing cars, breaking 
                        into houses, that kind of thing?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Hey, breaking into houses was a 
                        lucrative business. I could’ve got 
                        at least thirty bucks for this girl 
                        I found in a closet one time.

           She CRACKS UP, dazzling smile, these two love busting each 
           other’s chops. They kiss, for a beat -- and by the way Max 
           stands there, trying not to watch, we can tell: he’s jealous.

                                 MAX
                        Elise, for the record, I would’ve 
                        paid at least a hundred for you.

                                 ELISE
                        ‘Course you would’ve, you cheap 
                        bastard, c’mere, congrats...
                             (bear-hugs him)
                        Let me get a picture of you two 
                        handsome devils. 
           Elise lifts a thin glass camera, aims it at them, frames a 
           PHOTO of Max and Coleman -- Coleman’s arm on Max’s shoulder, 
           Max’s smile hiding distant thunder. Off the CLICK we CUT TO:

           EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS, COURTYARD - DAY

           A STRING QUARTET plays on the courtyard stage, couples sway 
           on the grass dance floor. Coleman and Elise, cheek to cheek:

                                 ELISE
                        Question: since you’re about to 
                        become an engineer, do you get to 
                        wear one of those old-timey hats?

                                 COLEMAN
                        That’s actually all I’m gonna wear.

                                 ELISE
                        Somehow, I think that will not 
                        cause great joy in the land.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Says you.

                                 ELISE
                             (voice lowers, sensual)
                        ...by the way, I got a little pre-
                        grad present for you, should come 
                        over later and see it.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...is it an old-timey hat?

           Elise snorts back a laugh as we CUT TO:

           THE COURTYARD BAR

           ...where Max, having just slugged his third drink, motions 
           for another -- never taking his eyes off Elise and Coleman.

                                 PICKNER (O.S.)
                        Maximus!

           JEFF PICKNER, one of Max’s fratty pals, oozes up next to him.

                                 PICKNER
                        It’s all coming together, bro. I’m 
                        about to kick ass at my dad’s bank, 
                        you’re about to kick ass at 
                        McCormick Industries--

                                 MAX
                        Yes, asses everywhere are cowering 
                        in fear.

           It’s only then Pickner notices where Max is looking...
                                 PICKNER
                        Dude. I don’t get it. Chick’s 
                        surrounded by guys who’ll be owning 
                        the world in ten years and she’s 
                        hooking up with, like, the janitor. 

           Max polishes off his drink, gives a shrug.

                                 MAX 
                        We live in fascinating times.

           Pickner chuckles, but from the look in Max’s eye, we can tell 
           his feelings run deeper about the issue.

           EXT. MCCORMICK MANSION - NIGHT

           That night at the McCormick estate. Coleman leaves the garage 
           and makes for the employee quarters, alone in the dark, when--

           HIGH-BEAMS BLAST ON, Coleman WHIRLS to see a sporty burgundy 
           M.I. LYNX speeding down the driveway toward him. 

           He DODGES, the car follows, SKIDS to a sideways stop--

                                 MAX
                        Like the graduation present?

           Max is at the wheel, fresh from the party. Coleman wipes his 
           brow, approaches the car, digging it:

                                 COLEMAN
                        Thanks, really, you shouldn’t have--

                                 MAX
                        Ha ha, funny--

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’m serious, I’m gonna have to 
                        steal this. I can’t help it, my 
                        childhood instincts are kicking in--

                                 MAX
                        --hop in, let’s take her out.
                             (off his hesitation)
                        You’ll work on ‘em, but you won’t 
                        give yourself the joy of riding in 
                        one? You that much of a boyscout?

           A beat as Coleman thinks. Max smiles, knowing he’s got him.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - NIGHT

           The boys WHIP into the city like a blow-dart through Amazon 
           foliage. Slaloming by rickshaws and under HOVER-TRAINS.
                                 MAX
                        You, grease monkey of all grease 
                        monkeys, should dig how she steers--

                                 COLEMAN
                             (SKIDDING through a turn)
                        Whoah, whoah--

                                 MAX
                        Doesn’t do anti-grav, but let’s 
                        face it, anti-grav’s kinda trashy--

           Coleman looks over to see Max taking a long pull off a FLASK.

                                 COLEMAN
                        The hell are you--

           WHAM! Max slams the gas, jerking Coleman back in his seat as 
           they ROAR onto a FREEWAY RAMP, past a sign marked CLOSED. The 
           road beyond them blocked by a chain-link gate.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Holy shit--

           CRASH! They PLOW THROUGH THE GATE and speed up onto...

           THE ABANDONED FREEWAY: a concrete strip of crater-sized 
           potholes, dead streetlights, foliage-choked cracks. Max 
           weaves PAST HUNKS OF DEBRIS and FALLEN SIGNS--

                                 MAX
                             (off Coleman’s fear)
                        C’mon Coleman, stop freaking out, 
                        you’re supposed to be the man! You 
                        finished a 4-year program in three! 
                        Why do you look so scared?--

                                 COLEMAN
                        --that what this is? You pissed off 
                        that your dad called me out--

                                 MAX 
                        Who said I was pissed off?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Fine-- what do you want?

                                 MAX 
                        I want you to beg my forgiveness. 
                        Can you do that, Coleman?

           Max looks him, pleasant smile, “patient”, just as a REBAR 
           SPIKE sticking out of rubble pile emerges ahead of them and-- 
           KA-CHUNK! The spike RIPS OUT A TIRE, throws the vehicle into 
           a nauseating SPIN, it clips the median, door imploding and 
           CRUSHING MAX’S ARM, airbags deploying, car rolling over the 
           barrier and toward the street as we SMASH TO:

           NEWS FOOTAGE OF THE CRASH: 

           Coleman, battered and bloody, pulling Max away from the car 
           as flames rise up within it, rubberneckers gathering around 
           to watch, as a handsome NEWSCASTER continues:

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        --in recovery after his accident 
                        last week, police say the crash 
                        resulted from a faulty navigation 
                        system in the prototype vehicle--

           Coleman, cuts and bruises healing, shakes his head as he 
           passes the TV, revealing we’re in...

           THE LOBBY OF A HOSPITAL

           ...Gregor, quieter than normal, strides down the gleaming 
           hall with him, past NURSES filling out charts on digi-
           tablets. We note the PACKAGE Coleman carries as we CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL, PHYSICAL THERAPY WING - DAY

           A PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM, where Max (seen in profile, wounds 
           bandaged) talks with PERKINS -- the cop from earlier, looking 
           even fatter and scummier, his nose still slightly crooked 
           from when Coleman broke it all those years ago.

                                 PERKINS
                        --look, Max, this ain’t exactly 
                        proving easy to keep under wraps--

                                 MAX
                        If it was easy, I wouldn’t be 
                        paying you. Just stay on message--
                             (sees he’s got visitors)
                        You made it.

           As Gregor and Coleman enter, Perkins quickly tucks a THICK-
           STUFFED ENVELOPE into his jacket as he turns, “innocent”--

                                 PERKINS
                        Mr. McCormick. Thought I’d drop in, 
                        see how the patient’s doing--

                                 GREGOR
                        Get the hell outta here, Perkins.

           Perkins makes for the exit, gives Coleman a look-of-death.
                                 COLEMAN
                        Still got your nose out of joint, 
                        officer?

                                 PERKINS
                        That’s “detective” now, shithead.

           SLAM! Perkins shuts the door behind him.

                                 MAX
                        I think he missed you. 

           Coleman lifts his gift out of the package -- it’s a FRAMED 
           PHOTO: Max and Coleman at the graduation, all smiles.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Thought it’d class up the joint.

           Max, smirking, takes it from him as we reveal his left arm is 
           gone -- replaced with a ROBO-PROSTHETIC. Attached at the 
           shoulder, scar tissue giving way to artificial flesh and 
           exposed titanium, mini-hydraulics, whirring gears, etc.

                                 MAX
                        Great, now I gotta spend all day 
                        looking at your ugly mug--

                                 GREGOR
                        Why’d you lie to me, Max?

           Gregor just shut down the room with that. Max feels it out...

                                 MAX 
                        I don’t know what you’re--

                                 GREGOR
                        You were drunk. Night of the crash.

           Max glances at Coleman. Storm clouds. Gregor sees it.

                                 GREGOR
                        He didn’t say shit. Drone-cams 
                        picked up a nice shot of you 
                        chugging brandy at a stoplight. 

                                 MAX
                        Pop, it’s ok, I handled it--

                                 GREGOR
                        I don’t care how much cash you 
                        throw into Perkins’ yacht-fund, you 
                        coulda’ killed people last week, 
                        I’m not letting you sweep that away-

                                 MAX
                        So what, huh? This gonna be news?
                                 GREGOR
                        It already is.

                                 MAX
                        How am I supposed to go to work for 
                        you with that all over TV? 

           There’s dead silence, before Max puts it together--

                                 MAX
                        You’re not giving me the job.
                             (Gregor shakes his head)
                        What, because I messed up? 

                                 GREGOR
                        Because you drove drunk. Because 
                        you barely graduated. Because you 
                        treat the world like it’s a gift-
                        bag. Because of who you are, Max. 
                        And you’re not the guy for this--

                                 MAX
                        That’s bullshit--

           CRASH! Max swings his prosthetic arm across the bedside 
           table, sweeping its contents onto the floor. The picture 
           Coleman gave him CRACKS. Everything goes quiet. Then...

                                 GREGOR
                        I’ll send a driver over tomorrow.

           With that, Gregor exits. Coleman and Max are left alone.

                                 MAX 
                             (seething)
                        Go.

           INT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Shaken, Coleman exits. Across the hall by the elevator--

                                 GREGOR 
                        My father once told me “Beware the 
                        life bereft of consequence.” Took 
                        me a while to learn that, it’ll 
                        take Max time too. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        That’s a helluva teaching method.

                                 GREGOR
                        I didn’t take the job away because 
                        I was angry at him, Coleman. 
                             (focuses on him)
                        I did it because I found a better 
                        candidate.
           A loaded pause. Coleman looks at him cautiously.

                                 GREGOR
                        I’ve seen the diagrams you work on. 
                        Interesting stuff--

                                 COLEMAN
                        You’ve been looking at my--

                                 GREGOR
                        Only for the past four years. 
                             (off his gobsmacked stare)
                        Look: this job requires maturity, a 
                        work ethic, and genuine passion for 
                        what we’re building. And no matter 
                        how much I want that to be my son, 
                        he’s not there yet. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Due respect, this is insane. 
                        There’s no way I’m qualified, I 
                        went to night school--

                                 GREGOR
                        I know where you went. Know where I 
                        went? Night school. Turned out ok.

           Coleman keeps his distance. Struggling with his choice.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...what about Max?

                                 GREGOR
                        Let me worry about him. And no 
                        matter what you decide, keep it to 
                        yourself for the time being, I 
                        don’t want this going wide yet. 
                        That includes with Elise. 
                             (off his silence)
                        Take a day to think about it.

           As Coleman ponders, we PULL BACK into Max’s room: Max stands, 
           his back to the door, listening. Head low, trembling in his 
           hospital gown, eyes squeezed shut in rage.

           INT. ELISE’S LOFT - EVENING

           A doorbell CHIMES in a shabby-chic artist’s loft. Elise puts 
           down her paintbrush and makes for the door to reveal Coleman-- 

                                 ELISE
                        Well if it isn’t the Terror of the 
                        410 Freeway--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Hold still.
           He reaches up... and fastens a GOLD LOCKET NECKLACE around 
           her neck. She looks at it, stunned.

                                 ELISE
                        You can’t afford this--

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’ll be able to.
                             (before she can speak)
                        Can’t tell you what the deal is, 
                        not yet. But it’s good news.

           Taking the hint, she pulls him in to kiss him as we CUT TO:

           INT. ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Elise -- sweaty, sated, unclothed -- flops down next to 
           Coleman on the bed. In her windows, the sprawling city 
           glitters, distant anti-grav cars drifting like fireflies. 
           Draping an arm over him, she quotes “The Odyssey”:

                                 ELISE (IN LATIN, SUBTITLED)
                        You are an indurate man, Odysseus. 
                        Your limbs never wear out...

                                 COLEMAN (IN LATIN, SUBTITLED)
                             (rolls over)
                        ...you must be made all of iron, 
                        when you will not let your 
                        companions find sleep--

                                 ELISE
                        Someone’s been doing his homework.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Audio version, at least--

                                 ELISE
                        Lame--

                                 COLEMAN
                        --your favorite book’s a thousand 
                        years old and I’m lame?

           Grinning, she walks her fingers up his chest. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        When you gonna finish the Ravenwood 
                        Cliffs?

           He’s pointing across the room at a half-finished PAINTING on 
           an easel: a muted-color landscape, a weathered cabin perched 
           atop cliffs overlooking the ocean, hidden in trees. 
                                 ELISE
                        I was waiting for you to graduate 
                        and get some big, mysterious job 
                        you can’t tell me about, then 
                        charge you double for it.

           He chuckles, but his eyes are focused out the windows, where 
           FAINT FIREWORKS CRACKLE over the far-off favelas.

                                 COLEMAN
                        When I was about 10, me and some 
                        friends found a bunch of fireworks 
                        over in the Chinese quarter. 

                                 ELISE
                        Oh, you “found” them?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Yeah, we found ‘em. In a shipping 
                        container. That we broke into.
                             (off her laugh)
                        Anyway, we went up to the roof of 
                        our building, started lighting ‘em 
                        up. Thought it’d piss people off, 
                        but the whole neighborhood came 
                        out. We had 4th of July in January. 

                                 ELISE
                             (a nod)
                        Good day.

                                 COLEMAN
                        My best. For a while.

                                 ELISE
                             (after a beat)
                        ...my best day? If I had to pick? 
                        Last week, this Italian male model 
                        came in for my nude-drawing class, 
                        it was, like, life-changing--

                                 COLEMAN
                             (stands)
                        Where is he, I must fight him--

                                 ELISE
                        Yes, go, defend my honor--

           Cracking up, he lets her pull him back in, and they kiss. 
           More fireworks rise and twinkle dimly in the hazy distance. 

                                 ELISE
                        I don’t know what my best day is.
                        But I have an idea of what my best 
                        years are gonna be.

           He nods, ditto, and as their lips meet again, we CUT TO:
           EXT. MCCORMICK MANSION, LAWN - MORNING

           In the light of Sunday morning, Gregor hits golf balls on the 
           lawn. Glances over to see Coleman, in his AM routine, jogging 
           out of the woods surrounding the mansion.

                                 GREGOR
                        That looks like the stride of a man 
                        who’s made a decision--

                                 COLEMAN
                        I wanna work for you. 
                             (beat)
                        But I’m not gonna take something 
                        that was supposed to go to Max. 

                                 GREGOR
                        The idea that things are “supposed 
                        to go to Max” is Max’s problem.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Is he a little entitled? Yeah. But 
                        his heart’s in the right place. And 
                        you’re not gonna teach him anything  
                        getting his arm ripped off hasn’t.
                             (off his look)
                        It’s a big company, there’s gotta 
                        be room for both of us.

           Gregor silently appraises him a beat... and we see something 
           like respect settling into his gaze. Finally:

                                 GREGOR
                        Maybe you’re right. Let’s figure it 
                        out, grab a club.

           As Coleman makes his way over, we CUT TO:

           INSIDE THE HOUSE

           ...where Max, fresh from the hospital, walks in as his DRIVER 
           unloads his bag from the car. Flexes a hand as he goes, his 
           synth-arm almost identical to his real one. Calling out:

                                 MAX
                        Dad?

           No answer. Then he hears a familiar CRACK. Walks fast to a 
           window, looks TO THE LAWN... where his dad and Coleman are 
           hitting golf balls into the trees. Talking, friendly.

           Staring at this final insult, Max lets out a low breath. A 
           long-gestating decision solidifies in his brain. And as the 
           room’s ambient noise builds to a horrible hiss, we CUT TO:
           INT. MCCORMICK MANSION, STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           WHOOSH! Down in the gloomy storage room of the McCormick 
           Mansion, amidst the rows of crates and file cabinets, Max 
           HAULS OPEN a drawer and dumps its contents onto the floor. 

           Feverishly sifts through the papers, searches, searches, gets 
           a papercut, barely notices, until... he finds THE FILE he’s 
           after. Throws it open, reads it, eyes lit, yes, yes, yes...

                                 PERKINS (PRE-LAP)
                        Let’s see here: got paroled three 
                        weeks ago after a a seven-year bid 
                        for murder, grand theft and B&E...

           EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

           Det. Perkins exits the precinct with Max, going over a file.

                                 PERKINS
                        ...priors of aggravated assault, 
                        trafficking... wanna tell me why 
                        you wanna find this winner so bad?

           No answer as we pan down to the file: PHENG’S MUG-SHOT.

           INT. PHENG’S PAD - EVENING

           The past 9 years have not been kind to Pheng: he’s still got 
           that same sleazy elegance, but he’s now weathered, broken 
           down, living in a favela hovel. Hums along with “Pachelbel’s 
           Cannon” as he settles in for a post-dinner bath...

                                 PHENG
                        Dummm dah dah dah dummm...

           Taking a DROPPER of Push, he drips the liquid narcotic into 
           his eyes as WHAM! His door gets KICKED IN by Perkins.

                                 PHENG
                        Perkins! Lovely. If you’re here to 
                        shake me down for old times sake,  
                        afraid all you’ll find is a toaster 
                        and some used hypodermic needles.
                             (as Max enters)
                        Good, your partner’s here. Teaching 
                        him the fine art of taking bribes?

                                 MAX 
                        We’re not here for a bribe, Pheng.

                                 PHENG
                        God, a first. Someone take a photo.

           Pheng’s mood shifts as Max takes a hit off his eyedropper.
                                 PHENG
                        So... I’ll assume you’re not a cop?

                                 MAX
                        If I was, I’d charge you with 
                        “Possession of Push Cut With So 
                        Much Windex I Don’t Know Whether To 
                        Get High Or Clean My House.” 

                                 PHENG
                        So you’re more of a connoisseur--

                                 MAX
                        I’m a guy with an offer. 
                             (off his look)
                        Remember a skinny little bastard 
                        who used to work for you? Got you 
                        seven years on some prison planet? 

                                 PHENG
                             (a slow nod)
                        ...not a day goes by.

           Max grins, leans in to make his deal as we CUT TO: 

           INT. MCCORMICK MANSION, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           OPERA plays as we float through the McCormick’s kitchen, 
           where a SERVANT preps cocktails. As she goes into the pantry-- 

           --MAX slips into frame, emptying the contents of TWIN EYE-
           DROPPERS INTO EACH DRINK, exits before the servant reemerges.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           We follow Max down the corridor, past the DEN, where Gregor 
           talks with Coleman, the servant coming out carrying their 
           drinks. Max gives them a final glance... and keeps walking.

           INT. MCCORMICK MANSION, GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           A car door SHUTS and Max slumps down in the driver’s seat. 

                                 MAX
                        ...they’re good to go.

           That’s all he says. Pheng climbs out of the backseat as Max 
           drives off to his alibi. As Pheng pulls on a GAS-MASK...

           INT. MCCORMICK MANSION, DEN - SAME

           OPERA BLARES as the half-drunk cocktail sweats in Coleman’s 
           hand as Gregor LAUGHS FREAKISHLY HARD at a joke he’s just 
           made. Coleman’s pale now, pupils wide as--
           OUTSIDE: Pheng glides through a door, grooves down a hall as--

           IN THE DEN: Coleman, forehead slick, COLLAPSES. Through his 
           POV, Gregor tries to shake us out of it--

           --and as the MUSIC SWELLS, a blurry MASKED FIGURE appears 
           behind Gregor and aims a HANDMADE GUN at his skull...

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...no...

           From OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, we hear a POP! POP! POP! 

           SMASH TO BLACKNESS. 

                                 TABLOID ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Just this week, the blood-soaked 
                        saga of Edward Coleman...

           TV NEWS FOOTAGE: the BLOOD-SPATTERED MURDER SCENE, Gregor 
           McCormick getting auto-sealed into a body bag, beat-up 
           Coleman being hurled into a cop car amidst a swarm of police. 

                                 TABLOID ANNOUNCER
                        ...ended with a guilty verdict.

           Coleman in court, being sentenced, as the announcer goes on:

                                 TABLOID ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        We caught up with Max McCormick, 
                        longtime friend of the convicted--

           Max, in a tasteful suit, addresses a reporter on camera:

                                 MAX 
                        --I do not believe, for one 
                        instant, that he committed these--

                                 REPORTER
                        --he claims to have no memory of 
                        the night, yet he was found at the 
                        scene with a gun used by his old 
                        gang, drugs in his system-

                                 MAX
                        I’m aware--

                                 REPORTER
                        --the arresting officer testified 
                        he found Coleman in a rage about 
                        your father renegging on a job--

           Max SWATS the camera away as we cut back to the announcer:
                                 TABLOID ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Detective James Perkins, key 
                        witness to the DA, delivered his 
                        statement this morning--

           Footage of Detective Perkins, delivering his soundbite:

                                 PERKINS
                        Greg McCormick took a leap of faith 
                        letting this diseased soul into his 
                        life... and he paid dearly for it. 

           Cut to Coleman, muscled out of the courtroom by armed guards--

                                 TABLOID ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        With a life sentence awaiting him 
                        on I.F. 35, Edward Coleman’s only 
                        begun to pay a price of his own.

           And as the camera zooms in on Coleman’s eyes, we CUT TO:

           INT. JAIL, VISITING ROOM - DAY

           Coleman’s eyes -- dead, lifeless. He sits in the jail 
           visiting room: steel table, blast-proof glass walls. 

                                 ELISE
                        I’m not gonna stop.

           Reveal Elise across from him -- looking older than her years 
           now. But true to form, she won’t wave the white flag.

                                 ELISE
                        I’m gonna get it overturned. I 
                        don’t care how long it--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Elise?
                             (beat)
                        Wake up. Perkins won. He wanted to 
                        put me here since I was a kid--

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        That’s time, people.

           A guard approaches to escort her out. A few seconds to go...

                                 ELISE
                        See this?
                             (re: necklace he gave her)
                        ...this stays on until I see you 
                        again. You’re gonna be right here, 
                        nowhere else. Understand?

           She motions to the locket, by her heart. As she’s lead off, 
           he leaves her with familiar words...
                                 COLEMAN
                        ...have a good life, Elise.

           CLANG! The door shuts. Coleman looks down... failing to 
           notice Max, ushered in by a guard. Soon as they’re alone--

                                 MAX
                        Hey brother.

           Coleman looks up as Max sits. Keeping his voice steady.

                                 MAX
                        I’m... I’m sorry, I...
                             (quiets)
                        ...I wish it didn’t come to this. 

           Max isn’t being disingenuous. For him, this is a deeply 
           emotional moment; a catharsis. Coleman’s eyes narrow...

                                 COLEMAN
                        What the hell are you--

                                 MAX 
                        Remember when I said I give 
                        everyone the benefit of the doubt 
                        until they prove me wrong, Coleman?
                             (beat)
                        Remember what I said would happen 
                        if you did?

           And as he meets Max’s stare, Coleman realizes...

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...you... did this...

                                 MAX
                        No. You did this. Because you just 
                        couldn’t learn your place. You had 
                        to go and try to take mine. 

           Coleman’s quaking with rage in his chair, as Max ramps up:

                                 MAX
                        You got my father, you got my job, 
                        you got Elise, and you know what I 
                        get? 
                             (leans in)
                        I get to see the look on your face 
                        right now.

           Coleman LUNGES at him, just as GUARDS pour in, SHOCK-BATONS 
           sending Coleman down, CHOKED RASPS coming out of his mouth as-

           --the last thing he sees is this: Max, guiding Elise away 
           under his arm, door closing behind them as we SMASH TO BLACK.
           INT. CONVICT TRANSPORTER 

           A hand trembles. Coleman rides along, shackled in a line of 
           ROCK CONS. Stares at his fingers, trying to still his panic 
           reflexes through sheer will... only now, it doesn’t work.

                                 SPARLING (O.S.)
                        Lookin’ a little shaky there, son.

           He gives a quick glance at a tattooed thug we’ll call 
           SPARLING, scuzz and violence encoded into his DNA. Sparling, 
           sensing weakness, smiles. Over the INTERCOM we hear:

                                 VOICE OVER INTERCOM
                        Inmates prepare for landing.

           The vessel SHAKES VIOLENTLY as it enters the atmosphere and 
           we PULL OUTSIDE to reveal the ship descending towards...

           ...A LOOMING PLANET: the color of stomach acid, desert-like 
           expanses stretching as far as the eye can see. And slowly 
           taking shape amidst curtains of dust-strewn wind is...

           THE PRISON ITSELF: like a 1000-foot titanium tree, pod-like 
           cells lining its branches. A looming megalith of despair. 

                                DETENTION FACILITY I.F. 35

           INT. PRISON SHIP, LOADING BAY - DAY

           HISS goes landing gear as the ship docks in the LOADING BAY: 
           a massive hangar where ROWS OF SHIPS eject lines of cons and 
           crates of gear. Dirty orange wind howls through the portals.

           Joining the line, Coleman looks out to a deck where a PRIVATE 
           SPACESHIP rests -- a two seater, sleek as a vitamin capsule, 
           MI logo on the grill -- before he’s hustled on toward hell.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER (PRE-LAP)
                        I’d like to welcome you all to 
                        Detention Facility I.F. 35.

           INT. PRISON - DAY

           The prisoners file through the security gate where WARDEN 
           WEISBECKER waits: female, 30’s, attractive in a polished-
           steel kinda way. If she’s at all intimidated by the predatory 
           looks she’s getting from the inmates, it doesn’t show.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        My name is Warden Weisbecker. If 
                        you’ll follow me, please...

           Weisbecker suddenly FLICKERS and VANISHES. Then REAPPEARS a 
           beat later, down at the processing desk; 
           she’s a hologram, giving a pre-recorded spiel. No wonder she 
           seems so fucking comfortable. As she guides them toward the 
           MEDICAL CENTER...

                        First thing: body-mods. Against 
                        regulations. You’ll be relieved of 
                        them here in the medical bay...

           Half surgery theater, half industrial disassembly line: teams 
           of HAGGARD-FACED DOCTORS use power saws and hand-drills to 
           remove BODY-MODS from semi-sedated prisoners gritting their 
           teeth in pain. A cart of robo-limbs gets dumped down a trash-
           chute marked MEDICAL WASTE, into the raging fires below as--

           INT. PRISON, WARDEN’S OFFICE - SAME

           Aromatherapy candles burn as the real Warden Weisbecker sits 
           in her long, sleek office, getting a hand-massage from her 
           tiny FEMALE ASIAN ASSISTANT. On a bank of security monitors, 
           we see her digital doppelganger continue the tour...

                        Over here is the com-center... 

           DOWN IN THE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER

           ...hologram Weisbecker leads the prisoners past a blank room 
           lined with glass cubicles, each with a projection screen.

                        ...once a year, you’ll receive 
                        messages here. Your correspondence 
                        card is a privilege. You fight, you 
                        destroy property, you so much as 
                        irritate an employee, specifically 
                        me, you lose your one line to the 
                        world. Make your choices carefully.
                             (beat)
                        Enjoy your stay, gentlemen.

           Coleman, taking this all in, is guided into the belly of the 
           beast... and we hear the last thing we expect: a clear, 
           familiar voice. Sam Cooke singing “A Change Is Gonna Come.” 

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        I was born by the river in a little 
                        tent...

           CUT TO A SERIES OF SHOTS 

           --Coleman’s stripped naked. Strapped to a chair. Robotic 
           razors shave off his hair. A dental speculum gets shoved into 
           his mouth, props his jaws open, a TUBE-LIKE CAMERA gets fed 
           down his throat, checking for contraband as he writhes.
                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        Oh and just like that river/I've 
                        been running ever since...

           --WHAM! Steel bars shoot out of the walls, clanging into 
           place. Coleman, head shaved, gazes out in quiet terror. We 
           pull away, gradually losing Coleman’s cell amidst the others.

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        It's been a long time coming/But I 
                        know a change gonna come...

           --We soar over the yard, into a BRAWL: Coleman, getting beat 
           by Sparling and his gang. Refusing to fight back, he takes 
           it, head SNAPPING SIDEWAYS in a spray of bloody spittle.

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        It's been too hard living but I'm 
                        afraid to die...

           --Coleman, beat to shit, limps into the MESSAGE ROOM. Stuffs 
           his plastic CORRESPONDENCE CHIP into a slot, a holo-screen 
           boots up. Like a supplicant before a shrine, he watches a 
           message from Elise; his reward for not fighting back.

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        Cause I don't know what's up there 
                        beyond the sky...

           --A PRISON RIOT rages on the main floor, an almost balletic 
           panorama of destruction. We PULL BACK INTO COLEMAN’S CELL, 
           where he stands, his back to the chaos, a statue. 

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        It's been a long time coming, but I 
                        know a change gonna come...

           --Consequences for staying out of the riot are brutal. WHAM! 
           Coleman gets HAULED OUT OF HIS LUNCH SEAT by Sparling and his 
           gang, dragged along the floor, kicking and struggling as... 

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        Then I go to my brother/And I say 
                        brother help me please/But he winds 
                        up knockin' me down on my knees...

           --WHOOSH! 3-D x-rays show a shattered jaw. Coleman, in the 
           med-bay, a pile of human rubble, takes food through a straw.

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        It’s been a long time coming...

           --Coleman, eyes bruised into slits, hurriedly feeds his 
           correspondence card into the slot, the holo-screen boots up. 
           A new year, a new message from Elise. She’s still wearing the 
           necklace, but seems sleep deprived, exhausted... distant.
                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        But I know a change gonna come...

           --Coleman, in his cell, pulls the bandages away from the 
           slash-wound on his stomach and sees that GNAT LIKE INSECTS 
           have infested the gash. Dry-heaving, he CLAWS AT HIMSELF--

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        There were times that I felt I 
                        couldn’t last for long...

           --Coleman, another year older, lunges into his com-booth... 
           and discovers his inbox is empty. He sits, bathed in the cold 
           light, as we WHOOSH AROUND him, through the screen, and--

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        ...but now I think I’m able to 
                        carry on...

           --WE’RE BACK WITH HIM, a year older, bearded, haggard, still 
           with no messages. His face desolate as we WHOOSH AROUND--

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        It’s been a long time coming...

           --AND INTO HIS CELL, where he lays still on the floor in a 
           dark spreading puddle, having slashed his wrists open with 
           the sharpened edge of his correspondence card. As a GURNEY is 
           wheeled into frame and MEDICS haul him up, we FADE TO BLACK. 

                                 SAM COOKE (ON SOUNDTRACK)
                        But I know a change is gonna come.

           INT. PRISON - DAY

           A chyron reads:

                                      5 YEARS LATER

           CLANG! The bars of his cell retract and Coleman -- still 
           alive, unfortunately -- walks out. Scarred and skeletal, aged 
           beyond his years, barely recognizable. A GUARD calls for him:

                                 GUARD
                        Correspondence room, Coleman, 
                        you’re up.

           Coleman stares at him, zombie-like, then follows.

           INT. PRISON, CORRESPONDENCE ROOM - DAY

           The screen FLICKERS on -- and there’s a message waiting. 
           Coleman’s eyes light up... but then he sees it’s not from 
           Elise. The sender’s name is listed as M. McCormick. 
           ON THE SCREEN

           HANDHELD FOOTAGE plays of a lavish outdoor wedding reception. 
           The cameraman trying to get someone’s attention--

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        --man of the hour, anything to say?

           Turning to the camera is the groom -- Max, tuxedo’d, tipsy.

                                 MAX
                        Hey babe, be articulate for me--

           The POV swerves over toward ELISE, in her wedding dress. The 
           necklace he gave her is gone. She looks happy. Almost. 

                                 MAX
                        Got anything to say for anyone who 
                        couldn’t make it?

                                 ELISE
                        ...where are you that’s so 
                        important?

           Max smiles at us: “Fuck you, I won.” Leans over, they kiss, 
           for a while, and CLICK! The transmission ends. PAN OVER TO--

           Coleman. Sitting. Staring. The zombie’s been resurrected.

                                 GUARD
                        Hey pal, time’s up.
                             (Coleman doesn’t move)
                        You heard what I--

           WHAM! Coleman grabs the guy and slams his face into the 
           screen. CRACKS IT. Drops him. Snatches his shock-baton as--

           INT. PRISON, MAIN AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           WHOOSH! Doors open, Coleman storms into the dining area. 
           ALARMS WAIL, but Coleman pays no mind. He beats a path 
           straight towards Sparling and his crew at a table--

                                 SPARLING
                        Well if it ain’t the prodigal--

           BAM! Coleman blasts the guy’s teeth out with the baton. Sends 
           him to the floor, KEEPS SWINGING, gets pulled back by guards, 
           rips free, and tears a SWATH THROUGH THE INCOMING CROWD as...

           The floor erupts into a RIOT. Coleman’s SWARMED and BUFFETED 
           OVER THE HORDE, face a rictus of suicidal ecstasy--

                                 COLEMAN
                        WHO WANTS IT?!
           INT. WARDEN WEISBECKER’S OFFICE - DAY

           FREEZE FRAME on Coleman’s face -- it’s security footage of 
           the riot, on a screen in Weisbecker’s office, where the 
           warden confers with a Guard (call him ONE-EARED JACK):

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        You’re telling me he’s spent the 
                        past nine years keeping to himself 
                        and then--

                                 ONE-EARED JACK
                        --starts the biggest riot in prison 
                        history and bites off my goddamn 
                        ear? Yep, pretty much.

           Jack has a red-blotched bandage over the remains of his ear.

                                 ONE-EARED JACK
                        Enough’s enough, warden, this guy’s 
                        about to have himself an accident--

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        That’s not going to send the right 
                        kind of message, now is it?
                             (off his look)
                        We’re gonna put him downstairs.

           One-Eared Jack’s frown gets turned upside down as we CUT TO:

           INT. PRISON, LOWER LEVELS - NIGHT

           CLANG! A cage elevator arrives in the bowels of the prison. 
           Coleman’s hauled out by TWO GUARDS, One-Eared Jack in the 
           lead. The guards simultaneously swipe TWIN SECURITY KEYS to 
           open a barred gate, guiding him into the dank realm ahead...

                                 ONE-EARED JACK
                        Gonna love it down here, pal...

           They pass through the security checkpoint and into a dim 
           corridor of basement cells, MUFFLED SCREAMS and MOANS heard 
           within, the whole place rank with piss, sweat, misery...

                                 ONE-EARED JACK
                        ...gonna fit right in.

           ...they get to the end of the row, where the guards twin-scan 
           open a BARRED TRAPDOOR IN FLOOR. As they unshackle Coleman--

                                 ONE-EARED JACK
                             (calls down into cell)
                        Enjoy!

           Jack THROWS Coleman down the hole, scan-locks the trapdoor.
           INT. SUBTERRANEAN CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Dark in here. Blacker than the inside of your fist. Coleman 
           sits up, looks around. Ten by ten. Steel walls. He turns 
           slowly, trying to get his bearings... and someone SNIFFS.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Hello?

           FSSSHT! A match strikes and suddenly there’s a LIGHT, coming 
           from a SINGLE LUMPY CANDLE. Coleman, sensing an oncoming 
           attack, just stands there. Welcoming it.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Gave you a candle in here, huh?

           A MAN’S VOICE, flat and metallic, floats out of the darkness.

                                 MAN’S VOICE 
                        I made it myself.
                             (beat)
                        Want to know how?...

           The voice is coming from a different direction now. Coleman’s 
           getting circled. Stalked. Still, he doesn’t move a muscle.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Rendering fat. Human fat. From the 
                        ones they put in here. They became 
                        my light. Just as you will.

           WHAM! Coleman’s knocked to his knees by an unseen blow. 
           SCREEE! A LONG BLADE drags across the wall, sprays sparks, 
           before it touches down on the back of Coleman’s neck. He 
           doesn’t struggle; to him, it’s like icewater on a hot day.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                             (a whisper)
                        Are you ready?

           A nod. The figure winds back... and in the flickering light, 
           Coleman sees WORDS ETCHED ON THE WALL. A phrase in Latin. 

                                 COLEMAN
                             (bleary last words)
                        ...”the die is cast.”

           CLANG! The blade drops to the floor. Coleman’s attacker moves 
           around, lighting more candles, until finally... we see him.

           GABRIEL MOLDESANTOS -- 50’s, with a wiry strength that belies 
           his size. Pale, waxy skin. Eyes that glint in the gloom. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        You speak Latin.
           His voice has done a 180. No longer the whispery wraith-sound 
           it was moments before; it’s posh, English, more like 
           something aged in an oak barrel. Almost... gentlemanly. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Gabriel Moldesantos. Pleasure to 
                        make your acquaintance.
                             (offers his hand)
                        In case this is still unclear, the 
                        only reason you’re not being 
                        converted into candle wax is 
                        because I think you might make for 
                        slightly more stimulating company 
                        than the illiterate refuse they 
                        usually throw down here. 
                             (beat)
                        Where did you learn Latin?

           Coleman stares, bewildered. Gabriel motions -- come, sit.

           INT. BASEMENT CELL - DAY

           Chess pieces cut from human bone get moved across a “board” 
           carved into the floor. Gabriel and Coleman, mid-match:

                                 GABRIEL
                             (completely at home)
                        So. What are you in for?

                                 COLEMAN
                             (freaked, hiding it)
                        Unpaid parking tickets. You?

                                 GABRIEL
                        I was responsible for a rash of 
                        jaywalkings about 30 years ago.

                                 COLEMAN
                        This what lifers talk about?

                                 GABRIEL
                        “Lifer” as in “a man who is going 
                        to spend his life in prison?”

           It’s an odd question, and before Coleman can say anything--

                                 GABRIEL
                             (makes a move)
                        Check.

           Seeing he’s got no more moves, Coleman tips his king over.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Only the 26th time you’ve won 
                        today, you must be very proud--
           WHAM! Gabriel SWINGS HIS ARM across the board, spraying 
           pieces all over the place, flying off in a sudden rage:

                                 GABRIEL
                        Not proud. Bored. You’re Boring Me. 
                        Give me paint drying. Give me grass 
                        growing. Give me a thousand-page 
                        book on the history of sand. But if 
                        you give me one more predictable 
                        game of chess, so help me, I’m 
                        going to slit your throat. 
                             (smiles)
                        Shall we go again?

           And off Coleman’s wan expression, we CUT TO:

           COLEMAN AND GABRIEL

           Coleman, sweating, plays with laser-like focus. Gabriel, 
           lounging, moves pieces with the tip of his machete.

                                 GABRIEL
                             (eyes the board)
                        Interesting move, why that one?

                                 COLEMAN
                        You always attack my knights first.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Fair enough. It’ll cost you a rook--

           Gabriel FLICKS his rook off the board with the blade.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...and that’ll make it check-mate.

           Coleman makes his move. A beat as Gabriel surveys the 
           board... and tips over his king. Impressed.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Good. Why did you win this time?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Made better moves.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Wrong. You made me make worse 
                        moves. That’s the secret: you cut 
                        off your opponent’s options until 
                        he stops playing his game and 
                        starts playing yours. 
                             (off his “what?” look)
                        ...it’s not every day you find 
                        someone who can make good tactical 
                        decisions while under pressure.

           Leaving it at that, Gabriel stands, satisfied. 
                                 GABRIEL
                        Congratulations, your throat will 
                        remain blissfully unslit this week.

           And as he BLOWS OUT the almost-burnt-down-to-nothing CANDLE 
           on his bedside table, we hear:

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER (PRE-LAP)
                        What do you mean, “still there?”

           INT. WARDEN WEISBECKER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Weisbecker and One-Eared Jack, in her office, talking tensely 
           as she sucks down edamame and flicks the pods into a bowl.

                                 ONE-EARED JACK
                        I mean he’s alive. Breathing. It’s 
                        been over a week...

           She processes this new intel for a moment. Then--

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Get him in here.

           INT. BASEMENT CELL - NIGHT

           Something BUZZES, Coleman JERKS UP from his cot, as the trap-
           door WHOOSHES OPEN and TWO GUARDS come rushing down:

                                 GUARD
                        Position 1, NOW!

           Coleman, follows Gabriel’s lead -- sinks to his knees, puts 
           his hands behind his head. Gabriel, unperturbed:

                                 GABRIEL
                        So good to see you all again.
                             (to Coleman)
                        Try to keep your jaw shut so you 
                        don’t swallow your tongue when they-

           BZZZT! Gabriel gets SHOCKED TO THE FLOOR by a guard’s baton. 
           Coleman WHIRLS and BZZZT! He drops too as we SMASH TO: 

           INT. WARDEN WEISBECKER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Water trickles. Soothing music plays. Coleman blinks, sits 
           up... he’s on a couch inside Warden Weisbecker’s office, 
           where small fountains flow amidst clusters of bonzai trees.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        I’m making some tea.
           Weisbecker walks past. Strangely, he’s alone in here with 
           her. She turns her back on Coleman, scanning her kitchenette.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...you brought me up here to talk 
                        to a hologram?

           Behind Coleman, a voice says:

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Good eye.

           Coleman turns across the room to see the REAL Warden 
           Weisbecker -- seated at her desk, a pair of steaming Japanese 
           teacups before her. She switches off the webcam-like HOLOGRAM 
           PROJECTOR on her desk and FZZT! Holo-Weisbecker vanishes.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        So you’re the one who killed Gregor 
                        McCormick, huh? 

                                 COLEMAN
                        I remember hearing about that.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Shame. He built amazing machinery. 
                        I’m a fan on the MI-12 myself. 

           She toys with the crystal on her necklace and we realize it’s 
           a key-- with a McCormick Industries logo carved into it.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Whenever I get overwhelmed by 
                        running this glorified zoo, I like 
                        to take it out, blow off steam. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        We all got our stress relievers. 
                        Mine involves prison riots.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        I remember hearing about that.
                             (motions to a cup)
                        Tea?

           He takes the black ceramic cup off her desk, sniffs it... and 
           realizes something odd: the surface of the mug is coated with 
           a STICKY FLUID, webbing itself to his fingers. What the hell?

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        It’s ok. Just a little tree-sap. 

           Coleman suddenly goes RIGID in his chair, body JERKING like 
           he’s going into anaphylactic shock.
                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Of course, it’s from the Urushi 
                        tree from the Yamashiro Colony, and 
                        it effectively paralyzes you for 
                        about 2 hours, but you’ll be fine.

           Coleman’s stuck in his chair as if by a magnet. Weisbecker 
           rises, and we see she’s toting a SHOCK BATON.  

                                 COLEMAN
                        Hell’s going on?--

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Normally I’d have guards do this, 
                        but when there’s ten billion supra 
                        at stake, it seems discretion is 
                        the better part of valor.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...ten billion--

           BZZZT! She swipes the baton across his head, sends 50,000 
           volts careening into his skull. He STIFFENS like he’s been 
           hit with a hot poker... but doesn’t scream.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Funny story: thirty-one years ago, 
                        the US Treasury finally decides to 
                        switch over to globalized currency. 

           BZZZT! Going lower, she gives him a TAP on the lips -- 
           blowing sizzling spit from his mouth.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        That first printing that came out? 
                        About ten billion, give or take? 
                        Goes missing in transit, poof. Took 
                        a while, but they eventually caught 
                        the person who did it...

           BZZZT! Shocks him in the throat. Coleman doesn’t scream so 
           much as let out a guttural RATTLE, esophagus spasming.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                             (leans in)
                        It was a 21-year-old philosophy 
                        student from London named Gabriel 
                        Moldesantos.

           Coleman, gasping for breath, eyes watering, processes this 
           new information. Weisbecker continues her circle around him, 
           turning up the voltage dial on the baton.
                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Best part? He stashed the loot 
                        before he got caught, somewhere out 
                        in the Epsalen galaxy -- and even 
                        when he was looking at lifetime 
                        behind bars, on the worst prison 
                        planet in the known universe, he 
                        wouldn’t tell anybody where it was--

                                 COLEMAN
                             (gets it)
                        --and you think he’s gonna tell me.

           BZZZT! She shocks him in the chest. He TREMORS hideously. 

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        I think you’re going to get the 
                        information out of him. Because 
                        until you do, you’re going be back 
                        in here each week, and what I’m 
                        doing to you now is going to seem 
                        like... a nice amuse bouche before 
                        the main course. Any questions?

                                 COLEMAN
                        The hell is an amuse bouche?

           BZZZT! She shocks him in the gut. Coleman’s jaw CHATTERS. But 
           still, she cannot get a fucking scream out of this guy.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        You notice the general trajectory 
                        we’re heading in?...

           She motions the shock-baton toward his crotch. Sucking air, 
           face flushed, he asks her...

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...know what your problem is?
                        You’re all stick and no carrot.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Excuse me?

                                 COLEMAN
                        You actually believe you can do 
                        anything to me that hasn’t already 
                        been done in the past 10 years? 

           And a grin crosses his face. Mocking her, even in the face of 
           a sizzling shock-baton hovering over his personals. A long 
           beat, then... CLICK! She shuts off the baton, sets it aside.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Ok, let’s talk carrots. Let me 
                        guess: you cooperate, I let you out 
                        the back door, something like that?
                                 COLEMAN
                        Think I’m stupid? I want something 
                        you’re actually gonna give me. 
                             (off her “go on” look)
                        Transfer to facility of my choice. 
                        On Earth. Minimum security. 

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        ...somewhere it’d be easy for you 
                        to waltz out of.

           No response. A long beat as she ponders. Then--

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Deal.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Good. Hit me in the face with that. 
                             (off her look)
                        I gotta get into character, right?

           Weisbecker smiles and winds back with the baton as--

           INT. BASEMENT CELL - DAY

           WHAM! The door to Coleman’s cell flies open and he’s TOSSED 
           IN by a pair of guards. Hits the floor, looking beat to shit. 
           Gabriel looks up from his bunk as the door slams shut.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...hell was all that?...

                                 GABRIEL
                        Something you get used to.
                             (sees him flexing a hand)
                        Gave you the sap, did she?

           Coleman doesn’t respond, because... he’s just noticed 
           something odd. There’s A FRESH CANDLE burning on Gabriel’s 
           table. A little alarm bell goes off in Coleman’s brain. He 
           starts peering around the cell as Gabriel talks...

                                 GABRIEL
                        I have information they want, and 
                        they’ve been trying for years to 
                        get it out of me, by hook or by 
                        crook. Looks like they’re going to 
                        be using the same method with you. 

           Coleman looks under the cots, under the table, behind the 
           toilet, seeing nothing, when...

                                 GABRIEL
                        Might I ask what you’re--
                                 COLEMAN
                        Where’d the new candle come from?

                                 GABRIEL
                        I made it.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Within the last 12 hours?

           Gabriel gives no answer. TAP TAP. Coleman taps on the cell 
           walls with his fingertips. Moving along, up and down... TAP 
           TAP... until in a low corner, he hears an echo. A beat, then--

           He snatches the lit candle, runs it along the wall, and 
           suddenly WAX STARTS TO DRIP FROM A BARELY-VISIBLE SEAM AS--

           --we reveal it: there’s a false front built into the wall, 
           held in place with wax, leading to a HIDDEN COMPARTMENT 
           behind, the width and length of a coffin. Coleman looks at 
           Gabriel... who just smiles. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        You wanted to see if I’d find this. 
                             (off his nod)
                        Why?

           Still no answer. Coleman shines light into the compartment: a 
           cluster of candles, Gabriel’s machete, a fat pile of prison-
           clothes, writing utensils, a leather-bound JOURNAL. Coleman 
           rips open the journal, scans the pages: crudely-sketched 
           DIAGRAMS OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE PRISON. Arrows. X’s.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...is this what I think it is?

                                 GABRIEL
                             (a smile)
                        It’s exactly what you think it is. 

           Coleman’s eyes light up like a pinball machine as we hear:

                                 WEISBECKER (PRE-LAP)
                        So: he’s planning a break-out...

           INT. WARDEN WEISBECKER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Coleman, back in the warden’s office for another “session.”

                                 WEISBECKER
                        Consider my interest piqued. Sit 
                        down, please, care for some tea?

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’ll pass.
                                 WEISBECKER
                        Quick study.
                             (smiles, sits)
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 COLEMAN
                        ‘Cause you’re gonna let it happen.
                             (off her look)
                        Think about it: you spent years 
                        trying to get him to give up the 
                        coordinates to his loot, you’ve 
                        thrown everything you got at him, 
                        and he’s given you zip.

                                 WEISBECKER
                        Your point?

                                 COLEMAN
                        He’s never gonna spill his guts. 
                        It’s the only thing he’s got left. 
                        But if you let him break out...

                                 WEISBECKER
                             (catches his drift)
                        ...first thing he’s going to do is 
                        try to steal a shuttle. He punches 
                        in the coordinates, we swoop in--

                                 WEISBECKER
                        --and I get a first-class ride back 
                        to Earth.

           Weisbecker sits back, weighing his words. Then--

                                 WEISBECKER
                        Sounds like if you want to get out 
                        of here, you two better start 
                        making some plans.  

           Coleman gives a nod, ready to get his hands dirty, and as  
           RISING DRUMS start to clatter, we CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT CELL - DAY

           RIP! A page gets torn from a journal. Coleman and Gabriel 
           crouch on their cell floor, piecing something together, as 
           the drumming continues over the sequence: 

                                 GABRIEL 
                        The first thing I can tell you is 
                        that it’s impossible for a man to 
                        break out of I.F.-35. 
                             (puts pieces in place)
                        But with two men, it’s merely 
                        almost impossible.
           As we rise, we see they’re piecing together a hand-drawn 
           BLUEPRINT OF THE PRISON. The first stage of fevered planning.

           CUT TO: GABRIEL’S COT

           WHAM! The metal-framed bed gets flipped sideways and shoved 
           against the wall, as we widen to reveal Gabriel is turning 
           their cell into a DIY fight-ring. 

                                 GABRIEL 
                        You have any formal training in 
                        hand-to-hand?
                             (Coleman shakes his head)
                        The guards here do.

                                 COLEMAN
                        They also got guns. Last I checked, 
                        those are slightly more effective.

                                 GABRIEL
                        A guard pulls a gun, he’s shooting 
                        to kill. Which means your job is to 
                        incapacitate him before then.

           Gabriel tosses him a shirt -- wrap up.

           SMASH TO: THE MATCH 

           WHAM! WHAM! Coleman and Gabriel roustabout in the cell, their 
           blows creating counterpoints to the fevered drumming. 
           Coleman’s style is pure street scrapping, no match for 
           Gabriel’s icy control, a newfangled mix of Krav-Maga & Judo.

                                 GABRIEL
                             (blocking punches)
                        See the problem here?

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’m fighting some old bastard who’s 
                        spent thirty years dreaming up ways 
                        to hurt people?

           Gabriel UPPERCUTS him, Coleman doubles over, gasping--

                                 GABRIEL
                        Thirty-three years. And no-- 

           WHAM! Coleman LUNGES at him and Gabriel calmly JUDO-THROWS 
           him down, planting a foot on his heaving chest--

                                 GABRIEL
                        Man cannot live on rage alone. 
                        Focused rage... now that’s useful.
                             (takes his foot off)
                        On your feet.

           SMASH TO: COLEMAN ON HIS COT 
           After-hours, working by candlelight as Gabriel sleeps, 
           scratching notes onto paper. Names: MAX, PHENG, PERKINS.  
           Then a mess of, stats, diagrams, etc. Feverishly scribbling, 
           like the devil creating a guest-list for his party.

           SMASH TO: COLEMAN AND GABRIEL BACK IN THE RING

           WHOOSH-WHAM-WHOOSH go their sparring fists. Coleman’s wearing 
           his training, bruises and cuts all over. But he’s gaining 
           muscle, speed, agility, and most importantly, he’s getting 
           it: saving energy, planning his strikes, landing blows as--

                                 GABRIEL
                        That’s it, boyo, better--

           WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Coleman lands three more blows, comes in 
           for a spin-kick, when Gabriel grabs his foot and WHIRLS HIM 
           to the floor. Gasping for breath, Coleman gets up--

           --to see the older man is nowhere to be seen. At least until: 

                                 GABRIEL (O.S.)
                        Up. 

           Coleman looks up to see Gabriel perched ten feet up, propping 
           his feet against the far wall’s corner.

                                 COLEMAN
                        How did you--

                                 GABRIEL
                        The same way you will.

           And as Gabriel casually drops we CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT CELL - NIGHT

           The calm before the storm. Coleman and Gabriel in their cell, 
           pulling Gabriel’s laundry-stash out of its hiding place, 
           rolling the garments up into bundles. As they work...

                                 COLEMAN
                        Never told me why you’re in here.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Yes, well. Neither did you.

                                 COLEMAN
                        The first thing I learned growing 
                        up was that people are vicious, and 
                        the world doesn’t give a shit about 
                        you... and I made the mistake of 
                        forgetting that. 

           Gabriel smiles. Like he knows wherefrom Coleman speaks.
                                 GABRIEL
                        A long time ago, I was planning a 
                        particularly lucrative robbery. I 
                        did it for the same reason men used 
                        to climb mountains. I planned it 
                        perfectly, executed it perfectly, 
                        made the perfect getaway, but my 
                        one imperfection was my choice of 
                        partner. He got caught, served me 
                        up to the police, and that’s how I 
                        came to enjoy this 5-star 
                        subterranean tomb with you. 

           Coleman takes this in for a moment. Realizing, regretfully, 
           that he’s got more in common with this man than he thought. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        So that’s what you’re gonna do when 
                        we get out? Track him down, get 
                        your revenge?

                                 GABRIEL
                        No, no. I already killed him. Five 
                        minutes after I realized what he 
                        did. 
                             (a pause)
                        ...and if there’s anything I deeply 
                        regret in my life, it’s that.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Killing him?

                                 GABRIEL
                        No. Not making him suffer. If I 
                        could do it again, I’d do it right: 
                        I’d make him watch as I ripped away 
                        every single thing he held dear, 
                        and only then would I let him die.
                             (smiles)
                        Absolution doesn’t come in the form 
                        of a bullet, boyo, but from knowing 
                        you took from them exactly what 
                        they took from you, and then some.

           Gabriel finishes bundling up the last of the clothes...

                                 GABRIEL
                        In the future, should you ever 
                        cross paths with your friend Max... 
                        let me know how it goes for you.

           Coleman looks up, stunned -- how did you know?

                                 GABRIEL
                        You talk in your sleep.

           A half-smile from Gabriel. Coleman just shakes his head. 
                                 GABRIEL
                        Rest well, boyo. After tomorrow, 
                        we’ve got business to attend to 
                        beyond these walls.

           Gabriel makes for his cot. We hold on Coleman, weighing those 
           words, face in turmoil, as we CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT LEVEL - NIGHT

           BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! It’s the next night and boots are pounding 
           the floor -- a pair of GUARDS, BLONDIE and BOWLCUT, heading 
           down the subterranean hall towards the basement cell.

                                 BLONDIE
                        Position 1, both of you, now!

           The guards enter, guns up. In the gloomy-dark cell, Gabriel’s 
           on his knees, face to the wall, hands behind his head.

                                 BLONDIE
                        Hell’s the matter with your friend?

                                 GABRIEL
                        Beauty-rest, I assume.

           We see it: Coleman, curiously enough, hasn’t moved from his 
           bed, back to them, sheet draped over his torso.

                                 BOWLCUT
                        You! Position 1, now, or you’re 
                        going outta here feet first!

           Coleman doesn’t move. Bowlcut, weapon ready to spit, 
           approaches him... and sees something odd: this isn’t Coleman 
           at all -- just his jumpsuit stuffed with rolled-up LAUNDRY.

                                 BOWLCUT
                        What the--

           WHOOSH! Coleman DROPS from his perch high in the corner of 
           the room -- just like we saw Gabriel do -- plummeting down to 
           elbow-drop Bowlcut in the spine with a CRACK as--

           Blondie WHIRLS with his gun, just as Gabriel SNATCHES his 
           makeshift machete from its hiding place in the bedframe, 
           THROWS IT, slashing the gun out of the guard’s grip and 
           sending it flying, blade SLICING Coleman’s arm as he dodges-- 

           WHIR-BAM! Gabriel spin-kicks Blondie’s legs out, bounces his 
           head off the floor, knocks him cold. On his feet in a flash--

                                 GABRIEL
                        Bravo, boyo. Dress that--
           Gabriel hauls off his PRISON SHIRT, tosses it to Coleman, who 
           turns it into a tourniquet for his bleeding arm as we CUT TO:

           EXT. BASEMENT LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER

           WHAM! The trap door opens and TWO GUARDS -- actually Coleman 
           and Gabriel, wearing stolen uniforms and weapons -- emerge 
           from it. They round the corner, twin-scanning their key- 
           passes, heading through a barred gate toward... 

           THE ELEVATOR CHECKPOINT STATION

           ...where a JOWLY GUARD looks up as the “guards” head towards 
           him, helmet visors pulled low. 

                                 JOWLY GUARD
                        Any goodies back there? Guy in 14 
                        had some freaky Korean porno 
                        comics. Disgusting! Y’gotta see ‘em-

           ZZZTT! Coleman nails him in his fat neck with the shock 
           baton, spilling Jowly and his comics to the floor as--

           UPPER LEVEL OF PRISON

           CLANG! The elevator doors open as Gabriel and Coleman HAUL a 
           shaking-and-convulsing Jowly out into the main hall--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Man down, man down! Need help here! 

           GUARDS run toward them, rolling a stretcher from the med-
           closet, Coleman and Gabriel loading Jowly onto it (giving us 
           a glimpse of the SHOCK BATON Coleman’s stuffed up the guy’s 
           pant-leg, which he furtively triggers every few seconds.)

                                 GUARD
                        Jesus, what happened--

                                 COLEMAN
                             (subtly shocks him again)
                        Seizure, what’s it look like? We 
                        got this, take point downstairs--

           Coleman and Gabriel RUSH Jowly on, glancing back as the 
           guards make for the elevator, setting the clock ticking, as--

           INSIDE THE MED-BAY

           WHAM! The med-bay doors ERUPT OPEN and Jowly gets pushed 
           through by Gabriel and Coleman, PRISON DOCS rushing over--

                                 PRISON DOC
                        Talk to me, what’d they do to--
           No answer. And it’s then the doc looks over to see one of the 
           guards is wrapping SURGICAL TUBING around his hands. And as 
           the EMERGENCY KLAXONS START WAILING, the doc realizes...

                                 PRISON DOC (INTO EARPIECE)
                        They’re here, they’re in the medica-

           CRACK! Gabriel swings a heavy robo-prosthetic forearm at the 
           doc’s head, puts him down, just as--

                                 GUARDS (O.S.)
                        OVER HERE! 

           GUARDS rushes toward med-bay entrance, OPENING FIRE. Coleman 
           slams the QUARANTINE SEAL button, doors SLAMMING INTO PLACE 
           before the guards can get there. Gabriel tosses him surgical 
           tubing, starts to wrap a wet towel around his face as--

           OUTSIDE THE MED-BAY

           --the guards punch in codes, trying to get the door open, 
           repeatedly getting rejected, until finally a BURLY BASTARD 
           approaches with a STRAP OF SLEEK FEATURELESS HAND GRENADES.

                                 BURLY
                        Step back--

           --he primes the grenades along the entry portal and...

           INSIDE THE MED-BAY

           BLAM! The grenades go off, sending the flaming, warped door 
           askew on its track. Guards pour into the smashed-up room to 
           search for our heroes, finding no one, as we PAN OVER to...

           ...the MEDICAL WASTE CHUTE.

           INSIDE THE MED-WASTE CHUTE

           Coleman and Gabriel shimmy up the confined metal shaft, using 
           the surgical tubes around their hands for traction, breathing 
           through wet towels wrapped around their mouths. Below, the 
           INCINERATOR glows a hellish orange, sparks streaking up--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Christ--

           The walls are so hot, they’re melting the tubing around their 
           hands and shoes, leaving tendrils of molten rubber behind.

                                 GABRIEL
                        C’mon, boyo. 

           Steeling himself, Coleman pushes himself onward, following 
           Gabriel, making for the VENTILATION GRATE above. Only a few 
           more feet to go, but the rubber of Gabriel’s shoe MELTS and 
           DRIPS onto Coleman’s face, he hisses in pain as--
           Gabriel makes a final UPWARD LUNGE and pushes open--

           THE TOP GRATE

           --climbing out, Coleman snaking up after him, and as he 
           plants a foot-hold on the wall--

           --his shoe SLIPS, he fumbles and--

           WHAM! Gabriel grabs him before he can fall into the 
           incinerator. Gets pulled up to the floor, gasping, as we see--

           THEY’RE IN THE LOADING BAY

           --the hangar where DOCKED SHUTTLES tower in rows. They break 
           a cinderblock-looking monster of a SUPPLY TANKER, ramp-stairs 
           leading to its entry. The two men rush up into the ship and--

           INTO THE VESSEL’S CONTROL CENTER

           --where Gabriel throws himself into a captain’s seat, Coleman 
           taking the one next to him. A look between them, a trace of 
           something -- guilt? -- crossing Coleman’s face.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Didn’t have to pull me up.

           Gabriel looks at him like it’s the most obvious thing.

                                 GABRIEL
                        What did I tell you? We both have 
                        business to attend to...

           Coleman watches, heart-rate rising, as Gabriel punches 
           COORDINATES into the navigation system, takes hold of the 
           controls... and something strange happens. 

           The ship’s power dies. Screens flash the words: ENGINE LOCK. 

           OUTSIDE THE SHIP

           Warden Weisbecker, Blondie, Buzzcut, and One-Eared Jack storm 
           up the steps and into the ship’s entrance, guns out--

                                 GUARDS
                        HANDS UP!/BOTH A’ YOU, NOW!

           --and they find Coleman sitting, stone-faced, avoiding 
           looking at Gabriel. As Warden Weisbecker approaches...

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Thank you, Coleman, let it never be 
                        said you’re not useful.
                             (to Gabriel)
                        On your feet, Moldesantos.

           Gabriel doesn’t move. Refusing to look at her.
                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Don’t get sour, you held out for as 
                        long as you could. Sorry your cell-
                        mate wasn’t so disciplined.
                             (checks the screen)
                        ...fine, we’ve got the coordinates, 
                        will somebody shoot him please?

           BAM! Blondie shoots Gabriel in the head. The bullet SPLINTERS 
           the front screen... and Gabriel does nothing except flicker. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Never know what someone’s gonna 
                        walk out of your office with, huh?

           Weisbecker looks to see Coleman, who’s holding her HOLOGRAM 
           PROJECTOR. The image of Gabriel is a digital forgery. 

           BAM! BAM! Behind her, guards DROP, cut down by fire from 
           GABRIEL -- the real one. Coming down the corridor, loaded 
           with riot-weapons, strap of grenades on his chest, guns hot-- 

           WHOOSH! Weisbecker -- realizing she’s been thoroughly had -- 
           ducks, spins, kicks Coleman’s legs out, then SNATCHES THE 
           MACHINE-PISTOL from his hand--

           --just as Gabriel gets a bead on her and she UNLOADS at him, 
           sending him diving out through the ship’s entry portal, 
           Weisbecker lunging after him like a demon, bullets SPARKING 
           off the metal loading stairs as he rolls down them and--

           WHUMPH! Coleman TACKLES her into the wall, her gun bouncing 
           away, but she unsheathes a SHOCK BATON and it’s all-out close-
           quarters combat. This woman knows what she’s doing -- but so 
           does Coleman. At least until--

           BAM! A baton-blow sends Coleman flying back through the--

           ENTRYWAY OF THE SHIP

           --sending him BOUNCING off the stairs and hitting the loading-
           bay floor with a OOOF. Into her earpiece she says:

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER 
                        Loading bay, now. Shoot on sight.
                             (to Coleman and Gabriel)
                        Forget who you were dealing with?

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...did you?...

           Coleman holds up her NECKLACE KEY -- the one to her ship. 
           Ripped from her neck in the fight. Weisbecker gives an ashen 
           smile as across the room, DOORS WHIR OPEN, GUARDS INCOMING-- 

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Uh oh. Here come the adults.
           BRAAAAAAAP! Guards on the catwalk spray a BLIZZARD OF BULLETS 
           as Coleman DIVES behind stacked metal crates, Gabriel behind 
           him when WHAP! A shot NAILS GABRIEL in the back, drops him.

                                 COLEMAN
                        --no--

           Coleman lunges out and OPENS FIRE on the guards as he runs 
           for Gabriel, dragging him back with one hand--

           BEHIND THE CRATES

           --shots WHIZZING overhead as they slide into place. Coleman 
           sees the puddle of DARK FLUID spreading out from under his 
           friend. He pulls off his jacket to tie off Gabriel’s wound--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Hang in there--

                                 GABRIEL
                        Boyo--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Hold still, we’ll get you tied off--

           Gabriel shoves a hand out, keeps him at bay. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        What happened to “we both have 
                        business to attend to?”

                                 GABRIEL
                        We do... Mine’s just not in the 
                        same place as yours.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Bullshit--

                                 GABRIEL
                        Coleman, when an old man’s about to 
                        use his dying breath to give you 
                        the location of a vast fortune... 
                        don’t interrupt.

           Gabriel LAYS DOWN MORE SUPPRESSION FIRE, then grabs Coleman 
           and starts whispering COORDINATES INTO HIS EAR as--

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           --a guard runs for the control panel, punches in a code and 
           WHIR-BOOM! Around the loading bay, HEAVY STEEL DOCK-DOORS 
           START TO COME DOWN, shutting off all exits one by one, as--

           BEHIND THE CRATES
           --Coleman and Gabriel look out to see the exits sealing off. 
           Coleman zeroes in on WEISBECKER’S SHIP in its private hangar, 
           just beyond the shutting doors. Ten seconds. Turns to Gabriel-

                                 GABRIEL
                        It’s been an honor. 
                             (grips his hand)
                        Now do me a favor and go kill that 
                        son of a bitch.

           Summoning his final strength, Gabriel shoves him away and 
           lunges out, spewing sizzling lead at the onrushing guards. 
           Coleman, now or never, turns and RUNS, eyes glued to...

           THE LOWERING BAY DOOR, CLOSING FAST.

                                 COLEMAN
                        No-no-no-no--

           Coleman breaks into a SPRINT. Breaknecks past stacks of FUEL 
           BARRELS that go up like FIREWORKS as gunfire rakes them--

           Eyes glued to THE DOOR.

           DOWN IT COMES.

           HE DIVES INTO A HEAD-FIRST SLIDE.

           SPACE TIGHTENING AROUND HIM AS HE SKIDS THROUGH.

           CRUNCH.

           The door CLOSES ON HIS LEGS, pulverizing them. Trapped and 
           spasming like a hooked fish, he fights not to go into shock--

           White hot agony distorts his vision... but with a teeth-
           gritting ROAR, Coleman HAULS HIMSELF OUT, drags his destroyed 
           legs from under the crushing door as it BOOMS into place. 
           Free. Inside the shipping bay, Gabriel looks on...

                                 GABRIEL
                        Arrivederci, boyo--

           BLAM BLAM BLAM! Gabriel’s taken down by a hail of gunfire as--

           OUTSIDE

           Coleman pulls himself towards Weisbecker’s ship. Pure 
           determination. Suddenly, BOOM! He ROLLS ASIDE just as FUEL 
           BARRELS burst through the roof and kamikazie to the ground. 

           Coleman, going wan from blood loss, looks to the red hot 
           surface of the burning fuel barrel behind him... and gets an 
           idea. But it’s something he really doesn’t want to do.

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...ohgod...
           No choice. Suck it up or die. He steels himself, PUSHES HIS 
           WOUNDED LEGS AGAINST THE BARREL and cauterizes his wounds as--

           IN THE MAIN HANGAR

           Motioning for the guards to hold fire, Weisbecker strides 
           toward a fast-fading Gabriel, gun held casually, smiling.

           IN WEISBECKER’S SHIP

           A TREMBLING HAND grabs hold of the armrest as Coleman pulls 
           him into the control seat. Jams the stolen key in. Shaking 
           fingers punch in the coordinates Gabriel gave him, as--

           IN THE MAIN HANGAR

           --Weisbecker plants a foot on Gabriel. Triumphant.

                                 WARDEN WEISBECKER
                        Any final statements on your part?

           She kicks him over... to see he’s got a strap of GRENADES. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        The die is cast.

           KAA-BOOM! The grenades GO OFF, toss bodies, set fuel ablaze-- 

           OUTSIDE

           --Weisbecker’s ship LIFTS OFF at the same moment the hangar 
           VOLCANOES. Chunks of flaming rubble BUFFET THE SPACECRAFT. 
           Turbulence knocks Coleman onto the floor, head hitting hard 
           as THE SHIP BLASTS OFF and goes into ZERO GRAVITY...

           ...and for a moment, Coleman’s drifting free, arms out, in a 
           floating hailstorm of TINY ORBS OF BLOOD AND SWEAT, a gasp of 
           either agony or euphoria, and we... SNAP TO BLACK.

           EXT. SPACE 

           Vast, twinkling emptiness. Drifting slowly into the distance, 
           a shiny speck: the MI-12 ship. Alone in the endless void...

           ...until we pull back to see we’re watching it through the 
           viewscreen of ANOTHER SHIP. A voice, New Zealand accent:

                                 MAN 1
                        Lousy place to run outta fuel, eh?

           Man 2 doesn’t respond for a beat. Then--

                                 MAN 2
                        Bring her in.
           INT. M1-12 

           Inside the M1-12, we move through the vacant control center, 
           all’s quiet... until BAM! The entry portal gets blown off its 
           hinges, drops to the floor, smoke rises from the drill-holes. 

           Across the cabin, laying like a pile of human rubble, 
           Coleman’s eyes blink open. Through his hazy POV, he can 
           barely see FOUR FIGURES coming into the cabin...

                                 MAN 1
                        Christ, mate...

           As they loom in, staring at the destroyed human beneath...

                                 MAN 2
                        Whaddya’ call a guy floating alone 
                        in space with his legs smashed off?
                             (over their laughter)
                        Screwed.

           They BUST UP LAUGHING as Coleman drifts back into darkness. 

           INT. SCAVENGER SHIP, BREAKDOWN BAY 

           WHAM! Coleman JERKS UP on a table in what looks like a 
           mechanic’s garage. SHIP PARTS stacked in messy piles. Hot in 
           here; he’s got a sweat-soaked sheet over him, brow dripping.  
           Sensing something’s wrong, he YANKS the sheet aside...

                                 COLEMAN
                             (deadpan)
                        ...well, shit.

           We don’t see what the problem is, just him piecing it 
           together. Then, down the corridor, he hears MUFFLED ARGUMENT.

           Coleman eyes a WHEELCHAIR by the bed and as he pulls it over 
           to him and climbs in, we see it: his legs are GONE, above-
           knee amputated, stumps swathed in bandages. And we CUT TO: 

           THE SHIP’S KITCHEN

           A STEAK gets flipped on a pan as we reveal KIP: 21, punkish, 
           New Zealand accent, with a cheerfulness at odds with his job 
           title (“galley-slave.”) Carries plates out of the kitchen--

                                 KIP
                        Hold onto your tastebuds, mates!

           AND INTO THE DINING AREA

           ...where fans circulate swampy air, a vent DRIPS in the 
           corner, and a seated crew of FORAGERS (aka “space pirates”) 
           ignore their servant. 
           The captain, SYKES, a scowling hulk in welder’s goggles, is 
           engaged in a charged conversation with his crew -- SCUZZY, 
           SHORTY, and SPINDLY. Sykes drinking beer, the crew’s sucking 
           down sake, as Kip hands out plates...

                                 SYKES 
                        ...ain’t even up for discussion, 
                        there’s no way he’s staying on 
                        board, it’s too goddamn dangerous--

                                 SPINDLY
                        You didn’t want him kept alive,  
                        that would’ve been helpful to know, 
                        I dunno, before I went to the 
                        trouble of amputating his legs?-- 

                                 SYKES
                        I can’t be everywhere on this 
                        shitcan at once--

                                 SHORTY
                        Look, way I see it? We either dump 
                        him and get nothing, or take him 
                        back to the prison and get paid.

                                 SYKES
                        Or get killed, ever think about 
                        that? Think I.F. 35 wants it to be 
                        common knowledge that someone was 
                        able to escape from there? We’re 
                        gonna dump this prick out the 
                        airlock and be done with it--

                                 KIP
                        Hold on a second.

           The crew shoots mad-dog glares at Kip -- why is the kitchen-
           bitch talking? 

                                 KIP
                        Bloke managed to steal a guard’s 
                        uniform, break out of prison, in 
                        the warden’s ship -- which is 
                        awesome -- got half his body 
                        crushed to hell, survived that, and 
                        now we’re gonna just dump him out? 
                        Seems a bit... unfair.

           CRASH! Sykes throws his BEER BOTTLE at Kip, it SHATTERS off 
           the wall. The crew laughs as Sykes HUCKS MORE BOTTLES at him-

                                 SYKES
                        Hear that, gentlemen? 
                             (CRASH!)
                        Our trusty galley-slave has an 
                        opinion he’d like to express! 
                             (CRASH!)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SYKES (CONT'D)
                        And if there’s one thing we love, 
                        it’s Kip expressing his opinion!
                             (CRASH!)
                        Please, Kip, go on--

           Sykes makes to throw the MAGNUM SAKE BOTTLE when--

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Throw one more, I’m gonna walk over 
                        there and kick the shit out of you.

           All eyes look over to see Coleman: in the entrance, slouched 
           legless in the wheelchair. Surprisingly cool for a guy in his 
           condition. Sykes and the crew fight can’t help but crack up.

                                 SYKES
                        Look who it is: Captain Stubs.

                                 COLEMAN
                        So what’s this I hear about you 
                        dumping me out the airlock?

                                 SYKES
                             (shrugs)
                        Sorry, pal, you’re a liability. 
                        Can’t have that on board my ship.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Your ship.

                                 SYKES
                        That’s right.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Tell me something: why is it so 
                        goddamn hot in here?

           That brings things down a notch. Coleman frost-eyes Sykes; a 
           brash, nihilistic confidence starting to manifest itself.

                                 SYKES
                        I dunno what you think you’re--

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’m giving you two reasons you 
                        better keep me on board, and since 
                        your lives and livelihoods depend 
                        on them, I’d shut up and listen.
                             (lifts a finger)
                        One: your ship’s about six days out 
                        from a catastrophic malfunction.

           That gets their attention. Coleman points across the cabin--

                                 COLEMAN
                        That stuff dripping out of the 
                        vent? Smells kinda like copper? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLEMAN (CONT'D)
                        It’s propylene glycol, it’s what 
                        your combustion chamber uses to 
                        keep cool. 

                                 SHORTY
                        How do you know--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Let’s just say I’ve had some 
                        experience with engines.
                             (to the crew)
                        You’ve got a leak, which means your 
                        system’s overheating, which means, 
                        at this rate, within the next few 
                        days, it’s gonna melt down like a 
                        nuclear reactor and kill everyone 
                        on board. Unless someone fixes it. 
                        Luckily for you -- unlike your 
                        captain -- I know how.

                                 SYKES
                        Think I don’t know how to fix my 
                        own goddamn--

                                 COLEMAN
                        If you did, you’d have done it 
                        already.
                             (to the crew)
                        In my professional opinion, for all 
                        the good this guy’s doing you, 
                        you’d be better off throwing him 
                        out the airlock. 

           Sykes, who’s had enough, quick-draws a HAND CANNON, aims it 
           at him. Coleman -- bored -- to the crew:

                                 COLEMAN
                        Ready to hear reason number two?  
                        Gabriel Moldesantos, anyone 
                        recognize that name?

                                 SYKES
                        Hey, Earth-to-asshole-with-the-gun-
                        pointed-at-him--

                                 COLEMAN
                        Robbed the US Treasury, got sent to 
                        I.F. 35? They never found the loot 
                        ‘cause he stashed it somewhere out 
                        in the ass-end of the universe?

           A look between Spindly, Scuzzy and Shorty, cautious--

                                 SCUZZY
                        Just ‘cause you were on I.F. 35 
                        doesn’t mean you know him--
           WHAM! Coleman slams it onto the table -- A PRISON SHIRT, the 
           one Gabriel gave him for a tourniquet, Gabriel’s name and 
           serial number on the back. A muted “whoah” from the crew.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Moldesantos is dead. But before he 
                        died, he told me where the money 
                        was. And if any of you want even a 
                        taste, I suggest you shoot this 
                        idiot before he shoots me.

           CLICK-CLICK! Sykes cocks the gun, voice low, dangerous--

                                 SYKES
                        Ease up, stubby. This crew’s been 
                        with me a long time and they’re the 
                        most loyal sonsabitches I’ve ever--

           CLICK-CLICK! The crews has their guns out and aimed at Sykes. 
           Sykes LUNGES UP, losing his shit, waving his piece around--

                                 SYKES
                        Y’all got TWO SECONDS TO GET ON THE 
                        RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY--

           CRASH! Kip HURLS the sake bottle, SHATTERING IT over Sykes’ 
           dome, drops him. A shocked beat, then all eyes to go Kip...

                                 KIP
                        That is me expressing my opinion!

           And off Coleman’s satisfied smile, we SMASH TO:

           INT. SCAVENGER SHIP, STORAGE ROOM 

           WHAM! Sykes, SNARLING, hands bound, gets TOSSED into a 
           storage room, the crew locking the door behind him, cutting 
           off his howls of rage. As they turn to Coleman...

                                 COLEMAN
                        Welcome aboard, gentlemen. 
                             (hands a LIST to Kip)
                        Kip, love your style with that sake 
                        bottle, you just made first mate. 
                        Order of business number-one, get 
                        me everything on this list.

           Kip, liking the sound of that, eyes the list. Then--

                                 KIP
                        What the hell you making?

           A SERIES OF SMASH-CUTS:

           CRATE IN THE STORAGE AREA MARKED “ROBOTICS” -- RIPPED OPEN.
           SLAMMED ONTO A TABLE: METAL RODS. HYDRAULIC GEARS. BLOWTORCH. 

           COLEMAN: GOGGLES ON, WORKING IN SPRAY OF TORCH-SPARKS. 

           INT. SCAVENGER SHIP 

           Coleman, sitting up on the “surgery table” where his 
           amputation took place. Kip and the crew stand by, post 
           operation, watching in awe as Coleman gets up and...

           ...we see he’s engineered himself a pair of ROBO-PROSTHETIC 
           LEGS. He takes a step forward -- CLANK. 

                                 SPINDLY
                        See? Like nothing ever happened.

           INT. SCAVENGER SHIP, ENGINE ROOM  

           Coleman, atop a boom lift in the engine room, wrenches and 
           solders away on the gasket of a massive COOLANT TANK. Kip 
           tosses him a beer as he repairs the leak, as we hear...

           INT. SCAVENGER SHIP, CORRIDOR

           CLUNK-CLUNK! Coleman’s “feet” go lumbering down a corridor, 
           Kip leading him on a physical therapy run. Coleman keeps 
           trying to push himself too hard, tripping, stumbling--

                                 KIP
                        Easy, easy--

           Coleman, disregarding him, lunges onward and BIFFS IT-- 

                                 KIP
                             (offers hand up)
                        Slow down, mate, what’s the rush?

                                 COLEMAN
                             (stands, runs on)
                        Got some business back home that I 
                        gotta get in shape for.

                                 KIP
                        Like a... track-meet?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Like “finding the people who put me 
                        in prison and destroying them.”

           Coleman VAULTS UP a ten-foot stairway in one jump. Kip looks 
           after him -- what? -- and we CUT TO:
           INT. SCAVENGER SHIP, LIVING QUARTERS - LATER

           Coleman furiously does SIT-UPS as Kip pins his “feet”, taking 
           in everything he’s just been told...

                                 KIP
                        ...so, the takeaway from this is: 
                        Max = needs-to-be-made-dead. Yes?

                                 COLEMAN
                             (flops down, gasping)
                        Pretty much.

                                 KIP
                        Cool. Where we going first?

           Coleman looks at him -- we? 

                                 KIP
                        Two weeks ago, I was scrubbing 
                        toilets and hand-washing jumpsuits 
                        belonging to guys with names like 
                        Scuzzy Pete, and if you hadn’t 
                        shown up, that would still be my 
                        lot. So... I’d say I owe you one.

           Before Coleman can respond, there’s a CLANG of an opening 
           door behind them. They look over to see Scuzzy leaning in...

                                 SCUZZY
                        Hate to interrupt but uh...

           CUT TO OUTSIDE THE SHIP

           ...we see their vessel is floating toward a DERELICT SPACE 
           STATION, like a steel giant hibernating through an endless 
           winter. The only sign of human life for eons.

                                 SCUZZY (V.O.)
                        ...think we’ve officially reached 
                        the ass-end of the universe.

           INT. SPACE STATION, CARGO HOLD 

           CREAK! A wheel-lock on A MASSIVE STEEL CONTAINER spins. Widen 
           to Coleman, Kip and the crew, in the cavernous hold of the 
           space station. And as the container door swings open...

           ...we DON’T see the money; we do see their REACTION to it. 
           Dumbstruck awe. Even from Coleman.

                                 KIP
                        Goddamn, captain...

                                 COLEMAN
                        ...I’m not your captain, Kip.
                                 KIP
                        Then what should I call you?

           Coleman thinks, before eyes catch the brand-name of the 
           container, printed on the door: CRISTO, INC. And as he and 
           Kip stand before this (still unseen) mountain of money...

                                 COLEMAN
                             (to Shorty/Scuzzy/Spindly)
                        Gentlemen, before you three go on 
                        your way as billionaires, I’d just 
                        like to say, to all of us...
                             (an evil smile)
                        Merry Fucking Christmas.

           We hear MUSIC playing from somewhere...

                                 FRANK SINATRA (PRE-LAP)
                        He’s making a list, checking it 
                        twice...

           INT. TIKI BAR - NIGHT

           A very old song plays on a retro jukebox:

                                 FRANK SINATRA (FROM JUKEBOX)
                        Gonna find out who’s naughty or 
                        nice. Santa Claus is comin’ to town

           Pull away into a shithole TIKI BAR, dressed up with chintzy 
           Christmas decorations. A skinny Cuban BARTENDER calls:

                                 BARTENDER
                        Lil’ more seasonal cheer, Perkins?

           A Mai Tai slides across the counter, joining a cluster of 
           empties in front of retired DETECTIVE JAMES PERKINS: now in 
           his 50’s, and looking better than the last time we saw him. 
           He’s overtanned and rotund, sure, but he’s had some work done 
           on his face, finally getting his busted nose straightened.

                                 PERKINS
                             (lifts glass)
                        Ho ho ho.

           EXT. FLORIDA KEYS, HARBOR - NIGHT

           Outside, moonlight shines over the Florida Keys. Slur-
           singing, Perkins heads past ROWS OF FUTURISTIC BOATS looking 
           like massive white dragonflies with solar-panel wings. Fails 
           to notice he’s being watched by a guy in Bermuda shorts...

                                 KIP (INTO EARPIECE)
                        He’s coming in.
           Perkins shambles his way up the ramp and onto his 50-foot 
           vessel -- the HMS RETIREMENT. Makes his way down into the...

           CABIN BELOW

           ...where he fumbles for a light, starts to get undressed... 
           and then hears it: a boat engine starting. His boat engine. 
           He lumbers up the stairs to the deck, where sure enough, at 
           the helm, a punkish-looking Kiwi fella mans the controls.

                                 PERKINS
                        Hey, asshole! Hell ya think you’re--

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Remember me, detective?

           Perkins WHIRLS -- there’s a figure behind him. We don’t see 
           his face; Perkins does... and he’s transfixed for a beat.

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                             (closes in)
                        You’ve had work done on your nose. 

                                 PERKINS
                        The hell are you--

           BAM! Perkins takes a blow to the face, his expensive new nose 
           CRUMPLES, he falls to his knees moaning.

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Remember me now?

           WHAM! Perkins gets KICKED -- as if by a fucking elephant -- 
           20 feet across the deck and into the boom as we CUT TO:

           EXT. PERKINS’ YACHT - LATER

           Perkin’s eyes open. The night sky seems to be CHURNING. We 
           FLIP UPSIDE DOWN to see the sky is actually ocean. Perkins is 
           strung up by his feet from the mast, tissue stuffed in his 
           broken honker, boat idling somewhere out in desolate waters.

                                 PERKINS
                        Oh God-- HELP! HELP ME!

           BAM! The boat’s stern light turns on, he winces in the glare.

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Nice boat.

           A figure hops jauntily down from the stern into the light; 
           all we see is a silhouette, never his face. 
                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Mine’s a little bigger, but this is 
                        nice. Glad to see you at least got 
                        paid well for what you did.

           Perkins goes pale as SHINK! The figure draws a DIAMOND-SHAPED 
           KNIFE, slides it up to the corner of Perkins’ eyeball.

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Know what I’ve discovered over the 
                        past ten years, detective?

           Perkins SQUIRMS and KEENS, the knife poised to jab into his 
           tear duct ay any second... but it backs away.

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Everyone can be bought.

                                 PERKINS
                        NAME IT-- name your price--

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        I want all of it: where they live, 
                        where they sleep, what they’re 
                        doing, what they drive, who they’re 
                        screwing, who they’ve screwed over, 
                        who owes them money, who they owe 
                        money to, what libraries they 
                        haven’t returned books to--

                                 PERKINS
                        I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you--

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        --and most importantly, I want our 
                        conversation to stay a secret. Or 
                        I’m going to see how many pieces of 
                        you I can cut off. Understand?

                                 PERKINS
                        Yes, I swear, I won’t say a--

           THUNK! The knife gets THROWN into the boom, a few feet away.

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Start talking.

           We push in on Perkins’ blubbering face as we SMASH TO:

           EXT. PERKINS’ YACHT - MORNING

           Dawn breaks over the ocean. Perkins’ yacht rocks gently, the 
           only vessel for fifty miles. We hear a ROPE CREAKING as--

           ON THE YACHT
           Perkins, alone, still upsidedown, heaves his body back and 
           forth, reaching out... until he’s finally able to grab the 
           knife from the boom. Cuts the rope and WHUMPH! Hits the deck, 
           air belching out of him. Legs too numb to stand, he crawls...

                                 PERKINS
                        ...think you’re gonna come here and 
                        pull this shit...

           ...making for the steering station, where his CELL PHONE 
           sits. Snatches it, scrolls through until he finds “MAX.”

                                 PERKINS
                        ...another thing coming, asshole...

           CLICK! He hits the “call” button and listens as the phone 
           rings once... then goes to a pre-recorded message. Kip’s 
           cheerful New Zealand-accented voice saying:

                                 KIP (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Shouldnta’ dialed that number, mate-

           Perkins’ eyes go wide as BEEEEP goes a digital timer across 
           the deck -- from a stack of EXPLOSIVES among the fuel tanks.

                                 PERKINS
                        God--

           KA-BOOOM! The HMS Retirement, along with its captain, is 
           ATOMIZED INTO FLAMING CHUNKS. A FIERY BOAT ENGINE flies at 
           us, the logo -- MCCORMICK INDUSTRIES -- hits us in the face.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Max McCormick sits up in bed, blinking awake as if from an 
           intense, disorienting dream. 

           He’s now ten years older, a little soft from living the good 
           life. We’ll see that his youthful entitlement has distilled 
           into weapons-grade arrogance, which he hides behind a life-of-
           the-party bonhomie. Behind him in bed, a woman dozes.

                                 MAX
                        You ever have one of those dreams 
                        where the floor suddenly gives way?

           The woman rolls over and we see it’s not Elise, but ARABELLA: 
           a high-toned Italian beauty, accent that could melt copper. 

                                 ARABELLA
                        You want to talk about dreams, it 
                        costs extra.

                                 MAX
                        You’re ruthless. I like that.
           He gives her a smack on the ass, stands, tosses her a stack 
           of supra (globalized currency) off the table. Gets dressed--

                                 MAX
                        How do I look?

                                 ARABELLA
                        Like a man who’s spent the night 
                        doing things his wife would not. I 
                        recommend a fresh shirt.

                                 MAX
                             (blows her a kiss)
                        See you next week.

           Welcome to a Day-In-The-Life Of Max. Hang on, enjoy the ride.

           INT. MAX’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           We WHOOSH into Max’s apartment: a 4000 square foot shrine to 
           his ego, interior designed within an inch of its life. As he 
           heads in, he takes coffee from his waiting servant MARTHA--

                                 MAX
                        Martha, light-of-my-life...

           She giggles as he glides to the DINING ROOM, where Elise eats 
           toast in her robe. The past 10 years haven’t gotten the best 
           of her.

                                 MAX
                        Hey pretty lady.

                                 ELISE
                        How was New Jamestown?

                                 MAX
                        Next time the company makes me do a 
                        walk-through on a sub-orbital, I’m 
                        threatening ritual suicide.

           No way to tell if she believes him. He goes to the fridge, 
           pours cream into his coffee, tosses the empty bottle out, the 
           item gets auto-added to a DIGITAL SHOPPING LIST on the door.

                                 MAX
                             (re: her robe, teasing)
                        Please, please, please tell me 
                        you’re gonna wear that particular 
                        bit of sexiness to the party.

                                 ELISE
                        Yes, Max, I am going to wear a 
                        bathrobe to the charity gala I 
                        spent the past six months planning.
           He doesn’t have a comeback; it’s almost like he’s trying to 
           recreate the rapport she had with Coleman and not doing very 
           well at it. Max gives her a kiss and goes to get cleaned up, 
           Elise gives him a lingering glance as we WHOOSH TO:

           INT. MAX’S APARTMENT TOWER - MORNING

           Max, in a fresh suit, swoops into the parking garage, where 
           Gregor’s old James Dean-era PORSCHE SPYDER pulls up. JOEL, 
           the young valet, opens the door as Max wipes a smudge off it.

                                 VALET
                        Morning, Mr. McCormick--

                                 MAX
                        Hi, Joel. Smudge my car again, your 
                        head’s going on top of my Christmas 
                        tree.
                             (off his “oh shit” look)
                        Kidding, kidding. Here, take this, 
                        buy yourself something shiny.

           Max slaps a hefty tip into his hand, gets behind the wheel 
           and VROOOM! Motors off into BUSTLING MORNING TRAFFIC, being 
           followed by a souped-up repulsor-bike as we WHOOSH TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - MORNING

           Max weaves into an UPSCALE CAFE, towards a table where JEFF 
           PICKNER sits -- Max’s college pal from 10 years ago, now 
           30’s, bank VP, living proof that money can’t buy charisma.

                                 MAX
                        Pickner! How’s the sexiest bank VP 
                        on God’s green earth? 

                                 PICKNER
                        Max, listen--

                                 MAX
                        Denise doing well? Your kids 
                        staying in school and off the drugs 
                        and all that?

                                 PICKNER
                        Max?
                             (gets his attention)
                        I’m sorry, but... we’re calling in 
                        your loans.

                                 MAX
                        Funny. Love it. Your bank can’t 
                        afford to call in my loans, Jeff--
                                 PICKNER
                        Someone bought us out.

                                 MAX
                        What?... 
                             (beat)
                        Who?

                                 PICKNER
                        It was over my head. Guy apparently 
                        swooped in out of nowhere, started 
                        making bids like the money was 
                        gonna burn his hands. First order 
                        was to call in your markers. 

                                 MAX
                        And this was the best way to tell 
                        me? Was, I dunno, a cake with 
                        frosting letters not available?--

                                 PICKNER
                        --I’m sorry, Max, there’s nothing I 
                        can do. You’ve got thirty days. 

           Unaware that this is an omen, Max chews thoughtfully. This is 
           a guy who will be your best friend, until you slight him.

                                 MAX
                        Jeff, nothing personal, but by the 
                        time my lawyer is done, your unborn 
                        descendents will be in hock to me.  
                             (makes to go, then:)
                        And next time you’re out of town, 
                        don’t leave Denise at home by 
                        herself. She tends to get lonely.

           Gives his shocked pal a salute, strides on as we WHOOSH TO:

           EXT. MCCORMICK TOWER - MORNING

           The McCormick Tower, the big HQ, looms amidst the shimmering 
           skyscrapers of downtown. We CATAPULT towards it, over its 
           ascending pyramid-like levels of sloping glass, each sheet 
           the size of a football field, which we GO WHOOSHING THROUGH--

           INTO THE MEZZANINE

           --as Max cruises past EMPLOYEES, talking into his earpiece, 
           phone in hand, jovially rattling off orders to his lawyer. 
                                 MAX
                        --ok Gene, buddy, time to earn your 
                        retainer, I want you to pore over 
                        the loan documents until you find 
                        some subsection that allows me to 
                        drag Jeff Pickner into an alley and 
                        perpetrate sexual violence on him--

           WHAM! He slams into a 20-ISH EMPLOYEE, the phone skids off. 

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        So sorry--

                                 MAX
                        Oh my, a curse upon your house.

           The employee darts for the phone and we see he is actually 
           KIP, who subtly slips a tiny LAYER OF CLEAR FILM onto it. 

                                 KIP
                             (hands phone back)
                        Have a good one.

           Max walks on, as we push into his phone, into THE STRIP OF 
           FILM Kip stuck to it, ZOOMING into a sea of tiny nanochips--

           INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

           --and out of a SET OF LISTENING-STATION SPEAKERS, set up in a 
           well-furnished penthouse. Someone sits at the desk, seen only 
           from the back, LISTENING IN ON MAX’S LIFE, hearing...

                                 MAX (FILTERED)
                        As you can see, we’re looking at a 
                        major upward surge of ROI in the 
                        coming months...

           INT. MCCORMICK INDUSTRIES, BOARDROOM - SAME

           Max confidently gives a presentation to the BOARD OF 
           DIRECTORS, pointing to different HOLOGRAM CHARTS. 

                                 MAX 
                        ...so think “last quarter with a 
                        shot of human growth hormone.” 

           Everyone laughs. Except Bob, Gregor’s old right-hand-man, the 
           one we met at the graduation, now in his 60’s and still made 
           out of steel. The man’s icy stare almost trips him up. 

                                 MAX
                             (back on track)
                        Let’s take a look at the 
                        projections for--
           INT. MCCORMICK TOWER, BATHROOM - DAY

           WHOOSH! Water spews from a tap, Max washes his face, alone in 
           the gleaming executive men’s room. Straightens his tie, rolls 
           his neck -- maintaining his cool against the rising tides.

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        You ever spend any time at culinary 
                        school, Max?

           Max turns to see Bob shutting the door behind him.

                                 BOB
                        By the way you cook the books, I’d 
                        almost take you for a chef.

                                 MAX
                        Bob, with cataracts like yours, I’m 
                        amazed you could even see the 
                        projections.

                                 BOB
                        Must be me and my old age, not 
                        understanding how you can spend 
                        like a fleet of drunken sailors and 
                        still end up in the black every 
                        quarter. You must be that much of a 
                        better businessman than your dad. 

           Max doesn’t like hearing about his dad. But he stays cool.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know where you’re getting 
                        your intel from--

                                 BOB
                        I’ve been in contact with a well-
                        informed source.
                             (off his look)
                        Who would prefer to remain 
                        anonymous. 

           Max has no idea what this means. Yet.

                                 MAX
                        Y’know, there’s such a thin line 
                        between “anonymous source” and 
                        “imaginary friend.” Sounds almost 
                        like early onset dementia here...

                                 BOB
                        Keep it up, kiddo. But if someone 
                        was to take a look at your private 
                        files, I have a feeling they’d get 
                        a damn near panoramic vision of the 
                        hole you’ve dug this company into.
                                 MAX
                        You wanna look in my files, Bob, 
                        get a court order, wait the 48 
                        hours to get it processed, and 
                        while you’re waiting, contemplate 
                        spending your few dwindling years 
                        being sued up your barely-
                        functioning prostate.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, I already called in a court 
                        order, Max. And that’s forty-seven-
                        and-a-half hours to go, as of now. 
                             (beat)
                        Contemplate that.

           Bob smiles. Max does not. Just thinking of how he’s going to 
           handle this new wrinkle. As Max watches Bob exit, we hear:

                                 MAX (PRE-LAP)
                        ...so, I need you to kill someone.

           INT. PHENG’S COMPOUND - DAY

           A steel door BUZZES OPENS and we reveal PHENG, 10 years older 
           and elegantly sleazy as ever, swiftly leading Max into his 
           COMPOUND -- an abandoned police station in the favelas, 
           surrounded by walls, turrets, and machine-gun GUARDS.

                                 PHENG
                        I’m getting the strangest sense of 
                        deja vu here. Makes me wonder how 
                        you deal with other problems in 
                        your life -- like if your coffee 
                        maker breaks, do you think to 
                        yourself “Ah, yes, I’ll just hire 
                        Pheng to shoot it for me?”

                                 MAX 
                        You get funnier every time I see 
                        you, Chinaman.

                                 PHENG
                        I’m Thai, you imbecile.

           CLANG! A guarded door opens and Pheng leads him through into--

           PHENG’S SUPERLAB

           --a drug-making facility on steroids, THUGS IN GAS MASKS 
           working an assembly line, filling eye-droppers with liquid.

                                 MAX
                        Leave it to you to build a drug lab 
                        in a police precinct. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Should send a picture to Perkins, 
                        he’d get a kick out of it.

                                 PHENG
                        I somehow doubt that, mostly on 
                        account of his being dead.
                             (off Max’s “what?” look)
                        Didn’t hear? Last week his boat 
                        decided to blow up with him on it. 

                                 MAX
                             (thinks for a second)
                        ...there’s a “barbecued pork” joke 
                        in here somewhere.

                                 PHENG
                        Slapstick abounds.

           And that’s all the thought they give it. As Pheng checks on 
           his “experiments”, Max gets down to business:

                                 MAX
                        I’ll make this simple: I need to 
                        refill my company’s coffers in the 
                        next 48 hours, there’s a guy in my 
                        office asking questions and I need 
                        him to go away. You’ll get paid for 
                        this. Like last time. Questions?

                                 PHENG
                        Yes -- you need money so badly, why 
                        don’t you just take out a loan?

                                 MAX
                        Because my bank got...forget it. 
                        Any relevant questions?

                                 PHENG
                        How about: “Why should I help you?”

                                 MAX
                        Did you miss the part about--

                                 PHENG
                        --getting paid? I’m already getting 
                        paid, Max. I’ve got a shipment 
                        going out tonight that’s worth 
                        fifteen of your little hit-jobs.
                             (waxes rhapsodic)
                        Look around. This facility is like 
                        a lamp full of genies that grant 
                        unlimited wishes, as long as those 
                        wishes involve money and drugs. 
                                 MAX
                        Only reason you’re here is ‘cause 
                        10 years ago I hired you out of 
                        that hovel you called home. You 
                        forget that I made you?

                                 PHENG
                        Oh, you made me? Excellent. Make 
                        another me.
                             (motions to a guard)
                        I do believe we’re done here.

           A 19-year-old tattoo-strewn GUARD makes for Max--

                                 GUARD
                        Move it--

                                 MAX
                        This asshole puts a hand on me--

                                 GUARD
                             (grabs him)
                        I said, move it--

           For the first time today, Max lets his mask fully drop. BAM! 
           DECKS the guard, sends him 30 feet, bouncing off the conveyor 
           belt. Heads whirl to Max, as pale green fluid seeps from his 
           knuckles and runs down the “skin” of his robo-prosthetic arm.

                                 MAX
                        There goes one of your genies.

           Max exits, leaving the hoodlum on the floor, drooling blood.

                                 MAX (PRE-LAP)
                        My father once told me: “Your 
                        character is defined by who you are 
                        when nobody’s looking.”

           INT. CHARITY BALL - DAY

           We glide through a CHARITY GALA, in the ballroom of a hotel 
           overlooking the water, boats floating past the veranda. As 
           Max addresses the crowd from the podium, we notice his 
           knuckles have patches of synth-skin on them, “healing.”

                                 MAX
                        I think my dad came up with that 
                        when I was sixteen and he caught me 
                        stealing a bottle of his scotch. 
                             (gets a laugh from crowd)
                        But as smart as my dad was, he and 
                        I think differently. I think that 
                        character can be judged by what 
                        you’re willing to fight for in 
                        public. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        And that’s why, for the past five 
                        years, the “Max McCormick Favela 
                        Foundation” has been working to 
                        improve the conditions of our 
                        city’s poorest neighborhoods... 

           In the audience, only Elise catches how little of a shit Max 
           actually gives about this. Everyone else is eating it up.

                                 MAX
                        ...and I like to think if my father 
                        were here now, he’d say--

           LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC rises in the distance: “Ode To Joy.” Max 
           pauses, confused, as the audience stirs, heads turning to the 
           windows, where the view is rapidly overtaken by...

           A GIANT POWER-YACHT

           ...pulling up to the veranda: four stories tall, with a LIVE 
           SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA playing on the deck. A display of wealth 
           so ostentatious it forces you to redefine the word. 

                                 MAX
                        If I, uh, could ask everyone to--

           But the crowd is already heading out to see what’s going on. 
           Max, impotent and ignored, follows. Guests crowd onto the 
           veranda to see who on earth is making such an entrance as--

           UP ON THE BOAT’S DECK

           WHOOSH! A walkway ramp ejects. Kip, all cleaned up in a 
           snazzy tuxedo, sends a red carpet down it. As the music 
           CRESCENDOS, a POSH BRITISH ACCENT (like Gabriel’s) calls out:

                                 CRISTO (O.S.)
                        My apologies for being late.

           And a LONE FIGURE appears at the top of the ramp. He plants a 
           hand on the deck rail and JUMPS, launching forty feet through 
           the air, clearing the ramp, touching down with a WHUMPH on 
           the marble veranda, strolls onward like it ain’t no thing.

                                 CRISTO
                        Had quite the journey getting here.

           It’s Coleman -- or as we’ll now be calling him, CRISTO. The 
           malnourished boyscout has become a rockstar: his hair long 
           and dyed dark, contact lenses have turned his brown eyes deep 
           blue. Sharp facial hair, sharp suit, lean muscle beneath. The 
           transformation is striking; a world away from his old self.

                                 CRISTO
                             (taps a leg)
                        They’re brand new, thought I’d take 
                        them out for a test-run...
           Lifts a pant-leg to and we see his clunky prosthetics have 
           been replaced by flawless living-tissue synth-limbs.

                                 CRISTO
                        God bless progress, no? 

           Cristo mingles through the crowd, notices the stare he’s 
           getting from ELISE -- like she’s trying to place him. He 
           gives her a glance and keeps right on moving, toward...

                                 CRISTO
                        The fabled Max McCormick.

                                 MAX
                             (puzzled)
                        ...have we met?

                                 CRISTO
                        Depends. Do you believe in 
                        reincarnation?
                             (off his pause)
                        Then it’s an honor to make your 
                        acquaintance.

           Cristo shakes his hand and heads in. Max turns after him; he 
           too, feels something oddly familiar about the guy.

                                 MAX
                        ...and you are?

                                 CRISTO
                        It’s on the boat.

           Max turns to the yacht, sees a name embossed in gold: CRISTO. 

                                 AUCTIONEER (PRE-LAP)
                        The Yuan Dynasty jade yongju angel, 
                        Going, going, and--

           INT. HOTEL CHARITY GALA - NIGHT

           WHACK goes the gavel wielded by the AUCTIONEER.

                                 AUCTIONEER
                        Sold, once again, to the gentleman 
                        with his feet up in row three.

           WIDEN TO REVEAL Cristo: lounging with his wing-tips up on a 
           chair, ignoring the looks he’s getting from the crowd, 
           sipping bubbly, chatting up a pair of smoking-hot FEMALE 
           PARTY-GOERS, pausing only to give a quick nod to Kip--

                                 CRISTO
                        Put it with the others.
           Kip helps some EMPLOYEES wheel out Cristo’s latest purchase 
           as we see he’s cleared off the auction block single-handedly. 
           We pull back further to find--

           MAX

           --milling at the bar with a CROWD OF GUESTS, one eye always 
           focused on Cristo. His internal wheels turning, as the rumor 
           mill churns around him; big rock, meet small pond.

                                 PARTY GUESTS
                        Heard he’s based somewhere off in 
                        the Abell Cluster./Made his money 
                        in shipping./Gotta be inherited--

                                 MAX
                        Excuse me a moment.

           Like a shark to blood, Max heads toward Cristo, who’s parting 
           ways with the two smoking-hot Female Guests, one girl 
           slipping a phone number to Cristo and whispering in his ear.

                                 CRISTO
                        ...that’s horrifying. Count me in.

           A conspiratorial laugh from them, he plants kisses on both 
           their hands and sends them shimmering off into the party. 

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Careful. We call those two “The 
                        Succubus Twins”, and not for the 
                        reason you’re thinking.

           Cristo looks over to see Max, standing alongside him with his 
           champagne, watching the girls walk off. 

                                 CRISTO
                        And I was assuming they just had a 
                        soft spot for wealthy men with 
                        unspeakably depraved personal 
                        lives.

                                 MAX
                        Glad to see you and I already have 
                        something in common.
                             (raises his glass)
                        To depravity.

                                 CRISTO
                             (clinks it)
                        Always.

           Max motions for Cristo’s glass to be refilled, and they walk 
           on through the festivities...
                                 MAX
                        There’s a betting pool going on. 
                        Everyone’s trying to figure out 
                        what the scenario is on the 
                        mysterious party-crasher.

                                 CRISTO
                        What are the odds favoring?

                                 MAX
                        10 to 1, you’re a shipping magnate 
                        here to buy out the Southern Ports. 

                                 CRISTO
                        You put money on that?

                                 MAX
                        No, I was betting on “owner of 
                        extremely successful fish-and-chips 
                        franchise.” 

                                 CRISTO
                        It’s like you’ve known me forever.

           Max, not getting the joke, gets down to brass tacks:

                                 MAX
                        Let’s be real. There’s only one 
                        reason someone shows up to an event 
                        like this the way you’re doing it: 
                        because you’re looking to make an 
                        investment. And since you just 
                        rolled in here with the subtlety of 
                        the D-Day invasion, you’re gonna 
                        have every hitter in the room 
                        looking to be in business with you. 

                                 CRISTO
                        I’d heard you were a lot of things, 
                        Mr. McCormick. I suppose I can add 
                        “perceptive” to the list now.

           Max smirks -- what can I say? Gestures out to the ballroom, 
           the whole place seeming to ooze wealth and power.

                                 MAX
                        Do your due diligence. Make the 
                        rounds. Shake some hands. Find out 
                        who thinks they can hunt big game. 
                        And when you’re done...

           Max lifts his card: MAX MCCORMICK: CEO, MCCORMICK INDUSTRIES. 
           Cristo glances at it, but his attention is on Elise, excusing 
           herself from a conversation and heading down a hall.
                                 MAX
                        Don’t wait too long, my schedule 
                        fills up quick.

                                 CRISTO
                             (hands over his own card)
                        I get a feeling we’ll cross paths.

           Max glances at the card Cristo just gave him, perplexed as he 
           reads it: CRISTO -- FORMER BUSINESS CARD OWNER. And as he 
           looks up, Cristo is gone.

           INT. CHARITY GALA, SIDE ROOM - NIGHT

           In a private bathroom, Elise washes up at the sink. Looking 
           in the mirror, she plasters her game face on and turns to go--

           THROUGH A SIDE OFFICE

           --where something stops her. On a desk, there’s a portfolio 
           of receipts, with MAX MCCORMICK FAVELA FOUNDATION across the 
           cover in hideous shiny-gold lettering; very Donald Trump-ish. 

           Impulsively, she grabs the portfolio and throws it. It 
           topples a wine glass on a table, breaks it, Merlot spills. 
           She storms over, starts picking glass from the stained rug--

                                 CRISTO (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Elise McCormick, fearless 
                        destroyer of wine glasses.

           She looks up to see the darkly handsome gent in the doorway. 
           Looking at her with eyes a shade of blue normally associated 
           with Viking visionaries or sidewalk schizophrenics. 

                                 CRISTO
                             (extends hand)
                        Pleasure to meet you.

                                 ELISE
                        Pleasure’s mine, Mr.--

                                 CRISTO
                        Cristo.

           She motions for him to go on. He doesn’t. 

                                 ELISE
                        You one of these one-name guys 
                        like... “Hercules?”

                                 CRISTO
                        Simplicity’s a virtue.
                                 ELISE
                        Like the five-story monstrosity you  
                        docked outside. 

                                 CRISTO
                        Never said I practice what I 
                        preach.

                                 ELISE
                        What’d you name that thing, the 
                        “S.S. Good Taste?”

                                 CRISTO
                        Considered that, but I wound up 
                        naming it after myself.

           An odd, charged moment -- like they’ve immediately picked up 
           where they left off, busting each other’s chops. Elise looks 
           at him like he’s a puzzle piece she can’t quite fit. Cristo 
           grabs seltzer and a napkin, starts scrubbing the floor.

                                 ELISE
                        Pretty proficient at scrubbing 
                        floors for someone of your means.

                                 CRISTO
                        I wasn’t always rich.

                                 ELISE
                        What were you before?

                                 CRISTO
                        The details of my background are 
                        earth-shatteringly uninteresting, 
                        and at the risk of drinking alone, 
                        I feel it’s best not to bore you.

                                 ELISE
                        ...so, are you this full of shit 
                        with everyone or just me?
                             (off his “pardon?” look)
                        “Earth-shatteringly uninteresting” 
                        is not the term I’d use to describe 
                        someone who shows up uninvited to a 
                        charity gala, jumps off his boat, 
                        buys everything on the auction 
                        block, and ends up scrubbing the 
                        floor with a stranger.

                                 CRISTO
                        And what term would you use to 
                        describe a woman who spends months 
                        setting up a charity gala and then  
                        hides out all night in a back room?

           Elise pauses, taken aback...
                                 ELISE
                        How’d you know the gala was mine?

                                 CRISTO
                        McCormick Industries has always 
                        ranked high amongst my interests. 
                        And Max McCormick is not known for 
                        his dedication to charity. 

           Elise shakes her head, truer words...

                                 CRISTO
                        How’s that going for you?

                                 ELISE
                        How’s what going for me?

                                 CRISTO
                        Being married to such a... goal-
                        oriented individual.

                                 ELISE
                             (a beat)
                        You want the truth?

                                 CRISTO
                        If it’s more interesting than the 
                        lie, absolutely.

           Elise pauses... and the way you’d spill your guts to a 
           stranger on the subway after a bad day, she lets it out:

                                 ELISE
                        He’s unfaithful. He’s narcissistic. 
                        He’s patently insincere. But, being 
                        with him allows me the resources to 
                        do what I was put here to do.

                                 CRISTO
                        Which is?

           She motions outward -- you’re looking at it.

                                 CRISTO
                        I’m sorry -- “favela-aid?”
                             (off her nod)
                        ...why?

                                 ELISE
                        Because I had a friend from there 
                        once and he would’ve wanted it.

                                 CRISTO
                        Your friend would’ve wanted you to 
                        end up with an unfaithful, patently 
                        insincere narcissist.
           Before she can answer, there’s a KNOCK as--

                                 MAX
                             (letting himself in)
                        Ah, there you are. I was getting 
                        worried you ran off with the help.

                                 CRISTO
                        She did.

                                 MAX
                             (laughs)
                        Mind if I borrow my better half? 
                        Gotta go make the closing remarks.

                                 CRISTO
                        Take her, take her. It’s been a 
                        pleasure, Mrs. McCormick.

           He shakes her hand. A final, electric moment, their eyes 
           meeting... then Max guides her out. Coleman watches them go; 
           Max whispers into her ear and strokes a hand down her back. 
           And off Cristo’s blood starting to boil, we CUT TO:

           EXT. CRISTO’S SHIP - NIGHT

           Cristo’s shoes go BOOMING up the ramp to his yacht, he storms 
           across the deck toward Kip, who’s loading up a HEAVY, BLAST-
           PROOF CASE. (Loading it with what, we don’t see.) 

                                 KIP
                        Evening, robo-legs.

           WHAP! Cristo slaps down Max’s business card. His facade is 
           gone; he’s ice-cold, all business, his accent back to normal.

                                 CRISTO
                        Set the meeting.

                                 KIP
                        On it.

                                 CRISTO
                        Car?

                                 KIP
                        Waiting up front.

                                 CRISTO
                             (hustles him up)
                        Good, let’s move--

                                 KIP
                        Y’know, I really liked the version 
                        of you from five minutes ago better 
                        than this, he was less pushy--
           As Cristo packs up to head out, Kip glances down at the crowd 
           in gala, eyeing Elise as she goes through with Max.

                                 KIP
                        Was that who I think it--

                                 CRISTO
                        That was nobody.

                                 KIP
                        ...you see the love of your life 
                        for the first time in 10 years, and 
                        all you say is “That was nobody?”
                             (off Cristo’s dark look)
                        Fine. Let’s go cause a traffic jam.

           INT. PHENG’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           SWOOPING we go: through the favelas, over trash fires, 
           between vines, up over TALL STEEL WALLS and down into...

           PHENG’S COMPOUND

           ...where PHENG’S CREW works fast, loading cases of Push, 
           everyone’s favorite liquid-based narcotic, into crates. The 
           crates get stacked in a waiting SEMI-TRUCK -- a ground-only 
           vehicle, with a bread company logo on the side. 

           At its front and rear are GHETTO-RIGGED “TECHIES” (machine-
           gun mounted sentry jeeps, armored with Frankensteined found 
           materials.) As a handful of GUNNERS make for the vehicles, a 
           DRIVER hands out CONTACT LENS CASES.

                                 GUNNER
                        C’mon, man, damn things feel like 
                        sandpaper, I hate this shit--

                                 PHENG (O.S.)
                        Know what I hate?...

           They look up to see Pheng, at the door to his office above.

                                 PHENG
                        The idea of someone waltzing off 
                        with my product and thinking I 
                        won’t see it. Now put ‘em on.

           Grudgingly, the gunner tilts his head back and inserts the 
           CONTACTS into his eyes. In his POV, the world goes watery as--

           IN PHENG’S OFFICE

           --on a large bank of monitors (FEED SCREENS) we see through 
           the gunner’s POV; the contact lenses are actually live-feed 
           CAMERAS. Pheng checks the different monitors, seeing four 
           different views of the compound.
                                 PHENG (INTO EARPIECE)
                        Good... perfect... you, stop 
                        blinking so much... aaand good. 
                        Let’s boogie.

           EXT. PHENG’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           ENGINES ROAR as the convoy rolls out of the compound, the 
           semi-truck guarded at both ends by the techies, winding 
           through the favela streets. KIDS scramble to get out of the 
           way as the lead techie plays Pac-Man with debris in the road.

                                 LEAD GUNNER
                             (hits errant fruit cart)
                        Ten points!
                             (hits a trash-can fire)
                        Twenty points!

           They round a corner down into...

           A TIGHT STREET

           ...where the techie skids to a stop -- because, oddly enough, 
           there’s a COUPLE OF JUNKED SUVS blocking their path.

                                 GUNNER 1 (INTO EARPIECE)
                        Goddammit, I thought you checked 
                        this route out--

                                 GUNNER 2 (THROUGH EARPIECE)
                        I did, shit musta’ happened in the 
                        past thirty minutes--

                                 GUNNER 1 (INTO EARPICE)
                        Jesus Christ, back it up, we’re 
                        taking the long way--

           The convoy backs up out of the street and re-routes, driving 
           onward past Kip, watching from an alley.

                                 KIP (INTO EARPIECE)
                        Get ready.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR - NIGHT

           In the industrial sector, atop a warehouse roof, Cristo 
           stands -- a MINI-REMOTE in hand, blast-proof case open at his 
           feet. Gazing out into the favelas, as the convoy approaches 
           in distance, waiting like a gunfighter for the word “draw.” 

           INT. PHENG’S OFFICE - SAME

           Back in his office, Pheng watches a screen intently, eyes 
           focused like lasers... 
           but as we widen, we reveal he’s not watching the feed, but 
           his favorite THAI SOAP OPERA: an emotionally fraught break-up 
           between MONGKUT and SUMALEE.

                                 PHENG 
                             (over their argument)
                        God’s sakes, Mongkut, I told you 
                        that bitch was bad news.

           Behind him, his CHUCKLEHEAD RIGHT-HAND-MEN raucously play pai-
           gow poker at a table, while on the FEED-SCREENS nearby, we 
           see the world through the gunners’ POVS -- INDUSTRIAL 
           DISTRICT rolling past. We ZOOM IN on the screen and wind up--

           BACK WITH THE CONVOY

           The vehicles TEAR down the street. 100 feet ahead, a debris-
           stuffed SHOPPING CART sits in the road. We pan up to a NEARBY 
           ROOF, where Cristo crouches, watching, mini-remote ready...

           IN THE LEAD TECHIE

           The gunner points a fat finger at the shopping cart--

                                 GUNNER
                        Thirty points!

           They barrel towards it, gaining speed, as we RISE to see the 
           cart’s shopping bags are loaded with SILVER CANNISTERS as--

           BACK WITH PHENG IN HIS COMPOUND

           Pheng’s glued to his soap opera: Mongkut is now blocking the 
           door, Sumalee’s aiming a gun at him...

                                 PHENG
                        Don’t you dare, Sumalee.

           BANG goes Sumalee’s gun, Pheng recoils -- just as ON THE FEED 
           SCREEN, the techie slams into the cart and GETS THROWN INTO A 
           WHIRLING SPIN, framed by a corona of fire as--

                                 PHENG
                             (head in hands)
                        Why do I even watch this show?

                                 RIGHT-HAND-MAN 1
                        Uh, Pheng?

                                 PHENG
                        What?

           Pheng follows his gaze to the feed-screens: one’s COMPLETELY 
           BLACK, another shows a sideways-on-the-pavement view of a 
           FLIPPED-SMOKING-WRECKED TECHIE, the other two are showing...
                                 PHENG
                        Good God--

           BACK WITH THE CONVOY

           The REAR TECHIE lays rubber to speed ahead of the semi, the 
           GUNNER spraying TRACER FIRE, tearing plum-sized holes through 
           the buildings around it as he screams into his earpiece-- 

                                 REAR GUNNER
                        PHENG, COME IN, WHAT THE HELL IS--

                                 PHENG (THROUGH EARPIECE)
                        Do not stop! Keep that truck going!

           ON THE FEED-SCREEN

           The gunner’s POV aims up and we just barely catch a glimpse 
           of a HUMAN FORM VAULTING THROUGH THE AIR, coming in for a 
           crash landing on the warehouse rooftop adjacent--

                                 REAR GUNNER (THROUGH EARPIECE)
                        What the--

           WITH THE CONVOY

           The REAR GUNNER swivels his 50-cal on its tripod, sweat 
           trickling down his face, scanning the area--

                                 REAR GUNNER
                        DID ANYBODY ELSE SEE--

           WA-BAM! Something slams into the vehicle, and--

           ON THE FEED-SCREEN

           --the POV whirls to reveal someone’s dropped down onto the 
           truck’s gear crates, leaving a massive dent, springing 
           straight at us in a blur and--

                                 PHENG
                        --ohgod--

           --we’re THROWN FREE OF THE VEHICLE AND WE SLAM TO THE STREET, 
           rolling across the pavement, ground blacking out the screen--

                                 PHENG (INTO EARPIECE)
                        THE BLOODY HELL’S GOING ON THERE?!

           No response. Pheng looks to a WHIRRING POV in the last feed-
           screen, sees his final remaining gunner’s in the middle of s 
           BRUTAL HAND-TO-HAND, slashing at a barely-seen figure with a 
           KNIFE, slicing the guy above his collarbone, before there’s a 
           A KICK and we’re FLYING. Then monitor goes to black. 

           Pheng stares at the dead screens. Holy. Fucking. Shit.
                                 RIGHT-HAND-MAN
                        Uh... what just happened?

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           WHRRRRMMMMM! Repulsors blow trash off the street as a CUBE 
           VAN whips overhead -- Pheng, driven by a flunkie, doing 80 
           ten feet off the ground. Traveling adjacent to an ABANDONED 
           ELEVATED FREEWAY soaring 100 feet overhead.

                                 PHENG
                        There we go, there we go--

           He jams a finger at the GPS screen in the dash, where the 
           GLOWING DOT of the shipping-semi moves along--

                                 PHENG
                        --step on it, run ‘em down.

                                 RIGHT-HAND-MAN
                        It should be right in front of us--

                                 PHENG
                        Clearly, now where the hell is it?--

           BOOOM! Seen through their windshield, 50 feet ahead and 80 
           feet above, there’s an EXPLOSION OF DUST AND ROCK... 

           ...and there’s Pheng’s truck -- having just BLASTED THROUGH 
           THE FREEWAY’S CEMENT SIDE-BARRIER, soaring out into the air, 
           arcing downwards like a dive-bombing dragon as-- 

                                 PHENG
                        AHHHHHHHHHH--

           The cube-van SWERVES, needle-threading between a cement post 
           and the 60 tons of steel diving past their windows and...

           CRAAAASSSHHHHHH! The truck FACE-PLANTS INTO THE STREET. 
           Debris rains, freed tires bounce high, it’s shipping trailer 
           rips off, JACKNIFING like a suicidal gymnast, ROLLING INTO 
           OUR FACES WITH A SPINE-DISINTEGRATING BOOM as--

           BEHIND 

           --Pheng LEAPS OUT of his barely-stopped cube-van, RUNS LIKE 
           HELL toward the mangled remains of the truck, past the 
           WOUNDED THUG dragging himself out of the driver’s compartment-

                                 WOUNDED THUG
                        I made it-- Pheng, I’m alive--

           BLAM! Pheng puts a bullet in the guy while barely even 
           breaking his stride, and BOLTS straight for what’s really 
           important here: the trailer containing his drugs.
                                 PHENG
                        Please, please, oh god, please--

           WHIR-POP! He blows the LOCK off the trailer’s doors, yanks up 
           on the metal handle -- and SIZZLE GOES HIS PALM-FLESH. He 
           SHRIEKS and pulls his hand away, as his driver sprints over--

                                 PHENG’S DRIVER
                        Hell’s going on?--

                                 PHENG
                        LOOK!

           Pheng puts his shoe on the door and kicks upward, opening it 
           to reveal... the entire shipment of drugs has been set 
           ablaze. A 50-foot bonfire, burning toxically in the trailer. 
           The two men gaze on in horror as we CUT TO:

           EXT. PHENG’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Pheng, mid phone-call, is back in the cube-van and ROARING 
           through the entrance to his compound.

                                 PHENG
                        --no, no... I assure you, the 
                        shipment is on its way, we’ve just 
                        had a... minor transport issue--

           Pheng and his flunky hop out and head toward the lab.

                                 PHENG
                        How soon will you get it? Very 
                        soon. Very, very--

           Suddenly a familiar HIGH-PITCHED TONE RISES... coming from 
           inside the darkened confines of his lab. Pheng stops, listens-

                                 PHENG
                        Please tell me that’s not what I 
                        think it--

           KA-BOOM! Pheng’s knocked ass-over-teakettle as his superlab 
           detonates in a cumulonimbus of fire and debris, as we CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME

           Cristo, standing with Kip on the rooftop he started on, 
           watching it burn. Palpable satisfaction in his face, as he 
           takes in a deep breath of the smoke-tinged air. A beat, then--

                                 KIP
                             (motions to go)
                        Shall we?
                                 CRISTO
                        Not yet.

           He wants to enjoy this. Basking in the flickering light of 
           his destruction, Cristo smiles with delight as we SMASH TO:

           EXT. CRISTO’S PENTHOUSE - MORNING

           A JAZZ QUARTET whips up a sweet swing as top-shelf vodka gets 
           poured through an ICE SCULPTURE and down into glasses, bloody 
           maries get mixed and carried on a silver platter across...

           THE DECK OF CRISTO’S PENTHOUSE

           Palatial digs atop a downtown hotel. Beside the infinity pool 
           that seems to drop off into the city below, Cristo and Max do 
           breakfast. Cristo still glowing with last night’s adrenaline. 

                                 MAX
                        Let it never be said that you 
                        suffer from a lack of style.

                                 CRISTO
                        One of the many benefits of being 
                        monomaniacal. 

                                 MAX
                             (notices)
                        Hurt yourself?

           Cristo sees he’s motioning to the bandage peeking out from 
           under his collar; from when he was knife-slashed last night.

                                 CRISTO
                        Things got a bit rough last night.

                                 MAX
                        Let me guess, the Succubus Twins?

                                 CRISTO
                        I admit nothing.

           Max grins, then suddenly glances down at his buzzing phone -- 
           the name PHENG flashes on the screen. Silences it.

                                 CRISTO
                        So I did my due diligence, I asked 
                        around, I shook a lot of hands--

                                 MAX
                        --and here we are.
                                 CRISTO
                        Exactly. But before we get into the 
                        salient details, I should offer you 
                        some due diligence on me: there are 
                        certain business ventures of mine 
                        that require a... specific level of 
                        discretion. Does that make sense?

                                 MAX
                        Can’t live the life we enjoy and 
                        not have some skeletons in your 
                        closet. I upgraded to a warehouse.

                                 CRISTO
                        Then I’m in good company.

           Max’s phone HUMS once more -- Pheng again. He shuts it off.

                                 CRISTO
                        Hypothetical: let’s say I arrived 
                        in this country carrying some less-
                        than-legitimate funds... and that 
                        any company that assisted me in 
                        legitimizing them would receive a 
                        very healthy percentage.

                                 MAX
                        And hypothetically, how much are we 
                        talking about here?

           Cristo pauses a moment, then smiles:

                                 CRISTO
                        It’s probably easier if I show you.

           INT. CRISTO’S PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The doors to the penthouse’s ballroom swing wide, as Cristo 
           ushers Max in... and Max’s jaw goes agape, expression 
           brightening in a flush of awe and greed.

                                 CRISTO
                        Does that answer your question?

           THE BALLROOM IS FULL OF MONEY. Pallets of shrink-wrapped cash 
           towering in stacks. An old-growth forest of greenbacks. Max 
           turns to Cristo, his face like a man delivered to salvation.

           EXT. CRISTO’S BUILDING - DAY

           WHOOSH go the lobby doors as Max strides merrily out of 
           Cristo’s building and towards his roadster, on the phone...
                                 MAX
                        --Gene, I’m telling you, I solved 
                        the problem, ok?-- Yes, I’m fully 
                        aware of Bob and his scary little 
                        court order, but don’t worry, it’s 
                        under control. Now have you found a 
                        way for me to screw Jeff Pickner?-- 
                        Well then, I know what your 
                        weekend’s looking like. 

           His call waiting beeps -- looks down to see it’s PHENG.

                                 MAX 
                        Gotta go, Gene, buh-bye.
                             (switches call over)
                        Wanna tell me what’s so goddamn 
                        important, Pheng?

           EXT. PHENG’S COMPOUND - SAME

           Pheng -- looking utterly beleaguered, face singed, burned 
           hand wrapped in gauze -- stands across the street from the 
           SMOLDERING WRECKAGE OF HIS DRUG LAB, while hovering 
           firetrucks spray water onto the remains from above. 

                                 PHENG
                        Nothing, just thought I’d drop a 
                        line to say that someone destroyed 
                        an entire shipment of my product 
                        and then blew up my goddamn shop.

           INTERCUTTING between the two, as Max cleans a spot off the 
           window with a handkerchief and gets behind the wheel--

                                 MAX
                        That’s terrible, you should call 
                        the police, I remember there being 
                        a precinct in your neighborhood--

                                 PHENG
                        I can’t have this, I am not dealing 
                        with investors who take rainchecks. 

                                 MAX
                        Ah so, shoe, other foot, etc etc. 
                        Interested in my job offer now?

                                 PHENG
                        Your gift for understatement 
                        remains acute.

                                 MAX
                        Well then chin up, Chinaman...

           Max glances up at the building, towards Cristo’s penthouse.
                                 MAX
                        Got something even better for you.

           INT. CRISTO’S PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Cristo stands at the window, watching Max’s Spyder drive off 
           through a pair of retro-futuristic opera-glasses. Behind him:

                                 KIP
                        Not too hard getting those two 
                        ducks lined in a row, now was it?

                                 CRISTO
                        “Make them stop playing their game 
                        and start playing yours.”
                             (off his look)
                        Long story.

           Cristo turns from the window, starts unpacking a case...

                                 CRISTO
                        Do me a favor, get on the phone, 
                        set the Elise meeting for the AM.

                                 KIP
                        Alright, ok...
                             (beat, has to ask)
                        Just what the hell you gonna do 
                        about her, exactly? 

           Cristo looks up at him, surprised at his directness.

                                 KIP
                        I mean, you just gonna pull off 
                        your mask and yell “Surprise, and 
                        by the way, I’m going to kill your 
                        husband?” Doesn’t seem like ideal 
                        circumstances for winning her back--

                                 CRISTO
                        I’m not trying to win her back.

                                 KIP
                        ...why not?

                                 CRISTO
                        Because I have you.

                                 KIP
                        I’m flattered. Now stop 
                        bullshitting me.

           Cristo stops unpacking electro-darts for a moment. Kip hears 
           something odd in his voice: a trace of vulnerability.
                                 CRISTO
                        She gave up on me. She did what she 
                        had to. 
                             (beat)
                        There’s just something I need from 
                        her before this is over.

           It’s all he’s gonna say. Cristo exits the living room, Kip 
           pondering his last statement as we hear: 

                                 PHENG (PRE-LAP)
                        So this “Euro-dynasty brat” wants 
                        you to clean 10 billion supra...

           INT. FAVELA PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Tight on Max and Pheng, sitting, planning their heist:

                                 PHENG
                        ...and you’re telling me he’s 
                        keeping it in his bloody penthouse?

                                 MAX
                        Sorry, what? I was just admiring 
                        your new base of operations.  

           Widen to reveal they’re in the back of Pheng’s CUBE-VAN, 
           parked on the overgrown outskirts of the favela. 

                                 MAX
                        Got a great minimalist vibe, very--

                                 PHENG
                        Finished?

                                 MAX
                        --utilitarian. Yes. Anyway, the guy 
                        is the easiest mark in the history 
                        of marks. You make it out with even 
                        half his stash, you and I are gold.

                                 PHENG
                        For the kind of money you’re 
                        talking about, I’ll even throw in 
                        killing that old bastard from your 
                        office for free.

                                 MAX
                        No longer necessary, but it’s the 
                        thought that counts.
                             (sticks out a hand)
                        We in business?

           Pheng smiles, shakes his hand... and we hear something CLICK. 
           Pheng winces. Not in pain -- but holding back laughter.
                                 PHENG
                        You didn’t.

                                 MAX
                        I did.

                                 PHENG
                        You scoundrel.

                                 MAX
                        I know, right?

           As Pheng lifts his wrist, we see the SEGMENTED TITANIUM 
           BRACELET that Max fastened around it when they shook hands-- 
           a thin strip of RED LIGHT glowing ominously within it, a 
           little McCormick Industries logo imprinted on the metal.

                                 MAX
                        This time next year, they’ll be 
                        putting prisoners in these things.

                                 PHENG
                        Yes, but on the bright side, it 
                        really matches my sunglasses.

                                 MAX
                        And on the not-so-bright side, if 
                        you fail to deliver the funds to my 
                        account by 7 AM tomorrow, it’ll 
                        auto-detonate and turn your ass 
                        into a Chinese firework.

                                 PHENG
                        For the last time, I’m Thai.

                                 MAX
                        So we understand each other.

           Pheng eyes the bracelet... and gives a nod as we CUT TO:

           EXT. CRISTO’S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           Nightfall. Out of the deck of Cristo’s penthouse, the water 
           in the infinity pool SHUDDERS as...

           Pheng’s CUBE-VAN comes in for a landing. The back doors open 
           and Pheng and his crew leap out, mag-pistols in hand, masks 
           on, beating a path toward the penthouse, lights off within as-

           INSIDE THE PENTHOUSE

           --a BEAM-TORCH cuts a man-sized hole in the glass, which then 
           gets removed with suction-grips, before the four figures slip 
           through into the living room. Guns up, moving silently, they 
           spread out, Pheng’s eyes searching...
           CLICK! The room’s suddenly GLOWING WITH LIGHT and ECHOING 
           WITH LOUD VOICES as Pheng and his crew WHIRL to see--

           --the WALL-SIZED HOLOGRAPHIC TV has turned on, playing NEWS 
           at top volume -- coverage from a trial. Pheng’s crew doesn’t 
           recognize the footage; Pheng does. A chill runs through him.

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        We’re here on day 46 of the Edward 
                        Coleman murder trial...

           FZZZT! One of Pheng’s cronies DROPS TO THE GROUND and starts 
           SPASMING -- there’s an ELECTRO-DART sticking out of his neck.

                                 PHENG 
                        GET BACK--

           They dive for cover as FZZZT! FZZZT! Out of the darkness come 
           MORE DARTS, dropping Pheng’s crew one by one as--

           IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BALCONY ABOVE, a figure aims a 
           SILENCED DART-RIFLE with a HEAT-VISION SCOPE as--

           --IN THE ROOM BELOW, Pheng SLIDES UP behind a kitchen island, 
           breathing hard, auto-pistols clenched in his sweaty palms. 
           Peers out to the living room; he’s the last man standing. No 
           sign of the gunman. Then his eyes shift to...

           THE CUBE-VAN

           ...still waiting outside, engine idling, repulsors humming. 
           20 feet away. If he sprints, he’s got a chance. Guns up, 
           Pheng takes a tentative step out of his hiding place... just 
           as the TV footage jumps back/replays at ear-blasting volume:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        Edward Coleman murder trial--
                             (pauses, jumps back)
                        Edward Coleman murder--
                             (pauses, jumps back)
                        Edward Coleman-- Edward Coleman-- 
                        Edward Coleman--

           WHIRPOPPOPPOPPOP! Pheng, losing his shit, vaporizes the holo-
           TV lens and RUNS FOR THE DECK, shooting artwork, furniture, 
           the glass doors, finally DRY FIRING as he sprints--

           OUTSIDE

           --bolting towards the CUBE-VAN, just as, to his dismay... 

           THE VAN RISES and WHUMPH! His unconscious DRIVER smashes down 
           to the deck. He looks up to Kip at the wheel, saluting.

                                 PHENG
                        No--
           VROOOOOOM! The truck SWOOPS IN, repulsor-forces BLOWING PHENG 
           OFF HIS FEET, sending him TWIRLING through a glass patio 
           table. A cut-up mess, he watches his ride vanish into night. 

           Then... A VOICE from behind him:

                                 CRISTO (O.S.)
                        Not a very good feeling is it? 

           Face like he’s just watched a replay of his life with only 
           the shitty parts left in, Pheng turns to see our hero...

                                 CRISTO
                        Wasn’t too much fun for me either.

           Pheng’s heart skips a beat as he stares up at the man 
           standing over him. Trying to place this motherfucker.

                                 CRISTO
                        I got two questions for you, ready?
                             (kneels down before him)
                        Question 1: do you know who I am?

           A beat, Pheng’s brain wrestling to process the information...

                                 PHENG
                        ...you can’t be him. 
                             (off his look)
                        He’s been dead for three years. 
                        Died from an infection on I.F. 35. 

                                 CRISTO
                        Unfortunately for both of us, you 
                        got some bad intel. Question number 
                        two: do you know why I’m here?

                                 PHENG
                             (pauses)
                        Because... 

           Pheng spits some blood. And for a beat, his facade drops. A 
           vulnerability surfacing, the man looking every inch his age.

                                 PHENG
                        ...because I did something that no 
                        sane person could forgive. And I 
                        was instrumental in taking away 
                        that which meant anything to you. 
                        And because the moral arc of the 
                        universe is apparently very long, 
                        but it always leads toward justice. 
                        That, old pal, is why you’re here.

           Cristo pauses. Certainty wavering a beat...
                                 PHENG 
                             (smiles)
                        And because I splattered some rich 
                        prick’s brains all over his living 
                        room and you got pinched for it.

           Pheng BUSTS UP LAUGHING -- and SO DOES CRISTO. 

                                 PHENG
                        Go ahead and shoot, dickhead.

                                 CRISTO
                        I’m not gonna shoot you, Pheng.

           Cristo GRABS HIM, drags him across the deck, face-down 
           through the broken glass, and for the first time, Pheng’s 
           eyes fill with genuine, unmistakable horror as we CUT TO: 

           INT. MAX’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           In Max’s bedroom, the holographic big-screen SNAPS ON, waking 
           Max up with the sound of the WEATHER FORECAST.

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        Ten to seven in South Bay, clear 
                        skies in our Christmas stocking--

           Max JERKS OUT OF BED, rushes to his desk, flips on the 
           hologram monitor, bashes in a code...

                                 MAX
                        C’mon, c’mon, c’mon...

           Brings up the file for his PRIVATE ACCOUNTS, scans down... 
           and sees the balance. His face darkens. 

                                 MAX 
                        ...no...

           CLICK! The door opens behind Max, he yells over his shoulder--

                                 MAX
                        Now’s not a good time, Elise--

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Elise left, Mr. McCormick.

           Max turns to see it’s just his servant Martha entering--

                                 MARTHA
                        She’s meeting an art collector--

                                 MAX
                        Good for her! Thank you, goodbye--
                                 MARTHA
                        Mr. McCormick?
                             (off his look, quiet)
                        There’s some policemen at the door. 

           The blood drains from Max’s face. Then--

                                 MAX 
                        Tell them I’ll be one moment.

           She exits. Max sucks in a deep breath, thinks... 

           ...and makes his decision. Throws on clothes, snatches his 
           wallet, grabs a HANDGUN from his desk, and beats a path 
           toward HIS PRIVATE ELEVATOR across the room as we CUT TO:

           INT. MAX’S APARTMENT TOWER, GARAGE - DAY

           Max STORMS OUT of the elevator and into the parking garage, 
           SNATCHES his keys out of the valet stand and warpaths onward, 
           phone to his ear, hissing out a message for Pheng--

                                 MAX (INTO EARPIECE)
                        Hi, asshole, don’t bother calling 
                        back, ‘cause you know what I just 
                        looked at? An account that doesn’t 
                        have any money in it. 
                             (checks watch)
                        Being you’ve got about 15 seconds 
                        before that bracelet sends you off 
                        to the Great Panda Express In The 
                        Sky, I suggest you take these last 
                        moments and ask yourself--

           Max stops dead in his tracks -- because ahead of him, inside 
           his precious Porsche, is PHENG: bound and gagged. Muffled 
           screams rising as THE BRACELET LIGHTS UP RED on his wrist...

                                 MAX
                        Motherfu--

           KA-BLAM! THE CAR EXPLODES FROM WITHIN, incinerating Pheng, 
           debris-strewn shockwave BLASTING MAX BACKWARDS, setting off 
           car alarms all over the garage.

           Blasted in soot and grime and blood, Max gapes at the flaming 
           wreck... then notices he’s be stared at, by Joel, the valet.

                                 MAX
                        The hell you looking at?!

           As SIRENS rise in the distance, Max starts RUNNING.
           EXT. MAX’S APARTMENT TOWER - DAY

           BAM! A side door leading into an alleyway BURSTS OPEN and Max 
           comes stumbling out into broad daylight--

           --sprints down the alley, out into the PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC on 
           the sidewalk, a POLICE AIR-CAR idling outside, cops ahead... 

                                 MAX
                        ...ok, ok, ok...

           Throws sunglasses on, ducks his head low, and starts beating 
           a path in the opposite direction down the sidewalk, when--

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        There! There he is!

           Max looks up to see BOB, flanked by police, coming around the 
           corner, twenty feet away, pointing at him. Fear spiking, Max 
           TURNS TAIL, the cops BOLTING AFTER HIM as he lurches into--

           THE STREET

           BAM! He’s knocked off his feet by a ground-car, sent twirling 
           to the pavement, gasping as the car skids to a stop. Cops 
           gaining, Max thinks fast, YANKS OPEN the driver’s door, a 
           TERRIFIED TEEN GIRL looking at him as he digs for his weapon-- 

                                 MAX
                        Out, princess.

           He gets his gun out just as the girl rips something from her 
           purse and FSSST! Sprays him in the face with a lipstick-sized 
           container of MACE. Max JERKS BACK, HOWLING, half blinded and--

           BLAM! He FIRES, hits her in the leg, HAULS THE SCREAMING GIRL 
           OUT OF THE CAR, lunges into the driver’s seat and PEELS OUT, 
           seconds before the cops can get a bead on him as we SMASH TO:

           INT. ELISE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           A doorbell CHIMES, and a beat later, the door opens to reveal 
           Cristo -- at Elise’s old loft, which she’s converted into her 
           studio/gallery. Elise looks surprised to see him.

                                 CRISTO
                        We meet again.

                                 ELISE
                        Hi, uh... I’d invite you in, but 
                        I’m meeting with a collector--

                                 CRISTO
                        He’s arrived.
           Elise shakes her head, watching as he walks in and appraises 
           the sunlit workspace before him. Composes herself.

                                 ELISE
                        So what are you in the market for, 
                        Mr. Cristo?

           Before he can answer, she gets a phone call. Glances at the 
           screen -- Max. She sends it to voice-mail as we CUT TO: 

           EXT. FAVELA ALLEYWAY - DAY

           In a dingy, favela alley, behind an overflowing dumpster,  
           MAX crouches -- so beat-up, fucked over and desperate that he 
           almost blends in with his surroundings. Into his phone--

                                 MAX (INTO EARPIECE)
                        Elise, listen, things are about to 
                        get a little bit crazy right now 
                        and I need you to go to the 
                        vacation home and clear out the 
                        safe in the master bedroom--

           Down the alley, some ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS make their way over, 
           looking for an easy mark. Annoyed, Max AIMS HIS GUN at them:

                                 MAX 
                        Not now, ok?
                             (back to phone)
                        ‘Cause, uh, it’s looking like one 
                        or both of us is gonna have to 
                        leave town, which means that some 
                        fast cash is gonna be necessary, so-
                             (beat, loses it)
                        WHERE IN THE GODDAMN HELL ARE YOU?!

           INT. ELISE’S STUDIO - DAY

           Elise gives Cristo the tour of her studio...

                                 ELISE
                        This piece here is something I did 
                        last year, oil-watercolor hybrid... 

                                 CRISTO
                        Tell me about the Ravenwood Cliffs.

           She turns, sees he’s looking at an old painting on an easel. 
           The same landscape she was working on years ago. The tree-
           shrouded cabin overlooking ocean cliffs. Still incomplete. 

                                 ELISE
                        It’s... not for sale.
                                 CRISTO
                        Why not?

                                 ELISE
                        I’m saving it for someone.
                             (off his look)
                        ...they’re unfortunately no longer 
                        able to receive it. 

                                 CRISTO
                        And yet you don’t toss it out, or 
                        paint over it, or...

           A held look. For just a beat too long. Fighting nerves, he 
           moves on to the living room, motions to another painting--

                                 CRISTO
                        Tell me about--

                                 ELISE (IN LATIN, SUBTITLED)
                        You called it “The Ravenwood 
                        Cliffs.”

           She said it in a language he shouldn’t understand, but does. 
           Cristo turns, pauses. Keeps his game face on.

                                 CRISTO
                        I’m sorry-- what langauge is--

                                 ELISE (IN LATIN, SUBTITLED)
                        The Ravenwood Cliffs don’t exist, I 
                        made them up. And only one person 
                        knows I named the painting that--

                                 CRISTO
                        --is that Latin? 

                                 ELISE (IN LATIN, SUBTITLED)
                        If you keep lying to me, I’m going 
                        to walk out the door, and I will 
                        make sure you never see me again.

           Cristo can only shake his head apologetically. Elise stares 
           him down... then turns, makes for the door. And he lets her.

           Then--

                                 CRISTO
                        Why’d you do it?

           She stops. Turns. He’s dropped the facade. He’s wide open, 
           exposed. Confronted with the impossible, her lips part...

                                 ELISE
                        Coleman--
                                 CRISTO
                        Sorry, you must not have heard. 
                        Coleman’s dead.

           She pauses. Sees him for what he is now: a raw, ragged nerve.

                                 CRISTO
                        He made the mistake of trusting you 
                        people, and he paid with his life, 
                        so let’s not dishonor the departed.
                             (off her fighting tears)
                        While he was locked up, he was 
                        given a chance to see someone he 
                        loved, once a year, even if it was 
                        only on a screen. And once a year, 
                        he had a reason to keep going. So 
                        you can imagine his surprise when 
                        those reasons stopped showing up--

                                 ELISE
                        Don’t. Don’t you throw that at me. 
                        The news said you were dead--

                                 CRISTO
                        --and let me guess: you felt so 
                        confused that--

                                 ELISE
                        No--

                                 CRISTO
                        --you just somehow... fell into bed 
                        with Max?

                                 ELISE
                        That’s not what--

                                 CRISTO
                        And then married him? 

                                 ELISE
                        I tried to kill myself.

           Cristo stops. Taken aback. Looks at her. 

                                 ELISE
                        Would’ve worked too, but Max found 
                        me, rushed me to the ER.
                             (beat)
                        He was there for me, no one else 
                        was, and things just... happened 
                        between us. And it took me years to 
                        fully admit that it was a mistake.

           Cristo takes this in, silent.
                                 ELISE
                        I still have this.

           Elise goes to a bureau, opens a drawer. From within, she 
           lifts the necklace he gave her all those years ago.

                                 ELISE
                        I said I’d hang onto it until I saw 
                        you again. And you’re here. It’s 
                        not too late to start over--

                                 CRISTO
                        Sorry, afraid it is.

                                 ELISE
                        You came back for me--

                                 CRISTO
                        I came back for Max.

                                 ELISE
                        What are you--

                                 CRISTO
                        He had his father killed and had me 
                        thrown in prison for it.

           She goes quiet. Trying to process what he’s just said. Can’t 
           quite bring herself to believe it. 

                                 ELISE
                        ...no...

                                 CRISTO
                        No? Of course not. He’s a lying, 
                        cheating, pathological narcissist, 
                        so there’s no chance that’s all 
                        just the tip of the iceberg--

                                 ELISE
                        It was Perkins, he was the one who--

                                 CRISTO
                        Perkins was just the fuse, Max was 
                        the one who lit it. And I hate to 
                        be the bearer of bad news, Elise, 
                        but he is about to be all kinds of 
                        dead. Sorry if that bothers you.

           She takes in all that’s been thrown on the table here. And, 
           voice steady, she says what she has to say:

                                 ELISE
                        You do that, I can’t be with you.
                                 CRISTO
                             (stares daggers at her)
                        He only married you because he 
                        wanted to hurt me. You can stomach 
                        that, but not me?

                                 ELISE
                        Why should I have to “stomach” 
                        anything? Why should I have to pick 
                        the lesser of two evils?

                                 CRISTO
                        I’m nothing like him--

                                 ELISE
                        You will be to me if you go through 
                        with this.
                             (beat)
                        You ever heard the saying “The best 
                        revenge is living well?” 

                                 CRISTO
                        Most likely said by someone who 
                        never really needed it--

                                 ELISE
                        Does “losing the person you love” 
                        sound like “living well” to you, 
                        Coleman? Because it sure as hell 
                        doesn’t to me.

                                 CRISTO
                        And what if I don’t love you?

           A dagger. There’s silence in the room, for ages. Then...

                                 ELISE
                             (a whisper)
                        ...go.

           She STUFFS the necklace into his hand and SHOVES HIM BACK. 
           Breathing hard, he looks into her... then storms to the door.

           INT. CRISTO’S PENTHOUSE - DAY

           CRASH! A shelf of sculptures gets SWEPT onto the floor. It’s 
           Cristo, coming into his penthouse, raging. At least until--

                                 KIP
                        So I take it the ten-year reunion 
                        didn’t go as planned?

           Cristo looks over to see Kip exiting the kitchen, a half-
           eaten caviar sandwich on his plate. Saying nothing, Cristo 
           goes to a locked case on a table, pops it open, starts 
           assembling components for a twin hand-held AUTO-CANNONS. 
                                 KIP
                        Tell me something: does this girl 
                        love you?

           Cristo stops putting the guns together for a moment.

                                 KIP
                        If so? Walk away from this. Mate, 
                        if you hadn’t got me off that ship, 
                        I probably wouldn’t even like you--

                                 CRISTO
                        Kip, your assistance is 
                        appreciated, but I’m afraid I no 
                        longer require your services. 

                                 KIP
                             (after a beat)
                        Are you... firing me?

                                 CRSTO
                        Call it “creative differences.”

                                 KIP
                        Bollocks. You’re about to make the 
                        biggest mistake of your bloody 
                        existence and I seem to be the only 
                        one trying to stop you--

                                 CRISTO
                        Get out of my way, or I will put 
                        you out of my way.

           A stare-down... and WHAM! Cristo KNOCKS HIM into a shelving 
           unit, sends him to the ground. As Cristo storms for the door, 
           Kip lurches to his feet, shouting:

                                 KIP
                        I feel bad for you, mate. Even if 
                        you get what you want, you’ll still 
                        be stuck with yourself!

           SLAM goes the door as we SMASH TO:

           EXT. FAVELAS, BAZAAR - EVENING

           A bustling outdoor bazaar in the favelas. In a shop window, 
           rows of KNOCK-OFF HOLOGRAM TVs play the news: the manhunt for 
           Max, the CEO-turned-fugitive, in full swing. We pull back...

           ...to find Max, filthy and sweating, crouching behind a fruit 
           stand, waiting... A COP CAR GOES SWOOPING PAST... and a beat 
           later, he makes his move: running for an idling AIR-TAXI, the 
           CABBIE wrapped up in Haitian-Creole religious radio-talk.
                                 CABBIE
                             (Max yanks his door open)
                        Whoah, heyman--

           Max grabs him with his robo-prosthetic arm and HURLS HIM, 
           sends him flying through shop windows, then lurches into the 
           car and BLASTS OFF, almost mowing down gawkers as we CUT TO:

           EXT. FLOATING SUBURB - NIGHT

           Moonlit clouds and VEHICLE LIGHTS whir past us as we soar 
           toward the ELEVATED ESTATES, hovering quietly above the city 
           below. Pushing onward we go, towards THE MCCORMICK ESTATE, 
           where an AIR TAXI is parked askew in the drive...

           INT. MCCORMICK MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Dark inside. Max has turned his family’s old home into a 
           vacation house he never uses. Sheets over couches. Dust on 
           the mantles, coating framed pictures of his father.

           IN THE BEDROOM

           ...Max’s fingers punch a code into the WALL SAFE, and CLICK! 
           The door retracts, revealing a SEALED METAL CASE inside. Max 
           snatches it, dials in the combination...

                                 MAX
                        C’mon, c’mon, c’mon--

           Hauls the case lid open to reveal... 

           ...instead of money, there’s a PICTURE.

           The one of Coleman and Max at the graduation a decade ago. 
           Coleman’s arm around his friend, Max smiling his fake little 
           smile. And all at once, it all comes together for him.

                                 MAX
                        ...no...

           Then he notices something reflected in the glass of the 
           frame: a reflection of a man behind him. And at once, the 
           color drains from his voice.

                                 MAX
                        ...jesus, Coleman.

           Max’s hand JERKS into his jacket for his gun--

                                 CRISTO (O.S.)
                        Bad idea. Take it out, toss it 
                        across the floor, turn around.
           Max, seething, does as told. Then turns around, they meet 
           each other’s gaze. Cristo giving Max that pitiless smile he’s 
           been practicing in his dreams.

                                 MAX
                        Wow. Wow. Perkins, Pheng, now me. 
                        And I thought I had a busy week.

           Max eyes the auto-cannon Cristo’s got in hand.

                                 CRISTO
                        Why’d you do it?

                                 MAX
                             (after a beat)
                        Because you were a cancer on my 
                        life. And you can’t begrudge a 
                        cancer patient for getting chemo.

                                 CRISTO
                        Sure you can, Max. 

           Max is refusing to give him the thing he wants: fear.

                                 MAX
                        ...got you pretty good though, 
                        didn’t I?

                                 CRISTO
                        You were on a roll there for a 
                        while. Part where you told Elise I 
                        was dead? That was my favorite. 

                                 MAX
                        Hey, I tried to give her time to 
                        get over it, but she kept sending 
                        you those goddamn messages. But 
                        you’d be amazed how much one little 
                        news story can facilitate things. 

           Cristo keeps his rapidly boiling anger in check. 

                                 MAX
                        Let me tell you, though: once she 
                        got the green light? Whoah. No 
                        stopping her. Was like a starving 
                        dog getting its jaws on a t-bone. 
                             (off his building rage)
                        The things she’d ask me to do to 
                        her, just... filthy. And that’s 
                        coming from me.

           Cristo, losing it, SHOVES THE GUN INTO MAX’S FOREHEAD. Max’s 
           smile gets even wider. At least until Cristo says:
                                 CRISTO
                        An old friend once told me that 
                        absolution doesn’t come in the form 
                        of a bullet.

                                 MAX
                        ...hell’s that supposed to mean?

           BAM! Cristo PISTOL WHIPS HIM hard enough to turn teeth to 
           chalk dust and sends him SPLAYING ACROSS THE ROOM. Max hits 
           the floor rolling as Cristo HOLSTERS his gun, then lunges in--

           WA-BOOM! Max catches him in the gut with his robo-prosthetic 
           arm, pinballs him through a tall ceramic sculpture, rushes to 
           grab his tossed-away gun. Gets a hand on it, just as Cristo 
           springs at him, sending their bodies sailing through the--

           GLASS WALL OVERLOOKING THROUGH LIVING ROOM

           --we follow them through the haze of falling shards as they 
           drop and SLAM HARD into the floor with a WHUMPH, gun sliding 
           away from them, under the couch. 

           Sucking wind, both men find their feet... then come at each 
           other. Unstoppable force, meet immovable object. Grudge match 
           of the titans. Tearing into each other in a house-destroying 
           brawl, locked in mortal combat, damn well getting their 
           money’s worth out of their prosthetics, until--

           WHAM! Cristo pins Max’s arms with his knees, straddles him, 
           wraps his hands around his throat... and squeezes. Waiting to 
           hear his esophagus go snap-crackle-pop. Max, face losing 
           color, struggles, but it’s no use. This is about to end, when-

                                 ELISE (O.S.)
                        STOP.

           Everything freezes. It’s Elise -- in the doorway, looking 
           ghostly pale, out of breath, scared, but standing her ground.

                                 ELISE
                        Let go of him.

                                 MAX
                        --uh oh, plot thickens--

           Cristo doesn’t let go, still choking Max’s throat.

                                 ELISE
                        Stop it--

                                 CRISTO
                        That what you came here for, to 
                        protect him?
                                 ELISE
                        Not him. You.
                             (off his look)
                        I know who you are, Coleman... and 
                        this isn’t it.

           A long beat. Despite his circumstances, Max can’t hide his 
           gleeful grin. Until Cristo levels a gaze at him that would 
           make Hannibal Lecter shiver... and tightens his grip.

                                 CRISTO
                        You got the only family I ever had. 
                        And ten years of my life. And her. 
                        And you know what I get? 
                             (tightens further)
                        I get to see the look on your face 
                        right now.

           Max’s eyes bulge, his body spasms, skin going purple until--

           Cristo suddenly LETS GO. Bounces Max’s head off the ground. 
           Climbs off him, as Max rolls over, gasping for air on his 
           hands and knees, looking over his shoulder to see...

           ...Cristo -- taking out his phone and dialing a number. Max’s 
           face goes wan as we hear a faint ROBOTIC VOICE pick up:

                                 ROBOTIC VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Emergency services, state your--

                                 CRISTO
                        I’m holding a fugitive in custody.

           Elise looks to Cristo, not quite believing what she’s seeing.

                                 CRISTO (INTO PHONE)
                        Villa 33, Amalfi Elevated Estates--

                                 MAX
                        --don’t do this--

                                 CRISTO
                        Sorry, Max.

           We see where Max’s eyes are focused: on the GUN, the one that 
           slid under the couch, just a foot or two in front of him.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t-- do well when cornered--

                                 CRISTO
                        Then you’re really gonna hate where 
                        you’re going--

                                 ROBOTIC VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Estimated response time--
           WHOOSH-BLAM! With prosthetic-enhanced strength and speed, Max 
           grabs hold of the couch-base and HURLS IT OVER HIS HEAD, 
           knocking Cristo on his back and sliding across the floor, as 
           Max snatches the gun and FIRES, bullets shredding through the 
           still-sliding couch as Cristo rolls to get out of the way--

           --and a bullet SEARS across Cristo’s torso, bringing blood, 
           sending him crumpling to the floor and crying out as--

           --Elise scrambles to pull him up, only to get YANKED AWAY by 
           Max, stuffing the gun to her temple as--

           --in the distance, SIRENS RISE. Coming in fast. Max, gun up, 
           using Elise as a shield, backs towards the door out to--

           THE FRONT DRIVEWAY

           --where he stuffs her into the passenger seat of her car, 
           climbing in through the driver’s side door, FIRES UP the 
           repulsors and BANK-TURNS out of the driveway as behind them--

           CRISTO

           ...moving as fast as his prosthetics allow -- which is to say 
           fucking fast -- rushes toward the departing vehicle. Back 
           where he started: fleeing the McCormick Mansion to the sound 
           of sirens. Only this time, hell couldn’t stand in his way. 

                                 CRISTO
                        MAX--

           He gains ground, coming after the car as it TAKES OFF, 
           joining the midnight air-traffic below as--

           --Cristo LEAPS onto the tall adobe wall around the villa, 
           racing along, eyes locked on the car 100 feet beneath as 
           WHOOSH WHOOSH! Above Cristo, POLICE AIR CRUISERS swoop in, 
           spotlights hitting him, voices coming over the loudspeakers:

                                 COP VOICES
                        PUT THE WEAPON DOWN! HANDS UP!

           Cristo BOLTS FASTER, builds up a furious head of steam and--

           HURLS HIMSELF OFF THE VILLA WALL

           ...soaring out over the smoggy neon abyss, legs kicking in 
           the air, arms pinwheeling...

           ...and BAM! He touches down on the security dome of the 
           neighboring estate, a half “block” away, impact shooting out 
           ripples of static everywhere as he ROLLS and SKIDS...

           Stands, gasping, eyes whirring, as he squints down into the 
           SKY FUNNEL, where earthbound traffic descends in vertical 
           columns of light. Catches a glimpse of Max’s car entering the 
           funnel, about to vanishing into the mass of vehicles.
                                 CRISTO
                        No--

           WHOOSH! He THROWS HIMSELF down the dome, barely able to get 
           his legs under him as his momentum hits critical mass and--

           SPRINGS FORWARD 

           --off the dome, seconds before he’d otherwise go dropping off 
           into the void, arcing forward through the air--

           --BOUNCE-SKIMMING across the roof of a limo-style transporter 
           below, hanging on tight as the vehicle goes down into...

           THE SKY FUNNEL

           ...whirring down through this elevator shaft made of pale 
           white light, stacked traffic sinking towards earth beneath 
           him, upward-heading traffic ROARING PAST behind him.

           Dripping sweat, trembling with adrenaline, he clings to the 
           roof of the vehicle as we PULL BACK TO SEE--

           --he’s only four vehicles above Elise and Max, all of them 
           trapped together in the traffic funnel as we SMASH TO:

           INT. CRISTO’S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           ABRASIVE PROTO-PUNK plays on Cristo’s penthouse stereo. On 
           the hologram-TV screen across the room, THE NEWS is on mute. 
           Kip’s stacking money, getting ready to skip town.

                                 KIP
                        Fire me? Bollocks, you’re fired--

           Kip HAULS a heavy cash-case over to the door, when he 
           suddenly stops. Something on the news catches his eye: drone-
           cam footage of Max, in Elise’s car, speeding out of the 
           descent funnel... and just for an instant, Kip sees CRISTO 
           HOLDING ONTO THE ROOF OF A CAR BEHIND THEM. 

                                 KIP
                        ...Jesus...

           Kip looks from the TV, to the money, frozen, as we CUT TO:

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           In Elise’s car, Max steers, Barely 100 feet off the ground, a 
           SPEEDING METRO AIR-TRAIN whooshing past as-- 

           KA-BLAM! A human shape comes pinwheeling onto the roof the 
           train beside him. Skidding, tumbling, lunging to its feet--
                                 MAX
                        Are. You. KIDDING ME?

           Cristo. Riding neck and neck with Max, on the train roof. 
           WHIRRRRRR! Max mashes the pedal, cuts across three lanes of 
           air-traffic, trying to fight his way upward as--

           CRISTO

           --races along the top of the metro-line, SLIDES to avoid 
           overhead signage, pops back up and takes a LONG-DISTANCE JUMP 
           over the street, toward a HOTEL...

           ...with a GLASS ELEVATOR rising up its exterior. WHAM! Cristo 
           tumbles into the elevator roof, shocked PASSENGERS looking up 
           at the WARPED METAL CEILING inside, as our guy rides upwards, 
           getting ready to make his next move as...

           INSIDE MAX’S CAR

           --Max JERKS the wheel left and right, trying to fight his way 
           higher through traffic, almost out of the thick of it when--

           CRUNCH! Cristo tumbles onto the hood, holds on with one hand, 
           gun aimed, having just vaulted from the elevator to the car. 
           A Mexican stand-off through the windshield.

                                 CRISTO
                        Set it down.

                                 MAX
                        My pleasure.

           WHRRRR! Max JERKS THE CAR SIDEWAYS, Cristo LOSES THE GUN, but 
           manages to grab hold of the hood with both hands, its lid 
           POPPING OPEN under his weight, body dangling over the 
           glittering city below, straining, kicking, before--

           --he DYNO-THROWS himself at the ENGINE, grabs on with one 
           hand, RIPS OUT THE GLOWING REPULSOR LINES with the other as--

           INSIDE THE CAR

           --the dash-screens FLASH WORDS: “POWER FAILURE -- INITIATING 
           EMERGENCY LANDING”, the car going into emergency auto-pilot--

                                 MAX
                        Sonofabitch!--

           OUTSIDE THE CAR

           Cristo clings to the grill for dear life as the vehicle makes 
           a SWOOPING SPEEDY DESCENT, repulsors FLICKERING and SHORTING 
           OUT as they spiral in for a SCREECHING, LANDING atop...
           EXT. MCCORMICK TOWER, LOBBY ROOF - NIGHT

           ...a familiar place: the glass roof of the McCormick lobby. 
           SHOCKLINES shoot out from the car’s impact point. Cristo gets 
           THROWN FREE of the hood as it touches down, his body tumbling 
           along the panels of thick glass, skipping like a stone--

           --skidding straight toward the edge of the roof. Ahead of 
           him, the long, steep slope of a GLASS AWNING, shooting down 
           80 degrees and ending in an abyssal drop toward the city. If 
           he goes over, he’s goulash. He tries to dig in with his feet 
           to slow his skid as Elise screams from the car--

                                 ELISE
                        COLEMAN!

           HE TUMBLES OVER THE EDGE... but not quite. Body hanging 
           halfway on the roof, half on the awning. Like a bug ascending 
           a slippery windshield, he tries to pull himself up as...

           IN THE CAR

           Elise rips away her safety belt as Max, thrown askew in his 
           seat from the crash, reaches for his dropped handgun, as--

           --Elise GRABS IT, Max struggles to wrestle the gun away as 
           BLAM! The gun goes off -- Max takes a round in his foot. He 
           SCREECHES in pain, Elise scrambles out of the car--

                                 ELISE
                        HANG ON COLE--

           WHAM! Max LUNGES AFTER HER and tackles her. She whirls at him 
           with the gun, pulls the trigger again... and CLICK! Empty. He 
           SWATS the gun away and pulls her in, elbow around her throat.

                                 MAX
                        Hey Coleman, wanna see what happens 
                        when I do this?

           BAM! Max SLAMS HIS ROBO-PROSTHETIC FIST into the glass 
           ceiling. SHOCKLINES spread like ice cracking over a pond. 
           Beneath them, a 300 foot drop to the marble lobby floor. 

                                 MAX
                             (lifts his fist again)
                        See that?

                                 ELISE
                             (voice choked)
                        Don’t do this--

                                 MAX
                        I’m sorry. He doesn’t get to win.
           WHIR-CRASH! Max HAMMERS his fist down at the glass, making 
           the bodies on it JUMP like kernels in a frying pan. We WHOOSH 
           UPWARD to see the whole surface is criss-crossed with 
           spiderweb-like cracks. Cristo’s eyes whir for an escape, sees 
           only hundreds of feet of fracturing surface all around them.

                                 CRISTO
                        What do you want, Max?

                                 MAX
                        I want you to beg my forgiveness. 
                        Can you do that, Coleman?

           The same question from all those years ago. Cristo pauses... 
           because he sees something: 100 feet up, his AUTO-PISTOL. 
           Dropped askew on an executive-balcony railing.

                                 MAX 
                        I said CAN YOU DO THAT?--

           WHAM! Max wallops the glass, the shockwave runs up the 
           building, makes the gun TEETER. Cristo looks to Elise, trying 
           to communicate a message with his eyes -- get ready -- then 
           locks his gaze onto Max. And says two words:

                                 CRISTO
                        You first.

           Max’s face -- fine, die. He BASHES THE BEJEESUS out of the 
           glass... and the impact KNOCKS THE GUN OFF THE LEDGE. 

           Sailing out over our heroes below...

           Max rearing back to swing again...

           As Cristo PLUCKS THE GUN FROM THE AIR--

           --and UNLOADS AT MAX before his fist can come down. Bullets 
           sew up his body, the breath catches in Max’s throat... 

           ...and his grip releases from Elise’s wrist. She’s on her 
           feet in a second flat. 

                                 CRISTO
                        GO!

           SPRINTING she goes toward Cristo, as behind her--

           --Max, with his dying strength, throws one last punch--

           ...and there’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back. RAMP 
           DOWN INTO SUPER SLO-MO, as the following things happen in eye-
           popping succession:
           --The surfaces ATOMIZES beneath Max. He seems to FLOAT in the 
           sea of shards, before it DROPS 300 FEET DOWN TO THE LOBBY 
           FLOOR with a wet WHUMPH. His car SMASHES DOWN a beat later, 
           bouncing and rolling onto him as--

           --A WAVE OF FALLING GLASS goes shooting out in all directions 
           from the break-point above as--

           --Cristo LUNGES at Elise, grabbing her tight and HURLING 
           THEIR BODIES off the roof and onto the downward slope of the 
           long glass awning, milliseconds before the surface behind 
           them vaporizes into airborne crystals.

           --Sliding down the awning they go. Chased by a fast-moving 
           tide of falling glass as--

           --just ahead, they see it: A METAL SUPPORT BEAM connecting 
           the sloped glass to the roof below, just as--

           WHOOSH! The fall-wave catches up with them and they’re no 
           longer sliding but FLYING THROUGH SHARD-STREWN SPACE...

           BAM! Cristo’s hand slams down on the metal support beam, 
           catching hold, still holding onto Elise’s wrist with the 
           other, now 200 feet above the marble floor--

                                 ELISE
                        Holyshit--holyshit--

                                 CRISTO
                        Don’tletgo-- don’t--

           KA-BOOM! Below in the lobby, the destroyed vehicle ERUPTS IN 
           FLAMES, fireball turning the world beneath their feet a 
           blossoming orange. Elise SCREAMS.

           His sweat-slick hand starts to slip on the beam...

           Gravity sucking at them both, struggling to hang on... 

           Their eyes lock on each other...

           And suddenly, there’s a GUST OF WIND blowing at them.

                                 KIP (O.S.)
                        Hang on!

           Eyes lighting up, Cristo and Elise look up to see--

           KIP

           --at the wheel of the air-cruiser, replusors blasting as he 
           gets beneath them, delivering them from doom as we CUT TO:
           EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAWN

           Dawn. The sun rises above an abandoned freeway as we dip 
           below an overpass to find the three outside the car, Cristo 
           trading his destroyed shirt for Kip’s jacket, Kip mid-story:

                                 KIP
                        There I was, back at the penthouse, 
                        about to jump in the jacuzzi, then 
                        I saw you on the telly and I’m all 
                        “Kip to the rescue!” and then--

                                 CRISTO
                        Kip?

           Kip looks over at him. Cristo hands him a scanner-key.

                                 CRISTO
                        You’ve earned your cut.
                             (holds onto the key)
                        But I got one last job for you.

           Cristo murmurs it to him, and Kip’s eyes widen in disbelief. 
           Then, shaking his head, Kip sticks out his hand.

                                 KIP
                        Been good knowing you, Robo-Legs.

                                 CRISTO
                        You too, Kip.

           They shake. Kip climbs into the car, and as it departs...

                                 ELISE
                        ...so what now, Mr. Cristo?

                                 CRISTO
                        I’m considering a name-change.

                                 ELISE
                        Interesting. You know, I’ve always 
                        been biased toward “Coleman”...

                                 CRISTO
                        “Coleman.” I can do that.

                                 ELISE
                        Are you sure?

           It takes a moment before he realizes she’s serious. He thinks 
           for a beat... and a little smile slowly emerges on his face.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Long time ago, somebody told me...
           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Just as we saw in the very beginning: water running from a 
           faucet. Coleman puts his dirty, beat-up, blood-specked hands 
           under the flow, lets the grime spiral away as we hear his VO:

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        “You’re born what you are, you die 
                        what you are, and everything else 
                        is just noise.”

           CUT TO: THE BATHROOM MIRROR

           Coleman takes out his CONTACTS. Lurid blue irises going back 
           to their natural brown. Takes a RAZOR to his lathered facial 
           hair, his old face gradually reemerging. 

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        But that’s not the truth.

           CUT TO: A METAL TRASH CAN

           A stack of immaculate SUITS gets tossed in, doused with 
           lighter fluid, set ablaze. Coleman watches the flames dance.

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        No one’s born to be anything but 
                        what they choose to be.

           CUT TO: A FLASHY SPORTS CAR

           Kip hops out in front of a modest storefront -- the MCCORMICK 
           FAVELA FOUNDATION. Delivers an envelope to the harried 
           RECEPTIONIST. As he exits, the envelope gets opened: the 
           foundation has just been given an 8-billion supra donation.

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        And sometimes all they need is a 
                        chance to be better.

           CUT TO: A BLACK MUSTANG

           Coleman, now looking very much like himself, drives along in 
           one of Gregor’s old cars, Elise at his side. Sun glints off 
           her locket necklace. Wind whispers in the coastal trees.

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        What they do with it is up to them.

           CUT TO: A CABIN OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN

           The setting sun bathes the coast in gold. Coleman and Elise, 
           in silhouette, on the deck. Phantom figures in the dusk.

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        The die is not cast.
                                                             SNAP TO BLACK.
