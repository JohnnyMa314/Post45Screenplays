           EXT. COFFEE SHOP- MORNING OF A WORK DAY

           A girl smokes a cigarette and types away ENGROSSED on her 
           iPhone. This is CHARLIE (29, quick witted, cute without much 
           effort). She finishes and throws the butt on the ground.

           ANGLE on a older woman at an outside table JUDGEMENTALLY 
           looking at Charlie. They catch eyes. Charlie smiles and picks 
           up the cigarette to throw it in the garbage. 

           INSIDE THE COFFEE SHOP

           Charlie walks in and up to her best friend BETSY (late 20’s, 
           fun, flighty, no filter) who’s also typing on her phone.

           Betsy turns to Charlie and talks through her teeth. She tries 
           to be casual but she’s smiling really big so it just looks 
           sorta creepy.

                                 BETSY
                             (gritted teeth)
                        Yo, play it cool but there’s a cute 
                        guy that keeps eyeing me. 2 
                        o’clock. No, wait, 3. Ok fuck, no 
                        it’s definitely 2.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop smiling like that, you look 
                        creepy.

           Betsy attempts to stop smiling but now her lips are pursed 
           strangely and it looks just as bad.

                                 BETSY
                             (not moving her mouth)
                        How’s this? 2’clock. Look now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He can’t hear us, just talk 
                        normally.

                                 BETSY
                        Ok.

           Charlie casually looks over.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s cute. But what’s he drinking? 
                        It’s 8AM dude. What are you, 12?

           ANGLE on a guy sipping a Frappuccino with whipped cream.

                                 BETSY
                        Get off you high ass.
                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s not the saying.

           Betsy looks over again. Fuck, he caught her. Wait, he’s 
           smiling. Now he’s walking over.

                                 BARISTA
                        Charlie!

           Charlie walks to the counter for her drink as the guy 
           approaches Betsy. The guy and Betsy talk near Charlie but you 
           can’t hear what they’re saying. 

           She fixes her drink and looks up just as the guy and Betsy 
           are saying goodbye. It’s a weird handshake into hug with a 
           kiss on the cheek hybrid. Awkward.

           Betsy walks back up to Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Talk to me.

                                 BETSY
                        His name is Matt. He works as a 
                        paralegal at Hoffman and Steinberg.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Perfect. Call me when you get to 
                        work.

           INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE- LATER THAT MORNING.

           Charlie sits behind her computer in a small office. It’s 
           decorated pretty hip. A BANKSY print hangs on her wall.

           She’s on the phone with Betsy. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You ready to get into it?

           INT. OFFICE- CUBICLE- SAME TIME

           Betsy sits in a fairly small cubicle. Various different CHIA 
           pets are at her desk.

                                 BETSY
                        Maybe don’t do a check up.

           WE INTERCUT THE PHONE CALL BETWEEN BOTH PLACES.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Shut up.

                                 BETSY
                        Ugh, fine. Tell me everything.

           Charlie GOOGLES: “Matt”, “Hoffman & Steinberg” and 
           “paralegal.” A list comes up. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, there’s like 15 different 
                        Matt’s coming up at this company. 
                        This may take a sec.

                                 BETSY
                        I’m here. Waiting on eggshells.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t, think you’re using that 
                        phrase correctly. 

           Charlie types more. There’s an ARTFULNESS to her searching. 

           We see a PICTURE of Matt on GOOGLE IMAGES. She matches it 
           with FACEBOOK.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Jack. Mutha Fuckin. Pot.

                                 BETSY
                        You’re the Queen. Talk to me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit. His profile’s private. Gotta 
                        use my hacking skills.

                                 BETSY
                        You’re like “Murder She Wrote.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Except for the not at all part.

           Charlie’s on Matt’s Facebook page. She makes DISAPPOINTED 
           faces and sounds as she scans through pictures.

           She stops on a picture, leans in to look closer.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, fuckity fuck.

                                 BETSY
                        What? What what what what?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, right now I’m staring at a 
                        shirtless picture of this dude at a 
                        pool in Vegas.

                                 BETSY
                        Ok...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Drinking one of those huge douchey  
                        drinks with the twisty straws.

                                 BETSY
                        Eesh...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Standing next to Joe fucking 
                        Francis, the “Girls Gone Wild” 
                        tool, and they’re in the midst of a 
                        bro-shake...

           ANGLE on PICTURE of Matt and Joe Francis making DOUCHEY kissy 
           faces. Caption beneath reads “Bro’in it out with my Bro Bro. 
           Who wants a Bro-jito?”

                                 BETSY
                        Are they making those kissy faces?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. Guess you have to change his 
                        name in your phone to “Don’t 
                        Answer.”

                                 BETSY
                        How many “Don’t Answers” do you 
                        have?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Me? Uh, does “Annoying” and “Don’t 
                        Fucking Pick Up” count? 

                                 BETSY
                        Yeah.

           She looks at her phone.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like, 12. But for good reasons. 

                                 BETSY
                        Sometimes, I just wish you weren’t 
                        such an amazing cyber stalker. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s not stalking Bets. I can’t 
                        help that I have these God given 
                        skills of research. It’s like a 
                        super power. If you could fly, 
                        would you just be like “eh, fuck 
                        it. I’ll just stay here on the 
                        ground. I think I’ll walk to the 
                        store.” Fuck no you wouldn’t. 

                                 BETSY
                        It’s not natural to know everything 
                        about someone beforehand.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure it is. This is the age we live 
                        in. I’m just smarter cause I’m 
                        weeding through the bullshit for 
                        everyone. 

                                 BETSY
                        Yeah. Well, sometimes, when one 
                        door closes, there’s, a window, you 
                        didn’t, leave open, but someone, 
                        comes into it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That sounds like a rapist.

                                 BETSY
                        Just trying to be helpful. Love ya. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Love ya.

           They hang up. Betsy sadly changes his name to “Don’t Answer.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           We HEAR..

           SONG: “SHOWER SCENE SILVER SCREEN” by FELIX DA HOUSECAT.

           (Why don’t you go put on that song to get you in the groove?)

           The hand types a name into GOOGLE. A list of websites comes 
           up as we..

                                                                CUT TO:
           CLOSE up on a DIFFERENT pair of hands, this time SEARCHING 
           the internet on an IPHONE. A NAME is searched. All different 
           links come up; FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE, LINKED-IN, etc. The hand 
           SCROLLS through the links as we...

           we jump to..

           A HAND moving a computer mouse to UNFRIEND a person on

           We dive into different websites, searching PEOPLE, scrolling

           INT. YOGURT SHOPPE-EVENING

           Charlie, Betsy, and MEG (30, level-headed, confident) TASTE 
           various flavors at the machines. Charlie holds a bunch of 
           different samples.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is it wrong if I just eat like 10 
                        sample cups instead of buying it?

                                 MEG
                        Wow, this shit is not fat free. 

                                 BETSY
                        Well not when it ends up looking 
                        like mine. Boo-yah!

           ANGLE on Betsy’s yogurt. It looks like a 5 year old made it.

           Tons of flavors are covered in Caramel, sprinkles, cereal, 
           fruit, gummy bears. It’s a mess.
                                 CHARLIE
                        How old are you?

                                 BETSY
                        Stoned.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jealous. 

                                 MEG
                        You guys need to stop getting high 
                        all the time.

                                 BETSY
                             (thinking)
                        I’m totally gonna stop when I’m 
                        pregnant. Duh. But then, when my 
                        kids are old enough, I’ll be like 
                        “Your father and I are going to the 
                        store, stay here!” And then me and 
                        my husband will sneak into the 
                        garage, and put on old records and 
                        roll a joint and talk about the 
                        good old days. Before we had STUPID 
                        kids. And bills and a mortgage. And 
                        then my kids will be like, 
                        “something smells funny”, and 
                        they’ll come outside, and the 
                        garage door will slowly start 
                        opening, and I’ll be like “Keith, 
                        put the joint out!” And I’m 
                        spraying Febreeze like crazy, but 
                        then our kids come in and they’re 
                        like “Mommy, why does it smell like 
                        skunk in here?” and I’m like “Get 
                        inside the house RIGHT now!” but 
                        meanwhile we’re hiding behind the 
                        car and our kids are like “we know 
                        you’re in here!” And the fan isn’t 
                        working and it’s so hot in the 
                        garage, and I’m like “why didn’t 
                        you buy a new fan Keith?!” and he’s 
                        getting mad at me and he’s like 
                        “you always got a million lists of 
                        things for me to do. I’m SO SORRY I 
                        didn’t get to buying a fan for the 
                        garage!” He can be such a dick 
                        sometimes.

                                 MEG
                        You need to stop talking.

           Betsy listens like a child.
                                 BETSY
                        Ok.

           Charlie spots an acquaintance JANE (late 20’s, pretentious, 
           overdressed) getting in line.

                                 JANE
                        Oh my gosh, Charles in Charge, how 
                        are you sweets?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jane, hey, what’s up?

           They hug. It’s not very genuine.

                                 JANE
                             (to Meg and Betsy)
                        Hi ladies.

                                 MEG AND BETSY
                        Hey. Hi. 

           They don’t look excited to see her. Well, Betsy just looks 
           INCREDIBLY high. She stares and eats her yogurt slowly.

                                 JANE
                             (to Charlie)
                        I feel like it’s totes fate we 
                        bumped in. Marni was telling me 
                        about these “check ups” you do for 
                        everyone?

           Jane does air quotes on “check ups”. It’s condescending. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, yeah. Well not everyone, just 
                        like close friends and stuff.

                                 JANE
                        Nuts-ville. I was actually hoping 
                        mabes you could do one for me? I 
                        met this guy rece and he seems 
                        totes perf, so obvi it makes me 
                        think he’s got mad bags, ya know?

           Charlie tries to understand what the fuck she’s saying.

                                 CHARLE
                        Yeah?

                                 JANE
                        So, how much do you charge?

           Jane pulls her wallet out of her pretentiously MASSIVE purse. 
           Betsy makes FACES behind Jane’s back. She thinks she’s 
           funnier than she is.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh my gosh, no no. This is just 
                        something I do for my friends, it’s 
                        really not a big deal. 

                                 JANE
                        Wow, so nice. Ok, so his name is 
                        Evan. He’s like 30. Met him at a 
                        party. He’s gorge. Totes my steez.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ah, ok. Any other info?

                                 JANE
                        Uhm, he works at a youth center 
                        around here. I wasn’t really 
                        listening. I think the name has 
                        “happiness” or “bright” or 
                        something in it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cool. Well, I’ll call you in a few 
                        days and let you know what I find.

           Jane puts her hand on Charlie’s shoulder. 

                                 JANE
                        Thanks so much sweets. You’re cray 
                        amay. Bye lades. Joy the lofe gurt 
                        on this perf sum eve.

           Jane walks away with her annoyingly perfect ass.

                                 MEG
                        What the fuck did she just say?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have no idea. 

                                 BETSY
                        You’re not gonna do it right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, not for her. She’s a chode. 

                                 MEG
                        You need to stop doing those. 
                        They’re unhealthy. You’re addicted.
                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not addicted. It’s just a 
                        little screening process. Who 
                        cares? Why waste your time with 
                        someone when you don’t have to?

                                 BETSY
                        She’s kinda right. Remember those 
                        YouTube clips she found of 
                        Jonathan? His stand-up gave me the 
                        awkward tingles.

                        did years ago.

                                 BETSY
                        I once let a valet guy squeeze my 
                        bare breast for free parking. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know Bets. I was there. And you 
                        actually tea bagged his face with 
                        your boobs. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT- FLASHBACK

           A SMALL foreign Valet parker sits in the passenger seat of 
           Betsy’s car. She’s leaned over with her breasts on his face. 

                                 BETSY (V.O)
                        Oh yeah. That was so weird.

                        two years ago, at your cousin’s Bar 
                        Mitzvah.

           EXT.-PARKING LOT- FLASHBACK

           The Valet’s face is almost totally OBSTRUCTED by Betsy’s 
           breasts. His words are muffled from it.

                        Oh, right. Eduardo. We still text!

           Charlie and Meg stare at Betsy for a beat.

                                 MEG
                        Anyway, that’s life Charlie. You 
                        get to know someone and take that 
                        chance. It can be fun, believe it 
                        or not.

           The girls pay for their yogurt. Charlie spots an OLD couple 
           at a table, holding hands, eating yogurt totally in LOVE.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I want what they have. 

           She NODS over to the couple. The girls look on wistfully for 
           a moment, Betsy is ESPECIALLY wistful, or high. Hard to tell.

           The old man WIPES off a bit of yogurt on the woman’s cheek 
           and KISSES her, then again, and, whoa, is he licking the 
           yogurt off her face? Now they’re MAKING OUT, a LOT. It’s 
           gross.  

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe, not exactly, what that is.

           JEWELRY line. She types away. She runs the company’s SOCIAL 
           MEDIA.

           She contemplates, then CLOSES the Twitter window. Gets on 
           GOOGLE. Types “Evan”, “Youth Center” and “Brighter.”

           ANGLE on an ONLINE NEWS ARTICLE titled “Future’s Looking 
           Bright” about “THE BRIGHTER FUTURE” youth center.

           PICTURE at the top is a SMOKING hot guy surrounded by kids, 
           one is SITTING in his LAP. They’re in the midst of a HUGE 
           hearty laugh. It’s a little overboard. 

           The CAPTION beneath reads “Youth Center Events Director Evan 
           Beckett shares a laugh with some of the kids.”

                        Are those women’s jeans? 

                                 TUCKER
                        No, they’re skinny. I’m fine. Go.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, I’m doing a “check up” on a guy 
                        for this acquaintance, aaaand he’s 
                        perfect for me.

                                 TUCKER
                        What makes you think you’re perfect 
                        for each other?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, scratch that. He’s perfect. 
                        His smile, his, face, ughhh, I 
                        wanna date him. It’s happening. 
                        It’s so fucking happening. 

                                 TUCKER
                        And what are you going to tell this 
                        acquaintance?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll figure it out. She sucks, so I 
                        don’t feel bad. She definitely 
                        doesn’t deserve him. 

                                 TUCKER
                        Ok, lemme see.

           He AWKWARDLY walks over to her computer to look at a picture.

                                 TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Damn, I’m getting a broner. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (a bit disgusted)
                        A what?

                                 TUCKER
                        I don’t, I was just, ya know, I’m 
                        straight but, I can appreciate a 
                        hot guy, ya know? Whatever, I don’t 
                        actually have an erection. I just, 
                        heard it somewh-forget it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t, say that anymore. To anyone.

           He nods. He looks at the picture again.

                                 TUCKER
                        Those cheekbones should be illegal. 
                        Am I right?

           She looks at him again, like “what are you even saying?”

                                 TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Well, keep me posted. You deserve 
                        to meet someone amazing. You’re a 
                        catch.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks.

           Tucker leaves and Charlie immediately dials her phone.

           Jane sits in a pedicure chair reading OK! Magazine. She picks 
           up her cell.

                                 JANE

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S LIVING ROOM- NIGHT TIME

           Charlie sits with Betsy in pajama pants and old ripped up t-
           shirts. Betsy is FILLING up a huge bong. 

                                 BETSY
                        Ok, 20 grand, you adopt, like 15 
                        ferrets, for a year.

           Betsy LIGHTS the bong up for herself.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can I tell people it’s for a bet?

                                 BETSY
                             (exhaling smoke)
                        Fuck no. And you have to like, 
                        pretend you really love them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A year? No, 20 grand is nothing. 
                        Ferrets are gross. And ferret 
                        people are super creepy. And this 
                        is like a meaty year of my life.

           Betsy passes the bong to Charlie. She lights it up.

                                 BETSY
                        How bout 50 grand? But then you 
                        have to wear like silk screened 
                        shirts with pictures of them on it 
                        at least once a week.

           Charlie exhales.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No way. All the money would go to 
                        keeping those fuckers alive.

                        grand. After taxes, right?

           Meg bursts through the front door holding trays.

                                 MEG
                        Some help?

           Charlie jumps up to help. Betsy looks up from the couch.

                                 BETSY
                        What is it? I want it!

           She CLENCHES her fists in and out like a child.

                        I’m doing next weekend. Who loves 
                        ya?

                                 BETSY
                        You’re the best ever! I just bought 
                        the greatest Panini maker on the 
                        planet. Will make us some?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bets, are you serious? I thought we 
                        talked about no more infomercial 
                        products. You don’t even cook.

                                 BETSY
                        The woman in the commercial made it 
                        look SO easy. I can literally put 
                        ANYTHING into a Panini. You’re 
                        telling me you don’t want that 
                        option?!

                        It’s not a big deal.

           The TALKING BASS and other lame products hand on the WALL.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Really? I think it’s at like 
                        intervention level. 
           A GAZELLE is stuffed into a corner PILED with laundry. A 
           printed picture of TONY LITTLE with a thought bubble that 
           says “Get off your ass and RIDE me bitch!” hangs on it.

           Betsy PEELS back the foil on the trays.

                                 BETSY
                        Good. They used me as a model in 3 
                        stock photos today. My boss said 
                        the company’s gonna have to start 
                        paying me extra.

                        I did, “Girl Upset by Sexting,”

           explains each one.

                        about to blow your minds.

           The girls look over intrigued.

                                 BETSY
                        I love getting my mind blown, like, 
                        so much.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I found my soulmate. Jane’s dude. I 
                        did a checkup and, he’s fucking 
                        perfect.

                                 BETSY
                        YOU found nothing wrong with him?
                                 CHARLIE
                        No, he’s literally perfect.

                                 MEG
                        But you don’t know him?

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I will. Soon. Ok, so no 
                        judgement zone, would it be like 
                        creepy fatal attraction style if I 
                        try and kept him for myself?

                                 BETSY
                             (excitedly)
                        Maybe it was fate that you came 
                        across him? It’s like a modern day 
                        fairy tale!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Here’s the thing though. He’s like 
                        into macrobiotics, and yoga, and 
                        recycling.

                                 BETSY
                        You bring extra garbage to the 
                        movies just to throw it out on the 
                        floor.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It just feels so good.

                                 MEG
                        Ok, so it sounds like he’s not 
                        perfect for you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh no, he is. But more like 
                        perfect, for who I want to be. Will 
                        be.

                                 BETSY
                        What do you mean will be?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, obviously I’m crazy good at 
                        finding things out about people. So 
                        I’ll just use my internet talents 
                        as a little assistance, a kick 
                        start really. Just, ya know find 
                        out his likes and interests, places 
                        he frequents. Then, maybe bump into 
                        him a few times. See how it plays 
                        out. After that, it’s all me.
                                 MEG
                        This is bad idea.

                        I get it Meg, ok? I get it. But 
                        listen. This guy is fucking 
                        perfect. And he’s just walking 
                        around out there as we speak, 
                        living his life. Buying socks, or 
                        even getting out of the shower...

           Evan is exiting his shower, in SLO-MO, body glistening, it’s 
           sort of glowing around him.

                        And I can’t just sit around here 
                        now, knowing that he exists and not 
                        do shit about it! 

           The fantasy Evan shakes his wet hair out, it’s like some sexy 
           dreamy ad.

                        of him. I get that you’re a lez and 
                        this probably won’t do anything for 
                        you, but here.

           Meg leans in to look at Charlie’s phone.

                        like, high-five God or something. I 
                        didn’t know humans came like that.

                        Don’t do this. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Blah blah blah from the girl 
                        already in love. Betsy, you in?

           SWISH PAN INTO CHARLIE AT HER DESK. 

           Charlie’s on SPEAKERPHONE talking to Betsy.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, so if you go into Google docs, 
                        I started a file for us to share 
                        info we find out. It’ll mostly be 
                        me using it, but it’d be cool if 
                        you start following him on Twitter, 
                        read all his posts, see his 
                        Twitpics, that sorta thing. And 
                        then Foresquare, Yelp, and Linked 
                        in, just to keep up on him.

           INT. PHOTO STUDIO- SAME TIME

           Betsy’s wearing a woman’s business suit and reading glasses 
           while they set up a photo shoot behind her. 

           WE INTERCUT THE CALL BETWEEN BOTH PLACES.

                                 BETSY
                        Hey, I thought of a great idea too. 
                        Remember Doug, my friend that used 
                        to work in law enforcement and 
                        other stuff? I thought he could 
                        help us with the investigating.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, you need to use law 
                        enforcement very loosely. More like 
                        “stuff.” Bets, he’s super creepy 
                        and he’s totally in love with--

                                 BETSY
                             (cutting her off)
                        Bu-bu-bu-bu, he’s on the phone.

           THREE WAY SPLIT SCREEN OF PHONE CALL.
           INT. PARKED CAR -SAME TIME

           DOUG (late 30’s) regular looking dude, sits in the driver 
           seat of his car EATING a bag of fast food.

                                 DOUG
                        Hi Charlie. Listen, I get where 
                        you’re coming from. I’m sittin here 
                        in a 92’ Accord with a mouth full 
                        of waffle fries and an unlicensed 
                        gun in my trunk. But I wanna get 
                        this job done for you.

           Charlie looks pissed and embarrassed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey Doug. Uh, sorry about that. Ok. 
                        Let’s not, call it a job though.

                                 DOUG
                        Tell me what you need from me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think we’re good right now, but 
                        we’ll definitely let you know.

           Doug is chewing loudly into the phone.

                                 DOUG
                        Ok. I got a lot of equipment in my 
                        trunk. Nanny cams, rope, buck 
                        knives, night vision goggles, baby 
                        clothes, snow shoes, girl scout 
                        cookies, latex body suits, whatever 
                        you need.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sounds..good. Thank you.

                                 DOUG
                        I wanna get inside this guy like a 
                        colonoscopy camera. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Too much Doug. 

                                 DOUG
                        Ok, noted. But let’s do this. 

           INT.- PHOTO STUDIO- SAME TIME

           A crew guy walks up to Betsy.
                                 CREW GUY
                        Hey, we’re ready for you.

                                 BETSY
                        Cool, thanks.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 BETSY
                        I’m about to be in a shot. I’ll 
                        give you the deets later. Love ya.

                                 DOUG
                        Betsy, you are my light in a world 
                        which is so dark it can envelope a 
                        man’s soul and bleed him dry. 

                                 BETSY
                             (giggles light heartedly)
                        Doug!

           Charlie looks creeped out. They hang up.

           Betsy walks over to the shot. A guy dressed in a business 
           suit stands off to the side. The PHOTOGRAPHER (late 30’s, 
           pretentious, luxurious hair) walks over to Betsy.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        So first up, we’re doing Sexual 
                        Harassment photo # 3. This is Greg.

           GREG (30’s, Mid western with a warm face) walks up to Betsy 
           and shakes her hand. He was the guy in the suit.

                                 GREG
                        Hi, I’m Greg. Guess I’ll be, 
                        sexually harassing you today?

           Betsy smiles, he’s cute. 

                                 BETSY
                             (giggly and awkward)
                        Yeah, well, I mean, it’s not really 
                        sexual harassment, if you’re into 
                        it right?

           Greg laughs and shrugs, amused by her. 

                                 CREW GUY
                        Ok, places!

           Greg and Betsy get in front of tall bookshelf with a chair in 
           front of it.
                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Ok, girl, stand on the chair like 
                        you’re grabbing a binder. And guy, 
                        I want you standing beneath her, 
                        looking up her skirt.

           They get into position. It’s clearly awkward and 
           uncomfortable. A small BORED crew looks on.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Now girl, look down at guy and let 
                        me just see your mouth slightly 
                        agape, shocked at what’s happening.

           Betsy looks down toward Greg and opens her mouth.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        And guy, let me see your eyes 
                        peering up her skirt, but I want 
                        your fist in your mouth. 

           Greg slowly looks up her skirt and hesitantly puts his fist 
           into his mouth.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful, and we’re off!

           The photographer takes TONS of shots. He’s making WEIRD 
           sounds. A PA walks up and DABS his head with a towel. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Fabulous. That will do. Ok, let’s 
                        take a 5 to set up for the next 
                        shot. Girl? 

           Betsy looks over.

                                 BETSY
                        Me?

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Go change, the next shot is “Woman 
                        confused by Cordless Drill.” 

                                 BETSY
                        Ok.

           Greg and Betsy start to walk off set together.

                                 GREG
                        Well that was officially weird.
                                 BETSY
                        So, since you’ve already seen up my 
                        skirt, what’s next? 

                                 GREG
                        Well, would you wanna grab a drink 
                        sometime?

                                 BETSY
                        Like, alcohol?

                                 GREG
                        Uhm, yeah, of course. 

           He’s entertained by her sweet and flighty personality.

                                 BETSY
                        Totally. Gimme your phone, I’ll put  
                        my number in.

           He hands over her phone, she plugs it in. They smile.

           EXT. CHARLIES OFFICE- DAYTIME

           Charlie is walking toward her office. Tucker catches her.

                                 TUCKER
                        Hey Charlie, I’ve been thinking...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok?

                                 TUCKER
                        I really feel like you should cool 
                        it on the internet searching a bit. 
                        You’re such a great catch and it’s 
                        just stupid to force this whole 
                        thing. You need to find someone 
                        that really fits you, you know? The 
                        old fashioned way.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ve been thinking about it too, 
                        and you’re right Tucker. So thank 
                        you. You’re not only a good boss, 
                        but a good friend.

                                 TUCKER
                        I love ya. Good talk bro.

           He puts his fist out. Charlie hesitantly fist bumps. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t, call women bro.

                                 TUCKER
                        You’re the best.

           Charlie walks into...

           HER OFFICE

           She quickly sits at the computer. Pops opens a document open 
           called “Evan Beckett.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s do this.

           INTERNET RESEARCH MONTAGE

           SONG- “LEARN TO LOSE”- by HOCKEY

           IN HER OFFICE

           Charlie TYPES AWAY on the computer pulling up information 
           about Evan from VARIOUS websites.

           IN HER LIVING ROOM

           Charlie adds to the Google Doc “INTO RAW FOODS AND JUICE 
           CLEANSES.” She’s EATING a bag of Cheetos and dip on her 
           couch. She SLOWLY closes the bag.

           INT. PET STORE - DAYTIME

           Charlie looks at a “TwitPic” on her phone of Evan SAVING SEA 
           TURTLES in Costa Rica. 

           WIDEN to reveal she’s at a pet store, LOOKING at a tank of 
           small TURTLES. Betsy eats a Ring Pop next to her, stoned and 
           MESMERIZED by a tank of fish, entertained like it’s the TV.

           She looks at Charlie and points to the tank implying “get a 
           load a these guys.” They walk out with a TURTLE and TANK.

           EXT. FOOD TRUCK 

           Charlie grabs lunch. She stares at the WEEKLY SPECIAL- “Bacon 
           Cheeseburger with Grilled Onions.” Moments later she angrily 
           eats a salad.

           IN HER OFFICE
           Charlie looks at a FACEBOOK picture of Evan doing a CLEAN UP 
           at a junk yard. The caption reads “Recycle Party”. 

           OUTSIDE

           Charlie approaches a GARBAGE CAN. She contemplates and then 
           throws a bottle out in the GLASS bin instead of the trash. 
           She’s overly pleased like it was a HUGE accomplishment.

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S HOUSE- NIGHT TIME

           Charlie eats an apple and reads a book on Modern Art. She 
           looks anxious. Betsy comes in the front door.

                                 BETSY
                        What up?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I cracked the code! This weekend, 
                        I’m meeting Evan. Level one, com-
                        pleted! 

                                 BETSY
                        Shut the FUCK up! 

           Charlie gets up and they yell and scream like idiots.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                             (re:apple)
                        Wait, are you smoking weed outta 
                        that? Our bong is in my room.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        No you asshole, I’m eating it. Like 
                        a human being.

           Betsy seems confused.

                                 BETSY
                        Huh. Interesting.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tryin to get my health on. Where 
                        were you?

                                 BETSY
                        I met a guy. But right now you will 
                        know nothing. I wanna play this out 
                        like a normal person. No check ups.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing?! Ugh, you’re mean.

                                 BETSY
                        So what’s the Evan sich?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, soooooo, friend of a friend of 
                        a friend’s birthday party. Fate 
                        intervened and Evan is going. He 
                        RSVP’d on Facebook. It was 
                        forwarded to me. We got a mutual 
                        friend. We are SO fucking there.

           EXT. STREET- NIGHT TIME

           Charlie, Betsy, and Meg are approach the door to a bar. 

           The girls look GREAT. Betsy airs on the side of SLUTTY. 
           Charlie rocks some KILLER heels. She can’t walk in them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not gonna lie, my feet already 
                        hurt. 

                                 MEG
                        Why are you wearing them then?

                                 BETSY
                        Because I’m awesome and found this 
                        on his Twitter. 
                             (reading)
                        “Girls in high heels equal sexy. 
                        It’s the dirty old man in me. I 
                        can’t help myself.”

                                 MEG
                        You’re both idiots. I shouldn’t be 
                        supporting this, but I’m intrigued.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Duh. 

           Meg texts on her phone.

                                 MEG
                        Jill might come. She’s working 
                        late, but she’ll try to swing by.

                                 BETSY
                        Yay. I miss her.

           The girls approach the door. Charlie takes a deep breath.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s do this.

           Charlie opens the door to the bar. 

           INSIDE THE BAR

           WIDE SHOT- THE THREE GIRLS ENTER IN SLO-MO.

           SONG: “TOO FAKE” by HOCKEY

           The song begins as wind BLOWS the girls’ hair in SLO-MO as 
           they enter. It looks SEXY. SUDDENLY the door shuts as we 
           ABRUPTLY go back to NORMAL speed. Their hair flies EVERYWHERE 
           from the door shutting. 

           They make a BEE LINE to the bar. Betsy aggressively PUSHES 
           through and makes room for the girls. Damn, she’s feisty.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Shots. Tequila?

                                 BETSY
                        Yes please.

           Betsy orders.

                                 MEG
                        I’ll do Merlot.

                                 BETSY
                        Who brought Mom?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seriously, you’re like a soaking 
                        wet Snuggie right now.

                                 MEG
                        Fine.

           The hold up the shots.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Here’s to us, here’s to those like 
                        us, and to everyone else, fuck em!

           They clink and all do a shot. Charlie SCANS the bar. A small 
           sweet smile curls up her face. 

           ANGLE ON- EVAN BECKETT talking with a group, looking as 
           GORGEOUS as humanly possible. Is there a halo of light 
           surrounding him? Angels are singing somewhere.
           Charlie STARES entranced for a moment. She turns back.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (a bit frazzled)
                        I see him.

                                 BETSY
                        Ok, what’s the game plan?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know. I need a cigarette.

                                 BETSY
                        Remember that Instagram pic of him 
                        from Coachella? He smokes. That’s 
                        your “in.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        When did you get smart?

                                 BETSY
                        I have my moments.

           Suddenly a man comes up next to them to clean up some empty 
           glasses off the bar. Charlie does a double take.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Doug?! What are you doing here?!

           Doug holds empty glasses and eats a chicken wing.

                                 DOUG
                        Just cleaning up the mess. You look 
                        stunning Betsy. Like a delicate 
                        mermaid without the disgusting fish 
                        tail part.

           He winks and walks away.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What the fuck?

           Betsy shrugs and Meg looks confused.

                                 MEG
                        Anyway, I think Betsy should just 
                        mosey on in there.
                             (to Betsy)
                        You have no shame.

           Betsy shrugs like “true.” The girls do one more shot. Meg 
           shoos hers away. Betsy takes it.

           ANGLE ON- EVAN AND THE GROUP TALKING
           In the BACKGROUND the girls talk, while Betsy inches up. The 
           group starts LAUGHING. Betsy sees this as her “in” and 
           “casually” joins the group.

           For the first time, we’re up close and personal with EVAN 
           BECKETT (30, so handsome it hurts, sparkling smile) With him 
           are ADAM (29, mid-western, Guy’s guy), JACK (31, Evan’s best 
           friend, confident relaxed vibe) and another chick.

           The group starts to LAUGH as Betsy POKES herself right in, 
           laughing along with them, a little TOO big. The laughter 
           begins to die down.

                                 BETSY
                             (too excited)
                        Right?! I know! It’s like, what?! I 
                        think technically that’s illegal!

           She lean/bumps against the other girl in the group.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Hey you.

                                 GIRL
                             (confused)
                        Hey?

                                 BETSY
                        I haven’t met you guys yet though. 
                        I’m Betsy.

           She outstretches her hand. Everyone shakes. She’s in!

           Meg and Charlie stand a few feet behind her. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Holy fucking fucker, she’s done it.

           Betsy charms the group, being dumb and funny, her strong 
           suit.

                                 MEG
                        I gotta give it up, she’s got 
                        balls. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And four shots of Tequila.

                                 MEG
                        True.

                                 BETSY
                        Man, I need a smoke. Hey Charlie!
           Charlie and Meg see the group LOOKING at them. Betsy is 
           mouthing “Oh my fucking God.” She gives a TINY thumbs up that 
           only the girls can see.

           Charlie and Meg walk over. Charle is having SERIOUS trouble 
           in the heels, walking EXTRA slow, attempting to make it sexy.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, I’m Charlie.

                                 EVAN
                        Hi, I’m Evan, nice to meet you.

           He shakes her hand firmly. They smile.

                                 ADAM
                        Adam, how goes it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Good!

                                 JACK
                        Looks like you haven’t quite 
                        mastered those heels yet, huh?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (annoyed)
                        They’re new.

                                 JACK
                        Just sayin.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (sarcastic)
                        Nice to meet you too!

                                 JACK
                        Jack.

           He shakes her hand, he smiles.

                                 BETSY
                        Hey Charlie, were you going to go 
                        smoke? Do you have any cigarettes?

           She catches on.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, yeah.

                                 EVAN
                        Can I bum one? 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure!

           EXT. BAR -MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie FUMBLES to give Evan a cigarette. He pulls out a 
           lighter and smoothly lights both his and Charlie’s.

                                 EVAN
                        Thanks for the cig.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No problem. I’m quitting. 

                                 EVAN
                        Oh yeah, me too. I’m always 
                        quitting. It’s my last vice. I’d 
                        like to think I live a pretty 
                        healthy lifestyle except for these 
                        little fuck-sticks. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        They are fuck-sticks, aren’t they?

           He looks down at her heels, they’re high as hell.

                                 EVAN
                        Those are some serious heels you’re 
                        working with. They look dangerous.

           She looks down at her feet.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I just love sexy heels. I have too 
                        many pairs. It’s so dumb, I know.

                                 EVAN
                        No, they look really good on you.

           They smile at each other.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks.

           Evan finishes his smoke, stomps it out and picks it back up.

                                 EVAN
                        You almost done?

           Charlie throws her cigarette down as well and stomps on it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yup!
           Evan PICKS up her cigarette butt as well. Charlie makes a 
           “fuck me” face to herself. He throws them out.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D (CONT’D)
                        You, beat me to it. I actually, 
                        find myself picking up other 
                        people’s cigarette butts, and 
                        throwing them out, all the time. I 
                        just can’t help myself. I’m a 
                        really big recycler. Have you heard 
                        of “Freecycle”?

                                 EVAN
                        Of course, I’m a member! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, no way! Yeah, me too. It’s 
                        just, great to trade stuff so 
                        you’re not trashing it.

                                 EVAN
                        I couldn’t agree more.

           He opens the door for her to walk back inside. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Charlie, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s me! 

           He touches her waist slightly helping her as she walks back 
           in. She notices.

           INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE- DAYTIME

           Tucker lays on Charlie’s couch reading STAR magazine. He 
           wears a FEDORA. It looks weird. Charlie types at her 
           computer.

                                 TUCKER
                             (reading the magazine)
                        Sometimes I wish I was best friends 
                        with all the “Real Housewives.” 

           Charlie doesn’t look up from what she’s doing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s really weird. They’re like 
                        the most awful human beings ever.
                                 TUCKER
                        Ok, not all of them. Just like, 
                        Jill Zarin for sure, and her 
                        husband Bobby. And the British one 
                        from LA. And that crazy one from 
                        New Jersey.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Which one?

           Tucker thinks.

                                 TUCKER
                        All of them, I guess.

                                 CHARLIE
                        God, I love that show. I would  
                        literally watch every spin-off 
                        until they ran out of cities. Same 
                        with “The Bachelor.” So damn good.

           Tucker flips through the pages.

                                 TUCKER
                        So what’s up with your soulmate? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Eh, nothing really. He didn’t ask 
                        for my number at the bar. But he 
                        did the double name ask and totally 
                        touched my waist after he opened 
                        the door for me. I’m gonna have to 
                        do another bump in. Just trying to 
                        give it enough time so it doesn’t 
                        feel too weird and planned.

                                 TUCKER
                        Which it totally is. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Affirmative.

           INT. CHARLIE’S CAR- A WEEK LATER- EARLY EVENING

           Charlie drives. Her phone rings through the SPEAKER of her 
           car, on blue-tooth.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (answering)
                        Hey.

                                 BETSY
                        Hey. Where are you?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Halfway home. 

                                 BETSY
                        Well get ready to make a pit stop. 
                        Evan just checked in on Foresquare 
                        at the B-Noble on 6th street. Get 
                        your ass there.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What? Shit, like now? Ughh, I look 
                        like crap. 

                                 BETSY
                        Go!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Going!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT- CONTINOUS

           Charlie speeds into a spot.

           INT. BOOK STORE- CONTINOUS

           Charlie GRABS a basket. She WALK-RUNS through the aisles 
           looking for Evan. She CHECKS a list on her phone; “Modern 
           Art, Raw foods, Billy Joel, Habitat for Humanity, Fiji, etc.” 

           She SPEEDS down isles, GRABBING books, then moving on. 
           Suddenly she spots Evan walking down the center. She SCURRIES 
           around behind his back so he doesn’t see her too soon. 

           She PRETENDS to go through books, fake reading them, not 
           really knowing where she ended up.

           Evan does a double take SPOTTING her. He walks up to her and 
           she PRETENDS to be surprised.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, hey! How are ya?

                                 EVAN
                        Good, fancy meeting you here.

           He gives her a hug.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, this is so random!

           Her hand is at her side, clutching a book she grabbed.

                                 EVAN
                        Whatcha got there?

           He picks up her hand HOLDING the book.

           ANGLE on a Science Fiction Fantasy novel with dragons and a 
           half NAKED woman on the front. It’s called “THE FIRST VIRGIN: 
           DRAGON BLOOD.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, this? This is for, well, see, I 
                        have a little sister, but she’s not 
                        really my little sister, it’s 
                        through one of those big sister, 
                        programs. She loves, these kinda 
                        books. Thought I’d surprise her.

           ANGLE on the TOTALLY inappropriate book cover. The woman’s 
           nipple shows.

                                 EVAN
                        Seems a little risque, no?

           She looks at it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s...really mature. But you’re 
                        right, this might be a bit much.

                                 EVAN
                        That’s crazy though, I have a 
                        little brother too! I’m actually 
                        the director of events for a 
                        mentoring organization. I started 
                        as a big brother years ago and just 
                        continued with them after college. 
                        It’s the best job. I’m so lucky.

           All of the sudden, Jack, Evan’s friend approaches.

                                 JACK
                        Well, well, well, look who we have 
                        here. No awkward heels?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi.

                                 JACK
                        Gettin your read on?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. What do you think of these 
                        “Idiot Guide” books? 

           Charlie pulls one out of her basket.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh my gosh, an “Idiot’s Guide to 
                        Vegan Living”?! Are you vegan?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Vegetarian, but trying. I just like 
                        to eat clean and fresh, ya know?

           In the BACKGROUND Charlie suddenly spots DOUG, eating a bagel 
           with lox and reading a KAMA SUTRA BOOK. She catches his eye, 
           and furrows her brow like “what the fuck are you doing here?”

           Doug nods his head like “you got this.” He points to the 
           COVER of the book showing a couple sexually INTERTWINED. 

                                 EVAN
                        Of course I know, I’m a Vegan! Wow, 
                        it’s definitely not an easy 
                        lifestyle, but totally worth it.

           Charlie snaps back to Evan. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No way! Well, you’ll have to give 
                        me some tips and recipes.

                                 EVAN
                        Absolutely.

           He smiles at her. The deal is being sealed. 

                                 JACK
                        Oh my god you guys, I’m totally 
                        vegan too! Except for cow, and 
                        pigs, chicken, lamb, duck, veal, 
                        lobster. Anything that was once 
                        breathing basically. Sometimes I 
                        like to get every animal I can 
                        between just two pieces of bread. 
                        Kinda like Noah’s Ark in a 
                        sandwich.

           He MIMES a sandwich and takes a big delicious bite.

                                 EVAN
                        You’re an awful human being.
                                 JACK
                        I didn’t make them delicious. He 
                        did.

           Jack points to the sky,implying it’s God. She rolls her eyes.

                                 EVAN
                        Yo, Charlie has a little sister 
                        through a mentoring program too, 
                        isn’t that crazy?

                                 JACK
                        Oh, no shit? You gotta meet LJ, 
                        Evan’s little brother. We’ve known 
                        him since he was, what?

                                 EVAN
                        8. Can you believe that? He’s 18 
                        now, about to go to college. How 
                        old is your little sister?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh man, she’s, gosh, who knows 
                        right? It’s so hard to tell their 
                        ages sometimes.

                                 JACK
                        No, not really. She’s not a dog.

           Charlie shoots Jack an annoyed look with her eyes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I mean, ya know. She’s like in that 
                        9-12 range.

           Jack gives her a look.

                                 EVAN
                        Cool. Well, we should hang out 
                        sometime, I mean, you’re adorable, 
                        plus we have too much in common. 
                        Maybe with our littles too? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I’d like that. 

           Evan looks down to his phone while Charlie gives her number.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh look, you and Jack are sneaker 
                        buddies.

           ANGLE ON- Charlie and Jack’s feet, they’re both wearing navy 
           blue Converse. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I have a lot of these.

                                 JACK
                        They’re the best. I live in them. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Me too. I was wearing them like, 
                        before you were born. 

                                 JACK
                        You definitely look older than me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shut up, I just meant, whatever.

                                 EVAN
                        Well Charlie, it was really good 
                        seeing you. Let’s hang soon.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Definitely. Bye you guys!

           Charlie TURNS and doesn’t really know which way to exit. 
           She’s about to walk away but decides to just sort of continue 
           FAKE LOOKING in the same spot on the book shelf. 

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S APARTMENT- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Betsy sits on the couch in their living room in her PJ’s, 
           slightly SHAKING, rolling a joint. Charlie busts in.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Guess whatttttttt?!

                                 BETSY
                        You saw Evan?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        He asked for my number! 

           They yell and high five and dance around.

                                 BETSY
                        I knew it! Yes, mission 
                        accomplished. This is like, wow. 
                        Celebratory joint!

           Charlie exits real quick and comes back holding her TURTLE 
           and a TOOTHBRUSH, cleaning it’s shell.

           Betsy sits back on the couch, she was already ROLLING a joint 
           anyway. She’s SHAKING a bit, making it difficult.
                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Are you cleaning Turtle?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, more responsibility than I 
                        realized. 

                                 BETSY
                        It sucks that no one ever gets that 
                        we named him after Turtle from 
                        Entourage.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. Hey Bets, why did I see Doug 
                        in the bookstore?

                                 BETSY
                        I’ll tell you, but you have to 
                        promise not to be mad.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t even like that sentence.

                                 BETSY
                        Ok, Evan didn’t exactly check in on 
                        Foresquare. Doug may have put a 
                        tracking device on his car.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you fucking insane!? That’s 
                        illegal. He has to take it off, 
                        like immediately. Like now!

                                 BETSY
                        He totally will! Promise! But let’s 
                        be honest, glass is half full right 
                        now. Maybe even three fourths? 
                        Fuck, you know what? It’s just a 
                        full glass and maybe you’ve taken a 
                        sip. But we’ll just spit it back 
                        into the glass. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you say things that make no 
                        sense, but somehow do?

           Betsy shrugs. Charlie finally notices Betsy’s shaking.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is happening?

           Betsy LIFTS her shirt. She’s wearing a tight belt around her 
           stomach that shakes violently.
                                 BETSY
                        It’s an Ab-Belt. I can lose weight 
                        without doing anything. I watch 
                        “Bad Girls Club” and eat Chex Mix, 
                        and the Ab-Belt does it’s work.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re deranged.

                                 BETSY
                        I’m not gonna lie, it’s giving me 
                        wicked headaches. I feel like I’m 
                        constantly in an earthquake, and 
                        then I’m like, shit, what if a real 
                        earthquake happens and I don’t even 
                        know, cause I’m wearing the belt? 
                        Scary stuff. 

           Charlie’s phone beeps. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        He texted me! He texted me! 

                                 BETSY
                        What’s it say?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (reading)
                        Hey Charlie, great seeing you 
                        again. So we hangin out soon or 
                        what?

           Charlie gets excited.

                                 BETSY
                        He totally likes you. He texted you 
                        right away! That’s like, big.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, so let’s wait just like 30 
                        minutes and I’ll text him back. 
                        Gotta play it cool, like I’m 
                        totally busy. What do I say? Keep 
                        it short, right? Do I add a smiley 
                        face? Those are lame, but, they do 
                        show interest, I like them 
                        sometimes. Or a wink? No, too soon, 
                        and it’s juvenile. Or is it flirty? 
                        Fuuuuck.

                                 BETSY
                        Whoa, I can’t believe you’re acting 
                        like this. You’re normally like 
                        Miss Cool Operator.
           Charlie’s phone beeps again.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit. Another text.
                             (reading)
                        “And we gotta get our little 
                        siblings together too!” 

                                 BETSY
                        What’s that mean?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck my life. I told him I had a 
                        little sister in a mentoring 
                        program, cause I knew he had one. 
                        Do you think Meg’s girlfriend would  
                        let me borrow her kid?

                                 BETSY
                        Maybe? But let’s start by not using 
                        the word “borrow.” 

                                 CHARLIE
                        True. But I mean if I can just use 
                        her for just like-

                                 BETSY
                        Let’s not say “use” either. How 
                        about, “hang out”? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s a good one. 

                                 BETSY
                        Now text him back!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine!

           She starts to text on her phone.

           INT. ROLLERINK - DAYTIME

           Pre-teens SKATE around a roller rink. Meg stands with her 
           longtime girlfriend JILL (30’s, sweet with poise) and another 
           woman talking near a table set with CAKE and DECORATIONS. 

           ANGLE on Charlie awkwardly skate/walking in on roller skates 
           with a present. She GRABS onto a young boy for support on her 
           way in. She thanks him and keeps going.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, hey, hey!
                                 MEG
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JILL
                        Charlie, how are you?

           They hug. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just wanted to see Maddy and wish 
                        her happy birthday. I got her a 
                        little present.

           Meg looks on suspiciously.

                                 MEG
                        I don’t trust this.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What? Do you trust, this?

           Charlie attempts to SMOOTHLY skate backward off onto the 
           rink. It’s messy. Kids and parents are YELLING at her. She 
           tries to catch up with MADDY (11, Jill’s daughter, typical 
           pre-teen) who’s skating with a boy and a girl.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey guys!

           Maddy is immediately annoyed and embarrassed by her presence.

                                 MADDY
                        Uhm, hey Charlie. Why aren’t you 
                        hanging by my Mom and Meg?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wanted to be with the cool kids, 
                        skatin it up!

           She attempts to do a spin and almost falls. She GRABS hold of 
           Maddy’s friend’s HAIR for support.

                                 GIRL
                        Owwww!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry! Here, I got you a present. 

           ANGLE on Meg and Jill looking on.

                                 JILL
                        What’s she doing?
                                 MEG
                        I don’t know.

           WIDER shot of Charlie awkwardly trying to keep up on skates.

                                 MADDY
                        Can you give it to me later?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, sure. It’s a “Twilight” 
                        calendar! How hot is Edward?!

                                 MADDY
                             (apathetic)
                        Cool.

           Charlie fumbles back out to Meg and Jill.

                                 MEG
                        What’s happening?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What? I wanna see Maddy more often.
                        Can I take her to a food truck 
                        festival this weekend? It’s 
                        supposed to be a blast.

                                 MEG
                        Who are you?

                                 JILL
                        Sure. But just so you know, she’s 
                        in that middle school “adults are 
                        embarrassing” phase.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uhm, I’m not an adult.

                                 JILL
                        Ok.

           INT. CHARLIE’S CAR- DAYTIME

           Charlie drives while Maddy sits in the passenger seat TEXTING 
           and listening to earphones. Charlie looks over a few times, 
           trying to think of something to say.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, are you excited?

           Maddy looks over at her and takes out her earphones, slightly 
           annoyed.
                                 MADDY
                        What?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I said, are you excited?

                                 MADDY
                        Uhm, not really. It’s just food 
                        right? Believe it or not, I’ve 
                        eaten before.

           Burn.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, I mean, it’s like tons of 
                        different food trucks, plus I think 
                        a little bit of clothing and 
                        jewelry. Maybe if you see something 
                        you like, I’ll buy it for you?

                                 MADDY
                        Why?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What do you mean? We’re hanging 
                        out. I never get to see you!

                                 MADDY
                        Ok?

           She goes to put her earphones back in but Charlie starts 
           talking again.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you listening to?

                                 MADDY
                        Black Eyed Peas.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you Ferg-a-licious?

           Charlie smiles, Maddy doesn’t.

                                 MADDY
                        No, I just like the music. Why are 
                        we really hanging out? This is 
                        weird. 

           Charlie looks at her, debating.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine Maddy, I’ll give it to you 
                        straight. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        I like a boy and I told him you 
                        were my little sister in a 
                        mentoring program. So there. Can 
                        you just be cool and pretend?

           Maddy looks at her. A small accusatory smile on her face.

                                 MADDY
                        When you tell the truth, you don’t 
                        need to remember anything.

           Charlie listens, she’s smart.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I know, but sometimes, well, 
                        I’m not telling you to lie, because 
                        it’s totally wrong, it’s just, like 
                        occasionally, there are instances--

                                 MADDY
                        It’s fine. Boys make you do crazy 
                        things. I get it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        They do, don’t they?

           EXT. FOOD TRUCK FESTIVAL-DAYTIME

           Tons of food trucks and people mill about. Evan hangs with 
           Jack, Adam and LJ (18) Evan’s “little brother”, sweet and 
           scrawny, but very confident for his age.

                                 JACK
                        What are you gonna go for?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m feelin the hybrid food lately. 
                        Maybe some Mexican Korean?

                                 LJ
                        I’m goin with a lot of meaty 
                        goodness, and some fried shit.

                                 JACK
                        See, that’s what I’m talkin about.

           Jack and LJ go into an elaborate handshake.

                                 LJ
                        This feels like an awkward first 
                        date. You diggin this chick?
                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I am. I don’t know, seemed 
                        low pressure and fun. 

           ANGLE ON- Charlie and Maddy walking up to them.

           Charlie suddenly feels AWKWARD. All eyes are on them. She 
           sort of WAVES and smiles, but they’re still a bit far away. 
           She debates talking from the distance.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (yelling)
                        Hey! What’s up?!

           Maddy looks at her.

                                 MADDY
                        You’re screaming. They’re too far. 
                        Keep walking.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Right.
                             (much quieter)
                        Hey, what’s up?

                                 MADDY
                        Now you’re too low. Just wait till 
                        you get there.

           Charlie nods. They get up to them. 

                                 EVAN
                        Charlie, this is LJ.

           LJ shakes her hand.

                                 LJ
                        What’s up? Smile for me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

           Maddy and Charlie look at each other. Charlie smiles.

                                 LJ
                        You got some nice “mouth pegs”. You 
                        had braces? Retainer? Invisalign?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

                                 EVAN
                        LJ wants to be a dentist. He’s got 
                        a real passion for teeth.
                                 LJ
                        Eyes are the window, but teeth, 
                        they’re like the invitation. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is Maddy you guys!

           Evan reaches into his back pocket.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey Maddy, hope this isn’t weird, 
                        but I got you a little something. 
                        Hope you don’t have this one.

           He hands her a book. She looks at it, a bit disgusted. The 
           cover of the book is TERRIFYING.

                                 MADDY
                        What is this?

                                 EVAN
                        It’s part of the “Wings of Angel 
                        Doom: Armageddon Enclave” series.

           Maddy looks at Charlie, who pleads at Maddy with her eyes, 
           then starts aggressively petting her head, trying to give her 
           a signal. 

                                 MADDY
                             (monotone)
                        Oh, right. Thank you for this 
                        amazing book.

                                 EVAN
                        No problem. So we should get our 
                        eat on?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, I’m starving.

           Evan and Charlie walk together while Jack, LJ, Adam and Maddy 
           walk in front of them. Jack seems to bond with Maddy.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey you guys, hold up.

           They’re in front of a truck with a long line.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I think I wanna wait on this line 
                        and get Charlie and I some of these 
                        Vietnamese wraps. Supposed to be 
                        awesome.
                                 LJ
                        Oh yeah, they got fried noodles, 
                        I’m in.

                                 ADAM
                        I see a hybrid truck. Greek 
                        Chinese? Fuck, I’m tryin it.

           LJ stands next to Evan. Adam scurries off.

                                 EVAN
                             (to Charlie)
                        You wanna go get us some smoothies 
                        and I’ll wait here?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sounds great.

           Charlie walks off with Jack and Maddy. 

                                 JACK
                        So what are you lovely ladies in 
                        the mood for?

                                 MADDY
                        Uhm, burgers?

                                 JACK
                        A woman after my own heart.

           Maddy smiles, a bit smitten.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                             (to Charlie)
                        I guess not for you vegetable face.

           Charlie does one of those LAUGHS like she’s MENTALLY 
           disabled. It’s that LAST resort comeback. A sort of weird 
           face and a “gur, gur, gur” thing going on. Maddy laughs.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Wow. You just did that? That’s like 
                        the last resort laugh. I didn’t 
                        even diss you, it was just a lame 
                        joke. There’s no comeback to that 
                        laugh. You just went right from 0-
                        60. I can’t believe you just 
                        dropped that on me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Believe it.

           They slow down at a truck. Charlie looks a little panicked.
                                 JACK
                        Here’s some goodness. 

                                 MADDY
                        Good call.

           Charlie stands BEHIND them, trying to HIDE, pushing her hair 
           in front of her face. As they get closer, the guy in the 
           truck MARTY (foreign and good natured) recognizes her. This 
           is an all MEAT truck.

                                 MARTY
                        Charlie, I love to see you!

                                 JACK
                        You know this guy?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, no, not really.

                                 MARTY
                        You wan your double bacon cheese 
                        burger Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, no, no. It’s been years!

                                 MARTY
                        What you say? Is your usual! All 
                        the time, you love so much!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to Jack)
                        I ate meat, like, a long time ago.

                                 MARTY
                        What about special Charlie Ribs? 
                        From las month, you love sauce and 
                        you get all over face like baby! Me 
                        want more ribbies!

           Behind Jack’s back Charlie SWIPES her hand across her neck 
           and shakes her head “no,” implying “cut it out.”

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Why you make motion like this?

           He copies the motion Charlie just did.

                                 JACK
                             (to Charlie)
                        Ba-ba-ba-ba-busted.

           Charlie is speechless.
                                 MADDY
                        It would appear so.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine. I like meat, but, I’m trying 
                        to become a vegan. I totally want 
                        to. I’m almost there.

                                 JACK
                        That’s dumb. So Evan thinks you’re 
                        a vegetarian? Interesting. Good way 
                        to start off.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, why don’t you just ease up 
                        Judge Judy. And can you not go 
                        running back like a little tattle 
                        tale girl?

                                 JACK
                        I don’t give a shit what you do, 
                        it’s not my place.

           EXT. PARKING LOT- A LITTLE WHILE LATER- DUSK

           The gang sits in a grassy area eating their food as the sun 
           SETS. Evan and Charlie flirt. Charlie takes a bite of her 
           Vegan food and catches Jack’s eye. He takes a huge SLOPPY 
           bite of his greasy meaty sandwich.

                                 JACK
                             (with his mouth FULL)
                        Oh my GOD, this is so fucking good!   
                        I almost can’t even take it. 
                        Seriously, it’s blowing my mind. 
                        Uhhhhhh, the meaty juices!

           Charlie rolls her eyes. Jack has food basically falling out 
           of his mouth.

           INT. BETSY’S CUBICLE- DAYTIME

           Betsy sits at her desk on the phone with Charlie. 

                                 BETSY
                        You’re so fucked.
           INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE- SAME TIME

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why? I’ve done yoga a couple times. 
                        I looked it up, it’s just like, 
                        warmer, big deal?

           WE INTERCUT THE CALL BETWEEN BOTH PLACES

                                 BETSY
                        My co-worker said it was the worst 
                        thing she’s ever experienced. She 
                        felt like she was dying.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bets, I’ve had sex outside on hot 
                        days. I get it.

           INT. BETSY’S CUBICLE-SAME TIME

           GREG (the guy from the photo shoot) approaches wearing 
           overalls, rubber gloves and holding a small shovel. 

                                 BETSY
                             (to Charlie)
                        Hold on a sec.

                                 GREG
                        Hey, uh, I had a lot of fun the 
                        other night.

           Betsy tries to cover the mouth of the phone. Charlie SQUINTS 
           and PRESSES her ear against the phone trying to hear.

                                 BETSY
                             (giddy)
                        Yeah, me too. Good times.

                                 GREG
                        So, I’m about to do a “Man Angrily 
                        Gardening” photo, but after that, 
                        would you wanna grab some coffee?

                                 BETSY
                        I’d love to! See you in a bit.

           Greg walks away. She takes her hand off the mouth piece.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What was that?
                                 BETSY
                        Nothing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck you, I could kinda hear. It’s 
                        that dude. Just gimme his name.

                                 BETSY
                        No.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I hate you. 

                                 BETSY
                        Why? You’re just gonna find out 
                        he’s in the Tea Party, or has some 
                        weird sex fetish. I just wanna 
                        pretend he’s normal for now and 
                        slowly learn that he’s fucked up, 
                        like regular people do.

                                 CHARLIE
                        At least tell me your thoughts?

                                 BETSY
                        I like him. A lot. He gives me 
                        butterflies. We’ve only gone out to 
                        dinner and seen a movie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sex?

                                 BETSY
                        Not yet. But I bought this angled 
                        sex floor pillow, apparently it--

                                 CHARLIE
                        From an infomercial?!

                                 BETSY
                             (busted)
                        I gotta go.

           EXT-YOGA STUDIO-EARLY EVENING.

           Charlie and Evan approach the door to a YOGA ROOM. Evan wears 
           shorts and a tank top. Charlie on the other hand wears LONG 
           yoga pants, a t-shirt and makeup. Her hair is DOWN.

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t know if you should have 
                        worn that? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Most of the girls are basically in 
                        sport bras and underwear. Have you 
                        taken a Bikrim class recently?

           She laughs like she’s got this.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s been a little while, but it’s 
                        all good in the hood. I’ll just 
                        sweat more, right?

           He shrugs.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I guess that’s true.

           Evan opens the door for Charlie. Her face tells all as she’s 
           HIT with a WAVE of hot dry heat. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to herself)
                        Mother of fuck.

           WIDEN to reveal all the men and women stretching on their 
           mats wearing almost nothing. 

           She starts breathing HEAVY, not walking in any farther. 

                                 EVAN
                        You ok?

           She turns to Evan, like a deer in headlights.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Just, uh, 
                        didn’t eat enough protein today.

           INT. YOGA STUDIO-LITTLE WHILE LATER

           We slowly PAN across the class. The teacher speaks 
           soothingly, instructing the class into positions. 

           We start to hear a WHEEZING sound, almost like a cat dying.

           Charlie LAYS on her back on the mat. She’s POURING her water 
           bottle onto her face and chest. Her yoga pants are ROLLED all 
           the way up to her thighs. People look over. Evan holds his 
           pose but looks over concerned. He SITS beside her.

                                 EVAN
                             (whispering)
                        Do you wanna leave? 
           Charlie’s hair is all MATTED and FRIZZY from the sweat and 
           heat. Her mascara is RUNNING down her face. She SLOWLY sits 
           up. Her words spill out of her mouth WEAKLY.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, it’s fine. It’s just, so weird, 
                        must be something I ate, I’m 
                        normally so good at. Oh, wow...

           She looks off beyond Evan in a drugged out stare.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Toby Maguire just got here. He’s 
                        with Seabiscuit. That’s so sweet. 

                                 EVAN
                        What?

           Evan looks in the direction Charlie’s looking.

           ANGLE on an older lady on her yoga mat, WEIRDED out by 
           Charlie staring.

           Charlie lays back down, continues pouring water on her face.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, I hate seeing you like 
                        this. Maybe you have food 
                        poisoning?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, no. Look.

           She lifts up one leg slowly, barely moving.

                                 EVAN
                        Come on, let’s just go shower and 
                        get some dinner.

           Charlie slowly rolls over into the fetal position.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You wanna check out that waterfall 
                        real quick?

           Suddenly she sees Doug in a corner, wearing TIGHT Yoga pants, 
           drinking a smoothie. He’s SHIRTLESS. Is it a mirage from the 
           heat?

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Doug?
                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, uhm ok. Let’s just get you 
                        out of here.

           He PULLS her up and gently helps her out of the room.

           INT- EVAN’S LIVING ROOM- LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Charlie and Evan are showered and cleaned up. They eat from 
           bowls on the couch. Evan is FIXATED by the TV. Charlie has a 
           DISTURBED look on her face at what she’s watching. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Every one in 700 children are born 
                        with cleft palate. Often times it 
                        can be very hard to look at, but 
                        organizations are trying to help...

           We hear the front door unlocking. Jack walks in, puts down 
           his stuff, cruises into the living room. He looks at the TV.

                                 JACK
                        Really dude? Cleft Palate again? 
                        Sexy.

                                 EVAN
                        I love this doc.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Totally.

           Jack looks at Charlie and catches her sarcasm.

                                 EVAN
                        You wanna join us?

                                 JACK
                        Only if I can smoke weed. It’s 
                        downers-ville USA otherwise.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, do it. Whatever.

                                 JACK
                        You game Charlie?

           Charlie looks at Evan. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, I don’t really smoke, weed.
           INT. LIVING ROOM-LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Jack sits in an arm chair on Charlie’s side smoking a joint. 
           Evan is ASLEEP.

           Jack silently offers Charlie the joint. She shakes her head a 
           little and gives him a look as if to say “I can’t, wish I 
           could.” Jack REACHES for the remote.

                                 JACK
                             (whispering)
                        Do you care if I change it?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (whispering)
                        Not even a little.

           Jack turns on “The Bachelor”. Charlie looks dumbfounded, it’s 
           one of her FAVORITE guilt ridden reality shows.

                                 JACK
                             (whispering)
                        I fucking love reality TV. It’s 
                        everything amazing and awful in the 
                        world all rolled into one. I could 
                        write a disseration on it.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (whispering)
                        I agree with every ounce of my 
                        being. I think only special people 
                        appreciate reality TV on a certain 
                        level. Don’t let it go to your 
                        head.

                                 JACK
                             (whispering)
                        Completely. It’s glorious.

           Jack then motions with his finger for Charlie to come CLOSER. 
           She looks at Evan, totally passed out. She slowly leans in 
           toward him as he holds the joint. She takes a quick hit. 

           Suddenly Evan slowly wakes up. Charlie quickly sits back.

                                 EVAN
                             (groggy)
                        What are you guys watching?

                                 JACK
                        The Bachelor. 

                                 EVAN
                        Ugh, that show’s the worst.
           Jack and Charlie exchange a look like “yeah right.”

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S APARTMENT- NIGHT TIME

           Charlie is on the Gazelle working out, sweating like crazy. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I hate this. I fucking hate this.

           Betsy enters 

                                 BETSY
                        Lookin good!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Working out is so dumb. I wish I 
                        had a tape worm. 

                                 BETSY
                        Well, you’re glowing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, I’m sweating. I feel so 
                        deprived lately. I just want weed 
                        and meat and shopping. It’s so hard 
                        being a good person!

           She slows down on the Gazelle.

                                 BETSY
                        I know! Can you believe people do 
                        this, like for their life? 
                             (then)
                        I’m seeing Greg tonight.

                                 CHARLIE
                        When do I get to meet him?

                                 BETSY
                        I don’t know. I don’t want you 
                        researching him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I won’t, jeez! I’m doing dinner 
                        with Evan and I’m like afraid to 
                        eat lately because I’ve finally 
                        lost some LB’s.

                                 BETSY
                        Well, be careful with the drinking 
                        then. You know how you get.
           INT. RESTAURANT- NIGHT TIME

           A waiter CLEARS Charlie and Evan’s plates. Charlie’s plate is 
           almost full. She’s DRUNK, sipping her drink LOUDLY. She TRIES 
           to be funny and does an impression HOLDING her Martini glass.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (terrible drunk 
                              impression)
                        I’m Samantha from Sex and the City, 
                        and I just love Cosmos.

           She takes a drunken sip.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (loud whisper)
                        I wanna do dirty naughty things in 
                        your penis. 

                                 EVAN
                             (amused)
                        In my penis?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (drunk)
                        All over it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EVAN’S BEDROOM

           Evan and Charlie stumble into the room kissing. They fall 
           onto the bed. Charlie stops for a moment.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wait, here. I got a surprise.

           She runs out of the room. 

           EXT. EVAN AND JACK’S HOUSE- CONTINOUS

           Charlie DRUNKENLY runs out of the house without shoes over to 
           her car. She pops the trunk and GRABS a small backpack.

           INT.-EVAN’S BEDROOM- CONTINOUS

           Charlie jogs back in out of breath but tries to maintain 
           SEXINESS. 
           She throws her backpack next to a dresser with EVAN’S TURTLE 
           TANK. She UNZIPS a cosmetic bag with some makeup and 
           toothbrush and SITS it on the dresser.

           ANGLE on her cosmetic bag sitting next to a cup with ANOTHER 
           toothbrush in it used to CLEAN THE TURTLE’S SHELL.

                                 EVAN
                        What’s going on?

           Charlie grabs a couple things from the backpack and swipes 
           the toothbrush OUT OF THE CUP AND NOT THE COSMETIC BAG.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (attempting a sexy 
                              Schwarzeneggar 
                              impression)
                        I’ll, be back.

           She runs into..

           THE BATHROOM

           Three QUICK CUTS:

           Charlie HURRIEDLY gets unchanged. She FALLS OVER trying to 
           get her skin tight jeans off.

           Charlie dressed in sexy red panties and matching bra.

           Charlie talks to herself in the mirror holding the toothbrush 
           about to brush. It’s covered in GREENISH GUNK, but she’s way 
           too drunk to realize.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        You’re doin it. Sexy, matchy 
                        underwear. Hot, butt, naked. Oh hi 
                        there. Oh this? It’s nothing.

           She puts the toothbrush under water for a moment and starts 
           brushing. She quickly makes a DISGUSTED face, SPITTING into 
           the sink.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (whiney yell)
                        UGHHHHH!

           INT. EVAN’S BEDROOM- CONTINOUS

           Charlie runs in, only wearing panties and a bra holding the 
           toothbrush looking STUNNED. Evan looks at her for a moment.
                                 EVAN
                        Damn girl.

           She quickly looks at the dresser. Her cosmetic bag is OPEN 
           with the toothbrush STILL inside.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (frantic)
                        This is your turtle’s! What do I 
                        do?! What do I DO?!

                                 EVAN
                        Oh no. No, no, no! Shit! They carry 
                        Salmonella! Go wash your mouth out!

           She quickly runs back into..

           THE BATHROOM

           SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

           Charlie WASHES her mouth out with water.

           Charlie GARGLES with Listerine.

           Charlie SOBS for a moment in the mirror.

           Charlie SCRUBS her tongue with her toothbrush. 

           Charle SPITS repeatedly.

           Charlie POURS salt directly onto her tongue.

           Charlie stares in the mirror, talking to herself.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (convincing herself)
                        It’s gonna be ok. It’s gonna be 
                        totally fine.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOCTORS OFFICE- DAY TIME

           Charlie sits on an exam table, pale faced and weak.

           A DOCTOR (50’s, highlighted hair, wearing “cool” scrubs) 
           reads his clipboard. He laughs to himself a little.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Wow. That, is, crazy. I gotta tweet 
                        this.
           The Doctor takes out his phone. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?! No! You’re not tweeting 
                        this! You’re a doctor.

           The Doctor scoffs like a little kid.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Fine. I never have anything good to 
                        tweet.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t give a shit. 

           The Doctor suddenly seems bummed. There’s silence.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I feel like you’re mad now that I 
                        won’t let you tweet this and you’re 
                        not gonna give me as good of care.

                                 DOCTOR
                             (totally lying)
                        That’s not true.

           There’s a beat of awkward silence. They stare at each other.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine. Tweet it.

           The Doctor gets a huge smile on his face.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes! Thank you! The surgery doctors 
                        are gonna be so jealous. They 
                        always tweet about weird objects 
                        logged inside of people but this is 
                        gonna blow them out of the water!

           He holds up his phone to her face. She looks weak and 
           miserable.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Do you mind if I just take a--?

           She slaps his hand down with all the energy she has.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No!

                                 DOCTOR
                        Ok, ok, fine. Listen, I’m not gonna 
                        sugar coat this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Liquids are gonna be flying out of 
                        pretty much every orifice for about 
                        a week or so. You won’t be able to 
                        eat much, and your bowel movements 
                        are gonna be at a pretty constant 
                        rate. And, not solid. Just keep 
                        super hydrated.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (defeated)
                        Ok.

           He looks at his watch.

                                 DOCTOR
                        But I, actually have to go. I’m 
                        meeting the wife at “Dave and 
                        Busters.” The adult arcade, you 
                        ever go? What a blast. You get a 
                        drink, you play skeeball..

           Charlie shoots daggers with her eyes.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Ok, alright, I get it, not into 
                        small talk. Do you want me to tag 
                        you in the tweet?

           Charlie glares at him.

           INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM- AFTERNOON.

           Charlie lays in bed, looking like death. Her phone BEEPS. She 
           gets a text from Jack: “Who gets Salmonella?! You’re an 
           embarrassment to humanity.” She smiles a little. 

           Her phone rings, it’s Evan. She tries to shake it off for a 
           moment. She FEELS AWFUL but tries her best to SOUND FINE.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. YOUTH CENTER- BASKETBALL COURT

           Evan stands with a whistle coaching some kids.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey! How you feelin?

           WE INTERCUT BETWEEN BOTH PLACES
                                 CHARLIE
                        Gettin better. Probably just a 
                        couple more days!

           Charlie takes a sip of water. She looks TERRIBLE, but if you 
           just heard her voice you wouldn’t know. 

                                 EVAN
                        Ok, well, I can’t wait to see you 
                        next week when you’re better.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Me too. 

           She starts silently gagging a bit.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Can you hold on? I have a little 
                        cough.

           She starts a FEMININE cough and covers the phone. It turns 
           into CRAZY vomiting.

           Evan waits on the phone. He sees a kid running down the court 
           with the basketball.

                                 EVAN
                        You gotta actually bounce the ball 
                        Hector!

           Charlie comes back onto the phone.

                                 CHARLIE
                        All better.

                                 EVAN
                        Ok good. Well, just checking in. 
                        Feel better.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks, you too! I mean, yeah. Bye.

           She shakes her head and hangs up.

           INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM- LATE AFTERNOON

           Charlie frantically cleans. There’s a knock at her door. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come in!

           No one comes in. Another knock. 
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on in! 

                                 BETSY (O.S.)
                        Open the door.

           Charlie looks confused. She opens the door and looks down. 

           ANGLE ON- RUMBA VACUUM CLEANER

           A RUMBA vacuum cleaning robot scoots around the floor. On top 
           of it a bowl is DUCT TAPED filled with popcorn. Betsy walks 
           in with a remote, really pleased with herself.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Eh? It’s a vacuum cleaner robot, 
                        but I taped a bowl to it so we can 
                        serve people snacks and shit. 

           She smiles proudly. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m in the middle of cleaning, can 
                        it help me vacuum?

                                 BETSY
                        Yeah. Sort of. I don’t know.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m nervous Bets. First off, I’m 
                        just getting over the Salmonella. 

                                 BETSY
                        So weird. Who thought you’d ever 
                        say that in your life time, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can you not?
                             (then)
                        Also, Evan’s a neat freak and he’s 
                        never been here. I always suggest 
                        his place. Ok, we have to hide the 
                        weed, our bong, the gossip mags, 
                        rolling papers, junk food, and we 
                        gotta clean. And I got some vegan 
                        snacks. And look, I bought a 
                        Fernand Leger print for my room.
           ANGLE ON- FERNAND LEGER PRINT ON HER WALL

                                 BETSY
                        Whoa, calm down. I thought you said 
                        you were gonna be yourself now?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I am, pretty much. Last thing, for 
                        real. He just loves modern art and 
                        this dude’s his favorite, so I just 
                        wanna blow his mind once more.

           They both look at the print for a moment. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s cool. I like it.

                                 BETSY
                        It is cool, but it’s not you. 
                        Greg’s coming tonight. If you ask 
                        him his last name, I will hurt you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Alright! Yay adult party!

           Betsy gets excited and presses the remote causing the Rumba 
           to slam into Charlie’s foot.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Dude!

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S APARTMENT- NIGHT TIME

           Charlie SCURRIES around lighting candles, puffing couch 
           pillows, spraying Febreze. The doorbell rings and she stops 
           at a wall mirror to check herself one last time.

           ANGLE ON DOOR OPENING- TUCKER AND HIS WIFE ALLISON.

           Tucker wears cut off jean shorts and high top sneakers. 
           ALLISON (mid 30’s, cute and feminine) holds a bottle of wine.

                                 ALLISON
                        Pinot Noir!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Love it.

           They walk in and hug and kiss. 
           ANGLE ON DOOR OPENING- MEG AND JILL STAND THERE.

           Jill is finishing up a cell phone call, Meg holds a platter 
           covered in foil.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tell me they’re cake balls.

                                 MEG
                        They’re cake balls.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I wanna sit on your face right now.

           Jill hangs up.

                                 JILL
                        Uh-uh.

           Jill slaps Charlie’s ass as they walk in.

           ANGLE ON DOOR OPENING- GREG STAND THERE.

           Greg wears khakis and holds a bag of chips.  

                                 GREG
                        Hey, I’m Greg, are you Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I am! Great to meet you.

           They shake hands. Betsy quickly scurries up to avoid further 
           questioning. 

                                 BETSY
                        Hello!

           ANGLE ON DOOR OPENING- JACK, EVAN AND ANOTHER GIRL. 

           The guys hold bottles of booze. The girl, EMILY (20’s, blond, 
           pretentious hipster) gives an aloof smile.

                                 EVAN
                        Hello gorgeous!

           They kiss.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi!

           Charlie’s face looks slightly curious at the other girl. 
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           She hugs Jack.

                                 JACK
                        Charlie, this is Emily Leshure. 

           Emily puts out her hand to shake, but NOT sideways, more with 
           the TOP of her hand facing UP.

           ANGLE on the HANDSHAKE. Emily’s hand looks like DEAD FISH.

           They all walk in with Emily in front. Charlie’s shoots Jack a 
           look as if to imply “Her? Really?”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S APARTMENT- LATER THAT NIGHT

           We are in the MIDST of this game night party. People are 
           crowded around the living room being loud and rowdy. Everyone 
           is talking OVER each other, all the regulars plus a few more.

                                 BETSY
                        Ok, settle. Focus up people!

           People start to quiet down. Betsy takes a shot

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Ready? Go!

           She starts the timer to CATCH PHRASE. Meg is the first one to 
           go while the contraption BEEPS like a hot potato. 

                                 MEG
                        Ok, ok! It’s like, you’re beating 
                        people up.

           People start screaming out words like “assault, murder.” Greg 
           begins to stand, looking HEATED.

                                 JACK
                        Abuse!

                                 MEG
                        Yeah, but like the act of going at 
                        someone?

                                 GREG
                        Punching! Kicking! Come on, we need 
                        more God damn it!
           Whoa, Greg is angry. Does he know this is just a game?

                                 MEG
                        Ok, more vague! Uh, someone coming 
                        at you! Assault, aggressive-

                                 GREG
                        Attack! Attack! It’s gotta be 
                        attack!

           Greg’s face is fire engine RED. Is he sweating? Evan and 
           Charlie exchange a look. Evan smiles. He’s SO laid back.

                                 MEG
                        Correct. Ok, other word, in the 
                        sea, scary animal! Teeth!

                                 EMILY
                             (apathetic)
                        Octopus?

                                 MEG
                        No, like Jaws!

                                 EVAN
                        Shark!

                                 GREG
                        Attack! Fuckin shark attack!

           Greg is literally in Meg’s face screaming at her. Betsy 
           thinks it’s CUTE, maybe even SEXY?

                                 MEG
                        Whoa. Yes!

           Greg gets WAY too EXCITED he got it. He attempts a bunch of 
           HIGH FIVES. Meg quickly passes it to her left who is Emily.

                                 EMILY
                        Uhm. It’s a kind of farm animal.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cow, pigs!

                                 JACK
                        Horse, chickens!

                                 EMILY
                        No, like sort of like a goat or 
                        sheep maybe?

                                 DOUG
                        Llama!
           Where the hell did DOUG come from?! He definitely wasn’t 
           there a moment ago. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Doug?!

           Back into the game.

                                 EMILY
                        Right. Ok, so now, a type of Llama! 

                                 JACK
                        A type?!

                                 EVAN
                        Tapada, Tampuli, Lanuda!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to Evan)
                        Are you serious? How do you know 
                        that?

                                 EVAN
                        My father owned a farm.

           She smiles. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of course he did.

                                 EMILY
                        No, uh, shit, uhm, the first word 
                        is like, another word for a Barbie 
                        maybe? But it’s spelled weird.

           People are thinking. No one really speaks.

           Emily looks back down at the machine, the beeping is getting 
           LOUDER and CLOSER together. 

                                 TUCKER
                        A type of llama, sounds like a 
                        Barbie? 

           The timer runs out. Jill grabs the machine and looks.

                                 JILL
                        Dalai Lama?!

           People react accordingly. Charlie looks at Jack like “your 
           girl’s a fucking idiot.”
           INT. KITCHEN- LITTLE WHILE LATER.

           Charlie makes drinks in a blender. MADNESS is heard coming 
           from the living room. Betsy comes in, DRUNK.

                                 BETSY
                             (sort of sing/rapping)
                        Hey, hey, hey! We want some poosay.

           She dances with her eyes closed to imaginary rap music.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey drunky, wanna get drunker?

                                 BETSY
                        Shit yeah. Imma suck Greg’s dick 
                        tonight like his cum is the cure 
                        for cancer.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow. WOW. Can we just take a beat 
                        on that? I can’t just brush by that 
                        comment, it’s fucking insane.

                                 BETSY
                        It’s gonna be insane, when his dick 
                        explodes like a champagne bottle. 
                        Or like, when you put Mentos in 
                        soda. You ever YouTube that? That’s 
                        totally gonna be his dick.

           She mimes a gross explosion.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you too drunk to like, talk  
                        right now? I have thoughts I need 
                        to share.

           Betsy wavers but leans on to the counter for support.

                                 BETSY
                        No no. I’m so good. Go.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thoughts on the chick Jack brought?

                                 BETSY
                        Chicken head.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Right? I don’t get her. And she had 
                        the weakest handshake, almost like 
                        “hey, can you hold my hand for a 
                        minute, I’m sooo tired.” Jack’s so 
                        much better than her.

                                 BETSY
                        Yeah, I guess. I don’t know him so 
                        good.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s just like, a girl I know I 
                        hate. I bet she goes to those 
                        hipster places with mash-up dj’s 
                        and cheap ironic beer, but she used 
                        to like blow bouncers at cheesy 
                        clubs for bottle service, ya know 
                        what I mean? She’s a poser.

                                 BETSY
                        Uhm, Imma shut up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

           Betsy debates talking. She does.

                                 BETSY
                        You’re like, kind of a poser, with 
                        Evan?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, I’m not. I just use Internet 
                        assistance, I’m still me. Fuck, you 
                        know what? He introduced her with 
                        her first and last name, which, by 
                        the way, is so pretentious. But, 
                        I’m just gonna run into the bedroom 
                        super quick and do a check up.

                                 BETSY
                        Are you fucking insane? We’re 
                        throwing a party.

           She starts pouring a drink from the blender, not so well. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine. 

           She holds up her drink, smashed. A little spills on her head.

                                 BETSY
                        Here’s to getting FUCKED tonight!
           Betsy DRUNKENLY looks out the kitchen window. DOUG stands 
           right outside, eating a TACO.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                             (excited)
                        Doug!

           Charlie turns and quickly opens the back door.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Doug, why are you standing outside?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m casing the perimeter. For your 
                        safety.

                                 BETSY
                        Isn’t he the best?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m your bodyguard Betsy. You’re my 
                        Whitney Houston. 
                             (singing “I Will Always 
                              Love You)
                        Ifff I, shoulddd stay, I would, on-
                        ly, be in, your way-eeeeee.

           Betsy is touched.

                                 BETSY
                        Awwww! Like from the movie!

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, that’s it? You’re just gonna be 
                        outside our house for the night?

                                 DOUG
                        Short answer, yes. Do you want a 
                        bite of my taco?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

           Doug shrugs and closes the door. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT.-LIVING ROOM-LITTLE WHILE LATER

           The party has died down, only a few people are left. Charlie, 
           Betsy, Greg, Evan, Jack and Emily. Everyone looks TIRED and 
           DRUNK. Betsy’s head is in Greg’s lap. She picks it up.
                                 JACK
                        It’s almost 3:30. Should we leave 
                        soon?

                                 BETSY
                        Let’s all smoke a goodbye bong.

           Betsy grabs the Bong from her room. Charlie lays on Evan.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Charlie scored this weed for free 
                        last week.

           Evan looks at her inquisitively. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, not for me or anything. I’m 
                        just a charmer, what can I say?

                                 EVAN
                        I thought you don’t smoke weed?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t babe. Just helped Betsy get 
                        some.

           Jack gives Charlie a look.

                                 BETSY
                        She can charm her way into any 
                        situation, get anything she wants.

                                 JACK
                        That’s actually called 
                        manipulation.

           He smiles at her.

                                 MEG
                        For real. She’s gotten out of like, 
                        5 speeding tickets?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I got a way with words. What can I 
                        say?

           Evan smiles at her. 

                                 BETSY
                        There’s only one thing Charlie 
                        could never charm her way into.

           Charlie and Betsy knowingly look at each other.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Cookie Bomb pie.

                                 EVAN
                        What’s that?

                                 BETSY
                        We were OBSESSED with this bakery 
                        in college, and the baker made this 
                        pie that would literally make your 
                        mouth orgasm. It was like “If These 
                        Walls Could Talk”, but more like 
                        “If This Mouth Could Jizz.”

           Greg looks at her amused.

                                 JACK
                        That’s, disgusting.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s a real lady. Anyway, he 
                        stopped making them for whatever 
                        reason. It was a dark day for us. A 
                        real dark day. I tried every 
                        possible way to charm him. Money, 
                        wit, goods, services, he wouldn’t 
                        have it. God damn I miss that pie.

                                 JACK
                             (making air quotes)
                        Services huh? You blew an old man.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This pie was amazing. Let’s just 
                        leave it at that and never speak of 
                        it again.

           Jack and Charlie smile and exchange a look. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM- BED TIME

           Charlie is undressing while Evan kisses the back of her neck. 

                                 EVAN
                        That was really fun. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (distant)
                        Yeah, it was.

           Evan looks at Charlie’s wall and spots the “Leger” poster.
                                 EVAN
                        No shit! Fernand Leger is my 
                        favorite. And that’s literally one 
                        of my favorite prints of his. “The 
                        Mechanic.” Wow. I had no idea!

                                 CHARLIE
                        No way?

           Her face in the mirror looks slightly blue.

                                 EVAN
                        What’s up? You alright?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah....I don’t know. 

                                 EVAN
                        Talk to me.

           She takes a deep breath.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok. Well, I just...

           Evan takes off his shirt. Yup, there’s his UNBELIEVABLE body. 
           Are his ABS OILED up?! He kisses her.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Ah, fuck. I over-think things.

                                 EVAN
                        Tonight, it’s all about you.

           They fall on the bed kissing.

           DATING MONTAGE

           SONG: The Black Keys- “TIGHTEN UP”

           ON A HIKE

           Evan and Charlie hike together. Evan barely breaks a sweat. 
           Charlie is beat red, sweating and clearly miserable. Every 
           woman they pass gives Evan the once over.

           AT A MUSEUM

           Evan and Charlie sit next to each other watching a film 
           presentation at a museum. It looks INCREDIBLY boring. Evan is 
           SUPER into it. Charlie nods her head and smiles, pretending 
           to love it as well. They hold hands and with her other hand 
           she secretly plays SCRABBLE on her iPhone.
           AT A POOL

           Evan dives into a pool and does a PERFECT butterfly stroke. 
           Charlie in a new bikini, lookin hot, smiles sexy and does a 
           dive right after, swimming under water to him. She comes out 
           of the water in SLO- MO, wet hair swinging like a shampoo ad, 
           sexiness kicked up a notch.

           As we settle back into NORMAL speed, we see WET, STRINGY POOL 
           BOOGERS coming out of Charlie’s nose and dragged across her 
           cheek in one continous string. You know we’ve ALL had them. 
           She smiles at him sexily, totally OBLIVIOUS. He motions to 
           his own face, cueing her. She finally catches the drift and 
           dunks under water. The camera follows her as she SCREAMS 
           underwater, mortified.

           INT. EVAN AND JACK’S HOUSE- NIGHT TIME.

           Charlie makes dinner and Evan sets the table. His cell rings.

                                 EVAN
                             (on the phone)
                        Hello? Hey! Oh, really? Ok, ok. No, 
                        no, gimme 20 minutes. It’s fine. 
                        Don’t be silly. Ok, bye.

           Charlie looks up from cooking.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Crap. I have to run out to the 
                        youth center.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is everything ok?

                                 EVAN
                        Totally fine. Just a last minute 
                        thing for this field trip we’re 
                        trying to coordinate.  

           He looks at his watch.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back in an hour or so. 
                        Sorry babe.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No worries.

           He pecks her lips and rushes out.
           INT. EVAN AND JACK’S APARTMENT- 15 MINUTES LATER.

           Charlie watches TV and types on her phone. The food simmers 
           in the kitchen. Jack comes in the front door.

                                 JACK
                        Yo. Whatcha watching?

                                 CHARLIE
                        “Intervention”. I’m addicted. 
                        Ironic huh?

                                 JACK
                        I love all those one word A&E 
                        shows. Where’s Evan?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Had to run out to the youth center, 
                        said he’d be back in an hour or so. 
                        I was just making dinner.

           Charlie walks over to her purse and pulls out a CD.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, so I noticed your douchey “hey 
                        look, I’m a cool hipster” record 
                        collection and..

                                 JACK
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. I like records, 
                        they sound better. If that makes me 
                        naturally cool, so be it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It doesn’t. But, I put some good 
                        music on this for you cause I have 
                        really really good taste. Hopefully 
                        it’s stuff you don’t have. 

                                 JACK
                        Did you make me a mix cd?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, be cool. 

                                 JACK
                        So how much time do we have?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JACK
                        I mean, let’s smoke a joint and 
                        listen to this mix of yours.
           She looks at him, thinking.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I shouldn’t. I can’t. I don’t.

                                 JACK
                        But you want to.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JACK’S BEDROOM-SHORT TIME LATER

           Charlie and Jack sit on the floor of his room while Jack 
           rolls a joint. He has the SAME Banksy print that hangs in 
           Charlie’s office. She smiles at it. He hands her the joint 
           and LIGHTS it. He JUMPS up and puts the CD into his computer.

                                 JACK
                        Ok, let’s see whatcha got.

           He presses play. The music PLAYS in the background. Her phone 
           beeps. She pulls it out from her back pocket and reads it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Evan’s gonna be another 45 minutes. 

                                 JACK
                        Good. Ok, question. It’s, kind of 
                        personal.

           Charlie furrows a brow.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shoot.

           Jack takes a moment, like the question is going to be a big 
           deal.

                                 JACK
                        Ok, for 15 grand, would you be 
                        willing for a whole year, to tell 
                        whoever you’re with, every time you 
                        have to go to the bathroom and 
                        whether you’re going to pee or 
                        shit?

           She smiles, she does these too!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like announce it? 
                                 JACK
                        Yeah, like you’re at a meeting and 
                        you have to be like “Excuse me 
                        everyone, I have to go take a shit, 
                        I’ll be right back.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure. I’d just hold it.

                                 JACK
                        Not possible, you have to announce 
                        it as soon as you get the urge.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck no then. Too risky. And only 
                        15 grand? That’s nothing. You?

                                 JACK
                        I’d do it. Dude’s are gross. Plus 
                        I’m so charming I bet I could tell 
                        a chick I was gonna go take a 
                        massive dump, and she’d still fuck 
                        me right after.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, you think so?

                                 JACK
                        I know so...So what’s like, your 
                        panty dropper music?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ex-squeeze me?

                                 JACK
                        You know, like those sure fire 
                        songs that turn you on, and you’re 
                        like “Penis, in vagina, now.”

           She scoffs, then thinks, takes a hit off the joint.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uhm, shit. Probably like, some Bon 
                        Iver and, old school Motown. Otis 
                        Redding and Sam Cooke for sure.

                                 JACK
                        Nice choices.

           Charlie is still thinking of answers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Or you know what? The XX, their 
                        album is so fuckin sexy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        You know that song Crystallized? 
                        Man, that song just does it for me. 

                                 JACK
                        That is a hot song.

           Charlie suddenly feels stoned and vulnerable. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, so, all of those, whatever, I 
                        guess. So now, what about you?

                                 JACK
                        I don’t drop my panties. 
                             (jokingly sexy)
                        I make em drop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re dumb.

           They have a moment looking at each other. Jack jumps up.

                                 JACK
                        Don’t move.

           He runs out of the room momentarily and returns with a bag.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        So, your birthday is coming up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is true. Good memory.

                                 JACK
                        So, I got you a little something. 
                        It’s really more of a gift for me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m intrigued.

                                 JACK
                        I was gonna wait, but it got here 
                        quickly, so I’ve had it here. And, 
                        I don’t know, it feels like a good 
                        time. Close your eyes.

           Charlie puts her hands over her eyes. Jack pulls a box out of 
           the bag and places it in front of her.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Ok!

           She opens her eyes and OPENS it. It’s none other than the 
           infamous COOKIE BOMB PIE. Charlie is speechless.
                                 CHARLIE
                        What?! No way..I don’t, know what 
                        to say. How did you...

           Jack tries to be cool, but is aware it’s a pretty big deal.

                                 JACK
                        Don’t worry about it. But now it’s  
                        just a fact that I’m more charming 
                        than you. Agreed?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (a bit overwhelmed)
                        Ok. 

                                 JACK
                        Good. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, let’s eat it!

                                 JACK
                        What, now? Really? Don’t you wanna 
                        save it or something? Isn’t this 
                        like a big deal?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, it is. You should enjoy it 
                        with me. Hurry, before Evan gets 
                        back.

           Jack sits for a moment and then runs out of the room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT.-JACK’S BEDROOM-SHORT TIME LATER

           ANGLE ON THE PIE. ALMOST ALL GONE AND MASHED UP. THERE ARE 
           TWO FORKS SITTING IN IT. THEY WENT TO TOWN.

           WIDEN to reveal them SITTING Indian style with the pie in 
           between. It looks like the last shot in “Sixteen Candles” 
           when they’re sitting on the table with the cake in between.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m so full. Can’t. Breathe.

                                 JACK
                        Betsy’s right. I think some sort of 
                        ejaculation just happened with my 
                        mouth. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        I know. It’s hard to describe.
                             (then)
                        That’s the nicest thing anyone’s 
                        ever done for me.

                                 JACK
                        Shut up!

           Something is happening between them. Suddenly reality hits.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit. We should clean up.

                                 JACK
                        Right.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Does Evan know you did this?

                                 JACK
                        No.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is it cool if we keep it between 
                        us? Also, cause I just cooked 
                        dinner and blah blah...

                                 JACK
                        It’s fine.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cool.

           INT. EVAN’S BEDROOM- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Charlie’s CURLED on her side in Evan’s bed. She STARES at the 
           wall, deep in thought. Evan is fast asleep next to her.

           Seeing the bed from above, you can see the LITERAL distance 
           between them.

           EXT. PARK- BIKING/RUNNING TRAIL- DAYTIME

           Charlie and Betsy walk BRISKLY on a trail. Betsy has a 
           shocked look on her face, mouth agape.

                                 BETSY
                        The same pie?! Are you sure?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Positive. We ate it together.
                                 BETSY
                        Where was Evan?

                                 CHARLIE
                        He had to run out.

                                 BETSY
                        This is, I mean, fuck, I have so 
                        many questions. Thoughts?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Confusion.

                                 BETSY
                        Right. Totally. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can we chill for a minute? I hate 
                        walking fast, it’s dumb.

           They slow down and sit on a nearby bench. 

                                 BETSY
                        Jack’s it. I’ve always felt it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Since when? 

                                 BETSY
                        Just like, in my blood, or my 
                        groin. Wherever psychic abilities 
                        come from. I know it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, he’s not.

                                 BETSY
                        Charlie, don’t shit on my face and 
                        tell me it’s raining.

           Charlie just looks at her, confused.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uhm, ok. 
                             (then)
                        Evan is amazing. He’s literally the 
                        perfect guy. And he likes me.

           Betsy looks at her, not swayed.

                                 BETSY
                        He doesn’t know you. 
           Charlie thinks. A blond in yoga pants and a PERFECT ass jogs 
           by. The girls both simultaneously give her the MIDDLE FINGER.

           INT. CHEESY ALL AGES NIGHT CLUB- NIGHT TIME

           Evan, LJ and his teenage friends sit at a VIP booth, but it’s 
           an ALL ages club so the whole scene is a bit LAME.

           LJ STANDS on the seat of the booth DANCING with a couple 
           friends. Teens sexually GRIND up on each other on a nearby 
           dance floor. Jack stares grossed out.

           Charlie approaches the table with a big smile and a small 
           gift bag. She yells up to LJ standing on the couch.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Here! I got you a little somethin 
                        somethin.

           LJ leans down.

                                 LJ
                        Should I open it now?

           Charlie nods. LJ opens it. It’s a REALLY nice electric 
           toothbrush.

                                 LJ (CONT’D)
                        No shit!

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s supposed to be the best one. 
                        It has some crazy sonic technology 
                        or something?

                                 LJ
                        Oh, hell yeah!

           LJ stands back up on the booth and DANCES around with the 
           toothbrush excitedly, HUMPING it to the rhythm of the song. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (a bit uncomfortable)
                        Hey, where’s Evan?

                                 JACK
                        He texted me, he was held up at 
                        work. Should be here in an hour.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh really?

           She takes out her phone and looks.
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit, you’re right. I didn’t 
                        even feel the text.

                                 JACK
                        Is it illegal that we’re witnessing 
                        this?

           He motions his head towards the dance floor.

           A TEEN boy LITERALLY holds a girl’s leg up and grinds on her 
           aggressively, DRY HUMPING like nobody’s business. It’s gross.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow. That poor girl definitely has 
                        a teenage boner in a her stomach 
                        right now. Should we get a drink?

                                 JACK
                        Yes please.

           AT THE BAR

           The bartender hands them their drinks. Jack’s is colorful 
           with fruits and a little umbrella in it. They act a bit 
           UNCOMFORTABLE with each other. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What is that?

                                 JACK
                        Raspberry Mojito. 

           He takes the umbrella out. Charlie gives him a little 
           judgmental smile and nod.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t give me judgy eyes. It’s 
                        fucking delicious. Try.

           He moves the umbrella and gives Charlie a sip.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow, that is yummy. It’s like my 
                        mouth just took a fresh fruit and 
                        mint bath. Where’s Emily?

                                 JACK
                        She’s at this Art, Installation, 
                        opening, Vodka, sponsored thingy.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cool.
           Awkward silence.

                                 JACK
                        Why are we being weird?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know! It’s so dumb.

                                 JACK
                        Totally dumb. I have a great idea.

           Charlie looks at him, intrigued. He reaches into his pocket 
           and hands her something. It’s a tiny pill with an imprint.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is this E?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah. What could be more fun at 
                        this club?

           She looks at her strange surrounding.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Evan would kill me. This is not in 
                        the healthy lifestyle program. I, 
                        don’t do this.

                                 JACK
                        Sure you don’t. Our little secret?

           Charlie looks down at her hand.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re a terrible influence. And 
                        I’m a sucker for peer pressure. 
                        It’s a bad combination. 

                                 JACK
                        Bottom’s up?

           He has a devilish and flirty grin. They clink glasses and 
           take the pills.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR

           SONG: “Sleepy Head” by PASSION PIT

           SLOW MOTION TO FAST MOTION. Charlie and Jack are in the 
           CENTER of the dance floor. Their HANDS and BODIES move around 
           really LOST in the music. 
           We go from SLOW motion to FAST motion interchangeably, really 
           feeling the state of mind they’re in.

           ANGLE ON LJ and a friend watching them with confused looks.

           The music ABRUPTLY cuts out. We hear what’s REALLY playing in 
           the scene. Kids grind on the dance floor to DIRTY hip hop. 
           Jack and Charlie look like weird hippies in a sea of 
           children.

           LJ and his friend look at each other. LJ shakes his head.

                                 LJ
                        White people are weird.

           BACK OF THE CLUB- SOMETIME LATER

           Jack and Charlie sit on the ground in back of the club. Kids 
           smoke around them. They’re TUCKED in a corner in their own 
           world smoking cigarettes. 

                                 JACK
                        I don’t even smoke.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know, it’s weird, I can chain 
                        smoke a pack on this drug.

                                 JACK 
                        Me too. 

           Jack exhales the smoke and then takes a deep breath.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Deep breaths feel so good.

           Charlie takes a deep breath.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh yeah, that’s the stuff.

           She takes another deep breath.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I love the air. I can’t get enough 
                        of it. 

           She closes her eyes relaxed for a moment, and then looks up 
           at the night sky.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Life is so good, isn’t it?
                                 JACK
                        It really is. And we’re just, at 
                        the best age. There’s so much I 
                        wanna do and see.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Me too. Sometimes I get scared that 
                        I’ll never get to do it all.

                                 JACK
                        Don’t say that. We’re gonna do it 
                        all.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Evan’s gonna be mad.

                                 JACK
                        Why?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because I did drugs. 

                                 JACK
                        Don’t think about it. All that’s 
                        important right now is the air and 
                        these cigarettes. Both equally 
                        delicious.

           Charlie nods her head. He’s somehow calmed her down.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cool. Yeah, you’re right. 

           She takes another drag, then starts closing one eye at a 
           time, it looks awkward.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how to wink.

                                 JACK
                        What do you mean?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I look creepy. I can never do it 
                        right.

                                 JACK
                        Try me.

           Charlie TRIES to wink but her whole mouth sort of goes up 
           into the wink. It looks awful.
                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. Is that for real? That is, 
                        terrifying. Relax your mouth.

           She keeps trying. It’s getting worse. They start laughing.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Here, watch me.

           He winks at her, effortlessly. It’s hot.

                                 CHARLIE
                        See, I just look like an old lady 
                        who forgot her sunglasses.

           She keeps trying as Jack watches her. He smiles, momentarily 
           deep in thought.

                                 JACK
                        Sometimes....I don’t know.

           Charlie looks off into the distance.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Me neither. 

                                 JACK
                        Ok. Sometimes, I feel like I really 
                        know you, but then I see you around 
                        Evan, and I get confused. You act 
                        differently. I’m not sure who you 
                        are.

           Charlie listens intently, not sure of what to say. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I got things in my head, and they 
                        wanna come out, but I’m afraid.

           Charlie looks at him. Is she ready to tell him everything?

                                 JACK
                        Don’t be. We only got one life, ya 
                        know? Cigarette?

           Jack has a cigarette hanging out of his mouth but PULLS OUT 
           two more anyway. She takes one and he LIGHTS them, realizing 
           he’s already smoking one. He shrugs and smokes two. They look 
           at each other. This is the moment. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, I...

           ANGLE- LJ swinging open the back door.
                                 LJ
                        You guys look homeless, what are 
                        you doing?

           They look up STARTLED, broken out of their little world. LJ 
           walks over and we see they do look pretty gnarly. They’re on 
           the DIRTY ground next to a TRASH can. They didn’t realize.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just having a cigarette.

                                 LJ
                        For 45 minutes?

           Jack looks at his watch.

                                 JACK
                        Shit, I didn’t even realize.

                                 LJ
                        Yeah, we’re ready to go.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where’s Evan?

                                 LJ
                        Got here like 40 min ago. We’re out 
                        front. 

           She pulls out her phone. Sees a few texts.

                                 CHARLIE
                        God damn this phone. Ok, I’m ready.

           Jack and Charlie exchange one last look as they get up.

           INT. EVAN’S BEDROOM- THE NEXT MORNING.

           Charlie is rolled over on her side sleeping. She SLOWLY wakes 
           up, SMACKED in the face by the BRIGHT morning.

           She looks at the clock. It’s 8:32am. She groans. Evan SLEEPS 
           next to her. They’re not touching, it feels distant. She 
           watches him sleep for a moment and starts to rub his stomach. 
           He slowly wakes up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey.

                                 EVAN
                        What time is it?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Early. 

                                 EVAN
                        How are you awake? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know, just woke up.

                                 EVAN
                        Do you wanna talk about last night?

           Charlie thinks for a moment, a bit panicked but trying to 
           hide it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 EVAN
                        Uhm, that you did ecstasy and 
                        disappeared with Jack for like an 
                        hour? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh. Yeah. I’m really sorry.

                                 EVAN
                        It was just weird. Do you do that a 
                        lot?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, not really. It was random. 

                                 EVAN
                        I just feel like we’re too old for 
                        that kinda shit, ya know? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I know. Sorry.

                                 EVAN
                        And you’d think you’d wanna hang 
                        out with your boyfriend?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I did! It just, I don’t know. 

                                 EVAN
                        Ok.

           He rolls back over and goes to sleep. 
           INT.-MEXICAN RESTAURANT- NIGHT TIME

           Big, BOISTEROUS table filled with Charlie and her friends. 
           Balloons at Charlie’s seat. It’s her birthday. 

           ANGLE on Tucker, his wife Allison and Betsy. Tucker is 
           rocking a mustache and suspenders.

                                 BETSY
                        What the hell is on your face? You 
                        look like a hipster fucked the 
                        Monopoly man.

                                 TUCKER
                        It’s a mustache. It’s ironic.

                                 ALLISON
                        I told him he’s a dad, so it can’t 
                        be ironic. 

                                 BETSY
                        You look like the ring master in a 
                        traveling circus of child 
                        molesters. 

           He snaps his suspenders.

                                 TUCKER
                             (whiny)
                        Fuck you guys. I look cool and I 
                        should be living in Brooklyn!

           ANGLE on Jack and LJ. LJ grabs Jack’s beer and takes a swig. 

                                 JACK
                        Dude, you’re 18. 

                                 LJ
                        So? It’s a light beer. You’re not 
                        even a man.

                                 JACK
                        What would you drink?

           LJ thinks for a moment.

                                 LJ
                        I’d keep it real and just get 
                        Jameson and a splash of lime. Neat.

                                 JACK
                        Who are you?

           LJ takes another swig an hands it back to Jack.
           ANGLE on Charlie and Betsy.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bets, I need to quickly show you a 
                        picture. Please don’t be mad, it’s 
                        for your own good. Because I love 
                        you.

           Charlie holds her phone down so only Betsy can see. Betsy 
           leans in. It’s a photo of GREG on a Segway looking SUPER 
           geeky wearing a helmet with others on Segways close behind.

                                 BETSY
                        Charlie, are you fucking serious?

           Evan suddenly stands up.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey, I want to make a quick toast. 

           People quiet down. Charlie looks flattered but embarrassed.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to thank everyone for 
                        coming and say that it’s been great 
                        uniting all of our friends. 
                        Obviously, everyone knows what an 
                        amazing person Charlie is.

           He turns to look at Charlie now. 

           ANGLE on Jack looking at Charlie. Charlie catches his eye for 
           a moment.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        And so loved! So, let’s raise our 
                        glasses. Happy birthday Charlie, 
                        I’m so lucky to have you in my 
                        life. Cheers!

           Everyone RAISES a glass. They all scream “Happy Birthday” and 
           “Cheers” and clinks glasses. Charlie’s smile seems FORCED. 
           Evan sits back down and gives Charlie a kiss.

           EXT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT- LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Charlie and Evan smoke a cigarette next to a LARGE window  
           showing all of their friends inside.

                                 EVAN
                        No sexy heels tonight huh?

           Charlie looks down at her feet. She’s wearing flats. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Nah.

                                 EVAN
                        You still look beautiful.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks.

           Evan KISSES her. In the BACKGROUND three girls are walking 
           past. One is JANE, the acquaintance that enlisted Charlie to 
           first look into Evan. Jane STOPS dead in her tracks. 

                                 JANE
                        Well hello.

           Charlie and Evan turn to Jane. She doesn’t look pleased.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jane, hi!

           Evan looks at Charlie, who begins to look a bit panicked.

                                 EVAN
                        Jane! How are you? Weird, how do 
                        you know Charlie?

                                 JANE
                             (patronizing)
                        Charlie, you wanna take this one?

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re, friends. 

                                 JANE
                        Interesting. Are you and Charlie 
                        dating?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, we are.

           He smiles at Charlie.

                                 JANE
                        Wow.

           Charlie pleads to Jane with her eyes.

           INSIDE THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT

           Meg looks outside and sees what’s going on. She shocked.

                                 MEG
                        Betsy. BETSY!
           Betsy is tipsy and laughing with Greg. She turns to Meg.

                                 BETSY
                        Yeah?

           Meg motions outside the window with her EYES. Betsy looks and 
           sees Jane and a couple girls with Evan and Charlie.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Fucking fuck!

                                 MEG
                        What do we do?

                                 BETSY
                        I don’t know! Wait, I have an idea.

           Betsy whips out her phone.

           OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT

           Meg and Betsy watch from inside the restaurant in SHOCK. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s my birthday Jane.

           Charlie pleads at Jane with her eyes. Jane looks inside the 
           window and sees the big party for Charlie.

                                 JANE
                        Thanks for inviting me sweets.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, it was just, small and-

                                 JANE
                             (to Evan)
                        Has Charlie told you about her 
                        special skills?

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t know?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to Evan)
                        Let’s go inside.

           Charlie GRABS Evan’s arm. 

                                 EVAN
                        What’s going on?

           In the BACKGROUND through the window Meg gets up and talks to 
           Tucker. He looks outside. No one knows what to do.
                                 JANE
                        Charlie is an amazing cyber 
                        stalker. Do you know what that is? 
                        Basically she can find anything 
                        about anyone using the internet, 
                        and all she really needs is a name. 
                        It’s kind of creepy if you ask me, 
                        but everyone in our circle of 
                        friends knows about it. What’s so 
                        weird is, after we met at that 
                        party, and I’m embarrassed to say 
                        this, I asked her to look you up 
                        because you seemed too good to be 
                        true.

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t understand.

                                 JANE
                        And then she told me you had 
                        gonorrhea. 

                                 EVAN
                        What the fuck?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry.

                                 JANE
                        And now here we are, 5 months 
                        later, and you two are a couple. 
                        Isn’t that crazy?

           Evan looks at Charlie confused.

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t, so what, you like stalked 
                        me? Found out a bunch of stuff 
                        about me?

                                 JANE
                        I’m sure she took on all your likes 
                        and interests, I mean, she knows 
                        how to find them out pretty easily. 
                        Sorry, but that’s karma.

           Charlie looks like she’s had the wind knocked out of her.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Happy Birthday Charlie.

           All of the sudden an old beat up Honda Accord comes speeding 
           onto the sidewalk and almost HITS Jane. Everyone screams. 
           Doug jumps out eating a big soft PRETZEL.
                                 DOUG
                        Everybody freeze!

           He’s not holding a badge or anything, just the pretzel.

                                 JANE
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m Doug, Charlie’s bodyguard.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (defeated)
                        No, he’s not.

                                 JANE
                             (to Doug)
                        Fuckin weirdo.

                                 DOUG
                        Listen you wax figure bitch, that’s 
                        hurtful. You don’t even know me! 

           Jane and her friends WALK away. Evan stares at Doug.

                                 EVAN
                        Who is this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Betsy’s friend. Doug, can you 
                        please leave?

                                 DOUG
                        Sure, sure. Do you know if there 
                        are still quesadillas inside?

           Charlie just glares at him. 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Ok, probably, not. Happy birthday.

           Doug SLOWLY gets into his car and backs off the SIDEWALK. He 
           HITS a car on the other side of the street trying to leave. 
           The ALARM goes off. His exit is taking WAY too long. It’s 
           MESSY. They watch him in silence. He FINALLY leaves.

                                 EVAN
                        So, who the fuck are you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m still me Evan. I just, I don’t 
                        know. It got out of hand.
                                 EVAN
                        So, did you know stuff about me 
                        before we met?

           She nods her head yes. Evan is shocked.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Do we even have anything in common?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Some. 

                                 EVAN
                        So, our whole relationship, is 
                        based on lies then? 

           Her eyes well up with tears. She’s trying to be strong. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

                                 EVAN
                        I’m gonna leave now. Because, I 
                        don’t know what else to say or what 
                        to do. But I’m sorry, because it’s 
                        your birthday. But I have to.

           She nods her head, some tears stream down her face. Evan 
           walks away.

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S APARTMENT- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Charlie is curled under a blanket on the couch. Her face is 
           blotchy from crying. Meg, Jill, Tucker,and Allison are there.

                                 MEG
                        It’s gonna be ok, you know that 
                        right?

           Charlie just looks at her, like “seriously?”

           ANGLE on Betsy, DRUNK, looking like a hot mess, walking into 
           the living room wearing Pajama Jeans and her bra.

                                 TUCKER
                        What the fuck are you wearing?

           A small smile curls up Charlie’s face.

                                 BETSY
                        Pajama jeans. They’re jeans but 
                        they’re comfy like PJ’s. 
                                 TUCKER
                        Yeah, I get that. But why? Those 
                        are for trashy fat women. And 
                        pageant moms. 

                                 MEG
                        You look like you should be on 
                        Maury Povich trying to figure out 
                        who your baby daddy is.

                                 BETSY
                        No, they’re for everyone! A skinny 
                        woman was wearing them in the 
                        commercial! It made me realize that 
                        jeans can be constricting. Can 
                        jeans do this?

           Betsy starts DANCING and STRETCHING awkwardly. Charlie starts 
           to smile a little bit.

                                 ALLISON
                        Keep going girl, Charlie’s smiling. 
                        Do it! Do it!

                                 BETSY
                             (singing)
                        I’m doin it, and then guess what? 
                        I’m gonna do it some more! Who’s 
                        that girl? It’s Betsy! What’s she 
                        doin? She’s jammin.

           Betsy acts like a FOOL. Charlie seems momentarily happy. 
           Betsy’s mood suddenly changes.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, wait. Wait. I don’t like that 
                        picture you showed me. I forgot 
                        that I’m angry.

           The other friends are a little confused.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I had to show you. You’re my best 
                        friend.

           Betsy quickly grows pissed.

                                 BETSY
                        So if I’m your best friend, why 
                        wouldn’t you respect me enough 
                        after asking you like 5 times not 
                        to look into Greg? That I wanted to 
                        get to know him myself. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BETSY (CONT'D)
                        But you just couldn’t fucking help 
                        yourself. THIS is why you’re alone 
                        Charlie. Because of these stupid 
                        fucking check-ups, and your crazy 
                        insecurities about being rejected! 
                        Yeah, I said it.

           The group sits awkwardly as Betsy unleashes. She starts 
           walking out of the room, DRUNK, in Pajama Jeans and a bra, 
           trying to be serious.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        And by the way, Greg already TOLD 
                        me he has a Segway. And we rode on 
                        it together, AND I FUCKING LOVED 
                        IT!

           Betsy leaves. Charlie’s eyes well up. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Great. Betsy hates me. Evan thinks 
                        I’m a freak. Jack will never talk 
                        to me again. And Jane will probably 
                        spread this like wild fire.

                                 MEG
                        Fuck Jane. I will rape her life if 
                        she does anything. Betsy will get 
                        over it. You guys love each other. 
                        And things will work out with Evan 
                        and Jack. I know it.

           Charlie sighs, exhausted.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s fucked, but I can’t stop  
                        thinking about Jack and what he 
                        thinks of me...I just wanna go to 
                        sleep.

           Charlie starts to close her eyes. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM- DAYS LATER

           As Charlie CLOSES her eyes on the COUCH in the last shot, we 
           DISSOLVE into her laying in BED in a different outfit, 
           opening her eyes in a similar position.

           WIDEN to reveal her MESSY room. She doesn’t care. 

           DEPRESSED INTO FEELING BETTER MONTAGE

           SONG: “LOST IN MY MIND” by THE HEAD AND THE HEART
           Charlie sits up on her bed with her laptop. She looks MESSY 
           and GROSS. She goes onto FACEBOOK and starts to type in Jack, 
           but then ABRUPTLY swipes the computer off of her bed. 

           Charlie eats a massive cheeseburger and fries, CRYING and 
           SNOTTING everywhere with her mouth open. She’s watching 
           “Birds of Paradise: MATING” the PLANET EARTH episode. 

           Charlie ZONES out at a restaurant as she barely listens to a 
           client showing jewelry. The waitress brings a big fruity 
           drink that REMINDS her of Jack’s girly MOJITO. She smiles and 
           momentarily WALKS AWAY from the table. She TEXTS Jack “I 
           think about you a lot. I hope you don’t hate me.” She 
           HESITATES, then quickly hits send. She waits NERVOUSLY. He 
           texts back. “I think about you too Charlie. More than I 
           should.” And then-“But you fucked with my best friend.” She’s 
           sad.

           Charlie looks drained at her office. She goes on TWITTER on 
           her computer. “WEBSITE has been BLOCKED by PARENTAL CONTROL”. 
           She tries FACEBOOK and GOOGLE, same thing. She angrily “IMS” 
           Tucker on her computer. CHARLIE- “What’s wrong with my 
           computer? TUCKER- “Parental blocked your favorite websites. 
           Intervention. It’s for the best.” CHARLIE- “But this is my 
           job too!” TUCKER- “Figure something out.” CHARLIE- I hate 
           you.” She SHUTS her laptop and LIGHTS up a smoke at her desk.

           Charlie TIDIES up her room. She takes down the “Fernand 
           Leger” print she bought JUST for Evan. She looks a bit 
           HAPPIER. She HANGS a picture in its place. It’s a photo of 
           TWO swans facing each other in a pond with a person giving 
           them the MIDDLE FINGER in the foreground. She SMILES and then 
           opens a bag of TURKEY JERKY and happily eats it. 

           Charlie FEEDS her turtle and finishes making a SMALL sign. 
           She TAPES it to the TURTLE’S shell, opens BETSY’s door and 
           leaves the turtle. Betsy is on her bed. She sees TURTLE 
           slowly walking across the floor. The sign on his shell says 
           “PLEASE FORGIVE CHARLIE, SHES’S WRONG AND STUPID AND MISSES 
           YOU IN HER ENTOURAGE. LOVE, TURTLE.” Betsy smiles.

           INT. MEG’S KITCHEN- NIGHT TIME

           Charlie looks in better spirits. She’s in Meg’s kitchen with 
           Jill COOKING. Jill’s daughter Maddy comes in TEXTING on her 
           phone. She looks up and sees Charlie.  

                                 MADDY
                        I heard what happened. 
                             (genuinely)
                        Sorry.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks.

                                 MADDY
                        You’re supposed to be with Jack 
                        anyway. You know that right?

           Charlie looks at Maddy. How is she so smart?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.

           INT. DINER- DAYTIME

           Charlie NERVOUSLY waits in a diner booth, bouncing her knee 
           and checking her phone. 

           ANGLE on Evan and LJ entering the diner. They approach 
           Charlie, who stands up to greet them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Awkward hug time?

           Evan smiles slightly. They hug, it’s genuine. 

                                 EVAN
                        No awkwardness.

           LJ grabs Charlie and hugs her, picking her up off the ground 
           a little. He’s strong.

                                 CHARLIE
                        LJ, I didn’t know you were coming!

                                 EVAN
                        You gotta make right by both of us.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fair enough. How are you?

                                 EVAN
                        Good. Can’t complain. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you hate me?

                                 EVAN
                        I couldn’t hate you if I tried. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How you doin LJ?
                                 LJ
                        Cray amay.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Weird, is that like a saying now?

                                 LJ
                        Started college. So many honeys 
                        just prancing around. Eager, 
                        curious, horny. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Still studying to be a dentist?

                                 LJ
                        Oh hell yeah. I got big plans. 
                        After I’m a rich successful dentist 
                        with my own practice, I’m gonna 
                        host a dental reality show. Like 
                        “Top Chef” but it’s timed and you 
                        gotta turn someone’s gnarled out 
                        choppers into pearly whites. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I like it. 

           They both smile at LJ.

                                 EVAN
                        Sorry I was, you know, pretty MIA 
                        these last few months.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I get it. I fucked up big time. 
                        But, I just really want you to 
                        know, that, I’m not some stalker.

                                 EVAN
                        I know that. I just needed time. I 
                        gotta ask though, all the stuff we 
                        had in common, was none of it true? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No! Just yoga, being a vegan, fancy 
                        art, mentoring, spelunking..

                        tracking, fly-fishing--

                                 EVAN
                        Ok, ok, I get it!
                                 LJ
                        Damn.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, are you seeing anyone?

                                 EVAN
                        Actually, I am. It’s new, but it’s 
                        going really well. Got some trust 
                        issues because of you, but I like 
                        to think everything happens for a 
                        reason.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. Me too. That’s really great 
                        though. I’m happy for you.

           She takes a deep breath.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        So. I have some stuff to say, and 
                        I’m scared. But it’s all me, just, 
                        being super honest, so, I hope it 
                        helps a little bit.

                                 LJ
                        Truth is a blossoming flower 
                        waiting to expose itself to the 
                        light of day.

                                 CHARLIE
                        When did kids get all deep?
                             (then)
                        So, all this internet investigating 
                        I do, it’s basically because I’m 
                        just really afraid of being 
                        rejected. Plain and simple. That 
                        someone won’t like who I am once I 
                        let my guard down and become 
                        vulnerable. So, I find something 
                        wrong with them and reject them 
                        first. It was easy. Then I found 
                        you, and you were so perfect. So I 
                        just thought maybe I could become 
                        this perfect girl that you’d want. 
                        And then, it just kinda got outta 
                        hand. I never, ever wanted to hurt 
                        you. So, there. Truth. Damn, I need 
                        a cigarette.

           She exhales and sits back. A little more relaxed. 
                                 EVAN
                        But Charlie, you can’t fake your 
                        way into someone’s heart. I’m not 
                        perfect. I’m fucked up. We’re all 
                        fucked up. You just have to find 
                        someone that loves, all of you. 
                        Including the fucked up parts. 
                        That’s what makes a person special.

           Charlie nods. Takes another deep breath.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, so I think I may have found 
                        that person. But, I wanted to talk 
                        to you first about it...

           INT. PHARMACY- DAYTIME 

           Charlie browses the CARD SECTION at a pharmacy. She reads 
           various “I’M SORRY” cards. Then “I MISS YOU”. She SHUFFLES 
           through a bunch. Finally eyes a BAT MITZVAH card. The cover 
           says “So you’re finally becoming a Woman..” She stares at it.

           INT. CHARLIE’S PARKED CAR- DUSK

           Charlie is LEANED against her steering wheel holding the BAT 
           MITZVAH card from the store. She OPENS it and begins to write  
           “Dear Jack, Where the fuck to begin..”

           EXT. EVAN AND JACK’S HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie’s car PULLS up the house. She JOGS up to the porch, 
           card in hand. She CONTEMPLATES knocking, but then LEANS down 
           and slips it under the door. She stands up and QUICKLY walks 
           down the steps as the door SUDDENLY opens. Jack STANDS there.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, hey, what? I was just, hanging 
                        out on your doorstep, not a big 
                        deal. 

                                 JACK
                        Uhm, hi.

           He looks down and sees the card at his feet. He picks it up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, I wrote you a letter. With a 
                        pen. Like an adult.

           She starts to walk back up the steps. 
                                 JACK
                        Whoa. Did you use one of those 
                        calligraphy pens and dip it in an 
                        inkwell ma lady? You could have 
                        just emailed me you know?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I’m taking a little Internet 
                        break for a while.

                                 JACK
                        Gotcha.

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        Jack?

           Charlie hears this and peaks inside. Emily Leshure sits on 
           the couch. Emily gives Charlie a cold aloof smile.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (sotto)
                        Still with the Dalai Lama huh?

                                 JACK
                             (sotto)
                        Don’t judge.
                             (to Emily)
                        Just gimme one sec.

           Charlie is suddenly NERVOUS. She grabs the letter. They both 
           hold on to it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can I, actually, take the letter? I 
                        forgot something.

                                 JACK
                        Oh hell no. 

           He smiles. A stand off. She finally lets go.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (defeated)
                        Fine. 

           They stare at each other for a beat. Charlie leaves.

           INT. BETSY’S CAR- PARKING LOT- NIGHT TIME

           Betsy sits in the driver seat next to Charlie. They’re 
           smoking a joint with the windows ROLLED up.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Can we never fight again? It was 
                        the worst. I’m an idiot and I 
                        should have obeyed your wishes. It 
                        was my own insecurities sneaking 
                        in. I come from a broken home, cut 
                        me some slack. I love you Bets, 
                        you’re like my sister.

                                 BETSY
                        I love you too. But pretty much 
                        everyone comes from divorced 
                        parents Charlie. You’re almost 30 
                        and you’re finally growing up. I’m 
                        proud of you. We’re over it. Moving 
                        on, how long’s it been?

           She takes a pull off the joint and passes it to Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A week and a half. 

                                 BETSY
                        Read me the text again.

           Charlie hits the joint and reads the text from her phone.

                                 CHARLIE
                        “I read your letter. It meant more 
                        than you know. I have a lot of 
                        thoughts and questions, but 
                        ultimately I think we should be 
                        friends. What do you say?”

           Betsy listens intently.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Uggghhhhhh. The worst, right?

                                 BETSY
                        And you haven’t responded yet? I 
                        don’t know, be friends. Ask him to 
                        hang out. You should call him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Really? Like, now? Now. Noww. 
                        Nowww. It sounds weird. I’m high.

           Betsy thinks. 

                                 BETSY
                        Me too. Let’s eat first. We just 
                        hot boxed the fuck out of this car.
           The girls pour out of the car as smoke billows out as if it 
           were just on fire.

           INT DINER- MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie and Betsy silently STUFF their faces, high as fuck. 
           They’re BARELY taking time to breathe. Betsy takes a huge 
           bite of a burger and washes it down with soda. She finally 
           takes a deep breath. 

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        I keep forgetting to breathe.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Totally.

                                 BETSY
                        Call him now. Ask him to hang.

           Charlie takes a bite, nervously whips out her phone.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s ringing. I’m freaking out. I 
                        wanna abort.

                                 BETSY
                        Be cool.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hello Jack? This is Charlie.

           Charlie’s voice sounds stilted and weird.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT EVAN AND JACK’S LIVING ROOM- SAME TIME

                                 JACK
                        Well hello. Thought I wouldn’t hear 
                        from you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi. It’s Charlie. 

           Charlie makes a FACE like, “what the fuck am I saying?!”

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to know if you’d like, to 
                        hang out, with me, at some poin-
                        time. As friends?
                                 JACK
                        Of course I would! What did you 
                        have in mind?

           Charlie FREEZES. The old her would have thought of something 
           that she KNEW Jack would love. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uhm, I don’t know. Maybe like, 
                        order sushi and watch “The Real 
                        Housewives of NYC”?

           She looks at Betsy nervously. Jack laughs a bit.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JACK
                        That’s, perfect. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cool. So, bye?

                                 JACK
                        Well, do you wanna figure out when?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes. I do. 

                                 JACK
                        Friday night?

           Charlie mouths to Betsy “Friday night.” Betsy puts her 
           POINTER finger into her other curled up POINTER and THUMB, 
           the international SEX gesture. She continues until the finger  
           “FINISHES”.

           ANGLE on a waitress staring at Betsy DISGUSTED.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sounds good. Bye.

           She hangs up. Charlie is smiling like a school girl.

           INT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S PLACE- NIGHT TIME

           Charlie and Jack sit in the living room watching TV. All 
           sorts of sushi is SPRAWLED out across the coffee table.

           We hear “Real Housewives of NYC” PLAYING in the background. 
           They’re sharing a joint. 
                                 JACK
                        Ramona is so obnoxious but like, 
                        sometimes I love that she has no 
                        filter. Especially when she drinks 
                        her Pinot. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I love when she dances. It’s like 
                        she’s having a seizure. 

           Jack looks a little NERVOUS.

                                 JACK 
                        Totally. Hey, so, could you pause 
                        it for a sec?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure.

           Charlie PAUSES the TV. Jack walks to the stereo nearby. He 
           PLUGS in his phone, then turns off a lamp on his way back to 
           the couch, making it darker. Charlie is curious. 

                                 JACK
                        I just, wanna play you this song 
                        real quick. 

           Jack presses PLAY and sits back down. The song starts:

           SONG: “CRYSTALIZED” by The XX

           Charlie looks a little shocked. It’s her “PANTY DROPPER” 
           song. Jack smiles nervously. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What, are you doing? Why are you 
                        playing this?

                                 JACK
                        I have to tell you something. I 
                        lied to you. But, you should know 
                        all about that. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shut up. Lied about what?

                                 JACK
                        I can’t just be your friend 
                        Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What about Emily Leshure?
                                 JACK
                        She’s not my girlfriend. I just, 
                        needed time to figure some stuff 
                        out. Listen, you did some fucked up 
                        shit. Kinda funny, but mostly a 
                        little insane. But along the way, I 
                        still felt like I got to know the 
                        real you anyway. And I felt very 
                        lucky. I liked you, like you. I 
                        just want you to always be you. 
                        Cause, you’re awesome, and you’re, 
                        you. Shit, I’m high.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s the most amazing thing any 
                        guy has ever said to me.

           Jack thinks.

                                 JACK
                        Which part?

                                 CHARLIE
                        All of it!

           She DIVES on him. He wasn’t prepared, but he’s EXCITED. They 
           KISS and ROLL AROUND. It’s messy, and fun, and a little 
           fumbly, but REAL. The song gets louder in the background.

           INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Charlie and Jack cuddle in bed. She tickles his arm.

                                 JACK
                        Oh my God, I have the best idea.

           He flips over on his stomach.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Tickle my back now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine, but then it’s my turn.

                                 JACK
                        Deal, 30 minutes and you’re done.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Aw, it’s cute how you think that’s 
                        gonna happen.
           They kiss. All of the sudden the LIGHTS go ON in the bedroom. 
           Then back OFF. On again. Charlie looks up. There’s a KNOCK on 
           the door.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?

                                 BETSY (O.S.)
                        Are you decent?

                                 JACK
                        Never.

           Betsy opens the door. Wearing Pajama jeans.

                                 BETSY
                        Hey. So, I tried to wire the whole 
                        house to this new “Universal 
                        Remote” that I bought. It’s not 
                        working. Like at all. Sit tight. 

           She shuts the door. 

           Charlie and Jack look at each other and laugh. The lights go 
           OFF again. They kiss and pull up the covers.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHARLIE AND BETSY’S HOUSE- GARAGE DOOR

           We see the GARAGE DOOR going UP, then STOPPING mid way and 
           starting to go back DOWN again. Back UP again, STOPS midway. 

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Jesus!

                                 BETSY (O.S.)
                        Sorry!
