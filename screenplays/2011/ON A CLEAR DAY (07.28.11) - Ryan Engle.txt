                                                            OVER BLACK:

           A SOUND.  Deep and rhythmic.  Undulating.  Throbbing.  
           Otherworldly.  WHUM WHUM, WHUM WHUM.  Growing louder as we:

           COME UP ON:  Night.  A downtown skyline.  High rise 
           reflections roll in the waterfront tide.    Sidewalk vents 
           steam.  Taxi drivers smoke.  Drunk couples stumble home.  A 
           trash truck in reverse.  The SOUND ever present, louder 
           still.  We land on:

           EXT. 4TH AVENUE - SAME

           Fog hangs low over the pavement.  Look closer.  Dust, not 
           fog, caught in the air by invisible waves of static 
           electricity. A MANHOLE cover vibrates spastically, the sound 
           crescendos and suddenly the 20 pound disc shoots into the 
           air; the first of many as down the block they launch one by 
           one by one....

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK:

                        --the magnitude 3.2 earthquake that 
                        rattled local Seattle residents and 
                        businesses early this morning was 
                        one in a flurry of tremors recorded

           CLOSE ON: A clock radio. 6:05am.  Then a framed PHOTOGRAPH of 
           a young family; a man, a woman, and two little girls.  A 
           book, Stephen Hawking’s A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, spined-open 
           to an unfinished chapter.

           And land on PETER FOX, the man from the photograph.  In bed, 
           wide awake and been that way for awhile.  Stubbled.  Worried.

           Cut back to reveal we’re in:

           INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

           Peter’s wife MOLLY sleeping next to him.  Moving boxes 
           stacked, a hurricane of clothes, art leaned against the wall.

                        Housing prices continue to tumble 
                        and national unemployment reached 
                        an all time high for the month of 
                        April.  This is NPR.

           He reaches across Molly and kills the radio.  Stays there, 
           kisses her cheek.

                                 PETER
                        I’ll get the girls up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Peter moves down the hall, shirtless with pajama bottoms.  He 
           is not rippling with muscle.  There are no tattoos.  He is 
           normal.  He stubs his toe on a vacuum cleaner, before opening 
           a door posted with a crayon drawing and we’re:

           INT. CHILD’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           With Peter stepping over stuffed animals.  A LUMP under a 
           blanket in the bed by the window.  A little GIRL on top of a 
           blanket in the bed by the door.  

                                 PETER
                        Come on, girls.  Rise and shine.

           ANNA (10), rolls over, squints.  Groans.  Gives her dad the 
           evil eye.  The lump in the other bed doesn’t move.

                                 PETER
                        Let’s go sweetheart--

           He tugs back the covers and finds his second daughter, EMMA 
           (7), sleeping upside down.  She still sucks her thumb.  

           Anna sits up, rubs her eyes.  Peter kneels by Emma’s bed.  

                                 PETER
                        Morning birthday girl--

           A little hand pushes his face away.  Off this we hear:
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What do we do, Mr. Buggles?  We’re 
                        running out of tiiiiiiiiime!

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           CLOSE ON: Morning Cartoons on a small TV next to stacks of 
           dishes, lamps wrapped in newspaper.

           A kitchen table, where Anna does homework and negotiates a 
           bowl of CHEERIOS.

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        It’s called Binary Code, a whole 
                        bunch of zeroes and ones that make 
                        all kinds of things possible--cell 
                        phones, internet, Ipods--

           Pick up Peter and Emma sitting on the carpet before a coffee 
           table, Emma has a WORKBOOK spread out before her.  

                                 PETER
                        --so when the aide from the science 
                        center brings the satellite dish to

                        turned into binary code, beamed way 
                        into space and then back to China 
                        into a classroom just like yours.

           See black and white comic book characters illustrating what 
           Peter is describing in Emma’s workbook.  A beat then:

                                 EMMA
                        Katie Frielander is coming to my 
                        birthday but she can’t have sweets 
                        cause she’s a diabetic.

           Peter grins.  Pick up Anna, serious, watching her father.

                                 ANNA
                        Dad?  Are you going to get a new 
                        job?

                                 PETER
                        Why?  You don’t want me around 
                        anymore.

                                 ANNA
                        Grandma said you screwed up and got 
                        fired that’s why we have to live in 
                        this dump.

                                 ANNA (cont'd)
                        So, I was just wondering when we 
                        could go home.

           Her earnest eyes break Peter’s heart.  But he hides it:

                                 PETER
                        Well, your grandma’s just a bitter 
                        old woman who judges other people 
                        to make herself feel better.  
                        That’s why we were so happy when 
                        she moved to a cabin in Montana. 

                                 ANNA
                        Daddy!

           Emma giggles.

                                 PETER
                        I have an idea, you should get a 
                        job.

                                 ANNA
                        But I’m a little girl.

           Off her laughter we hear:  TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           CLOSE ON: an EGG TIMER, 30 seconds and counting down.

           Land on Molly.  Cheeks flushed, pretty because of the 
           freckles.  Pink nurse scrubs, hair in a ponytail.  The door 
           partially opened, she watches Peter, Emma and Anna down the 
           hall in the mirror’s reflection.   

           The EGG TIMER goes off.  DING.  She closes the door, locks 
           it.  Steels herself.  Looks down.  Reveal a blue POSITIVE on 
           a PREGNANCY TEST.   

                                 MOLLY
                        Shit.  

           Emotional, this moment even more loaded then it should be.  
           She takes a beat to herself; a beat to pull it together.  
           Then wraps the test in toilet paper and deposits it in the 
           bottom of the trash.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Follow Molly down the hallway until she arrives in the living 
           room, to her left, the small apartment kitchen where Peter 
           supervises the rinsing of breakfast dishes.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Let’s go girls, bus will be here in 
                        five minutes--

           Peter looks up.  Sees Molly, particularly tired, or 
           particularly worried, he can’t tell at the moment.  As the 
           girls pass by:

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t forget your coats.

           And they disappear down the hall.  

                                 MOLLY
                        I need you to pick the girls up 
                        from swim class, I’m gonna try to 
                        see Dr. Phillips this afternoon--

                                 PETER
                        Everything okay?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah, just... Think I might be 
                        coming down with something.

           Turning away from him, sipping coffee.  Peter watches her, 
           somehow feeling the half truth.  

                                 PETER
                        I got that interview with Boeing--
                        finally--I didn’t want to mention 
                        it until--

           On her eyes, guarded, hopeful--

                                 MOLLY
                        I thought you said--

           He shrugs.  Just the small respite from the stress is a 
           relief to her.

           The shrill ring of the phone interrupts the moment--

           As Emma and Anna return, prepped for school.  Peter answers, 
           leaving Molly with the girls.  We hear his inconsequential 
           conversation in the background.

           Molly kneels down face to face with the girls.  
                                 MOLLY
                        You have your cell phone?  

           Anna rolls her eyes, duh.  Emma motions for Molly to come 
           closer.  Whispers between mom and daughter:

                                 EMMA
                        Mommy, I want a Princess cake for 
                        my birthday.

                                 MOLLY
                        You do?  Good thing you told me.

                                 EMMA
                        Why?

                                 MOLLY
                        Now I have a whole day to find the 
                        perfect cake for the perfect girl.

           Emma’s smile a mile wide.  Molly stands, grabs her purse and 
           coat.  Peter hangs up.  Kisses his daughters to a chorus of 
           “bye Dad”--

                                 PETER
                        Have a good day, love you guys.

           As they’re headed out the door, Peter catches Molly’s hand, 
           pulls her to him.  

                                 PETER
                        It’s gonna get better.
                             (beat)
                        Has to right?  At this point it 
                        couldn’t get any worse.

           Molly lays a hand on his cheek, smiles--

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know, unemployed engineers 
                        are kinda sexy--

                                 PETER
                        So I should rock the stubble--

                                 MOLLY
                        Let me know how the interview goes.

           They kiss and the door closes.  Hold on Peter as he drops the 
           pretense.  His body literally sags, as if all we just 
           witnessed took every ounce of his strength.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           On a school bus grinding to a halt.  Anna and Emma board and 
           wave from the windows.  Molly smiles and waves back as it 
           pulls away.  

           And then her smile is gone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter sits on the couch, a TV commercial in the background 
           for BOTOX.  “Look younger, feel better.”  

           Takes in the unpacked boxes.  Almost too weary to get off the 
           couch.  Almost.  He grabs his cell and moves down the hall.  

           On the left side of our screen we see a commercial for LIFE 
           INSURANCE.  “Protect your future.” On the right, we see Peter 
           disappear into the BATHROOM.

           Hold on this.  The commercial. The sound of the bathroom 
           faucet.  And then a Special News Bulletin:

                        We have just received reports of a

                        interchange.  It is unclear at this 
                        time the cause of the blast, 
                        however it is reported that all six

           Her face suddenly darkens.  For a moment she looks scared.

           She looks to her left.  We hear shouting.  A loud whine:

                        I’m sorry-- 

           Static.  The TV.  Electronic blizzard.  

           We push past the TV.  Curl into the bathroom.  Peter toweling 
           his face off, a hard look in the mirror.  He picks up the 
           cell phone.  Dials.
                                 PETER
                        Hey, it’s Peter.  I need you to do 
                        me a favor, I gotta get on the 
                        short list for that VP job at 
                        Boeing--
                             (listens)
                        Yeah, I know everybody and their 
                        mother--  
                             (beat)
                        Can you at least get me an 
                        interview?

           Suddenly we hear a distant BOOM.  Peter flinches.  Lights 
           flicker.   The phone dies.

                                 PETER
                        Hello?  

           From the silence he hears the static of the TV.  Walks to:

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Flips channels.  Nothing.  He picks up the cordless.  No dial 
           tone.  Checks his cell.  Scrolls to Molly.  Busy signal.  

           He walks to the sliding glass doors, steps onto the balcony.  
           There are SIRENS.  SMOKE in the distance.  Can’t see much.  

           What.  The.  Fuck.  

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           He pulls on jeans, a T-shirt, and sneakers.  Grabs his keys, 
           wallet, and cell phone.  Follow him to the:

           LIVING ROOM

           Where he sees Molly, her back to him, shutting the door.  

                                 PETER
                        I just tried to call you-- 

           That’s when she turns.  She’s shaking.  There’s a gash on her 
           forehead.  Dirt and blood staining her scrubs.  

                                 PETER
                        Jesus, Molly--

           Moves to her, she falls against him.

                                 PETER
                        What happened?

           She’s sucking breaths.  Drowning in air.   
                                 PETER
                        Are you okay?  Molly?

           She composes.  Barely.  Blood leaks from her ears, the gash 
           on her forehead.  

                                 MOLLY
                        There was an explosion.  People 
                        were lying in the street.  They 
                        were screaming.  Everybody was 
                        screaming.

                                 PETER
                        I’m gonna call 911.
                             (remembers)
                        Phones are down. 

           He grabs a towel, warms it with water.  Presses it against 
           the gash on her head.

                                 MOLLY
                        There was a woman, Peter.  An old 
                        woman.  She was begging for her 
                        daughter.  I didn’t help her, I 
                        couldn’t, I ran.  

           She’s losing it, horrified.  He takes her hands.  HOLDS them.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m so scared--

                                 PETER
                        I know, Mols.  Just--

           He stops.  We hear something.  A Whoosh.  Otherworldly.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s that?

           Growing louder.  Louder.  What ever it is, it’s approaching.  
           Like a jet engine.

           Louder.  Louder.  LOUDER.  Everything rattles.  Picture 
           frames.  The coffee cup shatters on the floor.   

           Peter holds Molly.  The sound so fucking loud our ears are 
           throbbing.  Shaking.  Shaking.

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM.

           The entire apartment heaves like a 9.0 earthquake erupted and 
           they’re at the epicenter.  TV goes over.  Dishes fly from the 
           counter.  Windows shatter.  
           And then quiet.  Horrifying, deafening quiet.  

           We hear footsteps in the hall outside.  Running.  Shouting.  
           They’re gone.  More footsteps.  Doors opening and closing.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh my god, Peter, the girls.

           It’s occurred to him too.  He stands.

                                 MOLLY
                        Where you going?

                                 PETER
                        The roof.  See if I can get 
                        reception.  

           He’s out the door and:

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Moving quickly towards the stair well.  Hears SHOUTING.  
           Breaks into a run.  Two stairs at a time.  Emerges onto:

           EXT. ROOFTOP DECK - CONTINUOUS

           We are assaulted with SOUND.  Fire alarms.  Engines.  Horns 
           honking.  Sirens.

           Peter sprints along the walk-way and vaults the final steps 
           to the roof where PEOPLE lean against the railing.  His face 
           expresses the horror before we see it.

                                 PETER
                        Oh my god.

           And then we do.  A sky line darkened by massive columns of 
           black smoke.  FIRES raging.  

           A FERRY BOAT is CAPSIZING in the bay.  

           Baghdad on crack.  The explosion moments before turned the 
           University Bridge into a mess of tangled iron.  

           Streaks of flaming light descend from the sky like comets.  
           We wonder if they are SATELLITES tumbling from orbit. 

           A GUY next to Peter:

                                 GUY
                        This is not happening.

           And a GIRL, down the line.
                                 GIRL
                        We’re under attack.  

           BOOM.  Another explosion, see the FIRE BALL.  Everyone ducks.  
           We watch as the SPACE NEEDLE bends, buckles and tips....  

                                 GUY
                        We gotta get outa here.  WE GOTTA 
                        GET THE FUCK OUTA HERE.

           Peter’s world instantly changing forever.  And then SIX 
           CHOPPERS zooms over head.

           Suddenly his home.  His city.  His life.  Is a battle zone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STAIR WELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter takes the stairs, dialing his phone.  Busy signal.  
           Again.  Busy signal.  

                                 PETER
                        Come on.  Come on.

           Busy signal.  Down another flight.  Phone rings--

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Daddy?

           Commotion behind the voice.  Crashing.  A FIRE ALARM.

                                 PETER
                        Anna?  You okay?  Is Emma with you?  

                                 ANNA
                        She’s in her classroom. 

                                 PETER
                        I want you to take the phone to 
                        your teacher.  Can you do that?

           Muffled voices.  Rustling.  Movement.  Then:

                                 PANICKED VOICE
                        Hello--

                                 PETER
                        Christine, it’s Pete Fox.  Is 
                        everybody alright? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Everybody’s fine. We’re headed to 
                        the gym, police are on the way.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHRISTINE (cont'd)
                        I gotta go, Peter, I’m sorry, just 
                        get here as soon as you can--

                                 PETER
                        WAIT, WAIT--

           We hear more chaos in the background, somebody screams, SLAM--

                                 PETER
                        Hello?  Christine?   

           Sirens.  Feet Running.  Busy signal.  As he pushes into:

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 

           Molly is gone.  A blood stain on the couch.  

           Then he hears it.  The shower running.  Goes to the:

           BATHROOM  

           And pulls back the shower door.

           She’s topless on the tub floor, water pouring over her.  
           Hollow raccoon eyes that flick towards:

           Two inches of serrated SHRAPNEL protruding from her rib cage 
           under her left breast.  The water pools with blood.  She’s 
           trembling uncontrollably.    

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m going into shock.

           Peter is paralyzed before her.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Find something to stop the 
                        bleeding.  Something clean.
                             (he doesn’t move)
                        Peter?

           Finally he nods, we’re with him as he races into the BEDROOM, 
           grabs a clean T-shirt from the drawer.  Back to her, climbing 
           in the shower, water pouring over them.

                                 MOLLY
                        Wrap it.  As much pressure as 
                        possible.

           He ties the T-shirt around her back.  Both soaking wet--  

                                 PETER
                        Now what?
                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know.  I don’t want to die.

                                 PETER
                        You are not going to die.   

                                 MOLLY
                        Where are the girls?  

                                 PETER
                        At the school.  Police are on the 
                        way there.

                                 MOLLY
                        What did you see?  On the roof?

                                 PETER
                        Nothing.  Everything’s fine.

           One more look at the wound and he decides, leaves.  Stay with 
           Molly now.  

           As she struggles to regain her breath.  She rises to her 
           feet, her hand against the wall, steady now.  Steady.

           Suddenly the water goes off.  The lights go out.  A 
           horrifying beat as all creature comforts are gone.

           HALLWAY

           With Peter as he pulls a lock box from the closet, opens it, 
           removes a .45 PISTOL and LOADED CLIP.  Moving back to Molly, 
           stuffing the gun in his belt.

           Their eyes meet.  White T-shirt already soaked with blood.  

                                 PETER
                        I’m taking you to the hospital.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter, still wet and an arm around Molly, now dressed, burst 
           through the door into the parking garage.  It’s an onslaught 
           of sound.  Sirens.  Honking.  

           Quickly towards his ancient BMW.  He helps her in the 
           passenger seat.  Starts the car.

           Reverses.  In drive, approaches the garage gate.  Hits the 
           garage door button.  Gate doesn’t open.  
                                 PETER
                        Hang on.

           Backs up the car.  Tires squeal.  Gasses it and throttles 
           into the gate, which breaks.  Car bursts through onto the 
           road.  Engine smoking.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Peter throws the car in drive.  Peels out.  Stay with them in 
           the car as he guns it down the street, doesn’t bother with 
           the stop sign--

           Then see Peter through Molly’s eyes.  We also see a pick up 
           TRUCK barreling towards us.

           And WHAM.  The truck T-BONES them.  Like a freight train.  
           The world is rocked.  Tips, around and around.

           Rolls 40 feet and finally comes to a halt.  A beat.  Silence.

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           On Peter.  He’s hanging upside down from his seat belt.  
           Everything is painfully SLOW.  Blood leaks from his ears.  
           SOUND distorted; like we’re underwater.   

           Looks, the passenger seat is EMPTY.  Pushes open the door.  
           Releases his seat belt.  Tumbles to the pavement.  

           See the DRIVER of the smashed truck get out.  A broken nose.  
           Driver runs up the street.  

           Suddenly Molly is there, desperately screaming words we can’t 
           hear; Peter’s eyes glazed.  Then:

                                 MOLLY
                        Are you hurt?  Answer me, please.  

           He blinks.  Ripping for his senses.  Eyes flick to Molly’s 
           bleeding wound, the sun burning through the hazy sky, the 
           remains of the car.  A painful breath.  Finally:

                                 PETER
                        I’m okay-- Jesus-- You okay?

           She nods.  He stands, leans against what used to be his car.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What do we do now?

           A moment of decision, Peter chews his lip, then:  
                                 PETER
                        Hospital’s only six blocks.  Can 
                        you make it?

                                 MOLLY
                        Are you sure--maybe--maybe you 
                        should get the girls and I’ll wait 
                        here for help.

                                 PETER
                        I don’t think anybody’s gonna help 
                        us.

           Off her panic we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BROADWAY - TOP OF THE HILL - MOMENTS LATER

           Cars are bumper to bumper as far as the eye can see.  
           Thousands of PEOPLE run, some alone, some holding the hands 
           of loved ones.  Smoke plumes from destroyed buildings.  An 
           onslaught of noise.  

           Find Molly and Peter.  A mix of terror and wonder.  

                                 MOLLY
                        This can’t be real.  

           Someone throws a brick through an electronics shop.  

           There’s an elderly MAN and his DOG.  Sitting on a bus stop 
           bench.  He pets the dog who sleeps in his lap.  Man is 
           bleeding, covered in dust. We realize he’s softly singing.  

           A terrified WOMAN runs past, bumping into Molly. 

           And then that sound.  We remember it.  We can feel it.  A 
           distant whine, closer now.  CLOSER.  The world RATTLES again.  
           Cars.  Parking meters.  Storefront windows.  An unnatural 
           wind violently throws back our clothes, our hair.  The sound 
           fills our hearts like a fucking nightmare. VVVVVRRRRRRRRRRRR.    

           And somewhere it hits.  The concussion rocks us back, 
           knocking Peter and Molly to the ground.  Debris as big as a 
           car and as small as a coffee cup flies at them.  Tossed by an 
           otherworldly power. 

           Peter covers Molly as the projectiles flip past them.

           And then the cloud.  A sandstorm of trash and debris and lung 
           choking dust. We suddenly hear nothing.
           There are Peter and Molly, hunched together.  Barely visible 
           in the swirling mass.  SILENCE.  

           Dead fucking silence.

           And then it roars back.  The sounds.  The screaming.  Peter 
           looks up and the MAN, the BENCH, and the DOG, are gone.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           TREES and APARTMENTS and CARS are covered in ash.  FAMILIES 
           pack vehicles, CHILDREN cry.  TIRES squeal as a CAR roars by.  
           Peter and Molly weave through the insanity.    

           Glancing up, Peter sees other PEOPLE watching from their 
           shattered windows.  

           The panic around us is unbearable.

           Suddenly, through the tangled mess of frantic bodies.  Peter 
           sees something.... Black and white, blue and red lights.

           Down the street.  A road block of THREE POLICE CARS--

                                 PETER
                        Come on, Molly.

           Peter and Molly fight their way through the frantic bodies--

                                 PETER
                        Out of the way.  Move, MOVE.

           PUSHING and SHOVING and finally getting clear only to grab 
           Molly’s arm--

                                 PETER
                        Wait.

           See eight COPS in flack jackets, rifles in position using 
           their cars as cover, aiming down a hidden street.  A beat, 
           they open fire.  A total barrage.  Finally it stops.  

           That’s when we hear a sudden WHOOSH, then:

           BOOM.

           Something hits the road block, all three cruisers go up in a 
           massive fire ball, every WINDOW within a hundred yards 
           shatters.   

           And then we hear GEARS turning.  Whining.  Pavement crunching 
           under phenomenal weight.  
           A TANK emerges from the street.  Not like any tank we’ve 
           seen.  Sleek, black. 

           Peter, Molly, the crowd are too stunned to move.

           A loud speaker comes alive aboard the tank:

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        For your own safety, please remain 
                        inside your homes.  Any civilian on 
                        the street will be detained. 

           The massive track pulverizing the torched cop cars beneath 
           its tread.  On Peter, the insanity of it all, then--

                                 MOLLY
                        PETER, COME ON.

           The crowd is moving away from the tank in terror, then--

                                 COP
                        HELP ME, PLEASE GOD.

           Peter looks back, sees a COP, trapped underneath debris, 
           desperately clawing.  The tank moments from smashing him into 
           raw meat.  

                                 MOLLY
                        PETER.

           And suddenly Peter runs as if out of body.... Towards the 
           cop.  Molly begging him to STOP STOP STOP.

           Peter baseball slides on the pavement, cop’s level. 

                                 PETER
                        HANG ON.

           Planting his feet, heaving against the obstruction.  Cop 
           screams as the tank groans closer.

           A final heave, the debris gives, and Peter yanks the cop out 
           from under the tread.  Tank passing by, glass and metal 
           exploding under the force.  

           On Peter and cop, catching their breath.  Looking up at the 
           huge instrument of war as it continues its destructive march 
           down another street.  

           A beat, a nod of thanks.  But it only gets worse.   

           Because here come the WOLVES.
           We’ll call them that because we don’t know what else to call 
           them.  They are robotic, like a DARPA EXPERIMENT gone wrong.  
           Four metal legs with rubberized joints and protruding wires 
           sprouting from a center mechanism the size of a lawn-mower 
           engine.  The head is a double lens camera system mounted on 
           top of a single ball bearing that rotates inside a shell like 
           a knee cap or a steadicam.  The face of the WOLF is a big 
           fucking gun.  

           There are two of them and their crazy legs are slipping, 
           sliding and running across debris.  Towards Peter and Molly 
           and the cop. 

                                 PETER
                        GO GO GO GO.

           Helping the cop and joining Molly among the crowd of 
           terrified people.

           And the WOLVES pursue like the hounds of robotic hell.  They 
           are immediately among the crowd, swinging their noses like 
           baseball bats, people fly in the air, knocked sideways.   

           To Peter’s right, the cop is suddenly lifted into the sky by 
           a gun barrel nose and tossed.  

           Peter pulls Molly down a side street, away from the crowd.   
           They weave between cars and duck behind an abandoned MINIVAN.  
           Peter looks back.  The wolves are gone from sight.  Molly is 
           trembling, eyes fever-wide.  

           Peter’s hands find her cheeks.

                                 PETER
                        Look at me, Molly, look at me.
                             (she does)
                        We’re okay.  Just breathe.  

           She nods, panicked intake.  He hugs her.  A moment of peace.  
           But just a moment, because the wolves come back.  Peter sees 
           them in a cracked windshield reflection.  

           Worse still, cars are flipping and bouncing like toys, the 
           wolves whacking them out of the way with their snouts.  

                                 PETER
                        We need to move.  NOW NOW NOW. 

           Stay with Peter and Molly as they sprint in the opposite 
           direction.  The wolves clock them and pursue. 

           Leaping what Peter and Molly dodge; whining gears and RIP-RIP 
           footsteps like a fucking nightmare.  
           They cross an empty street, towards the underpass of a 
           BRIDGE.  Look left to see a BURNING BUS, racing down the 
           hill.

           We’re out of its way, but one of the wolves isn’t so lucky, 
           smashed by the out of the control rig....

           The other LEAPS over the bus as we follow:

           Peter and Molly under the BRIDGE, swerving through jammed 
           traffic.  Behind them the WOLF vaults the gridlock, legs 
           rotating up and hooking onto the BOTTOM of the BRIDGE so it’s 
           running UPSIDE DOWN like some perverted spider monkey.  

           Peter yanks Molly down a grassy HILL; sliding, rolling, and 
           up again as the WOLF swings itself from the bridge, sailing 
           through the air--

           And landing.  Its gun barrel head swivels, but its targets 
           are gone.

           Reveal Peter and Molly in the dark shadows of a sewage pipe, 
           having barely squeezed through the drainage bars.  Their 
           breath echoes.  

           A pregnant beat.  

           Then the gun barrel nose slowly moves into frame, inches from 
           Peter and Molly.  Clearly it doesn’t see them.  But it’s 
           looking.  Within seconds the entire head is inside.  See the 
           intricate array of wires.  The complex machinery.  But it 
           stops.  The rest of its body can’t fit through the bars.  

           On Molly and Peter holding their breath.  Suddenly the single 
           eye turns, dilates, and has them in its sights.  Peter 
           doesn’t wait to find out what happens next.

           Because it happens fast.

           The Wolf’s gun rotates towards them at the same moment Peter 
           kick its head.  It opens fire, bullets spit with a deafening 
           roar sparking and pinging down the pipe walls.   Peter kicks 
           the head over and over again, forcing the barrel away.  
           Suddenly the wolf is trying to back out, but it’s trapped 
           between the bars--

           And Peter keeps kicking.  See the legs suddenly spasm, as if 
           the fucking thing is dying.  See the head spark as Peter 
           kicks the shit out of it, bending the metal, separating the 
           wires.  Hear Peter yelling for it to fucking die.  As he 
           kicks and kicks and kicks until finally the wolf slumps to 
           the ground.  

           Dead.  
           Peter hugs Molly’s face to his chest.

           We find Molly.  Vacant eyes.  We find Peter.  Fighting to 
           keep his shit together.  What the fuck is happening?

           Then something catches his eye.  He reaches out and wrenches 
           an exposed DATA CHIP from the broken head.  As if he’s seen 
           it before.  A beat.

           And a NOISE startles us.  The machine is still alive.  But 
           only the eye.  It rotates, dilates, and fixes on Peter--his 
           reflection in the circular lens--a light just behind it.  The 
           goddamn thing is looking at him, as if remembering, as if 
           taking a fucking picture.

           And then the light goes out.  

           Off this we hear the familiar sound of an electric guitar 
           wailing Hendrix’ version of the STAR SPANGLED BANNER.  
           Continuing over:

           EXT. BROADWAY BLVD. - SERIES OF SHOTS

           An abandoned STROLLER.  A TEENAGER sprints down the middle of 
           the street.  A CAR hangs impossibly from a tree.   

           Then we find the source of the music:

           A MAN standing on the roof of a MUSIC SHOP, playing his 
           electric guitar hooked to a battery powered amp.  Like a 
           great fuck you to the world.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           We see the ER.  WINDOWS smashed.  GURNEY’S tipped over.  A 
           crashed AMBULANCE, lights silently flash red white, red 
           white.  A dead CAT in the street.  Otherwise deserted. 

           And finally we find:

           Peter, peering out.  He looks down at Molly, ghastly pale, 
           sweat glistened, blood soaked; prone against the ALLEY WALL.

           EXT. HOSPITAL/ER - DAY

           Peter and Molly approach, her arm propped over his shoulder, 
           stumbling towards the threshold of the sliding glass doors.  
           Strangely, the doors hiss open.  
           INT. HOSPITAL/ER - CONTINUOUS

           The WAITING ROOM is deserted.  Lobby music; incongruous to 
           everything else.  Lights FLICKER.  Chairs tipped over, purses 
           and cell phones and magazines forsaken by their owners.   

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter--

           He follows her eyes to a dead security GUARD behind the admin 
           desk, a 7 inch hole in his abdomen.  

           Beyond the guard is the admittance door, a Plexiglas window 
           spider webbed underneath a red sign that reads HOSPITAL 
           PERSONNEL ONLY. 

                                 PETER
                        I’m gonna take a look around.  

           He brushes back her sweat soaked bangs.  Off her panic:

                                 PETER
                        We’ll be fine, okay?  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ER - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter pushes into a modern triage center.  Deserted.   

           Bloody gauze and towels thrown about, abandoned IV’s--as if 
           the doctors, patients and nurses simply vanished.

           Worse still; scorched bullet holes pockmark the walls. 

           The hopelessness is pervasive and Peter feels it like a 
           shotgun to the chest.  What the hell is he going to do now?

           Suddenly an intercom TONES.  Then:

                                 INTERCOM
                        Attention.  Hospital personnel and 
                        visitors please report to the 
                        rotunda for immediate evacuation.   

           That’s when we hear a CRASH.  Peter races back into the:

           WAITING ROOM

           Where he discovers Molly in a heap on the floor--

                                 PETER
                        MOLLY--
           By her side, rolling her over.  Feeling her face.  She’s 
           trembling, drenched in sweat and blood.  Her eyes fluttering--

                                 PETER
                        Wake up, Molly.  WAKE UP.   

           And her eyes open.  The panic of death unbearable.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter.  I’m not gonna make it.  

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Peter kicks open the door, carries Molly to the exam table.  
           He rifles through the drawers, finds blankets.  

                                 MOLLY
                        All this? It’s not possible, is it?  
                        Another country?  Terrorists?  It’s 
                        something worse.

           Curling the light cotton blanket around her shoulders.

                                 PETER
                        They’re evacuating the hospital.  
                        I’m going to the rotunda.  I’ll get 
                        a doctor.   

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter.  The girls.  

                                 PETER
                        I know.  Molly.  I know.  We’re 
                        gonna get them.  Together. 

           He kisses her forehead.  

                                 PETER
                        I’ll be back.  

           EXT. EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Peter shuts the door behind him.  In that instant.  He fights 
           a breakdown.  And moves.

           EXT. ER/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Peter running.  He finds a sign directing him towards THE 
           ROTUNDA.  Halogens casting an alien green glow.  
           He weaves past a tipped crash cart, abandoned gurneys.  At 
           the end of the hall he finds double doors, padlocked and 
           chained.  Beside it is a door leading towards: 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Peter ascends to the 2nd floor and exits into another: 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Leading him towards the CANCER WARD.  To his left is a PLAY 
           ROOM, forgotten toys tossed about.  Ahead he sees:

           INT. SKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Stretching over the street.  Glass walls on each side. That’s 
           when he hears it.  MOVEMENT.  ENGINES idling.        

           He peers through the glass wall and on the street below sees 
           several large FLATBED TRUCKS in the sunlight.  PATIENTS, 
           DOCTORS, NURSES, STAFF are loading onto the trucks. 

           SOLDIERS with ASSAULT RIFLES, FLAK JACKETS supervise the 
           boarding, like ranchers at a cattle run.  Then:

                                 VOICE
                        Sir?

           Peter turns to reveal a SOLDIER, his hand hovering over the 
           sidearm at his waist.

                                 PETER
                        Thank god.  My wife, she needs a 
                        doctor--

           Moving towards the soldier--

                                 SOLDIER
                        Stay where you are.

           His hand now on the pistol.  Peter stops.  Threatened.  
           Realizing quickly all of this is somehow wrong. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        What’s your name, sir?

                                 PETER
                        What difference does it make?  My 
                        wife needs help.  

                                 SOLDIER
                        I understand that.  Tell me your 
                        name and I’ll figure out how to 
                        help you.
                                 PETER
                        Peter--

           It’s at that moment something catches the corner of Peter’s 
           eye.  Something about the procession below--

                                 PETER
                        --Fox.

           Suddenly a panicked ELDERLY PATIENT breaks from the group, 
           his blue gown flitting behind him, buttocks exposed.  That’s 
           when we realize his hands are zip-tied behind his back.  

           We also realize that the soldier standing in front of Peter 
           has pulled his firearm.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Sir, I need you to get on the 
                        ground, face down.  Right now.

                                 PETER
                        What?

           As down below, a SOLDIER glances up at another as if to ask 
           for permission.  His SUPERIOR nods.  

                                 PETER
                        What is this?  

           The soldier below raises his rifle and pops three rounds in 
           the patient’s back.  The old man crumples as the others 
           scream in horror.  

           Back on Peter as the man is commanding:

                                 SOLDIER
                        GET DOWN ON THE GROUND.  I AM NOT 
                        GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN.

                                 PETER
                        Wait-- 

           But he’s moving towards Peter, cranking Peter’s arm behind 
           his back, throwing him to the ground, a knee in his spine.  
           He yanks Peter’s gun from his belt.

                                 PETER
                        I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        STAY STILL AND SHUT UP.

           With Peter secured, he touches the side of his helmet:  
                                 SOLDIER
                        Bravo one this is Tiger 6.

                                 SOLDIER
                        HVT-1 secured at divergent point 
                        9:30:23.

                                 RADIO
                        Copy, Tiger 6.  Bird in route.

                                 PETER
                        Listen.  Please.  I’m an American 
                        citizen.  I live at 151 Cedar 
                        street-- 

                                 SOLDIER
                        I know Peter, I’ve been waiting for 
                        you.

           On Peter as he processes the horror of the comment, then:  

           We hear a soft CLICK and a man’s voice.

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Drop your weapon and step away.  

           Look up to see a security GUARD, sweating more bullets than 
           in the clip of his firearm, squared at the soldier.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Hey, take it easy.  

                                 GUARD
                        I SAID STEP AWAY.

           The soldier releases Peter, who crab-crawls back.  Guard’s 
           eyes flick to Peter.

                                 GUARD
                        You okay, son?

           And that’s all it takes.  The soldier’s second firearm is out 
           of his holster and discharging rounds into the security 
           guard’s chest.  Blink and you miss it.  Soldier turns back. 

           But Peter is gone.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           If you’ve ever run for you life, multiply it by ten.  
           One corner, two.  Peter knows the soldier is nipping his ass,  
           knows if he catches him.  He’s fucking dead.

           Legs pumping.  Needs a stairwell, a window.  Anything.

           But this.  He finds himself at a dead end.

           The elevator well.  Hits the button.  No power.  No time.  He 
           looks back towards the hall, panicked, as we find:

           THE SOLDIER 

           Moving down the hall.  Methodically.  Gun up.  He enters the 
           elevator well.   Abandoned.

           Then we find Peter, hidden behind him, trash can over his 
           head.  He heaves it down on the soldier, who falls, gun 
           skittering across the floor.  Peter goes for it, but the 
           soldier grabs him.  Immediately up.  Grappling.

           And herein lies the problem: soldier is basically twice his 
           size.  And fully trained. 

           Soldier pulls out a massive BLADE.  

           Peter gets his legs under him.  Soldier thrusts the knife, 
           Peter barely able to grab his wrist.  Biceps bulge, pushing 
           the tip closer and closer to Peter’s neck. 

           He’s going to die.  But not yet.

           One last kick that connects with the soldier’s knee cap.  
           Snapping his leg unnaturally with an agonizing scream.

           Peter grabs the knife as the soldier clutches his backwards 
           leg and shoves it cleanly through the soldier’s rib cage, 
           into the soft mulch of his guts.  

           Surprised, panicked, the soldier reaches for the knife. Tries 
           to pull it out, eyes flicking to Peter, like a puppy who just 
           got kicked.  The solider realizes it’s futile.  

           Bloody gulps of air.  The breathing quickly slows.  Peter 
           backs into the corner; aghast.  

                                 SOLDIER
                        Drink of water?  Please man, a 
                        drink of water?

           His eyes swim.  Blood oozing between his teeth.  He looks at 
           the knife in guts.  

                                 PETER
                        Who are you?  
           His eyes cloud.  He’s fighting for consciousness.  Peter is 
           suddenly angry.

                                 PETER
                        WHO ARE YOU?

                                 SOLDIER
                        It’s okay.  I’m not really dying.  
                        Not really.

           He looks at Peter with great relief.

                                 SOLDIER
                        How can I?  I’m not even born yet.

           And then he coughs.  His fingers curl.  The soldier dies.

           Peter stares at the dead man.  Trying to comprehend.  A 
           moment of total silence--of stunned revelation.

           And then Peter’s up, grabbing the soldier’s field pack.  He 
           shoves the .45 back in his belt and palms the soldier’s 
           assault rifle.  A look both ways and he’s running.

           EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           With Peter as he stops at a hallway junction.  Leans against 
           the wall, peers around, sees TWO SOLDIERS moving towards him.  
           He draws quickly back.  Not sure if they saw him.  A breath.  
           He looks again.  They open fire.  Plaster chips and pops.  
           Guess they did.  Peter takes off.   

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Pounding the flights, sweating like a madman.  Breath beyond 
           exerted.  See the soldiers pursuing from below.  He exits 
           into:

           ANOTHER HALLWAY

           Leading to a WAITING ROOM, enclosed in glass.  A dead end.  
           Windows overlook a two story free fall to the lobby below.  
           An intricate FOUNTAIN center-room.   We HEAR the FOOTSTEPS of 
           the soldiers growing louder.   

           Peter is trapped.  A beat.

           Then he removes his belt, laces it through the door handles 
           and cinches the doors shut, just as:

           SLAM SLAM SLAM

           Soldiers pound against the sealed door and the belt’s 
           tearing.
           SLAM SLAM SLAM.  The door’s about to give.

           There’s no choice.  Peter sprints down the hall, throws his 
           hands in front of his face, steeling himself before he 
           hurtles through the glass--

           FROM BELOW

           Peter sails towards us, immersed in a shimmering cloud of 
           broken glass.  Falling.  Falling.  Falling.  Then splash.

           INT. MAIN LOBBY/FOUNTAIN - DAY

           Peter sputters to the surface of the FOUNTAIN.  Cranes back 
           at the window he just leaped through, astonished he’s alive.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Find Molly curled up on the bed, wrapped in blankets.  Peter 
           enters.

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter.

           He goes to her. 

                                 PETER
                        You okay?

           She nods as he wraps her in a hug.  Her entire lower half is 
           soaked with blood.  Her breath POPS short and fast.    

                                 PETER
                        We have to get out of here, Molly.

                                 MOLLY
                        I can’t.

                                 PETER
                        We don’t have a choice.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. HOSPITAL/LOADING DOCK - DAY

           A door is kicked open.  Peter supports Molly as they run up a 
           loading ramp towards the street.  The square of daylight 
           completely blown out as our heroes pound the incline.

           What we HEAR is what they’re about to see.  GUNFIRE.  
           EXPLOSIONS.  The unbelievable ROAR of WAR MACHINES.  
           Emerging onto the street we’re blasted with a scene of such 
           intense chaos that D-Day looks like a Saturday morning 
           cartoon.

           The hills of downtown Seattle descend below us.  BLACK 
           pillars of SMOKE from halved buildings.  

           See a squadron of of F-22 RAPTORS arching into the city met 
           by anti-aircraft weaponry, knocking two and three at a time 
           out of the horizon like paper airplanes.  Some fire off 
           missiles that corkscrew off target, detonating in suspended 
           FIREBALLS over the city.  

           The I-5 freeway runs between us and downtown.  Familiar 
           uniformed infantry engage in a fierce fire-fight with 5 
           WOLVES, cutting tracer fire into waves of our troops.

           The sight is devastating.  The end of the world is no fucking 
           whimper.  

           Suddenly a CHOPPER sails over us, arcs, revealing two fifty 
           cal machine gun mounts.   Even more disconcerting; there are 
           no pilots.

                                 PETER
                        You gotta be kidding me.  RUN.

           And the fifty cals open up behind our heroes, gashing 
           pavement in chunks.  

           We follow Molly and Peter as HE nearly drags her across the 
           street and into a parking structure, the chopper banking hard 
           in pursuit, the hornet BUZZ and SLAP of bullets constant.  

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER

           Suddenly Molly falls, taking Peter down with her.  He rolls 
           her to her back as she coughs blood, barely able to breath.

           Her fingers grope at his shoulders.  A sudden resolve in 
           those panicked eyes.  She isn’t going anywhere.

                                 MOLLY
                             (gasping)
                        Listen to me, listen.  I’ll only 
                        slow you down.

                                 PETER
                        Molly--

                                 MOLLY
                        Save our girls--
                                 PETER
                        I’m not leaving you here--

                                 MOLLY
                        OUR DAUGHTERS, PETER PLEASE.

           Peter looks up, see the chopper hovering outside, see the 50 
           call swinging to target.  

           They’re sitting ducks.... He looks back at Molly, her hand on 
           his cheek, telling him it’s okay.  Leave me here.  But this 
           is not a decision he’s ready to make.  

           That’s when his eyes alight on a solution.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           An AMBULANCE crashes through the gate onto the street, 
           fishtailing, tires rolling up plumes of smoke.  

           Behind it, we see the chopper slide into view.

           INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Peter drives.  Molly in the back.  Pushing 70, 80, 90.  The 
           chopper opens up, shredding the world around us as Peter 
           plows through dumpsters, slamming the ambulance into an 
           alley.  Looks up, the chopper has to go OVER THE BUILDING.  

                                 PETER
                        You okay?  

           She nods, curled into the corner of ambulance.  

           Suddenly Peter emerges onto a main street.  

           The chopper is there waiting.

                                 PETER
                        HANG ON.

           Peter breaks hard, loses control, slides into a full 180 
           turn, rams the gas.  The chopper comes on hot.  But it gets 
           worse.  Two LARGE METAL objects detach from the chopper’s 
           wings and fall towards the pavement, unfurling to reveal TWO 
           WOLVES that roar after them.   

           Peter fishtails into another alley.  In his rearview we see:
           Wolves running up the SIDES OF THE BUILDINGS like gravity 
           doesn’t mean shit.  One is alongside them.  Peter careens 
           against it, smashing it to the wall--

           But it keeps coming.

           He smashes it again, this time it crumples, flips under the 
           tires, sending the ambulance AIRBORNE and crashing down.  The 
           back doors break off, sparking as they skip away on the 
           concrete.  

           The second WOLF continues pursuit.   

           Up ahead is a building made entirely of glass, Peter makes 
           like he’s going to go right through it.  Behind him, the Wolf 
           leaps into the air, going for the top of the ambulance.  

           At the last second, Peter breaks, turns, skids.  The wolf 
           smashes into the building in a shower of glass.  

           Peter is off again.  Looks back at Molly.  

           Then looks left to see the distorted shape of the Wolf 
           plowing through walls INSIDE THE BUILDING.

           Up ahead is the gaping maw of a tunnel.  Peter guns it--

           Then he clocks the chopper banking behind him.

                                 PETER
                        MOLLY, GET DOWN.  

           Peter hits 90 as the CHOPPER OPENS FIRE, bullets WHIZ inside 
           the ambulance.  Metal and glass and debris cloud the air--

           SUDDENLY THE WORLD GOES BLACK

           When Peter looks back, we see that we’re inside a TUNNEL. 

           And the Chopper isn’t stopping--it pursues them inside, nose 
           down, skids SPARKING on the pavement.  

           And it’s gaining on them.  Peter can’t fucking believe it--

           But the spell is broken as he yanks the wheel, dodging an 
           abandoned car--

           Ahead is an obstacle course of cars, trucks and mini vans, he 
           weaves as the chopper plows through, still gaining--

           And then a suicidal possibility.

           A jackknifed gas tanker laying across the tunnel’s expanse.  
           But Peter doesn’t stop.  He hurtles the ambulance forward, 
           gunning for the tiny space between the wall and the tanker--

           He YELLS as they blast through, sparks like fire, but they 
           barely make it.  The CHOPPER isn’t so lucky--

           BOOM.  It collides with the tanker and the resulting fireball 
           would make Satan jealous--like rolling red hot thunder it 
           cannons behind them--

           Just as the ambulance bursts from the tunnel; a firestorm 
           erupting into the sky.  

           A beat.

           Peter driving, manic.  Wild eyed.  

                                 PETER
                        Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit--

           And then THUNK.  Something just landed on top of the 
           ambulance.  A moment later, a wolf latches onto the hood, its 
           gun metal nose smashing through the windshield-- 

           Peter wrenches the wheel.  The ambulance swerves, tips, and 
           goes over.  Molly and Peter roll and tumble, tossed like 
           toys, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT flies everywhere as the vehicle’s 
           inertia takes them:

           Sliding off the street, through mailboxes, a picket fence, a 
           grass yard, and coming to rest in someone’s driveway.

           Take a breath.  

           INT. AMBULANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Disoriented, Peter crawls from the ambulance.  His face 
           blackened by soot, a bloody gash on his neck.  And then he 
           stops.  His eyes reflect the horror.

           The wolf approaches, methodically, like a hunter who just 
           found its wounded prey, one bullet short of finality.  It 
           stands over him, gun aimed.  The eye dilates.  Then a voice--

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Daddy--

           Both Peter and the wolf turn, a little boy stands in the 
           front door clutching a teddy bear.  

                                 PETER
                        NO!

           But the wolf ignores the boy, turns back to Peter.
           That’s when a JOLT of electricity rips through the Mech’s 
           body.  It goes rigid.  Sparks.  Dies.

           Reveal a 50 something MAN holding a pair of JUMPER CABLES 
           hooked to a large generator-- 

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter and the man (GREG) carry Molly inside the house towards 
           a living room couch.  A TEENAGE GIRL (IRIS), watches wide 
           eyed--

                                 GREG
                        Honey.  Clean towels, bandages 
                        whatever you can find.

           Peter hovers over Molly on the couch, holds her face in his 
           hands.  The little boy with the Teddy Bear runs in--

                                 GREG
                        JOEY, GO TO YOUR ROOM.  NOW.

           Joey beelines out, hear him pattering up the stairs, wailing.

                                 PETER
                        Molly, look at me.  MOLLY.

           Her eyes open.

                                 PETER
                        I’m going to help you.  You need to 
                        tell me how.

                                 MOLLY
                        I can’t, I can’t--

                                 PETER
                        Yes you can.  There are medical 
                        supplies in the ambulance.  Tell me 
                        how to fix you. 
                             (beat)
                        Do not give up on me.

           Suddenly her eyes focus and she finds clarity.

                                 MOLLY
                        Clamp, catheter, stitches--

           MOMENTS LATER

           Peter returns with an armful of medical equipment.
                                 MOLLY
                        A mirror, clean water.

           Peter looks up at Greg who runs into the other room--

                                 MOLLY
                        My shirt--

           He props her up, she winces and cries out as he pulls off her 
           crimson-top, her entire chest a mess of blood.  Greg returns 
           with a mirror and bottles of water at the same moment Iris 
           arrives with clean towels.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Hold the mirror--

           She pours water over her chest, cleaning away the blood. 
           Molly clocks the wound, fighting to keep her shit together.

                                 MOLLY
                        Remove the shrapnel.  Pull, quick, 
                        straight, not to the side--

           Peter nods.  A beat.  A breath.  Then pulls.  Molly screams.  

           On Greg, horrified.  Iris is crying--

           Tossing the shrapnel, Peter holds up the mirror.  Her voice 
           is strained, words erupting between painful breaths.

                                 MOLLY
                        I need to see inside, if it’s a 
                        lacerated artery.  You have to pry 
                        the wound open.

           Peter hands Greg the mirror.  He digs his fingers into the 
           gash and gently spreads the skin and muscle.  Molly whimpers, 
           but remains conscious--

                                 MOLLY
                        I think... I think it’s 
                        superficial.  That’s good.

                                 PETER
                        Okay... okay now what?

           But Molly’s losing it again.   

                                 PETER
                        Molly, please--

                                 MOLLY
                        Reinflate the lung--
                                 PETER
                        How.

                                 MOLLY
                        Catheter.  Stab.  

           Indicates ust above her collar bone.  Peter nods.  Rips the 
           catheter’s package open.

                                 MOLLY
                        Wait, listen--if I pass out--stitch 
                        the wound closed--anticeptic cream, 
                        then bandages.

           Her hand fumbles for his, clasping together.

                                 MOLLY
                        I love you.

                                 PETER
                        I love you too.

           Peter raises the catheter.  His eyes never leaving Molly’s.

           And stabs.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK:

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON: the CONTENTS of the soldier’s pack unloaded onto 
           the kitchen counter in a heap.

           Cut back to see Peter, Greg and Iris.   

                                 PETER
                        My daughters are at their school, 
                        about ten block from here.  I need 
                        bottles of water, food, anything 
                        you can spare.  

                                 GREG
                        Sure, of course, there’s water in 
                        the fridge--

           Peter opens the stainless steel door, loads the backpack.

           That’s when we notice how bad the gash is on his neck, blood 
           runs freely down his shirt.

                                 IRIS
                        Hey, uh.  Dude.  Your neck.

           Peter stop, absently reaches back, feels the blood and skin.
                                 PETER
                        I’m fine--

                                 IRIS
                        It doesn’t look fine.

                                 GREG
                        Let us dress it--

                                 PETER
                        I’M FINE--

                                 GREG
                        If you bleed out on the way, what 
                        happens then?

           Suddenly a massive EXPLOSION nearby shakes the foundation, 
           followed by the RATA-TAT-TAT of gunfire.

           As if to punctuate his point.

           Finally Peter nods.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Peter sits restless on a stool as Greg begins cleaning the 
           wound.  Iris thumbs through the contents of the soldier’s 
           pack-- 

                                 GREG
                        I was making breakfast.  We were 
                        out of juice so Judy ran to the 
                        store and then the explosions 
                        started--

           His hands tremble, but talking makes him feel better--

                                 GREG
                        I didn’t know what to do, stay with 
                        the kids or go after their mom--

                                 IRIS
                        She’s not my Mom--

           Greg throws her a look, but holds his tongue.

                                 GREG
                        She never came back.  And then 
                        those things showed up, they were 
                        everywhere--

                                 IRIS
                        They’re not things, Dad, they’re 
                        robots--
                                 GREG
                        Did you see the way it looked at my 
                        boy, like it knew he wasn’t a 
                        threat.

           Peter pulls out the data the chip he took from the wolf in 
           the sewer.  He tosses it on the counter.

                                 PETER
                        It’s a guidance chip.  I used to 
                        design similar technology.  Someone 
                        is controlling them--

                                 IRIS
                        I told you, it’s the terrorists--

                                 PETER
                        They’re not terrorists--they’re--  
                        something worse.  

           Echoing Molly.  A beat.  Peter flinches as Greg begins 
           stitching.

                                 GREG
                        Sorry--

                                 IRIS
                        Where did you get all this stuff?

           We see commonalities in the pile, lip balm, clean socks.  And 
           then two items--pieces of technology we can’t comprehend.

           Peter doesn’t say anything, as if just now realizing he 
           killed a man.  Iris holds up one of the devices.

                                 IRIS
                        I think this is a video camera.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           On Molly--her eyes moving restlessly under closed lids.  She 
           shifts, moans, locked in some kind of nightmare.  We hear two 
           quiet BEEPS and suddenly she’s awake.  Confused, she clocks 
           her surroundings.  A nicely furnished master bedroom.  

           And Joey standing at the edge of her bed, watching her.

                                 JOEY
                        That’s my mommy’s bed.
           Molly painfully props up on her elbows.  A few wincing 
           breaths before swinging her feet to the carpet.  Joey’s big 
           eyes watching her--

           She’s been washed, her bloody clothes removed.  She stands in 
           just a tank top and panties.

                                 JOEY
                        You’re not wearing any pants.

                                 MOLLY
                        I won’t tell if you don’t.

           He smiles, nods.  She gingerly walks over to a long mirror, 
           pulls up her tank top and checks the bandage job.  Color has 
           returned to her cheeks.

           Then we hear the beeping again.  

           Molly spins, looks around.  Waits.  Listens.  BEEP BEEP.  
           From the laundry bin.  She tears it open and pulls out her 
           bloody clothes.  There, in her pocket, is Peter’s cell phone.  
           The red light is flashing.  She flips it open.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh my god.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGE:

           A 20 something WOMAN, would be prettier if she wasn’t gaunt, 
           dark circles under her eyes.  A pervasive sadness about her.  
           She’s wrapped in a mishmash of clothing.  We’re in some kind 
           of shanty town, see tents and fires burning in the distance.  

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Reveal Peter, Iris and Greg watching on the VIDEO CAMERA.  

           BACK TO THE IMAGE

           And realize now the WOMAN holds a BABY coddled in dirty 
           blankets-- 

                                 VOICE
                        Say something for Daddy.

           The baby coos-- 

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Can you translate?
                                 WOMAN
                        He says he doesn’t want you to go.

           She smiles sadly.  Camera lingers on her.  

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Things have to change--- 

                                 WOMAN
                        And you’re going to make the world 
                        a better place?  

           She looks past the camera.  Right into his eyes.  We can tell 
           she’s scared.

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Don’t do this to me, angel.  Not 
                        now.

                                 WOMAN
                        Just.  Make sure you come back to 
                        me.

           Camera cuts:

           TO ANOTHER SHOT.  We’re moving in some kind of TRANSPORT.  
           Soldiers in front of us and behind.  Pan out a reinforced 
           window.  It’s raining.  See a CITY in the distance--
           highrises.  Chicago?  New York?  

           And in the foreground a PROTEST is underway--two sides 
           screaming at each other.  One side; signs aloft proclaim 
           “Selection is Natural.”  “Support Darwin’s Law.”  The other: 
           “All Men are Created Equal.”  “Who’s right to choose?”

           Between them a line of MEN and WOMEN; sick, elderly, in rags.  
           They are ushered by soldiers in black towards a building

           We hear a soldier’s voice, very close to us:

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        What do you think it was like, 
                        before the fall?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        In few hours we’re going to find 
                        out.

           Hold on the protest as it escalates, people pushing and 
           shoving, YELLING at each other.  Suddenly a GUNSHOT.  
           SCREAMS.  Soldiers open fire--chaos.

           Pan back inside the transport--see soldiers pressed against 
           windows.  A SUPERIOR OFFICER yells at us:
                                 SUPERIOR
                        Private Allen, turn that shit off--

           Cuts again:

           We’re close on Private Allen’s face, he’s pointing the camera 
           at himself.  We recognize him as the man Peter killed.  

                                 PRIVATE ALLEN
                        We’re in the main staging area, 10 
                        minutes to transfer--

           Cuts again:

           And we’re now walking on what appears to be a bridge.    

                                 PRIVATE ALLEN (O.S.)
                        My god--

           Camera pans up quickly to reveal a massive DISC of electric 
           blue color--to either side are glass buttresses as tall as a 
           ten story building--  

           Camera swings again to reveal we’re in a massive dug-out 
           CAVERN.  There are 10 more DISCS evenly spaced, stretching 
           nearly a mile into the distance.  

           In the staging area is an army of unbelievable size, MOSTLY 
           consisting of TANKS, CHOPPERS, and WOLVES.  There is an 
           occasional SEMI TRUCK sized TRAILER VEHICLE--

                                 VOICE
                        Who says you can’t change the past.

           And the camera suddenly cuts.  Static.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Hold an astonished beat on Peter, Greg and Iris.  Strangely, 
           it’s Peter and Iris who lock eyes as if they both understand--

                                 PETER
                        He said he wasn’t born yet.  
                        Private Allen, before he died. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s some kind of future army.

                                 IRIS
                        Time Travel--

                                 GREG
                        That’s impossible.  
                                 PETER
                        A technologically superior force 
                        takes an American city in less then 
                        three hours.

           But somehow it doesn’t frighten him, only strengthens his 
           resolve.  Peter looks back at Greg, his hands covered in 
           Peter’s blood--

                                 PETER
                        Finished?

           Almost absently Greg nods, as we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly on the edge of the bed--the cell phone on speaker, see 
           a picture of ANNA on the tiny digital screen. Unfortunately, 
           we only hear the telltale sounds of an accidental phone call--

           STATIC.  RUSTLING.  MOVEMENT.  VOICES.  Indiscernible. 

                                 MOLLY
                             (barely holding it 
                              together)
                        Come on-- 

           Quiet.  Then we hear:

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        You remember?  

           Molly’s relief is palpable.  A soft voice sounds like “no.” 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        All around the mulberry bush.  
                        (static).  Chased the weasel.  
                        (static).  The monkey stopped to 
                        pull up his sock, pop goes the 
                        weasel.

           Sad laughter.  STATIC.  Then Emma:

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        I want momma.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Do you remember the second verse?

           STATIC.  And then:
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Everyone stay quiet.

           Female.  

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        I’m scared.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Shhhh.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Please children, quiet.  

           More urgency.  Silence.  Whispers:

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Anna, the phone is blinking--

           Rustling.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        PLEASE CHILDREN.

           And then clear as day:

                                 ANNA
                        Daddy?

           BEEP BEEP BEEP. 

           On MOLLY.  Her children are alive.

           MOMENTS LATER

           With Molly as she laces up a pair of tennis shoes.  Fully 
           dressed.  She glances at Joey, who watches her, Teddy bear in 
           his lap.

                                 MOLLY
                        You coming?

           He nods, she takes his hand as they move downstairs.  

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Where Peter is throwing the soldier’s pack over his shoulder.  
           See Greg watching him, Iris playing around with one of the 
           devices.  Peter turns when he hears footsteps.  

                                 PETER
                        Molly--
                                 MOLLY
                        They called us.

                                 PETER
                        The girls?  Where are they?

                                 MOLLY
                        At the school.  Phone’s dead now, 
                        but they somehow got through.  

                                 PETER
                        How long ago?

                                 MOLLY
                        10, 15 minutes.  

           Peter experiences that same reserved elation.  See Joey run 
           over to his father, who scoops him up.

                                 PETER
                        Can you walk?

           She nods.

                                 PETER
                        Let’s go.  

           Peter turns to Greg and Iris.

                                 PETER
                        Thank you for everything--

           Greg nods.  He holds out a photograph of a 30 something woman 
           with red hair--

                                 GREG
                        My wife.  Her name’s Judy, if you 
                        see her, tell her to come home.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens, Peter and Molly step into the brilliant 
           sunlight, hazy smoke hangs on the horizon.  See the crashed 
           ambulance and the dead wolf in the yard.  Then Iris comes out 
           after them--

                                 IRIS
                        Wait--

           Peter turns.  
                                 IRIS
                        You’re name’s Peter Fox.  151 Cedar 
                        Street.  The soldier you killed, 
                        that was at Swedish hospital.

                                 PETER
                        How do you know that?  

           Iris holds up the second device--

                                 IRIS
                        It’s like a PDA or something--
                        there’s a list with names, 
                        photographs, recent reports.  

           She shows Peter the screen--

                                 IRIS
                        You’re on it.

           A photo of Peter--sweat soaked bangs--we recognize the moment 
           it was taken--the moment from the sewer.  Off this we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PIKE STREET/DOWNTOWN SEATTLE - DAY

           Designer shops lay in ruin.  BENTLEYS, BMWS, and MERCEDES 
           line streets, smashed into gnarled metal skeletons.   
           Thousand dollar sweaters in gutters, soaked in sewage and 
           blood.   

           We pick up Peter and Molly moving through the wasteland of 
           BOMB CRATERS and RUBBLE. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WESTLAKE PLAZA - LATER

           A main shopping area of downtown.  A massive CAROUSEL, tipped 
           diagonally, like a flying saucer embedded into the asphalt.  
           Carnival horses frozen in a plastic terror.  

           Their lifeless eyes staring at our heroes.  Peter stops, 
           hands Molly a bottle of water.  She drinks.  

                                 PETER
                        There’s no one left.  No faces in 
                        the windows, no bodies in the 
                        streets.  It’s like everybody 
                        disappeared.

           Molly’s eyes fix on him.
                                 MOLLY
                        Is there something you know--
                        something you’re not telling me?

                                 PETER
                        No.

                                 MOLLY
                        Then why do they have a picture of 
                        you?

           On Peter, pained.  He has no idea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TANKS rumble past.  One.  Two.  Three. 

           And they’re gone.  Reveal Peter and Molly:

           EXT. ORDWAY ELEMENTARY - DAY

           Across the street from the elementary school.  A beautiful 
           lawn is singed brown.  DEBRIS in the yard.   WINDOWS broken.

           Peter and Molly cross the street to the main entrance of the 
           building, stopping at the double doors.  A faint fluorescent 
           GLOW inside.  

           The doors are dented in.  The locks smashed.

           Peter raises the assault rifle.  

                                 PETER
                        They’ll be here.

           He pushes open the door with the weapon.  

           INT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Papers are scattered about.  Shattered glass litters the 
           floor.  Emergency lights line the halls.  We hear water 
           dripping.  Somewhere a generator hums.

           They exchange a look before moving through the destroyed 
           hall.  Classroom doors are open.  ASSIGNMENTS forgotten on 
           tables.  TOYS scattered about.  Math equations mid-solution 
           on chalk boards.   

           And that’s when we hear it.  The comical MUSIC and VOICES of 
           a CARTOON.

           An exchange of hope as Molly and Peter immediately run down 
           the hall and arrive at the doors leading to the gym.  Shut.  
           We listen.  HEAR THE CARTOON INSIDE.  Push into:
           INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Dusk light pours through the giant windows that circle the 
           gym near the ceiling.  Book bags scattered on the wood floor.  
           Forgotten wrappers.  Half eaten sandwiches.  An old TV 
           playing CARTOONS like a cruel joke in the corner.  

           Otherwise the gym is empty.

                                 PETER
                        Hello?  

           Nothing but the RAT-A-TAT-TAT of far off gunfire.

                                 MOLLY
                        They’re gone, Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Maybe the police were here and--

                                 MOLLY
                        The police?

                                 PETER
                        EMMA?  ANNA?  

           Molly slides down against the wall, she hugs her knees to her 
           chest. Behind her, a DORA THE EXPLORER poster reminds 
           children to eat their vegetables.   

                                 PETER
                        Stay here.  I’m gonna search the 
                        rest of the school.

           Molly says nothing.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           With Peter as he moves from classroom to classroom. Throwing 
           open doors, closets, bathrooms.  Teachers lounge.  All the 
           while:

                                 PETER
                        EMMA?  ANNA?  

           He opens and janitors closet and recoils.  A young JANITOR, 
           executed through the head.  

           Peter steps back, trying to keep his shit together.  And then 
           he hears someone crying.  
           He turns.  It’s coming from the faculty office.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly is in silent tears, practically numb.  Her eye catches 
           something.  We don’t know what.  Not yet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter enters the office, gun up.  The crying is louder now.  
           Coming from a back room.

                                 PETER
                        Hello?  

           No answer.  But the crying stops.

                                 PETER
                        I’m not going to hurt you.
                             (beat)
                        I’m looking for my daughters.  

           Silence.  He pulls open a door and his eyes go wide.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly reaches down and picks up a backpack with a PRINCESS 
           embroidered onto the back.  

           Emma’s backpack.  She holds it to her chest only the way a 
           Mom could.  Like it’s all that’s left.  

           Fresh tears well and then suddenly she hears:

                                 PETER
                        MOLLY.  MOLLY.  

           Follow Molly out the door and into the:

           HALLWAY  

           Clutching the backpack into:

           THE OFFICE

           Where she sees Peter standing in front of a small closet.  
           Peter turns. 
           We see when she does:

           An ADULT WOMAN (CHRISTINE), tears streaking her face.

                                 MOLLY
                        Christine?

           Christine stares up at Molly, practically catatonic.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        There was nothing I could do.  I 
                        swear to you, if they found me too--

                                 MOLLY
                        Please, Christine, where are the 
                        children?

           Christine can barely get it out, when she does they are the 
           worst three words a parent could ever hear.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        They took them.

           Off the wrenching finality hitting Peter and Molly we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           On Peter staring straight ahead.  

           Reveal he’s looking through a glass CASING.  CLASS PHOTOS and 
           school TROPHIES.  See Emma, first row, spring dress and 
           pigtails, a toothy grin.  And Anna, solemn, caught in mid 
           thought, back of the class.

           Molly appears behind him.  A moment.  

                                 MOLLY
                        You should of left me at the 
                        hospital.

           Peter meets her reflection, hands gnawing at Emma’s back 
           pack.  He turns, recognizes the fear soaked blame.   But we 
           realize that it goes deeper than today.  Their marriage, 
           their family, their lives collapsing around them.   

           He picks up an overturned chair.  And let’s it all go.  

           Peter swings the chair at the glass photo case.  OVER and 
           OVER and OVER until his arms ache and the glass shatters. 

           Molly flinches with every blow.  Fresh tears spilling.
           Finally he stops.  Tosses the chair.  Chest heaving.  And 
           then he looks at her. 

                                 PETER
                        Don’t you think I would do anything 
                        to protect this family?  

           A long moment--somehow cathartic--somehow.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What do we do now?

           Peter stares at her, see Christine standing in the doorway.  

           Suddenly an idea.  Peter pulls off his back pack, drops to 
           his knees searching the contents-- 

                                 PETER
                        We find out where they took our 
                        daughters and we get them back.  

           And revealing the PDA DEVICE--

                                 PETER
                        This must be some kind of 
                        intelligence system, maybe there 
                        are maps, maybe--

           He’s turning it over in his hands, flips it on, see the 
           screen come to life, catch a glimpse of his photo, he slides 
           his finger over the touch screen.

           And then stops.  Register the implication on his face.

                                 PETER
                             (reads)
                        HVT-1, Fox, Peter, location 
                        acquired, 2nd and Columbia, units 
                        en route.  

                                 MOLLY
                        HVT?  What is that?

                                 PETER
                        High Value Target.  
                             (beat)
                        2nd and Columbia.  They know we’re 
                        here.

                                 MOLLY
                        How?

           A moment to process.  Then suddenly we see a MESSAGE ALERT.  
           “Resolving Altered Time Line.”   Then Peter:
                                 PETER
                        HVT-1, Fox, Peter, eliminated, 11 
                        hundred hours, 13 minutes, 33 
                        seconds.

           Peter doesn’t look up:

                                 PETER
                        Christine, what time is it?

           Christine shakes her head, shell shocked, doesn’t realize 
           she’s wearing a watch.

                                 PETER
                        Your watch.  What time is it?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        11:07--

                                 MOLLY
                        Six minutes from now?  That’s 
                        impossible.

           Peter turns to her, face ashen, then drops the PDA on the 
           ground.  Up and running.  

           Stay with Molly as she picks up the PDA.  Notice a COUNTDOWN 
           to 11:13 am.  5:58, 5:57, 5:56.... Then:

           See PHOTOS of Molly, Peter, and Christine.  It takes us a 
           moment to realize all three are dead.  The PDA blinks again.  
           Then reads:  “HVT-1 Fox, Peter.  Confirmed dead.  Additional 
           casualties identified; Fox, Molly, and unknown white female.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           On Peter moving quickly and arriving at a window, shades 
           drawn.  He finger-spreads the blinds and sees exactly what he 
           expected.  THREE wolves tear towards them, no more then two 
           blocks distant.

           Above, a chopper pounds air, sees SOLDIERS cocked and ready 
           on each skid, ASSAULT RIFLES poised to kill.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What is this?

           Turns to her, holding the PDA--

                                 PETER
                        It’s our future, Molly--
                                 MOLLY
                        We’re already dead?  No matter what 
                        we do we’re already dead?

           Peter is moving past her--

                                 MOLLY
                        We have to get out of here--we have 
                        to run.

           He picks up the assault rifle.  Then reaches towards a 
           bulletin board and tears a sheet of paper off.

                                 PETER
                        I’m done running.  

           He puts the paper in Molly’s hand.  She reads: Pacific 
           Science Center Satellite Demonstration.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter moving quickly, Christine and Molly following--

                                 PETER
                        Does the generator feed power to 
                        the outlets?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I think so--

                                 MOLLY
                        What are we doing, Peter?

                                 PETER
                        The robots are human guided drones, 
                        drones require a satellite uplink, 
                        the attack happened less than four 
                        hours ago, not nearly enough time 
                        to launch their own.  They’re using 
                        ours--

           Turning the corner:

                                 PETER
                        In here?

           Christine nods as they push:

           INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Peter immediately heads over to a small ARRAY, a lap top 
           plugged into it. 
                                 PETER
                        Bar the doors, use anything you can 
                        find.

           Molly and Christine nod, go to work.  While Peter boots up 
           the lap top and flips on the array.  He grabs a screw driver 
           off a nearby table and removes the back panel of the lap top.  

           Quickly, he pulls fiber optic wires from an empty hard drive 
           slot and places the GUIDANCE CHIP on the table, jerry-rigging 
           the wires to the chip--

           And that’s when we hear SLAM SLAM SLAM down the hall.  Peter 
           looks up, sees Molly’s stricken expression.

                                 MOLLY
                        They’re inside.  

           Peter is already sweating.  With the lap top booted up he 
           begins typing, windows open and close like lightening--

           He continues talking, his brain moving--

                                 PETER
                        Military satellites would have an 
                        impenetrable firewall, which means 
                        they’re using private, could be 
                        anything, TV, weather, research...

           Quick shot of the screen: SCANNING AVAILABLE UPLINK--

                                 PETER
                        If they got in, so can I--

           Then--

           A LIVE IMAGE comes up on the screen--

           Birds eye view of the SCHOOL.  PHOTO CLARITY.  See blue 
           squares outlining THREE WOLVES, one at each entrance.  And 
           then green squares moving inside the building.  Ten total.

                                 MOLLY
                        What is that?

                                 PETER
                        Them.

                                 MOLLY
                        How do you know staying here isn’t 
                        what gets us killed?
                                 PETER
                        Anybody would run.  We should run.  
                             (beat)
                        That’s why we stay. 

           Suddenly we hear BOOTS outside.  

                                 PETER
                             (hissing)
                        GET DOWN.

           They all duck behind a counter.  Christine practically dry 
           heaving with fear.  

                                 PETER
                             (whispering)
                        If I can clone the guidance chip, 
                        mimic the signal, maybe I can 
                        bypass their controls and paint 
                        them as targets--

           That’s when the door opens.  Peter looks up, face dripping 
           sweat.  In the METALLIC REFLECTION of a file cabinet he sees 
           a SOLDIER enter, assault rifle up.  See TWO MORE FOLLOW.  

           On MOLLY, laser focused on the PDA device--the three corpse 
           photos--the countdown.  32, 31, 30....

           On Christine, hyperventilating, rubbing the shit out of a 
           cross around her neck.  

           On Peter, working the keys.  

           The soldiers approaching.   20, 19, 18....

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s not working--

           Seconds away from discovering our heroes.   

                                 PETER
                        Got it.  Let’s see them fight one 
                        of their own.

           THAT’S WHEN WE HEAR THE FIRST GUNSHOTS.

           The soldiers turn, run back outside.  

           AND THEN COMES THE YELLING.  Indiscernible.  Chaotic.

           And see what he does.  On the computer screen is a POV of 
           absolute carnage.  

           The POV of a WOLF’S CAMERA SYSTEM.  
           Tracer fire tears into SOLDIERS.  Muzzle-bursts light up the 
           dim halls in crazy FLASHES of blood and gristle torn from 
           Soldier’s bodies.  See the soldiers firing back.  See a WOLF 
           suddenly enter frame.  The POV slams it against the wall, 
           bashes it in, then turns and BLASTS the last wolf into 
           oblivion.

           Then sudden quiet.

           On our trio, holy shit eyes.  Hear a BEEP--clock the PDA.  
           “11:13:33.  Resolving timeline.”  They changed the future.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        IT STOPPED  WE HAVE TO RUN, WE HAVE 
                        TO--

           She’s getting to here feet--

                                 CHRISTINE
                        We can’t stay here.

           On the PDA--”Timeline resolved.  Confirmed casualty: unknown 
           white female.”

                                 PETER
                        Wait, Christine, DON’T--  

           But she’s already up, sprints into the hallway and--

           SEE IT ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN.  FIRING ERUPTS as the moment 
           she emerges into the hallway, her body twisting into the 
           crossfire, peppered with countless bullets--

           Peter wraps his arms around Molly--

           ON THE SCREEN--

           A SOLDIER leaps towards us, then is whipped backwards, 
           propelled fifty feet down the hallway.

           The barage is endless--

           An awesome display of power, captured for us you-tube style 
           on the 17 inch lap-top.

           And then it’s over.

           Almost.

           On Peter and Molly.  Silence.  The TINK TINK TINK of bullet 
           casings bouncing on brushed concrete floors.

           Then slam.
           A SOLDIER slides into the opposite wall.  HARD.  Directly 
           across from Peter and Molly.

           He sees them.  They see him too.  Soldier reaches for his 
           gun.  Peter fumbles for his own.

           The soldier is faster.  He has them dead to rights.

           But then he looks off.  Sees something. 

           SUDDENLY a terrific BOOM.  Plaster and wood and glass 
           explodes as the WOLF breaks into the Science Lab.  

           ON THE SCREEN: see it clock the soldier, see it run towards 
           him.  And then immediately stop.

           Strangely.  Impossibly.  On the soldier, eyes wide, then 
           turning to Peter and finding Peter’s gun aimed nearly point 
           blank at his face.  His other hand on the lap top keyboard.

                                 PETER
                        Either it kills you, or I do.

           Soldier drops his weapon.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Close on DUCT TAPE wrapped around the soldier, fastening him 
           to a chair.  Peter tosses Molly the soldier’ pack.

                                 PETER
                        Search it.

           Peter appraises the young man.  Can’t be more then 25.  Let’s 
           give him a name.  JIM FORD.  Face of steel resolve, cracked 
           with fear.  

                                 PETER
                        Where are my daughters?

           Ford eyes Peter.  The gun.  Then looks away.

                                 FORD
                        I’m not afraid to die.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, right.  You’re not born yet.

           Peter shoots him in the shoulder.  The GUNSHOT is deafening, 
           cold, brutal.  Ford fucking screams, gritting his teeth.  He 
           steels again.  Spits blood on the ground.  
                                 FORD
                             (rapid fire)
                        My name is Jim Ford. I was born 
                        December 3rd 2018 in Raleigh North 
                        Carolina.  I’m a patriot.

           Ford wretches, drool spit-lining his lips. 

                                 PETER
                        Where are my daughters?

                                 FORD
                             (gritting his teeth)
                        My name is Jim Ford. I was born 
                        December 3rd 2018 in Raleigh North 
                        Carolina. I’m a patriot.  

           Peter presses the wound with the sizzling muzzle.  Ford 
           screams: 

                                 FORD
                        Our mission:  invade the past to 
                        take the future.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m not afraid to die for my cause.  

                                 PETER
                        TELL ME WHERE MY DAUGHTERS ARE OR--

                                 FORD
                        OR WHAT?  

                                 MOLLY
                        Or we’ll kill your parents.

           Ford and Peter turn to Molly.  She holds a PHOTOGRAPH in her 
           hands, obviously pulled from Ford’s pack.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Clayton and Linda Ford.  

           She flips the Photograph.  See a smiling couple, a baby held 
           in Linda’s arms.  A little BOY stands with them, grinning.

                                 MOLLY
                             (scary quiet)
                        This is your family, right?  Their 
                        names are written here on the back, 
                        your mom probably did that.  And 
                        the other boy, your brother?  You 
                        carry the picture with you because 
                        you love them.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOLLY (cont'd)
                        Tell us where our daughters are 
                        because if you don’t, we’ll find 
                        them, kill them, and erase your 
                        entire family from existence.

           For the first time we see Ford with more fear than resolve. 

                                 PETER
                        We took control of one of your 
                        drones, you don’t think we’re 
                        capable of finding your parents?

                                 FORD
                        I don’t know what you’re capable 
                        of.

                                 PETER
                        After today I’m not sure you want 
                        to find out.

           A beat. Ford’s eyes flick to the photo of his family. 

                                 FORD
                        All civilians detainees are to be 
                        transferred to a temporary holding 
                        facility at the football stadium.  

                                 PETER
                        You took them to get to me?

                                 FORD
                        No.  We don’t know who your 
                        daughters are; we can only track 
                        significant events that change the 
                        course of post invasion history.  
                        Whatever you’ve done today, 
                        whatever choices you’ve made have 
                        altered your determined future, our 
                        history, and somehow you’ve become 
                        a threat to our mission.

           Suddenly Peter puts it all together.  He pulls the PDA from 
           his pocket.  The soldier eyes it--

                                 PETER
                        You’re getting your orders from the 
                        future.  That’s what this is?  A 
                        device that communicates between 
                        your time period and ours--

                                 FORD
                        It’s called a “relay.”  As history 
                        rewrites itself future command 
                        orders a response--
                                 PETER
                        Jesus Christ--

                                 FORD
                        It won’t take them very long to 
                        figure out they have your daughters 
                        and when they do--  

           He doesn’t have to finish.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter--

                                 FORD
                        You can’t win.  You’re fighting an 
                        enemy who knows every move you’ll 
                        make before you do.

                                 PETER
                        An enemy that believed we would be 
                        killed at 11:13 am.  That was two 
                        minutes ago.

           Peter slings the assault rifle over his shoulder.  Looks at 
           Molly.  

                                 PETER
                        Let’s go.

           He turns, pulls the guidance chip from the dormant wolf and 
           smashes it on the ground, silencing it forever.  

                                 FORD
                        The determined future can change 
                        based on present day actions.  

           Peter and Molly move towards the door.

                                 FORD
                        But the one thing do I know, if you 
                        continue on this path, succeed or 
                        fail, your wife will die today.  
                        And with her your unborn son.

           Both stop.  Peter looks at Molly and her expression 
           immediately confirms. 

           A loaded emotional moment he is not prepared for.  Instead of 
           confronting her, he looks back at Ford.

                                 PETER
                        Who are you people?

           Ford says nothing.
           That’s when the generator cuts.  All the lights go out.  

           A beat.  The sound of our own breathing.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Now we run.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter and Molly sprinting down the hallway towards the exit.  

           Less then 20 feet away and something SLAMS into the doors.  
           They skid to a stop.  SLAM. SLAM. 

           BOOM.  The doors burst open.  SOLDIERS breaking inside.

           Follow Peter and Molly as they take off in the other 
           direction, cutting down an adjacent hallway.

           Only to find:

           More SOLDIERS moving towards them.  

           Peter grabs Molly’s hand, shouldering into:

           INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

           As bullets whip-snap behind them--

           They race between lunch tables towards another exit--

           But grind to halt, because more soldiers approach outside.  

           They’re fucking trapped--

           Peter looks around, wild eyed--

           Then sees a metal ladder heading up towards a suspended 
           walkway just below the ceiling.

                                 PETER
                        THERE, MOLLY, GO.

           He turns and opens fire with the assault rifle just as the 
           soldiers take position outside the cafeteria--keeping them at 
           bay--

           As Molly climbs a table and jumps on the ladder, pulling 
           herself up--
           Peter fires more bursts, then sprints towards the ladder--

                                 MOLLY
                        GIVE ME THE GUN--

           He tosses it up to her as he vaults the same table--

           His hands gripping, climbing.  She fires, but sprays wildly, 
           the gun kicking like a motherfucker--

           Peter climbs desperately--

           The soldiers duck and fire, bullets crescendo in a mad cry--

           As he pulls himself to the walkway.

           With them as they sprint.  The soldiers now stepping into the 
           cafeteria, but their gunfire ricochets off the bottom of the 
           walkway--

           Our heroes’ only cover.  

           See an access door ahead of them.  Peter full-speed-rams it, 
           bursting through the threshold and we find ourselves--

           EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           In the brightest sunlight you’ve ever seen.

           They sprint along the rooftop.  Stop at the edge.  A two 
           story drop to the pavement below.

                                 PETER
                        THIS WAY.

           Towards the other side.  See an adjacent roof.

                                 MOLLY
                        WE CAN’T MAKE IT.

           Look back, see the soldiers pouring out on the roof top.

           But Peter doesn’t stop, he yanks Molly along--

                                 PETER
                        JUMP.

           And they do, covering the distance.  Barely.

           Peter turns, fires back until the clip is empty.  He tosses 
           the rifle.

           They run.  Now jumping from roof top to roof top.  Soldiers 
           in hot pursuit.
           But they’ve run out of options.

           There are no more rooftops.  Peter and Molly duck behind an 
           exposed air conditioning unit.    

                                 PETER
                        GOD DAMN IT.

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter.

           She’s motioning towards a bi-level freeway (THE VIADUCT) that 
           runs perpendicular to the building.  The top level within 
           jumping distance and covered with BURNING cars.

           The only problem.  Running towards it leaves them totally 
           exposed.  Peter pulls out the pistol.  His last weapon.  

                                 PETER
                        When you make it, there’s some 
                        cover behind that building.

           See a taller BUILDING shielding the viaduct from the 
           soldiers.

                                 MOLLY
                        And then what?

           They both know the answer; he’ll run without cover.

                                 PETER
                        GO.  I’LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

           Molly nods.  Peter stands, fires.

           Molly runs.  She leaps, hits the edge of the viaduct.

           But doesn’t make it.  Hanging precariously on the railing.  

           Peter spins, sees his wife grappling for life.  

           And then she gains purchase.  Pulls herself up.

           His turn.  He sprints.  Bullets explode around him.  
           Impossibly missing.

           ON MOLLY

           Watching Peter’s mad dash, desperate for him to make it.  

           He meets her gaze and just as he’s about to jump--
           A bullet hits its mark.  Peter is flung like a rag doll, 
           twisted into the air, pirouetting and falling to the ground, 
           below Molly’s view.  

           She SCREAMS his name OVER AND OVER again.  The bullets stop.

           A frozen moment.

           And then Peter rises, his shoulder a bloody mess.  He runs 
           with the last of his energy and JUMPS--

           TIME SLOWS DOWN

           As Peter sails through the air.  It’s clear he won’t make it.

           Reaching out his hand--

           Molly lunging.

           And catching him, just before he falls.

           We RAMP back to full speed as Peter hangs there.  Molly’s 
           tiny frame the only thing keeping him alive.

           He looks at her, the ground falling away below him, and now 
           it’s his turn.

                                 PETER
                        Let me go.  Save our daughters.

           On Molly.  Her decision to make.  Her grip slipping.  

                                 PETER
                        They’re coming, sweetheart.  

           A beat.  Veins bulging.  Molly straining.  Then:

                                 MOLLY
                        No.  Give me your other hand.

           He sees the same resolve in her eyes that he felt before.  

           Through the pain and bullet torn muscle Peter reaches out his 
           other hand, screaming, until Molly is able to grab it.  She 
           sets herself and almost inhumanely yanks him to safety.

           EXT. VIADUCT - CONTINUOUS

           He collapses against the railing.

           She kneels down.  His face in her hands.  See his eyes 
           swimming in pain.
                                 MOLLY
                        We have to go.  We have to keep 
                        moving.

           Peter blinks, sweat matting his hair.

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter?

           Finally he nods.  And then his face changes as he looks over 
           her shoulder.

           She turns.

           And we see what she does.  FOUR shapes FLYING towards them 
           rippling in the afternoon heat.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh shit.  
                             (beat)
                        GO GO GO GO GO.

           And they’re up and running again.  As behind them we get our 
           first look at futuristic UAV’s.  Call sign HAWKS.

           Like mini fighter jets, except with the same double lens 
           camera system and gun-metal snouts as the WOLVES.

           Worse, HAWKS have mini-RPG’s attached to their wings.  

           All four of them FIRE and then arch up, immediately turning 
           for another pass as:

           The FOUR mini-missiles twist towards our heroes, comet-trails 
           of white exhaust behind them--

           BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM

           HITTING the TWO BURNING CARS on either side of Molly and 
           Peter.

           Even though they missed, the EXPLOSION is titanic, blasting 
           PAVEMENT and CARS filled with fuel 30 feet into the air--

           And if that’s not bad enough--

           Both CAR’S gas tanks detonate 20 feet over our heads.  A 
           thunderstorm of molten fire arcs across the sky as we:

           Pick up Peter and Molly, face down on the pavement.  
           Disoriented but alive--

                                 MOLLY
                        Jesus--they missed--
           Peter looks back, sees the Hawks curling around, though not 
           descending.  

                                 PETER
                        They must use infrared--they can’t 
                        distinguish us against the fire--

           Now he’s looking ahead--

                                 PETER
                        There’s an off ramp--

           Except they’ve got a bigger problem.

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter--

           The VIADUCT is trembling.  A beat to wonder.

           And then the reason is revealed.  The RPG’s damaged the 
           structural integrity of the TOP LEVEL.

           A spider web of cracks branch around them, earthquake style.

           Suddenly, behind them, the TOP LEVEL gives, a huge chunk 
           falling way--

           And now they’re not just running from the HAWKS.  They’re 
           running from the collapsing freeway.  

           The moment Peter and Molly move, the Hawks register them 
           again, immediately swooping down--

           At the same time our heroes race just beyond the vanishing 
           pavement--

           When suddenly ahead of them, no more then thirty feet, the 
           viaduct collapses and falls--the small section of freeway 
           remaining intact because luckily they’re standing over the 
           support beam.

           Except this creates a new problem.

           The section becomes a MASSIVE SEE-SAW and it’s tipping 
           forward. 

           Peter and Molly are lifted off their feet and immediately 
           tumble and roll down the concrete SLIDE--

           To where the TOP SECTION meets the BOTTOM.  

           An impossible amount of debris slides with them, culminating 
           in a choking cloud of dust.
           MOMENTS LATER

           We pick up the FOUR HAWKS gliding slowly down to the bottom 
           section, their camera systems scanning back and forth as we:

           Find Peter and Molly, hunched inside the cracked shell of a 
           FLOWER TRUCK--

           Clutching each other.  We can hear the soft purr of the 
           Hawk’s jet system approaching--

           And then flying into view--

                                 PETER
                             (whispers)
                        Wait until they pass--

           Which they do without incident.  A moment to catch their 
           breath.

           Peter leans out, peering around the truck, sees the four 
           hawks.  Two continue forward.  Two begin to circle around.

                                 PETER
                        Shit.  They’re coming back.

           And this time they won’t be so lucky.  Peter’s eyes fire for 
           another escape.  And then he sees it.

                                 PETER
                        There.  That window--

           Clock the glass rectangle in a building across the way, a 
           short leap from the BOTTOM LEVEL railing.  

                                 PETER
                        Ready?

           She nods--

           They spring from the truck and book across the bottom level.  
           The two Hawks see them.

           Peter goes first, Molly just behind--

           INT. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Peter flying towards us, shattering through the glass, shards 
           detonate in a glittering shower--

           Molly just behind him.  Rolling on the carpeted hallway.

           Running again as the Hawks enter through the windows--
           A mad race down hallways--

           Hawks pursue, one fires an RPG.

           Exploding behind Peter and Molly as they dodge a corner.  

           Peter pulls her into a room of cubicles--

           They duck low as the hawks enter.

           With them on a crouch run, putting as much distance between 
           themselves and the flying assassins.  

           But they’re running out of real-estate.  Options.  Time.

           They rest behind a cubicle.  Both exhausted.  

           The relentless Hawks don’t get tired.  They get closer.  

           Suddenly Peter sees something.  A PACK OF CIGARETTES peaking 
           out from a forgotten purse.  

           Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.

           MOMENTS LATER

           With the HAWKS scanning the cubicles.  We see smoke.  A small 
           fire erupts.  Both Hawks turn towards it.  Except Peter and 
           Molly are gone.

           And the fire’s growing.  Spreading.

           Finding Peter and Molly on the opposite side.  Watching as 
           PAPERS ignite.  BLINDS.  CARPET.  PENCILS.

           Soon there’s an inferno.

           And it’s wreaking havoc on the Hawks infrared.  

           Molly coughs--

                                 MOLLY
                        Let’s go.

                                 PETER
                        Wait.

           In mere seconds, the entire room is ablaze.  Peter sees the 
           Hawks spinning, almost comically, trying to locate their prey 
           in the red hot air.  

                                 PETER
                        Now.
           Both dash through the CRACKLE of flames, moving towards the 
           exit on the far side.

           And leap to the relative safety of the hallway.

           Looking back--see the distorted metallic shapes of the Hawks; 
           trapped.  See the ceiling collapse.

           Hear the fire ROAR.  

           And the SCREAM of dying robots.

           On Peter and Molly.  Galvanized.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           CLOSE ON: Peter’s exhausted face.  He winces.

                                 MOLLY
                        Hold still.

           Cut back to reveal we’re:

           INT. RESTROOM - DAY

           Peter sitting, his back to the wall.  His shirt off.  Molly 
           has a FIRST AID kit next to her, dressing Peter’s shoulder.

           Peter holds the PDA, cycling through photographs of others 
           like him.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Bullet missed the bone.  But your 
                        muscle is torn apart.  

           Peter looks up.  Watching her work.  A sudden tenderness.  

                                 PETER
                        How long have you known?  

           Molly’s eyes flick to his, then away.

                                 MOLLY
                        This morning.  
                             (beat)
                        There’s not much bleeding--

                                 PETER
                        I didn’t have an interview today.

           Molly actually smiles, however small--

                                 MOLLY
                        There’s always tomorrow.
           But the joke hurts more then the truth.

                                 PETER
                             (softly)
                        Molly.  

           Her eyes meet his.  See the pain.  The frustration. 

                                 PETER
                        When did you lose faith in me?

           Her inclination is to lie.  Never, Peter.  I never lost faith 
           in you.  But she can’t.  Because she did.  She finishes the 
           bandage.  

           And we realize she’s crying.  She wipes the tears away 
           immediately.  

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PETER
                        All I ever wanted was to take care 
                        our family, to give you guys the 
                        future you deserved.

                                 MOLLY
                        I know.  

                                 PETER
                        I will rescue our daughters.

                                 MOLLY
                        We will.  Both of us.  

                                 PETER
                        You have to run.  Get as far away 
                        from here as possible.  

           But Molly isn’t going anywhere.  

                                 MOLLY
                        We were supposed to die in that 
                        school.  We saw it happen.  We 
                        survived because we were together.  

           She reaches out.  A gentle hand on his face.

                                 MOLLY
                        I won’t let you do this alone.

           She sits back, looks at the PDA device.
                                 MOLLY
                        Find anything?

                                 PETER
                        No.  Just more names, photographs--  
                        targets.  Look at this--the guy 
                        from the house.

           A photo of Greg.  He slides his finger over the device.  

                                 PETER
                        His daughter too.  

           A photo of Iris.  Then landing back on his own photo.  
           Blinking text:  “HVT-1, Fox, Peter.  Location unknown.”  

           Absently, Peter touches the text--

           And a new window opens up.

                                 PETER
                        Molly--

           She slides over next to him.

           We see an image, like a FAMILY TREE.  A series of points with 
           lines branching out from one starting point that reads “first 
           contact, 8:21:16” he clicks on it--sees video of the wolf 
           staring at him before it died. 

           He clicks out.  Five lines branch from that spot, one is red, 
           four are black.  The red leads to “second contact.  Allen, 
           Nathan, KIA.  9:31:12”  Ten lines branch out of that.  One 
           red, nine black.  

           “Third contact.  Ford, Jim, status unknown. 10:14:22”  More 
           and more lines spread out in a complex web.  Many of them 
           stopping after one or two sections.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What is it?

                                 PETER
                        Possible futures.

           Peter scrolls down.  All of the lines that branch and 
           continue eventually lead to ONE moment.  “Last contact. 
           2:42:16”

           Peter click on it.  

           See a surveillance feed of a massive room lined with 
           FUTURISTIC computers.  Hundreds of TECHS sit at workstations.  
           Suddenly the camera shakes, people run and yell.  
           Then the shaking stops.  A beat.  The techs turn towards 
           something.  A MAN enters frame followed by two others.  We 
           quickly realize it’s Peter and he’s carrying an assault 
           rifle.

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s you--

                                 PETER
                        3 hours from now.

           Back to the image:  See Peter sitting down at a console.  See 
           him typing.  Then he looks up off camera.  A beat.  He seems 
           indecisive.  He’s shaking his head.  Yelling.

           Suddenly he appears resigned.  He hits a key and all hell 
           breaks loose.  Gunfire erupts inside the room.  Static.

           BACK TO PETER

           Who immediately returns to the tree and scrolls back--clicks 
           on different meet points that lead to that video.  PDA reads: 
           “resolving--unknown action.”  Again.  “Resolving--unknown 
           action.”

                                 MOLLY
                        What Ford said, about you being a 
                        threat to their mission--

                                 PETER
                        They’ve got the wrong future.  

           Peter stands, puts on his bloody shirt, slings the backpack 
           over his unhurt shoulder.

                                 PETER
                        I’m no hero.  I just want our 
                        daughters back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY

           Or what’s left of it.  A battle happened here.  The famous 
           tourist enclave is nothing but a collage of destroyed 
           buildings and debris.  Neon Chinese characters hang haphazard 
           from suspended wires.

           The metallic carcass of a WOLF, components sparking.  A few 
           dead soldiers in their black fatigues, several civilians.  We 
           don’t linger.  

           As Peter and Molly pick through the wasteland:  
                                 MOLLY
                        This great power to travel through 
                        time, correct the mistakes of the 
                        past.  And what does humanity do?  
                        We make war.

           Then we hear MOANING.  And reveal:

           A FEMALE SOLDIER impaled on a piece of rebar.  She’s holding 
           her guts in.  Molly sees her first:     

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                        Help me.  Please.  

           Molly fixes on the girl.  Young.  Pretty.  Swimming in 
           delirium.  

                                 PETER
                        Molly.  We can’t help her.

           But Molly approaches the soldier, kneeling before her.  The 
           girl is grateful.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s your name?

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                             (gasping)
                        Carrie Lorraine.  I was born 
                        October 14th, 2019 in Minneapolis 
                        Minnesota.  I’m a patriot.

                                 MOLLY
                        Is the future so bad, that this was 
                        only way?  

           Lorraine doesn’t answer.  Whether she is unable or unwilling, 
           we’ll never know.

                                 MOLLY
                        There’s nothing I can do for you.

           Lorraine’s eyes flick down to her sidearm still fixed to her 
           hip.

           Realizing, Molly glances at Peter.  He looks away, walks up 
           the crest of a hill.  

           Molly faces Lorraine’s plea.  

                                 LORRAINE
                        Please.

           Molly removes the girl’s sidearm.  Stands.  
                                 LORRAINE
                        Maybe I’ll be born into a better 
                        world this time.

                                 MOLLY
                        I hope so.

           On Peter as we hear the CRACK of the GUNSHOT.  

           Molly lowers the gun.  Tears in her eyes.  Then:

                                 PETER
                        Molly.  Look at this.

           She turn, Peter at the pinnacle of the hill.  A silhouette 
           against the falling sky.  She joins him.  A slight ocean 
           breeze ruffling their hair--

           And on that breeze comes:

           An entire fleet of NAVAL SHIPS sailing into the bay.  A 
           CARRIER, DESTROYERS, BATTLESHIPS.  FIGHTER JETS and CHOPPERS 
           circle like hornets around their hive.  

                                 PETER
                        They’re mounting a counter attack. 

           He looks at her.

                                 PETER
                        And we’re walking into the middle 
                        of it. 

           He takes her hand.  

           Off this we hear a cacophony of MOVEMENT and:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTH SEATTLE - DAY

           As Peter and Molly stand at the edge of downtown, South 
           Seattle falling below them.  And for the first time we see 
           the true extent of the ENEMY FORCE--

           THE BASE surrounds the football stadium (QUEST FIELD), a half 
           mile in either direction.  The perimeter secured by 
           Constantine wire.  GUARD TOWERS loom every 100 yards. Prefab 
           buildings erected inside.

           See the massive WAR MACHINES (TANKS, CHOPPERS, WOLVES). HAWKS 
           patrol the air like demon sentinels. 
           See the antiaircraft installations, see the thousands of 
           soldiers moving about like ants.  The base is buzzing, 
           obviously preparing for the US counter attack.

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter--

           She directs his attention to the base entrance.  

           A line of TRANSPORTS (FLATBED TRUCKS) wait to enter a 
           GATEWAY, where soldiers and WOLVES stand guard.  The 
           transports are filled with PRISONERS.  Hundreds of MEN, 
           WOMEN, and CHILDREN.  Each transport is cleared and then 
           allowed inside the base.

                                 MOLLY
                        We’ll never get inside.  

           Peter watches, thinking.  The towers, the soldiers, the 
           wolves.  He glances at Molly.

                                 PETER
                        I’m gonna take a closer look.  Stay 
                        here.  

           She says nothing.  Seemingly reading something in his eyes we 
           cannot.  

                                 PETER
                        I’ll be right back.

           He kisses her.  Fiercely, as if for the last time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           With Peter as he picks his way closer.  Moving in and out of 
           cover, vulnerable in the sunlight.  

           He stops behind a single wall of brick--once an entire 
           building.  Less then 100 feet away is the gateway.  Two more 
           transports idle, waiting for admittance.

           The place is an impenetrable fortress.  Peter considers his 
           options.  

           See the first transport enter.  The second begins to move, 
           right past Peter.  A beat.  He drops the back pack at his 
           feet and slides the relay device his pocket.  Then looks 
           back:

           At Molly, her head barely visible, watching him from the top 
           of the hill.  
           ON MOLLY

           She catches his eye, even across the expanse of debris.  Then 
           she sees him smile.  Sadly.  With love. 

                                 MOLLY
                        No.

           And he runs towards the last transport truck, climbing into 
           the back among the other prisoners.

           There’s nothing she can do.  

           She watches as the transport is gained admittance.  The 
           gateway closing behind it.

           Her mixed emotions are unbearable.  But it doesn’t matter.

           Because a hand suddenly wraps around her face.  

           And tears her from frame.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BASE - DAY

           On Peter.  Now a prisoner.  He clocks the base.  Morbidly 
           fascinated by the improbability of it all.

           And then his eyes land on something.   Four massive SATELLITE 
           DISHES (think SETI), two on each side of the SUBWAY TUNNEL 
           entrance heading underground.  A mini army of soldiers and 
           wolves.  Barricades block the entrance--

           But the transport continues to move, the installation 
           disappearing from view and soon the transport stops beside a 
           fifteen foot tall chain link fence surrounding the entrance 
           to the STADIUM.  SOLDIERS stand guard as Peter and the 
           PRISONERS are ushered inside--a requiem.  

           Peter keeps his head down, as best he can.  Yet he still 
           takes in the feeble faces of MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN.  They 
           are the people we walk by everyday.  Double breasted suits.  
           Summer dresses.  Baseball caps.  Tennis shoes.  Old, young, 
           ethnically diverse.  Americans.

           Some are wounded.  Some pray.  Some stare into a void that 
           will never be filled.  There are tears.  Cries of pain.  An 
           overwhelming sense of chaotic horror that is so pervasive, we 
           feel it like a heat wave.

           With Peter as armed soldier keep the line of prisoners moving 
           towards the ARCHED ENTRANCE of the stadium.  
           And what he sees is staggering.

           INT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           The entire field area of the stadium is packed with 
           CIVILIANS.  We HEAR calls for loved ones, moans of pain.  
           Look up and see CROWDS of people filling the seating area, 
           teeming to the roof.  

           HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS in a stadium that holds 
           seventy.  Makes Katrina look like an afternoon picnic.

           WOLVES stand guard inside, one every 15 or so yards.  

           All Peter knows is that his daughters are here somewhere.  
           And so he begins.

                                 PETER
                        ANNA?  EMMA?

           His voice resonating with the thousands of other pleas.

           And so we pull back from the crowd.  BACK, BACK, BACK until 
           we get the full spectrum of an entire city in captivity.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           CLOSE ON: Molly.  Her eyes vacant.  For the moment we have no 
           reference for where she is.  Or what’s happened to her.  So 
           we cut back to reveal we’re:

           INT. CLOTHING SHOP - DAY

           She’s sitting in a chair.  A CUP of something warm steaming 
           in her hands.  Her wrist are not tied.

           She is not a prisoner.

           A buzz of activity around her.  Muscular MEN with shorn hair 
           in blue, grey, and white city CAMO UNIFORMS.  

           The incomprehensible chatter blaring from a military radio.

           Two MEN converse, the younger nodding towards Molly.  The 
           older man approaches her.  This is LIEUTENANT TYLER.  No 
           bullshit, however, he’s kind, experienced, the sort of man 
           who’s left his family countless times to risk his life.

                                 TYLER
                        Mrs. Fox.  I’m Lieutenant Tyler, 
                        3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger 
                        Regiment.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TYLER (cont'd)
                        EVAC choppers have been suspended 
                        because of the counter attack.  
                        You’ll move out with us inside the 
                        half hour.

                                 MOLLY
                        Do you know what you’re up against?

           Tyler appraises her.  And for some reason he wants her to 
           know what he does.  

                                 TYLER
                        A mercenary army from the year 
                        2040, intelligence we’ve gathered 
                        indicates that they’re financed by 
                        some very powerful and very rich 
                        corporations intent on creating a 
                        different way life.

                                 MOLLY
                        Invade the past to take the future.

                                 TYLER
                        I can assure you Mrs. Fox, when 
                        were finished, there will be 
                        nothing left of their army but a 
                        giant hole in the ground.

           Molly meets his gaze.

                                 MOLLY
                        What about the civilian prisoners?

           Tyler says nothing.  

                                 TYLER
                        Like I said, we move out within the 
                        half hour.

           He walks away.  And now she realizes.

                                 MOLLY
                        Lieutenant Tyler.  What about the 
                        civilian prisoners?

           Just loud enough so all the RANGERS can here.  We see the 
           effect this question has on them.  

                                 TYLER
                        We lack the resources or the 
                        military strength to engage in 
                        tactical warfare with the enemy.
                                 MOLLY
                        What the hell does that mean?

                                 TYLER
                        It means we hit them with 
                        everything we’ve got.  Collateral 
                        Damage is unavoidable.

           Molly stands, her eyes on fire.

                                 MOLLY
                        There are thousands of innocent 
                        people in there.  My husband, my 
                        children.

           Tyler stiffens, but we see the pain in his eyes.

                                 MOLLY
                        Saving their lives is not 
                        unavoidable.  It’s necessary.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m truly sorry, Mrs. Fox.

                                 MOLLY
                             (not giving up)
                        They’re using private satellites, 
                        my husband took over one of the 
                        drones with a goddamn laptop--

                                 TYLER
                        They’ve breached the entire 
                        defenses network.  Our military 
                        infrastructure is crippled.  We’re 
                        out of options. 

           On Molly, horrified at the sudden reality.  Her family is 
           going to die.  

                                 MOLLY
                        How much time do I have?

                                 TYLER
                        I’m sorry?

                                 MOLLY
                        The counter attack.  How much time?

           And now he knows what she intends to do.

                                 TYLER
                        Mrs. Fox--
                                 MOLLY
                        HOW MUCH?

                                 TYLER
                        56 minutes.

           Without another word, she’s gone.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STADIUM - DAY

           On Peter moving through the crowd, scanning the tortured 
           civilian faces.  A startling quiet has fallen over the 
           throng.  His own face, pale, dark circles, misted in a cold 
           sweat.  

           His exhaustion and the terrible hopelessness taking their 
           toll.  His shoulder is bleeding again, his bicep a mosaic of 
           ungodly purple and black patches.

           Finally he has to stop.  He leans over, resting his hands on 
           his knees.  Only for a moment--  

           Because when he stands--

           There’s a commotion across the stadium.  He cranes over the 
           prisoners and sees SOLDIERS running quickly in his direction, 
           no more then two hundred feet away.  

           They’re pushing people aside, hear them yelling to MOVE, 
           MOVE, MOVE.  See their assault rifles.  Listen to the squawk 
           of their radios blasting coordinates.   

           They’re looking for someone.

           A soldier turns our way and Peter spins, ducks.  Shit.

           They’re looking for him.  

           He moves, head down, dodging people, and immediately takes 
           the PDA from his pocket.  Turns it on.  Waits for it too 
           load.  Glancing back--the soldiers getting closer.  Then 
           reads:

           “HVT-1 Fox, Peter...”  Loading.  Loading.  “Location 
           unknown.”  

           He stops, confused.  A beat.

           Then: “Alternative targets...” Loading.  Loading.  “Fox, 
           Anna, Fox Emma; targets captured.  2:21:46”  See a LIVE birds 
           eyes shot of the stadium. 
                                 PETER
                        No.

           See a red square identifying a small area of the field.   

           Sees the out of town scoreboard on the map.  Sees it across 
           the way.  See the stadium CLOCK.  It’s 2:20:46.  

           He has one minute.

           The soldiers are now on a diagonal course towards his 
           daughters--

           Peter runs.  

           Racing the soldiers to Anna and Emma’s location--

           He shoves through the crowd.  Jumps over sitting prisoners.  
           To his left the soldiers steam-roll forward, knocking 
           pedestrians aside-- 

           Peter’s forgotten his ripped-up shoulder.  His exhaustion.  
           If they get to his daughters it’s all over.

           And they’re closing fast--

           But he’s got the angle.

           He arrives at a cluster of people near the out of town 
           scoreboard.   Looks fast.  Many CHILDREN,  adults move about, 
           tending to them.  

           They’re here somewhere.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Daddy?

           And then he sees her.  His little girl.  Her face blackened 
           by soot.   

           As he scoops her up in his arms, pressing her fiercely to his 
           chest.  Kissing her tangled hair.  She’s already crying.

           But he’s running out of time.  Glancing back--the bobbing 
           heads of the soldier’s drawing closer.

                                 PETER
                        Where’s your sister, sweetheart? Is 
                        she here?  

           Anna nods, points.  

           See a MIDDLE AGED woman notice Peter--other adults--
           And there’s Emma.  Curled on the ground.  

                                 PETER
                        Emma--

           Moving towards her.  The middle aged woman, DEBBIE:

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re their father?

           Peter nods, scooping up Emma too.  She’s nearly catatonic.  
           Doesn’t make a sound.  

           A quick re-union.

           Peter looking now--the soldier’s practically on them.  Debbie 
           follows Peter’s eyes.  Sees the soldier’s too.

           Realizes.  On Peter, what the hell is going to do now?  

           MOMENTS LATER

           The soldier’s arrive.  Scanning the faces. 

           See Debbie.  Other adults.  Children.  The soldiers, four of 
           them, go from child to child.  Pushing adults aside.  

           The soldier’s look back.  Their targets are gone.  Lead 
           soldier approaches Debbie.

                                 SOLDIER
                        You.  These girls, where are they--

           Showing the PDA, PHOTOS of Anna and Emma.  Debbie, terrified, 
           shakes her head.  He rifle-whips her to the ground.  She 
           cries out.

           Other adults, backing up.  

                                 SOLDIER
                        Two girls.  They were just here--   

           Showing the photos.  See faces of unknown CITIZENS.  Scared 
           shit-less.  Some clutch children.  Others stand.  Silence 
           now. 

           Find Peter, Anna and Emma.  They’re laying between bleacher 
           aisles on the concrete floor, just above the out of town 
           scoreboard.  Barely hidden.

           Pick up a MAN, standing over them.  He’s sweat-clocking the 
           soldiers. 
           On Peter, knowing all these prisoner saw him.  Anyone of them 
           could simply point.

           The lead soldier suddenly grabs Debbie by the hair, drags her 
           into the middle of the cluster.  Everyone is watching.  

           He puts the gun to her head.  Vicious.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Someone saw them.  Talk or she 
                        fucking dies.

           Children are crying.  Hush now, hush.

           On the man above Peter and his daughters.  His eyes find 
           Debbie--see her barely shaking her head.

           These people--these strangers--are protecting Peter.  Not 
           because they know him.  Not because he’s special.

           Because he’s one of them.  Soldier realizes what’s happening.

           Knows he has to make a point.  Knows the only way to find out 
           is to POP this innocent woman.  

                                 SOLDIER
                        She dies.

           Then the MAN above Peter, his name is SAM.  Remember him.

                                 SAM
                        Wait.  

           Soldier stops.  Approaches.  He’s no more then a breath from 
           Peter and his daughters.   

                                 SAM
                        There was a man.  He grabbed them.  
                        Took them.  

                                 SOLDIER
                        Where did they go?

           On Peter, clutching Anna and Emma to his chest. 

           A frozen beat.  

                                 SAM
                        That way.  

           Gesturing towards the center of the field.  Into an ocean of 
           people.
                                 SAM
                        They couldn’t have gone far.

           Soldier appraises him.  It’s almost too much to bear.  
           Finally:

                                 SOLDIER
                        Fan out.  Find them.

           Soldier steps back.  His men move out.  He’s talking into his 
           radio, pushing past prisoners.  

           Pick up Anna--

                                 ANNA
                        Daddy?

                                 PETER
                        Shhhh.  Sweetheart.  

           He kisses her hair.  See the man and Debbie lock eyes.  

                                 PETER
                        We’re okay, now.  We’re okay.

                                 ANNA
                        Daddy?  Where’s mommy?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY

           Molly moving quickly over the rubble.  She stops when she 
           sees the female soldier she mercy killed not an hour before.  

           Molly approaches.  We’re not sure why.

           Until she starts taking off the girl’s fatigues.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Molly is fully dressed.  She pulls her hair into a pony tail. 
           Slips the sidearm she had taken before into the holster.  

           She looks just like one of them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BASE ENTRANCE - DAY

           Molly moves just out of sight from the base.  She crouches 
           below a pile of DEBRIS, watching.  Two soldiers man the 
           gateway.  A third and fourth man guard towers. 
           Two wolves below them.

           She steels herself, about to approach when she notices a 
           small cadre of soldiers walking up to the gateway.  

           At that moment she realizes looking like them won’t work.  

           Because each soldier receives a retinal scan before 
           admittance.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Shit. 

           A beat.  Thinking.  And then she looks down at her chest.  An 
           idea.  Probably suicidal.  

           She reaches for a shard of broken glass and tears a hole in 
           the uniform above her stitched and bandaged wound.  Un-
           tucking the shirt, she pulls it up.

           Then cuts away the bandages, revealing the tender skin around 
           a patchwork stitch job.  She touches it, wincing.    

           Molly closes her eyes.  Maybe saying a prayer.  Maybe just 
           getting her nerve.  

           She digs her fingers into the wound.

           And tears it wide open. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STADIUM - DAY

           Peter sits on the turf, his back to the partition wall 
           separating them from the stands.  Emma is asleep in his lap.  
           Anna sitting beside him, leaning on his good shoulder.

           Debbie sits across from him.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        At first, we waited for help to 
                        come.  And then we wondered if 
                        there was anyone left to help. 

                                 PETER
                        All these children?  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Parents are dead or missing.  A few 
                        of us got together, gathered them, 
                        tried to comfort them in anyway we 
                        could.  We spread the names of 
                        their parents-- 
                                 PETER
                        That’s how they found my daughters--

                                 DEBBIE
                        Why are they after you and your 
                        family?

                                 PETER
                        They know my future.  And in that 
                        future I’m some kind of threat.  

           Debbie realizes something.

                                 PETER
                        What?  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Every hour or so they move a group 
                        of prisoners into a building 
                        outside the stadium.  I was taken 
                        this morning.  
                             (beat)
                        They photographed us.  Drew blood.
                        They knew things--impossible things-
                        -where we’ll live, who will have 
                        children, what we’ll do with our 
                        lives.  Our value.  

           We remember the protest in Private Allen’s video.  Selection 
           is Natural--

                                 DEBBIE
                        Afterwards, some of us were brought 
                        back.  Others.  They kept.  

                                 PETER
                        They’re sorting people based their 
                        future--

                                 DEBBIE
                        And everybody left in this stadium 
                        when they’re finished is going to 
                        die.

                                 PETER
                        You don’t know that--

           We realize Debbie is crying.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        I was at the hospital when the 
                        attack happened.  I was diagnosed 
                        with stage 4 breast cancer.  
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEBBIE (cont'd)
                        They sent me back because I have no 
                        value.  

           She suddenly wipes her eyes.  We see her strength.   Peter 
           reaches out and touches her hand.  A smile of comfort.

           Then:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Peter?

           Peter turns to reveal Greg.  Joey in his arm.  Iris by his 
           side.

                                 IRIS
                        See Dad, I toldja it was him.

                                 GREG
                        Your wife?

                                 PETER
                        She’s safe.  Yours?

           Greg darkens, but doesn’t say anything.  

                                 JOEY
                        She’s at home and we’ll see her 
                        when we get there.

                                 GREG
                        That’s right, kiddo.  

           A beat.  Peter looks at Greg, Iris and Joey.  Then Debbie, 
           the children.  The thousands of other people.

                                 PETER
                        We need to get the hell outa here.  
                        Now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BASE ENTRANCE - LATER

           On Molly, staggering towards the base.  Sweaty bangs lift 
           with every struggled breath.  Her hand clasped over her 
           wound, blood oozing between her fingers.

           We wonder if she’s embellishing.  We hope to god she is.  The 
           SOLDIERS on the towers see her first.  Guns immediately 
           trained.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Soldier, stop where you are.
                                 MOLLY
                        Help me.

           Then a solider at the gate.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Jesus Christ.

           She looks that bad.

                                 MOLLY
                        Help me.  

           And then she collapses on the ground.  See the soldiers at 
           the gate eye each other.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BASE - MOMENTS LATER

           One of the soldiers helps Molly through the base towards a 
           PRE-FAB STRUCTURE.  They enter--

           INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS

           Where DOCTORS and NURSES treat incoming wounded--

                                 SOLDIER
                        Anybody got a bed--

           A DOCTOR turns, sees the blood pouring from Molly’s wound--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Over here.

           They guide her to the bed.   

           Doctor is examining her immediately, scissors open Molly’s 
           shirt, blood is pumping--he swings a LIGHT across the bed--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Multiple lacerations, bruised lung.  
                             (beat)
                        You’re going to be just fine--

           Doctor turns away from Molly, issues instructions to a NURSE--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Let’s ulta-sound the lung and chuck 
                        for fluid to be on the safe side--

           But when he turns back.  The bed is empty.
           Molly is gone.

           Debbie, Greg, Iris, and a bunch of other NAMELESS ADULTS 
           standing around Peter.

                                 GREG
                        This is nuts.

                                 PETER
                        Look, I know they seem strong, but 
                        they’re weak at the joints, that’s 
                        why the engine mechanism is so 
                        small, they’re built for dexterity, 
                        not power, they can’t hold too much 
                        weight.  I killed one of them by 
                        kicking its head in.   

                                 GREG
                        So we rush those things, and what?   
                        Take them down?

                                 PETER
                        Four or five of us to each drone, 
                        we overpower the legs and yes, take 
                        them down.  The soldiers will have 
                        to open the gates to retain order, 
                        once they do, it’s gonna be a free 
                        for all.

                                 DEBBIE
                        How do you figure?

                                 PETER
                        See the clock.

           Pointing to the stadium clock above the entrance.  2:24.

                                 PETER
                        Pass the word, quietly.  At 2:30 we 
                        go.  There’s at least ten of us for 
                        every one of them.  People either 
                        stand up and fight or stay here and 
                        die.  

                                 IRIS
                        I’m in.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Me too.
           Other voice agree.  Greg runs his hand through his greying 
           hair.  

                                 IRIS
                        Dad?

                                 GREG
                        Jesus.  I’m an insurance 
                        underwriter.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m a legal assistant.

                                 PETER
                        I’m an unemployed engineer.

                                 IRIS
                        I got a D in world history.

           Iris reaches for her Dad’s hand.  He nods.  Yeah, okay.

                                 PETER
                        Good.  Once we set this motion, 
                        those of you without families, 
                        you’ll have to come back for the 
                        children.  It’s going to be every 
                        man for himself.  

           Nodding faces.

                                 PETER
                        Pass the word.  In six minutes.  We 
                        fight back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BASE - DAY

           Pick up Molly running through the base, her right hand 
           staunching the wound.  SOLDIERS approach from the opposite 
           direction. 

           Both look at her strangely.   

           A tense beat.  Do they know?

           She nods to them.  And it’s returned as they pass by.

           Relieved, Molly leans against a PRE-FAB wall.  She has to 
           breath.  She has to keep it together.

           Beyond the structure is the stadium.  The fifteen foot tall 
           fence.  
           We’re not sure of the bigger question.  How does she get in?  

           Or how does she get her family out?

           That’s when we hear the SIRENS.

           Ripped right from the bombing raids of World War II.  

           And the base immediately flies into action.  Anti aircraft 
           weapons swing to target.  Soldiers sprint towards stations.  
           Choppers lift, rotor blades slicing air.

           Molly steps out, peers into the distant blue sky.  What looks 
           like a dark cloud at first is soon revealed to be a massive 
           formation of US fighter JETS cruising in from Elliot Bay.

           He checks her watch.  There’s still time.

                                 MOLLY
                        No goddamn it, you’re early.

           Molly’s eyes suddenly fix on something else.  Something 
           inside the base.  A pre-fab building with two massive open 
           garage-like doors.

           The building is filled with WEAPONS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter, Greg and Iris and two MEN push towards their target, a 
           wolf near the entrance.  Across the sea of people, we barely 
           make out OTHERS moving towards the multitude of wolves 
           positioned around the field.  

           And among the prisoners we hear whispers.  Words of attack.   
           The rising feel of rebellion.

           We begin to notice prisoners throwing furtive glances at 
           Peter, maybe realizing he’s the instigator, maybe wondering: 
           can this really work?

           Peter lays a hand on Greg’s shoulder--

                                 PETER
                        Wait, we’re close enough.

           They stop.  The wolf no more then twenty five feet away.

                                 PETER
                        Two minutes.  
           Peter glances back.  He sees it too.  Those who were sitting 
           are now standing.  Those who had given up have found hope.  

           A beat to revel in the possibility.  

                                 IRIS
                        Something’s happening.

           Follow her eyes to the wolf.  Once dormant, it stands 
           upright.  It’s head swiveling, looking:

           All around the stadium, wolves come to life, rising from 
           their steel haunches.  

                                 IRS
                        What the hell are they doing?

                                 PETER
                        They know--

           And then from above, the HAWKS begin to circle, descending 
           towards the field.

                                 PETER
                        They know because of me--

           Peter glances up at the clock.  Still a minute until--

                                 PETER
                        We’re out of time.  Go. 

           And then as if to tell anyone within ear shot.

                                 PETER
                        GO NOW.

           He starts running.  Greg, Iris and the others have no choice 
           but to follow.  

                                 PETER
                        OUT OF THE WAY.  MOVE.  MOVE.

           Bee-lining the wolf.  A suicidal sprint.  

           The goddamn thing turns--

           But not before Peter hurls himself forward--

           Just as the wolf swing its snout, catching him in the ribs, 
           throwing him sideways into a see of legs.

           Then the unmistakable ROAR of gunfire.  Screaming.  
           Peter on the ground, struggling to get to his feet.  
           Desperate to see what’s happening.

           Finally able to stand... see Greg, Iris and another clinging 
           to the wolf, now wrenching back and forth, trying to knock 
           them away.  Firing wildly into the air.  

           Above, the Hawks swoop down, straffing the field with 
           bullets, chewing turf--

           Peter sprints forward, joining Greg and Iris, climbing the 
           back of the wolf, like a fucking bull rider, ripping wires 
           with his bare hands.

           See Iris flung away.

           But miraculously someone else takes her place.  More and more 
           people, climbing, clawing, kicking--

           And then it goes down.  The crowd surrounds it, pummeling it.

           Beyond submission.  Beyond death.

           Find Peter, breathing heavily, backing away.  Looking out--

           And sees that all the wolves have been taken down, around the 
           field the prisoners, despite the circling hawks, despite the 
           fear have ripped the robots to pieces--

           A powerful ROAR of yelling erupts, the crowd moves like a 
           tidal wave.

           Look left too see MEN and WOMEN bum-rushing the entrance.  
           They climb the chain link fence.  Some are shot off by 
           soldiers, but others follows, overwhelming the fence with 
           their weight.

           And just as the fence goes down.

           The explosions begin.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BASE - WEAPONS BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly feels the first explosion as she throws an assault 
           rifle over her shoulder.  She turns in time to see a crater 
           shot, blowing soldiers into the air--

           She steps out--headed towards the stadium--

           The RAT-A-TAT-TAT of gunfire erupting in all directions.
           We hear a loud whine, followed buy a rush, like a SUNAMI 
           thundering over a helpless village.

           And then another explosion.  Rocking the base.  The world.

           Molly thrown to the ground.  

           But this is just the beginning--she looks up to see:

           The sky filled with streaks of light and smoke.  We quickly 
           realize they are giant MISSILES.  

           Titanic blasts echo as the missiles detonate across the base.  
           A HURRICANE sized orange fire cloud spreads over the entire 
           area like a red hot summer storm.   

                                 SOMEONE
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Suddenly Molly is in the middle of her own D-day.  Her hair 
           blows in the concussion, knocked to the ground again.

           Molly gets to her feet as an endless line of US FIGHTER JETS 
           descend.

           Red streaks of TRACER FIRE fills the air as the jets unload 
           on the base.  

           ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS SWING into position and power up; 
           sucking energy, barrels pulsing with light. 

           As the jets approach, the weapons fire, a concussive blast 
           that takes our breath away, like they sucked all the oxygen 
           from the world.  

           And right in the middle of the bomber formation, something 
           unseen explodes and waves of invisible power roll from the 
           blast point, literally like god himself smashed his fists 
           together with incredible force.

           Some of the jets are completely blown sidewise, out of 
           control, spiraling down--

           And one is headed right for Molly.  

           She runs as the out of control JET slices into the rooftops 
           of Pre-Fab buildings and cartwheels through the concrete, 
           flipping towards Molly who dives out of the way as: 

           The jet explodes along with its ordinance, generating a 
           monstrous blast that sends great boulders of concrete into 
           the air.
           Find Molly, head covered from the hail storm of falling 
           debris.  

           She looks up, her eyes reflecting the chaos.  And the 
           stadium, looming in the distance, couldn’t be further away--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           A different kind of chaos.  Rebellion has devolved into 
           panic.  The explosions outside a wake up call to those still 
           trapped.

           The terrified crowd streams towards the exit--

           Soldiers stand on the stadium parapet’s firing into the ocean 
           of prisoners--

           Find Peter, Greg and Iris pushing against the tide--

           On Peter arriving to find his daughters.  Anna screaming in 
           terror, her little hands over her ears.  Emma trembles 
           uncontrollably, knees hugged to her chest.

           Peter scoops her up in his arms.  Takes Anna’s hand.

           But he doesn’t run.  Not yet.  Because a whole group of 
           terrified children wait to be rescued.

           He can’t take them all.  And he knows it.

           But then Debbie arrives, bleeding from her head.  She takes a 
           little BOY’S hand and another GIRL’S.   Suddenly more adults 
           arrive.  Grabbing orphaned children.

           Debbie and Peter’s eyes meet.  A quick nod.  Greg arrives, 
           Joey in his arms and Iris at his hip.  Then:

                                 PETER
                        Anna, listen to me.  We’re gonna 
                        run now.  Whatever you do.  Don’t 
                        let go.

           As they join the rushing crowd.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly sprints through the battle zone.  To her left, 
           explosions, her right, anti aircraft fire, above the ROAR of 
           fighter jets, HAWKS launch RPG’S.  
           As if by some miracle, she makes it to the stadium and sees 
           the thousands of people having overwhelmed the entrance, 
           pouring from the stadium into the middle of war.

           Molly is immediately amoung the crowd--

                                 MOLLY
                        PETER?  ANNA?  EMMA.

           But she’s pushed back, unable to fight against the terrified 
           surge--

           Molly is jostled back and forth, suddenly slamming against a 
           ticket booth.  

           She needs a better a view, she needs to climb.

           Quickly, Molly arrives at top the booth--

           And can’t believe her eyes.  A gigantic funnel of faces 
           fighting for escape through a 40 foot wide exit.  Behind 
           them, the field is an undulating mass of moving people.

           Her family is in there somewhere.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           On Peter and his daughters, violently packed between bodies.   
           A log jam of terror, people clawing and crawling and 
           trampling weaker prisoners, as they push towards the exit.    

           And Peter’s now trapped in the middle of it.  The panic is 
           totally suffocating.

           Greg, Iris, Joey, Debbie nearby, suffering the same fate.

           Then:

                                 ANNA
                        DADDY.

           Anna is being ripped from away by the sea of bodies.  Peter 
           has her hand.

                                 PETER
                        HANG ON--

           But he’s losing her.

           Suddenly Anna is propelled away.
           With Emma in his arms, Peter fights through the people.  
           Pushes, pulls, desperate to get to his daughter.  To help 
           her, to keep her from being trampled to death.  

           But it’s a lost cause as he’s caught up in the thrust of the 
           crowd.  

           Then:

                                 MOLLY
                        UP HERE.

           He looks up and there is Molly, standing on the top of the 
           entrance, Anna in her arms.  Her hand reaching out.

           Peter thrusts Emma above his head and Molly grabs hold, 
           hoisting his daughter from danger, then Peter’s next.

                                 MOLLY
                        GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

           But Peter doesn’t--

           He looks back.  Sees his friends--

                                 PETER
                        OVER HERE.

           They clock him, fight their way over.  Peter is now helping 
           them to Molly’s perch.

           Joey, the children with Debbie, Iris, finally Debbie and 
           Greg.

           Peter’s last.  About to reach out.

           But he’s somehow pulled away--

           He lunges, but it’s too far now.  People pushing him away.  
           But he fights back.  Molly straining.

           Their fingers touching.

           Their hands locking.

           And Molly is pulling him up from the crowd to safety.  

                                 MOLLY
                        FOLLOW ME.

           Each parent holding a child, they shimmy along a concrete 
           shelf lining the entrance and soon are back on top of the 
           TICKET BOOTH.
           INT. BASE - CONTINUOUS

           They climb down, as panicked prisoners overwhelm THE GATEWAY, 
           breaking out into the city.

           Peter and his family, their friends, a few in thousands.

           And still the battle rages on--

           Follow the group as they race through the gauntlet of the 
           attack, towards the gateway, towards freedom.   

           And before they know it.  Our heroes are eclipsing the same 
           hill from where Peter and Molly stood.

           See civilians pouring into the destroyed city--

           And our heroes following.  

           But suddenly, inexplicably, Peter stops.  He’s looking off 
           towards the water.

           Realizing Peter is no longer beside her, Molly turns.  Greg, 
           Iris, and Debbie too.  

                                 MOLLY
                        PETER?

           Then she follows his eyes.

           In the bay, the NAVAL SHIPS are in flames, a DESTROYER sinks, 
           nose up.  See planes swatted from the sky by more powerful 
           weapons.  He sees American soldiers gunned down by the enemy, 
           their tanks, hawks, choppers and wolves unmatched.

           It’s very clear.

           We’re losing.

           Peter looks back at the base.  See the FOUR MASSIVE SATELLITE 
           DISHES.  

           Molly takes his hand.  They lock eyes.

                                 PETER
                        I have to go back--

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter--

                                 PETER
                        If I can disable the satellites, I 
                        can end this--
                                 MOLLY
                        We have to run--

                                 PETER
                        Look around, look what’s happening.  
                             (beat)
                        There’s a reason they’re trying to 
                        kill me.  We both saw it.  

           On the faces of their companions, a disbelieving kind of 
           respect.  His fierce eyes clock hers.

                                 PETER
                        Anybody would run.  I should run.
                             (beat)
                        That’s why I have to stay.  

           And now Molly knows, the decisions been made.  He will go 
           back no matter what she says.

           She takes the ASSAULT RIFLE from over her shoulder and hands 
           it to him.

           She touches his face as if for the last time.  

                                 MOLLY
                        They know you’re coming.

                                 PETER
                        And I’ll know they’re coming.

           He still has the PDA device.  

           Peter addresses the group. 

                                 PETER
                        Get out of the city, stay together 
                        don’t look back.

                                 MOLLY
                             (breaking)
                        Peter--

                                 PETER
                        I will find you.

           Suddenly Peter is hugging his daughters.  Then Molly.  He 
           kisses her, as behind them we see the might of our military 
           going up in flames.  

                                 PETER
                        I love you guys.
           And then he’s gone, running back down the hill against the 
           tide of fleeing prisoner.

           Back to hell.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BASE - LATER

           The fight continues on the sea-side of the base.  Anti-
           aircraft weapons spit death into the air.  The insane RAT-A-
           TAT of gunfire.  

           See prisoners captured, on their knees, secured--the majority 
           pushed back into the Stadium.

           Pick up Peter moving low from structure to structure, 
           checking his corners before moving again.  He stops, peers 
           out.  

           Beyond the line of anti-aircraft installations (think domed 
           structures like the Griffith observatory, only instead of 
           telescopes they are armed with big fucking guns), we see the 
           peak of the satellites.

           Peter pounds across the base, his footsteps silent amidst the 
           constant barrage of war, dodging between bomb craters--

           And hits back first at the base of one of the anti-aircraft 
           weapons.  From there he has clear view of:

           The SUBWAY TUNELL entrance, buttressed on either side by the 
           SATELLITE dishes.  Well guarded.  Hawks circle, soldiers, 
           wolves at ready-- 

           The entrance is barricaded--

           He checks the PDA device:  “HVT-1, Fox, Peter, location 
           unknown.” 

           If only it told him what he was supposed to do.  

           Because there’s no way in hell he’s getting close to those 
           things on his own.  

           He needs an idea.  A plan.  

           Then he alights on something directly opposite of the tunnel.

           Reveal a TRAIN YARD.  A maze of trains, some tipped over, 
           other on their tracks.  

           And one in particular--five cars--on the track that leads to 
           the subway tunnel.  
           Thank god for the Seattle light rail.

           He readies himself.  A suicidal sprint in the great wide 
           open.

           Except he won’t get the chance.

           Because a gun suddenly presses against the nape of his neck.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Drop the weapon.

           Fucked.  Peter does.

                                 VOICE
                        Hands behind your head.  

           Peter obliges.  It’s quickly clear.  He’s a dead man.

                                 VOICE
                        Stand up, slowly, face me.

           As ordered, Peter rises, faces the voice.  A team of soldiers 
           stand in a semi circle, all guns pointed at his head.  The 
           lead SOLDIER nods to another who searches Peter--finds the 
           relay device.  Shows the lead soldier.

           Who almost smiles.  They tricked him.  Lead Soldier clicks 
           his radio. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        HVT-1, Fox, Peter, identity 
                        confirmed.  He was in possession of 
                        a Relay.  On your orders.

           We hear the static, then:

                                 RADIO
                        Take him out.

           Peter closes his eyes.  The last moment he’ll ever think of 
           his family.

           The gunfire erupts shockingly quick.  All around him.  Peter 
           flinches. 

           But does not go down.

           He slowly opens his eyes to reveal that all the soldiers are 
           dead.  A confused beat--

           Then he clocks a reflective flash in one of the bomb craters--
           heads poke up, faces we recognize.  Some we don’t.
           GREG, DEBBIE, IRIS and a band of CIVILIANS have taken 
           position inside the crater.   Peter grabs his rifle and 
           sprints over, sliding down into relative cover.  

           See his friends.  See the others, 13 of them. Some faces we 
           recognize from inside the stadium.   They are weary, ragged.  

           But they came back for him.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re name’s all over the radio.  
                        More of them are coming.

                                 IRIS
                        What’s the plan?

           All looking to him.  Their de-facto leader.

                                 PETER
                        The enemy’s controlling the drones 
                        from some kind of command center-- 

                                 GREG
                        How do you know that?

                                 PETER
                        I’ve seen it.  If I can get inside, 
                        maybe I can crash the uplink 
                        system. 

           See Greg staring at the satellites and tunnel entrance.  
           Soldier’s are buzzing.  Preparing.

                                 GREG
                        You’re gonna tell us command’s 
                        inside the subway tunnel.

           Peter nods.  

                                 GREG
                        Jesus Christ.  Half the army’s out 
                        there and they know we’re coming.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Peter, he’s right.
                             (beat)
                        We’re walking into a future they’re 
                        ready for and we aren’t.  

           Peter looks at Greg, Iris, Debbie, the others--hours before 
           they woke up to a world they knew and discovered a horror 
           they couldn’t have imagined--never once held a gun or risked 
           their lives.  
                                 PETER
                        I saw the future.  I saw myself, my 
                        wife, dead on a concrete floor. 
                             (beat)
                        We made it this far against an 
                        enemy that supposedly knows every 
                        move we’re going to make.  That 
                        tells me they adjust to us, the 
                        choices we make.  
                             (beat)
                        The future belongs to us, not them.

                                 IRIS
                        So what do we do?

                                 PETER
                        We take it back.  

           He nods towards the SUBWAY CARS on the tracks leading into 
           the tunnel.

                                 PETER
                        Right through the front door.  

           Realizing the plan.  

                                 PETER
                        None of you have to do this.  
                        There’s still time to get out--

                                 IRIS
                        No there’s not.

           All heads turn to see a formation of wolves tearing towards 
           their location.  Either side of them, see HUMVEES filled with 
           soldiers--

           They’re seconds away.  Then a man we recognizee speaks up.  
           He’s the man who lied for Peter and his daughters inside the 
           stadium.  His name was Sam.

                                 SAM
                        We’ll make a stand.  Get to the 
                        train.  

           See the other citizens nod.  They take belly position, rifles 
           aimed at the oncoming enemy.

                                 SAM
                        GO.  GO NOW.

           And they open fire.  Stay with Peter, Iris, Greg and Debbie 
           as they scramble up the crater and book it towards the train 
           yard.  
           Behind them see the fire-fight escalate, but it’s too chaotic 
           to make sense of it.  See Wolves firing back.  See a HUMVEE 
           flip.  See soldiers take positions.  The ZIP-SLAP of bullets. 
           Fucking terror--

           And then suddenly we’re ducking into the train yard and 
           taking cover against a fallen train.

           Peter looks back.  See the muzzle flashes and tracer fire.   
           HEAR men scream.  Then an explosion rocks the crater--a 
           gigantic incineration as combustion sucks air and belches red 
           gas.  

           Then clock three wolves leaping over the crater through the 
           fireball.  And galloping right at us.

                                 PETER
                        MOVE.  LET’S GO.   

           Stay with them as they twist through the maze of train cars, 
           ducking corners, quickly and quietly as possible.  

           Peter stops.  Listens.  FOOTSTEPS.

           The wolves have joined them in the maze.  One walks past 
           their position, head scanning.

           Peter nods.  They move behind it and enter a burnt out--

           INT. PASSENGER CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Where they crouch against the melted plastic seats.  Peter 
           peers out--

           The train they’re trying to get to less than 100 feet away.

           But the wolves seem to be everywhere.  Then:

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’ll go out.  I’ll draw them away.  
                        You make a run for it.

           Likely a suicide mission.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Wait for me to fire--that’s your 
                        signal.  

                                 IRIS
                        I’ll go with you. 

           Find Greg--his eyes on his teenage daughter.
                                 GREG
                        No--

                                 IRIS
                        Dad.

                                 GREG
                        I’ll go.  You stay with Peter. 

           He’s terrified.  He hugs Iris.  He and Debbie disappear.

           It’s that quick.  

           We hold on Peter and Iris crouched in the train.  Iris tries 
           not to cry. 

                                 IRIS
                        He hates violence.  He doesn’t even 
                        like football.  

           And then it begins.  Hear Debbie yell something 
           unintelligible.  Then GUNFIRE.  

           Peter’s sees a wolf sprinting towards the commotion.

                                 PETER
                        Let’s go.

           With them as they leave the passenger car--

           EXT. TRAIN YARD - CONTINUOUS

           And race the remaining hundred feet to the target train.  The 
           gunfire doesn’t stop--it echoes inside the maze and it must 
           be hell.

           They arrive and Peter immediately sees all the doors are 
           shut.  He uses his gun to pry one open--

                                 PETER
                        Help me.

           Iris’ smaller hands squeeze into the cracks.  They pull it 
           ajar and are suddenly--

           INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Empty.  Abandoned coats and purses.  The lights are off--

                                 IRIS
                        There’s no electricity, no power--

           But Peter goes to the engine car, immediately looks over the 
           dials and levers and instruments.  
                                 PETER
                        I got caught on one of these during 
                        a blackout--they used auxiliary 
                        power to move us to the station--

           Then he sees a the auxiliary power command--locked behind a 
           Plexiglas case.

                                 IRIS
                        Peter--

           She grabs a set of keys hanging on the wall.  Tosses them.

           He tries several keys--

                                 IRIS
                        You hear that?  The firing stopped.
                             (beat)
                        That means they’re dead.

           Peter finds the right key.  Opens the case.  

                                 PETER
                        We’ll wait for them.

           But Iris shakes her head.  Wiping the tears.  

                                 IRIS
                        No.  

           Peter flips the power switch.  Hear the ROAR of the engine.  
           The lights come on.  The instruments fire.

           Shoves the accelerator forward.  The train lurches.  Moves.  

                                 IRIS
                        PETER.

           That’s when we see Greg and Debbie tearing across the 
           graveled surface of the train yard--

           Closing in, but Debbie stumbles.  

           Greg pulls her up, sprinting for the open door.  The train is 
           picking up speed and moments from going faster they can run.

                                 IRIS
                        COME ON.

           Then two wolves SLIP-SLIDE around the back of the car, 
           tearing after the subway--

           Peter leans out, grabs Debbie’s hand and yanks her inside.
           On Iris, she clocks the wolves--

           See her fifty-something father pounding gravel, Peter’s hand 
           out stretched--

                                 IRIS
                        DAD, THEY’RE COMING--

           He lunges forward, grasping Peter’s hand but losing his 
           footing, dragged over the uneven ground.  

           But if that’s not bad enough--the stadium TRAIN STATION is 
           looming.  There’s a steel pillar with Greg’s name on it. 

           And the train has hit 40 miles an hour.  

           INSIDE THE TRAIN

           Iris and Debbie race over and all three put a hand on Greg 
           and pull him into the car just before he’s halved by the 
           station and the roaring train.  

           Iris throws her arms around her Dad--

           Peter and Debbie move to the engine car--see the train 
           accelerating.  55, 60, 65, 70--

           Look back to see the wolves receding, unable to keep up.

           But ahead the tunnel looms.  

           The barricade.  The wolves.  The soldiers.  

           The train pushes 80, 85.  It’s fucking flying.  Above, see 
           Hawks circle in--

           Debbie and Peter share a look.  

                                 PETER
                        Here we go.  EVERYBODY DOWN.

           And that’s when it begins.  Hell on fucking earth.  We stay 
           with our heroes as the army unloads on the subway car--
           everything they’ve got.  HEAR explosions go off--

           As the train rattles, glass shatters, bullets ping--

           Peter looks up, barely sees the maw of the tunnel before the 
           train collides with the barricade.  

           And times slows down.  We’re suddenly caught in a slow motion 
           dance of destruction--
           SOLDIERS flip and twist in the air, knocked sideways by the 
           collision.  A wolf’s body torn in half between the train and 
           tunnel wall.  Glass shards sprinkle like rain.  Bullets fly 
           inches from our heroes.  Debris.  Acrid smoke.  Sparks.  

           Then black.  

           Hear SCREACHING METAL--suddenly the lights flicker on--we’re 
           inside the tunnel. 

           And we’re still moving.

           Our heroes rise to their feet.  A holy shit moment as they 
           survived the impossible.

           But only a moment--

           Because an EXPLOSION knocks them all back.  See the second 
           car directly behind them erupt in fire.  The back half of it 
           tears away, the font half topples in a BANSHEE CRY of sparks 
           and ripped metal--

           They’re dragging it behind them.  And worse.  See wolves and 
           hawks giving chase.  The cause of the explosion.

           Peter suddenly realizes.  Checks out the speed gauge.  It’s 
           dropping.  

           And the enemy is gaining--

           Peter makes his way to the back of the engine car towards the 
           halved second car.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

                                 PETER
                        I HAVE TO CUT IT LOOSE--

           But he quickly realizes he can’t do it from inside.  

                                 PETER
                        KEEP THEM OFF ME.

           Debbie, Greg and Iris take firing position.  

           And Peter climbs out the window of the train.

           EXT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Now imagine yourself negotiating the outside of a screaming 
           train.  Imagine the insanity.  Imagine you have no choice--
           With Peter as he finds a foothold, grappling with the cold 
           metal, sliding towards the connector.

           He’s feet away, but getting there will require a leap of 
           faith.  He reaches out, barely aware of the gunfire from 
           inside the train.

           And jumps, colliding rib-first with the train connector, his 
           feet almost ripped from under him.  But he pulls himself up--

           Peter wish-bones the two cars, the connector pin below him.  
           He releases the lock, now tugging at the PIN.

           Then a second EXPLOSION--Peter is nearly tossed, but grabs a 
           handle and manages to hang on for dear life--

           A beat.  See the pin in his other hand.

           And there it goes--the second car disengages, flipping and 
           bounces off the tunnel walls and track--taking out the wolves 
           and hawks like a massive bowling ball--

           Disappearing into the darkness. 

           Suddenly a hand grabs Peter, pulling him inside the train.

           Greg.  A beat.  

                                 GREG
                        That was nuts.

           Peter smiles.  But Greg’s face darkens, he tosses Peter to 
           the ground--

           As two surviving wolves appear and opens fire--

           Peppering Greg with bullets.

           It happened too fast for us to be shocked. 

                                 IRIS
                        DAD.

           But the wolves aren’t stopping.  One leaps forwards and lands 
           on the back of the train--its two front legs wrenching it in 
           the doorway.

           Its gun barrel nose pointed at us.

                                 GREG
                        GET DOWN.

           Not dead, not yet.  He throws himself at the wolf, latching 
           onto its body--
           See the wolf struggle to break free, it fires erratically--

           Greg sets his feet against the train door.

           Looks back at his daughter--

           And kicks.

           Watch the two of them fly off the back of the train--

           But there’s no time to mourn.  The second wolf tries a 
           different tack.  It runs alongside and slams its body against 
           us--so powerful the train lifts, teetering on one edge--

           Again and again and again--

           Next time it’s going over.  Peter crawls to Iris and Debbie.  
           He wraps his arms around them and there it goes--

           The train yaws for a suspended second then tips.  The front 
           end catches an edge and suddenly it’s fishtailing in circles.

           The wolf slammed between it and the tunnel wall.

           Peter, Debbie, and Iris caught in a washing machine 
           nightmare.

           Finally it stops.

           Peter’s eyes open first.  Blood from his forehead drips.  He 
           rises up.  Debbie is crumpled in the corner. 

           Iris lays close to Peter.  He struggles to his knees.  

           Then Iris opens her eyes.

                                 PETER
                        You okay?

           She nods.  

                                 IRIS
                        Debbie?

           Debbie is awake too, struggling to her feet.  Her gun still 
           strapped to her shoulder.  She tosses Peter his.  Iris find 
           hers behind a bent seat.

                                 PETER
                        Let’s finish this.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           See the wreck of the train, lodged sideways against the brick 
           walls.  Peter emerges first.  Bloody T-shirt, gashed 
           forehead, fucking assault rifle.  

           Then Iris and Debbie.  Now standing a top the train.

           See what they do:

           INT. COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Like Hitler’s secret mountain base, built right there on the 
           gravel floor.  Similar to the BRIDGE of an aircraft carrier.  
           But 10 times the size.  Hundreds of MONITORS line the walls.  
           A holographic map of the battle hovers mid-tunnel.  A glass 
           office on risers lords over it all.  

           The room is silent.  All of the technicians stare in awe at 
           our heroes.

           See a single soldier reach for his sidearm--

                                 PETER
                        Don’t be stupid.  

           The soldier stops.  

           This scene is exactly what Peter and Molly saw on the PDA.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The techs and remaining soldiers are locked in the glass 
           office.  

           Pick up Peter scanning the terminals.  The futuristic tech.

           Catch glimpses of the images on the monitor.  POV views of 
           the battle being fought.  Hawks engaged with fighter jets.  
           Wolves emitting tracer fire.  Our troops gunned down.

                                 IRIS
                        Peter. 

           He looks at her, she motions towards another MONITOR where we 
           see a live feed of soldiers pouring into the tunnel towards 
           the command center.   

                                 IRIS
                        What do we do? 

           Peter glances at Debbie, then back to Iris.
                                 PETER
                        Take positions, when they get 
                        close, start shooting, hopefully 
                        it’ll buy me enough time.

           As Iris and Debbie take cover at top the wrecked train, guns 
           trained on the entrance, Peter sits down at a terminal and 
           begins to work.  

           See the reflection of WINDOWS and CODE moving in Peter’s eyes 
           as he tries to break into their system.  Fingers pounding 
           keys.  

           On Iris, eyes flicking from the monitor with the soldiers and 
           the darkness before her. 

           On Debbie, somehow clear eyed, we realize she’s resigned to 
           die.

           Suddenly we hear the soldiers boot steps.  See hundreds of 
           flashlights approaching.

           On Peter, see the frustration.  See the screen flash words 
           like:  COMMAND DENIED.   

                                 IRIS
                        THEY’RE GETTING CLOSER.

           Peter blinks away sweat--

                                 PETER
                        I’m through the firewall--

                                 IRIS
                        HURRY--

                                 PETER
                        There’s over fifty separate 
                        uplinks.

           And then he sees something.

                                 PETER
                        Wait.  There’s no reason to shut 
                        them down.  

           Realizing.  His fingers now flying.  

                                 PETER
                        Almost.

           The YELLING grows louder.  We can FEEL the soldier’s getting 
           ready.
           On Iris, Debbie, sweaty fingers hovering over their triggers.

                                 PETER
                        Got it.  Let’s see them fight an 
                        army of their own.

           See one command on the screen in front of Peter.

           INITIATE?

           Peter closes his eyes with relief.  And for some reason the 
           soldier’s don’t fire.  It was almost too easy.  

           And then we know why.

                                 IRIS
                        PETER, STOP.  They have her.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 IRIS
                        They have Molly.

           Peter looks up.  In the monitor we see the darkness of the 
           tunnel, except for one image, illuminated in light.

           Molly.  On her knees.  A soldier with a gun to her head.  

           It’s JIM FORD, the soldier from the school.  And then his 
           voice echoing from the tunnel---

                                 FORD (O.S.)
                        Can you hear me, Peter?  

           Peter says nothing, so Ford presses the gun to the back of 
           his wife’s head.

                                 PETER
                        I hear you.

                                 FORD (O.S.)
                        I told you, succeed or fail, 
                        continue on this path and your wife 
                        and your unborn son would die.

           Peter glances at the COMMAND on the computer screen.  
           INITIATE?  Then back at the MONITOR.

                                 FORD
                        Our future is a defined by a series 
                        of choices.  Your’s wife’s future 
                        will be defined by one.  Yours.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FORD (cont'd)
                        Push the button, maybe we lose, 
                        maybe we don’t.  But push it, and 
                        Molly dies.  Surrender.  She lives. 

           On Peter.  A final impossible choice.  He squeezes the sweat 
           from his eyes.

                                 PETER
                        Where are my daughters?

           Ford taps Molly with the gun.

                                 MOLLY
                        They were picked up by a rescue 
                        team.

                                 PETER
                        You came back for me?

                                 MOLLY
                        I’ll always come back for you.

           And that’s hurts more then anything.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter.  Listen to me.  

           On her knees, tears in her eyes.  

                                 MOLLY
                        You have to take care our family, 
                        there’s only one way to give them 
                        the future they deserve.

           His eyes fixated on her.  Molly looking directly into the 
           camera as if she can see him too.

                                 MOLLY
                        Anybody would give up.  For my sake 
                        you should.
                             (beat)
                        That’s why you can’t.

           Her way of telling him to push the button.  See Molly close 
           her eyes, ready for the end.  Peter takes a last look and 
           then turns away.

                                 FORD
                        You have no idea what you’re about 
                        to do.  We’re trying to save this 
                        country.

                                 PETER
                        By killing innocent people?
                                 FORD
                        Not innocent.  The poor, the 
                        criminal, the weak.  The reason for 
                        the “fall.”  
                             (beat)
                        The strong will survive, they 
                        always do.  This is the only way.

                                 PETER
                        No.  It’s not.  

           Peter closes his eyes and initiates.  

           The response is immediate.  The soldiers outside open fire.

           Iris and Debbie return volley.  

           The entire command center is shredded in a maelstrom of 
           bullets.

           On Peter, not bothering to duck, simply lets the world 
           explode around him.  All sound fades away.  

           Papers flutter, equipment sparks, furniture and monitors torn 
           to pieces.  

           It goes on and on and on, until-

           A voice emerges from the silence--

                                 IRIS
                        Peter?  Peter?  PETER?

           Peter looks up, eyes filled with tears.

                                 IRIS 
                        You did it

           On the monitors we see POV shots of HAWKS and WOLVES and 
           unmanned CHOPPERS turning against their masters.  Firing back 
           into the base. 

           We see them pouring into the tunnel, taking out the soldiers 
           who were firing on our heroes.  We hear it happening--

                                 PETER
                        Molly--

           With Peter as he climbs the train car, looking out into the 
           lightening flash of the soldier’s battling their own weapons.

           He hits the dirt, searching.
                                 PETER
                        MOLLY?  MOLLY?

           Then:

                                 MOLLY
                        Peter?

           He nearly breaks.  They collide together.  She throws her 
           arms around him--

           Silhouettes against the raging battle down the tunnel.  

                                 PETER
                        How?

                                 MOLLY
                        Any version of the future I could 
                        think of, you always you chose me.  
                        I figured that must be the reason I 
                        was going to die.  

           They hug again as Debbie and Iris approach.  Standing 
           together.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - LATER

           Soldier’s bodies strewn about.  The tunnel entrance black 
           against the blazing sun. 

           Then emerging--Peter, Molly, Iris and Debbie.  Peter carries 
           Greg’s body.

           They stop in disbelief.

           See our troops filing onto the base.  Our jets soaring over 
           head.  Wolves stand docile.  The carcasses of their masters 
           littered before them.  They stand as if waiting Peter’s next 
           command.  

           A moment to take it all in.

           Then Molly sees Jim Ford, still breathing, a bullet wound in 
           his stomach.  He’s leaning against the shredded barricade.

           Our heroes look to Ford.  Peter says nothing.  But Molly 
           approaches him.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What could possibly happen in the 
                        future to warrant this? 
           Ford meets her gaze.  A beat.

                                 FORD
                        You’ll find out.

           As his eyes close for the last time. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           CLOSE ON: Peter.  Clean.  His hair combed.  Reveal we’re:

           INT. ROOM - SOMEWHERE - SOMETIME

           A small state room.  Two twin beds where Emma and Anna sleep.  
           Peter sits on a couch wearing fresh clothes.  Molly lays with 
           her head in his lap.  Their wounds have been tended to. 

           A knock on the door.

           A PETTY OFFICER in NAVAL ATTIRE enters.

                                 PETTY OFFICER
                        Mr. and Mrs. Fox?  You presence is 
                        requested.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Peter and Molly enter a nicely appointed office.  We still 
           don’t know where we are.

           A MAN rises from his chair. 

                                 MAN
                        Peter, Molly.  My name is Jack 
                        Norman, I’m the President’s chief 
                        of staff.  

           They shake hands.  

                                 NORMAN
                        Have a seat.

           They do. 

                                 NORMAN
                        You both have survived something 
                        quite extraordinary. 

           Norman sits forward in his chair.

                                 NORMAN
                        The fact is, we need your help. 
                                 PETER
                        I told your people everything I 
                        know.

           Norman nods, rubs his eyes.  He is beyond exhaustion.

                                 NORMAN
                        We have to master this technology, 
                        learn from it, improve up on it.  
                        Or we don’t have much of a chance.

                                 PETER
                        Sir?

                                 NORMAN
                        The Seattle attack wasn’t an 
                        isolated event.  The war is far 
                        from over.  
                             (beat)
                        Unfortunately, Peter.  It’s just 
                        beginning.

           Off Peter we suddenly we pull back, out of the windows.  
           Revealing them to be on an AIRCRAFT CARRIER.

           Pull back farther and we realize they are in the Puget Sound.  
           BATTLE SHIPS dot the bay.

           Continuing impossibly high.  Seattle in ruins.    

           Farther, as we witness the Western Seaboard.  

           PORTLAND.  SAN FRANCISCO.  LOS ANGELES.  Explosions.  Smoke. 

           Further still.  Destruction.  Fighting.

           CHICAGO. HOUSTON. DALLAS.

           Further still.  The entire U.S.

           NEW YORK.  BOSTON.  DC.  MIAMI.

           Further still.

           Black.
