           INT. POWELL HOME, BEDROOM - DAY 

           COLIN LUTHER POWELL, 65, retired four-star general, U.S. 
           Secretary of State and the most popular public figure in the 
           country stands in boxer shorts and socks in front a large 
           closet. 

           He looks sleep-deprived and stressed, worn down by the 
           burdens of his office. And right now he’s running late.

           He throws on a crisp shirt. A tie. His dark green ARMY DRESS 
           UNIFORM.

           He checks himself in a full-length mirror. His hair is more 
           gray now than black and he’s not as trim as he once was, but 
           he’s still an imposing man.

           He straightens the raft of MEDALS on the jacket, the name tag 
           over the breast pocket that reads, simply: “POWELL.”

           He stares at his reflection for a long beat. Something is 
           weighing heavy on his mind and the sight of himself in his 
           old uniform gives him pause.

           He snaps out of it as his wife, ALMA, early 60s, poised and 
           splendid in an elegant dress, enters. 

                                 ALMA
                        Ready?

                                 POWELL
                        Ready.

                                 ALMA
                        The car’s here. 

                                 POWELL
                        Good. Let’s go.

           They continue the conversation as they head DOWNSTAIRS.

                                 ALMA
                        They’ll drop me off first.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay.

                                 ALMA
                        And you’ll go on and get Annemarie 
                        from the hotel.

                                 POWELL
                        I will.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 ALMA
                        The church is only a few blocks 
                        away.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes.

                                 POWELL
                        It won’t take more than five 
                        minutes.

                                 POWELL
                        Right. 
                (beat)
                        What happens then?

                                 ALMA
                        Colin--

                                 POWELL
                        That’s when I walk her down the 
                        aisle?

                                 ALMA
                        Promise me you won’t do this when 
                        you’re with her.

                                 POWELL
                        All right, I promise.

                                 ALMA
                        Because she’s going to be nervous. 
                        However composed she might look 
                        she’ll be about ready to break down 
                        in tears, and one of your jokes 
                        might be all it takes.

           They walk out the front door --

           EXT. POWELL HOME - DAY 

           A limo is waiting for them in the driveway of this upscale 
           suburban house. The DRIVER greets them with a tip of his cap.

           Alma holds Powell back a moment.

                                 ALMA
                        Listen. How are you doing?

                                 POWELL
                        I’m fine.

                                 ALMA
                        It’s bad timing.
                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        If it wasn’t this it would be 
                        something else.

                                 ALMA
                        Try not to think about it, okay? At 
                        least for today, just put it all 
                        out of your mind.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m not thinking about it. I’m 
                        thinking how lovely you look in 
                        that dress.

                                 ALMA
                        Good. Hold that thought.

           The Driver lets them into the back of the limo.

           INT. LUXURY HOTEL, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

           A wedding reception in full swing. The GUESTS include a 
           lively mix of POLITICIANS, MILITARY BRASS and JAMAICANS, many 
           of whom sport brightly-colored traditional dress.

           The celebrations flow freely between a BALLROOM, where a 
           REGGAE BAND has the YOUNGER CROWD jumping, and the BAR AREA, 
           which feels like a de facto officers’ club as ADMIRALS and 
           GENERALS trade war stories over tall glasses of rum punch.

           RICHARD ARMITAGE, late 50s, holds court at the bar. Bald, 
           barrel chested, formidable -- a guy you want with you in the 
           trenches, even if he’s ever so slightly past his prime.

           SUPER: RICHARD ARMITAGE, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        The president’s on stage. He’s 
                        started his speech. And I’m running 
                        around in hallways like a headless 
                        chicken, trying to find the right 
                        staircase.

           As his story progresses, some of the MILITARY TYPES chip in 
           to goad him along. An ADMIRAL--

                                 ADMIRAL
                        General Powell’s with you?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        No, the General can’t -- the 
                        Secretary can’t leave the 
                        auditorium.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 ADMIRAL
                        Of course.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It’s the United Nations. You’ve got 
                        cameras all over.

           A COLONEL, flushed with booze--

                                 COLONEL
                        The world is watching!

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Half a billion people are watching.

           An ARMY WIFE, teasing--

                                 ARMY WIFE
                        So you’re on your own. The hero of 
                        the hour.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Yeah, but look at me. This is not 
                        the same body that rescued 20,000 
                        boat people from the middle of the 
                        South China Sea.

           Everybody LAUGHS.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        So I’m running around, sweating 
                        through my suit. Every door I try is 
                        locked from the other side. It’s like 
                        a bad dream. Eventually I find the 
                        right one, I’m backstage, but I’ve 
                        got to get to the teleprompter guy in 
                        about the next seventeen seconds or 
                        the president’s going to say the 
                        wrong thing and there’s going to be 
                        an international incident.

           He pauses for effect. But then his attention shifts from the 
           rapt audience in front of him to the other side of the bar, 
           where LAWRENCE WILKERSON, late 50s, signals to him.

                                 ADMIRAL
                        So what happened? Richard?

           Armitage stands abruptly.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Excuse me.

           He pushes through the crush to join Wilkerson. Bespectacled, 
           serious, a Southern military gentleman -- he’s a little less 
           bald than Armitage, a little less bullish.
                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 ARMITAGE
                        What’s going on?

           SUPER: LAWRENCE B. WILKERSON, COLIN POWELL’S CHIEF OF STAFF.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Not here.

           AT THE BAR

           MIKE POWELL, late 30s, picks up a couple of beers and heads 
           across the room. He looks very much like a young Colin, but 
           walks with a slight limp, his body tilted forward.

           Behind him, Wilkerson and Armitage disappear into another 
           part of the hotel. 

           Mike carries on towards Powell, his dad, who is with a group 
           of old ARMY BUDDIES. He’s the center of attention and doing 
           his best to join in the laughter and back-slapping. But his 
           mind is elsewhere. His face lights up when he sees Mike and 
           he excuses himself from the group.

                                 POWELL
                        I hope one of those is for me.

           Mike hands him a beer.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not sure I’m in the right 
                        place.

                                 POWELL
                        How do you mean?

                                 MIKE
                        I thought this was my sister’s 
                        wedding, but then I walk in and 
                        it’s like a convention of the Joint 
                        Chiefs and all their staffs.

                                 POWELL
                        She asked me if I’d like to invite 
                        a few friends. 

                                 MIKE
                        And?

                                 POWELL
                        I told her “yes”.

                                 MIKE
                        What happens if we’re invaded? 
                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        Tonight?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. I mean, is there a Rear 
                        Admiral or someone who isn’t here, 
                        just in case? Like when they do the 
                        State of the Union and the 
                        Secretary Of Agriculture gets 
                        hidden away in a bunker.

                                 POWELL
                        I wouldn’t worry, Mike. I think 
                        we’ve got it covered.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY

           Wilkerson leads Armitage towards a TV near the front desk. 
           It’s showing CNN but the sound is off. Wilkerson calls out to 
           the CONCIERGE, 40s.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Excuse me?

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Yes, sir?

                                 WILKERSON
                        Can we get some volume on this, 
                        please.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Of course.

           He reaches behind the desk for a remote.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Larry, are you going to tell me 
                        what this is?

                                 WILKERSON
                        Hold on a second. You won’t believe 
                        me if you don’t hear it for 
                        yourself.

           The Concierge turns up the volume.

                                 CNN ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        ... as to whether Secretary of 
                        State Colin Powell will go to the 
                        U.N. and give a speech that could 
                        make the case for war in Iraq. In 
                        exclusive breaking news this 
                        evening, sources within the 
                        administration have told CNN that 
                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 CNN ANCHOR(cont'd)
                        Secretary Powell will indeed appear 
                        before the UN Security Council, and 
                        he is expected to do so within a 
                        matter of days.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Oh, fuck me.

           He starts immediately back towards the bar.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Richard, slow down.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Does he know?

                                 WILKERSON
                        We can’t do this now.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        We have to do it now.

           Alma exits a restroom just as Armitage and Wilkerson hustle 
           past. She sizes up the situation in a flash.

                                 ALMA
                        Larry?

                                 WILKERSON
                        Alma, it’s nothing. 

                                 ALMA
                        It doesn’t look like nothing.

           She moves to cut them off.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        We’re going to need him for just a 
                        couple of minutes.

                                 ALMA
                        Richard, if you’re about to ruin 
                        this day for my little girl, then 
                        so help me --

                                 WILKERSON
                        Alma, please.

           The conversation has carried them back into the bar area. 
           From across the room, Powell, who’s still chatting with Mike, 
           sees them. He knows immediately this isn’t good.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Powell huddles with Armitage and Wilkerson as the party 
           continues around them. In hushed voices --
                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        It’s been leaked? 

                                 WILKERSON
                        Yes.

                                 POWELL
                        A decision I haven’t made yet has 
                        been leaked to the press?

                                 WILKERSON
                        Yes, sir, that’s about the size of it.

                                 POWELL
                        Do we know how --?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It’s got Cheney’s paw prints all 
                        over it.

                                 WILKERSON
                        It doesn’t matter whose paw prints.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        He’s trying to force our hand.

                                 POWELL
                        Larry’s right, it doesn't matter 
                        who authorized it -- the genie’s 
                        out of the bottle now.

                                 WILKERSON
                        You’ll have to confirm or deny. 
                        “I’m still making up my mind” isn’t 
                        an option now, sir. 

                                 POWELL
                        How long?

                                 WILKERSON
                        The press are going to respect that 
                        this is your daughter’s wedding day 
                        for, oh, about another ten minutes. 
                        And it’s all anyone’s going to be 
                        talking about on the morning shows. 
                        You have to preempt that.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        The report is false. Deny it.

                                 WILKERSON
                        It’s not that simple. If you deny 
                        it now it’ll be seen as a finite 
                        signal you oppose invasion.

                        If I deny it now the president’s 
                        going to want my resignation.

           There it is. They all look a little stunned, Powell included, 
           hearing it said so starkly.

           He glances through to the ballroom where ANNEMARIE POWELL, 
           early 30s, radiant in her wedding dress, tears up the dance 
           floor, surrounded by AUNTS and COUSINS, oblivious and happy.

           Powell looks pained. He can’t believe this is happening now.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Sir?(cid:13)

                                 POWELL
                        I can’t think in here with this 
                        music.

           He walks off. Armitage starts to follow.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Give him a minute.

           EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - NIGHT

           Powell steps outside from the bar and closes the French door. 
           The MUSIC continues to filter out.

           It’s a clear, cold winter’s night, but he seems to welcome 
           the chill as he tries to clear his head for one of the 
           hardest decisions he’ll ever make.

           He looks out across the sparkling lights of the city. Not too 
           far away, THE WHITE HOUSE stands illuminated.

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           A sweltering summer’s day. TOURISTS mill around the perimeter 
           fence. A sense of calm and normality.

           SUPER: AUGUST 5TH 2002. SIX MONTHS EARLIER.

                        What we’re talking about is nothing 
                        less than a whole new mode of war-
                        fighting.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

           “PRINCIPALS” meeting -- all the key players in the 
           administration. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH heads the table, 
                                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           relaxed but focused, as DONALD RUMSFELD, 70, makes his pitch 
           with cock-sure bluster. 

           Powell is at Bush’s left. DICK CHENEY, 61, to his right. 
           Silently taking everything in, giving nothing away.

           SUPER: DONALD RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

                                  RUMSFELD
                        I’m going to let General Franks 
                        take you through the details. But 
                        this is something I personally am 
                        excited about, and I’m confident 
                        you’ll all come to share that 
                        sentiment. Tommy?

           TOMMY FRANKS, 50s, intimidating but soft-spoken, takes over.

           SUPER: GEN. TOMMY FRANKS, COMMANDER OF U.S. FORCES IN THE 
           MIDDLE EAST.

                                 FRANKS
                        We’re calling this the “Hybrid 
                        Plan.”

                                 FRANKS
                        The idea is to take the best of the 
                        Generated Start and the Running 
                        Start, both of which you are all 
                        familiar with, and arrive at 
                        something altogether more optimal, 
                        premised on a streamlining of troop 
                        numbers.

           Powell doesn’t like where this is going. He exchanges a 
           glance with Armitage, seated in back, but holds his peace.

           Franks clicks to a slide showing a MAP of the Middle East, 
           plus troop numbers, deployment times etc.

                        This allows us to shrink the front-
                        end of the operation and achieve 
                        force deployment in eleven days.

                        unexpected move by Saddam once 
                        deployment was underway? Say he’s 
                        going to hit Kuwait or cut off oil 
                        flow to Turkey?

                        There’s built-in flexibility for 
                        that kind of thing. It’s not a 
                        point of no return.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        We can get you the details.

                        There’ll need to be humanitarian 
                        assistance from day one.

           Powell nods in agreement. He tries to catch Rice’s attention, 
           but she avoids eye contact.

                                 FRANKS
                        That’s an aspect we’re still fine-
                        tuning.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Look, the key is the quicker force 
                        posturing. This will greatly 
                        improve our short-term capability 
                        in the region. It will enable us to 
                        strike a body blow to Saddam before 
                        he even knows what hit him.

           All eyes turn to the president.

                                 BUSH
                        Good. I like the concept of that. 
                        Keep honing it, keep me up to date.

           INT. POWELL’S CAR, TRAVELING - DAY

           Speeding away from the White House, towards Foggy Bottom. 
           Powell and Armitage in the back.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s bullshit.

                        It’s not your purview.

                                 POWELL
                        A situation like this, you go as a 
                        last resort if you go in at all, and 
                        you do it with overwhelming force, 
                        not some “streamlined” mini-army.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Are you pissed about the new plan, 
                        or are you pissed that this is the 
                        focus?

                                 POWELL
                        You don’t think I’m right to be 
                        offended by their gimmick of an 
                        invasion strategy?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I don’t think you get to have an 
                        opinion either way. Not so long as 
                        you’re out of the uniform.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m more experienced at this than 
                        anyone in the administration, 
                        uniform or not.

           Armitage rolls his eyes. Powell catches it and fixes him with 
           a reprimanding stare, though he doesn’t really mean it. 
           There’s an easy camaraderie between these old friends.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Yes, sir.

           EXT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY 

           The car pulls up. Powell and Armitage get out and make for 
           the entrance.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Look, things are moving awful fast 
                        here. They’re not drawing up these 
                        kinds of contingencies as an 
                        academic exercise. This is real.

                                 POWELL
                        If they’re set on war, our window 
                        to influence that decision is 
                        already closed.

STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY 

           They walk a hallway. 

                                 ARMITAGE
                        What if they’re not?

           STAFFERS pass them by. Armitage lowers his voice. 

                                 ARMITAGE
                        What if they’re not already 
                        committed to invasion?

                                 POWELL
                        You were in the briefing.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        So Rumsfeld’s got a boner for his 
                        shiny new take on Sun Tzu. And 
                        Cheney can sit there with that 
                        lopsided poker face as long as he 
                        likes -- we all know he’s itching 
                        for another go at Saddam. But they 
                        don’t get to decide. The president 
                        does. And he doesn’t have the body 
                        language of a man who’s set on 
                        sending American kids to war. Not 
                        yet he doesn’t.

           They pass through a BULLPEN AREA, the bustling hub of 
           Powell’s office. A TV shows news footage of HAMID KARZAI. The 
           chyron reads: “NEW PRESIDENT EXPRESSES HOPE FOR REBUILDING 
           AFGHANISTAN.”

           Wilkerson joins them.

                                 WILKERSON
                        How’d it go?

           Powell shakes his head: not good. 

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It went swell. We’ll be dancing on 
                        the banks of the Tigris by Labor Day.

                                 WILKERSON
                (to Powell, concerned)
                        He’s exaggerating?

POWELL’S OFFICE

           Wilkerson closes the door. 

                                 WILKERSON
                        All right. So what are we thinking?

                                 POWELL
                        Richard wants me to take a stand.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I do. If you can’t put the brakes 
                        on this, no one can. 

                                 POWELL
                        But you were right, Richard -- we 
                        don’t know what this is yet. All 
                        we’ve seen is a fanciful 
                        presentation that wouldn’t pass 
                        muster in a freshman seminar at 
                        West Point. And quite frankly the 
                        last thing I want to do right now 
                        is jump blindly into a political 
                        knife fight with Dick Cheney.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Well, I’m sorry, sir, but you might 
                        have to get a little metaphorical 
                        blood on your hands before we’re 
                        all of us accountable for spilling 
                        the real thing across half the 
                        Middle East.

           Powell glares at him, and this time he really is mad. 

                                 POWELL
                        Are you done?

           Armitage knows he went too far.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 POWELL
                (to Wilkerson)
                        Talk it out. Report back.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Pushing and shoving isn’t going to 
                        help.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        We’ve got to get him there somehow. 
                        We’ve got to get him to a place 
                        where he’s ready to take this on. 
                        He’s the country’s top diplomat and 
                        he’s still thinking like a general 
                        gaming out deployment scenarios.

                                 WILKERSON
                        I know. But there’s more than one 
                        way we can play this, it doesn’t 
                        have to be a knife fight...

           He continues over --

           INT. POWELL HOME, DEN - NIGHT

           Powell sits at his desk, deep in thought.

                                 WILKERSON (O.S. CONT’D)
                        Cheney’s not the only one with 
                        influence in this administration, 
                        whatever he might like to think.

           Powell is surrounded by framed photographs -- family 
           portraits, but also a quick pictorial history of his career: 
           in Vietnam, with Reagan, with Clinton etc.

           He picks up the phone and dials. Condi Rice answers.

           INTERCUT WITH RICE ON HER CELL PHONE.

                                 RICE
                        Hello?

                                 POWELL
                        Condi, sorry to call so late.

                                 RICE
                        That’s okay. I was just catching up 
                        on some reading.

           She’s still in her OFFICE. The only person here.

                                 POWELL
                        Listen, I need a favor. I need you 
                        to get me some face time with the 
                        president.

                        Colin, you don’t need my permission 
                        for that.

                                 POWELL
                        No, but I don’t have the same kind 
                        of one-to-one access you do. And in 
                        this instance I’m going to want the 
                        opportunity to speak my mind 
                        without a lot of other people 
                        diluting the message.

                                 RICE
                        You mean without the vice president.

                                 POWELL
                        Of course if you want to sit in, 
                        that’s fine.

                                 RICE
                        I’ll put it to the president.

                                 POWELL
                        Thank you.

           He hangs up just as Alma enters.

                                 ALMA
                        Problems?

                                 POWELL
                        Maybe. Things are getting a little 
                        complicated.

                                 ALMA
                        You look tense.

                                 POWELL
                        No, it’s just been a long day.

                                 ALMA
                        I can see it in your shoulders. 
                        It’s making me tense.

           Powell drops his shoulders.

                                 POWELL
                        Better?

           Alma smiles, but still looks worried.

                                 ALMA
                        Come and say hi to Annemarie.

           INT. POWELL HOME, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Annemarie is at the kitchen table studying BROCHURES from 
           several nice-looking hotels.

           Powell and Alma enter.

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Good.

                                 POWELL
                        What’s good?

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Your being here. We have to make a 
                        final decision.

                                 POWELL
                        On the choice of husband?

                        On the venue.

                                 POWELL
                        Ah. Well, as your father I think 
                        it’s only right that I should have 
                        the final say on this important 
                        matter and --

           Annemarie thrusts two brochures at him.

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Pick one.

                                 POWELL
                        Now?

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Yes.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s months away. What’s the rush?

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        The rush is so we can actually book 
                        something here in Washington as 
                        opposed to, you know, Washington 
                        State. Pick.

                                 POWELL
                        This one.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)           He chooses the one she is obviously holding forward.

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Good choice! Thanks, Dad.

           She gathers up her things.

                                 POWELL
                        You’re leaving already?

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Yeah, sorry, but some of us 
                        actually sleep.

           She kisses him.

                                 POWELL
                        If there’s anything else I can help 
                        with. Choosing the dress or--

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        I’ll be sure and let you know.

           She kisses Alma.

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Bye, Mom.

                                 ALMA
                        Bye, sweetie.

           Annemarie leaves.

                                 POWELL
                        I didn’t know she was here.

                                 ALMA
                        You were busy. She didn’t want to 
                        disturb you.

                                 POWELL
                        She can always disturb me, she 
                        knows that.
                (beat)
                        Well, I actually have a couple more 
                        calls to make.
                (off her look)
                        What?

                                 ALMA
                        Nothing. Just... be careful.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay... I’m not sure that I know 
                        what you mean by that.
                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 ALMA
                        Your shoulders again--

                                 POWELL
                        Alma, there’s nothing wrong with my 
                        shoulders.

                                 ALMA
                        And making calls from home, this late 
                        in the day... Colin, I’m not asking 
                        for a classified briefing but I wish 
                        you’d let me in a little bit.

           Powell hesitates, he’s not sure how much he can tell her.

                                 POWELL
                        It may be that I’m going to have to 
                        take a position on something and 
                        it’s not going to win me an awful 
                        lot of friends.

                                 ALMA
                        We talked about this.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes.

                                 ALMA
                        When you took the job.

                                 POWELL
                        I remember.

                                 ALMA
                        The Army insulated you in a way 
                        that doesn’t happen when you’re the 
                        Secretary of State. 

                                 POWELL
                        Yes, it did. And now I’ve got to 
                        sell the president’s foreign policy 
                        to people who would very often 
                        shoot their own grandmothers before 
                        they’ll agree with anything I say. 
                        But in this case it’s not the 
                        Chinese or the Europeans I’m going 
                        to be up against. Not even the 
                        Democrats.

                                 ALMA
                        Oh. I see.

                                 POWELL
                        I don’t remember that being 
                        something we talked about.
                                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 ALMA
                        You’ve always been willing to speak 
                        out.

                                 POWELL
                        But on strategy, on tactics. I 
                        haven’t ever had to counter members 
                        of my own administration on an 
                        issue of whether or not we ought to 
                        go to war.

           Alma’s not sure what else to say but the concern is all over 
           her face.

           INT. VICE PRESIDENT’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Rumsfeld and his wife, JOYCE, are shown into the reception 
           hall by a butler, ARTHUR, 60s.

                                 ARTHUR
                        If you’ll wait here, the vice 
                        president will be with you shortly.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Thank you, Arthur.

           Arthur leaves them. Joyce pulls her shawl around her.

                                 JOYCE RUMSFELD
                        It’s cool in here.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        They say he has the temperature 
                        throughout the residence kept at 
                        sixty-two degrees. Year-round.

                                 JOYCE RUMSFELD
                        Gosh, that’s... consistent.

                                 RUMSFELD
                (admiring)
                        Isn’t it?

           Cheney and his wife, LYNNE, join them.

                                 CHENEY
                        Don.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Dick.

                                 CHENEY
                        Hello, Joyce.

           They all greet each other. Hugs and air kisses.
                                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 CHENEY
                        Shall we?

           INT. CHENEY’S PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cheney carves a roast duck. The others sit at the table.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Colin couldn’t join us this 
                        evening?

           Cheney smirk-grimaces.

                                 LYNNE CHENEY
                        Oh, don’t be mean.

                                 JOYCE RUMSFELD
                        Did you see him on “Meet the Press” 
                        the other day though?

                                 CHENEY
                        In fact I did, Joyce.

                                 RUMSFELD
                (mimicing Powell)
                        “If you would consult any recent 
                        poll, the American people seem to 
                        be quite satisfied with the job I’m 
                        doing as secretary of state.”

           They all laugh.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        You’ve never cared about poll 
                        numbers, Dick.

                                 CHENEY
                        We’re running a country here. It’s 
                        not the Miss Wyoming pageant.

                                 LYNNE CHENEY
                (whispers to Joyce)
                        He cares more than he lets on.

           Joyce smiles. Cheney pretends not to hear, but he looks very 
           briefly stung by his wife’s remark.

                                 CHENEY
                (recovering)
                        Don -- breast or leg?

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Oh, I think breast.

                        Good.

           He carves him a generous, fatty portion.

           LATER

           After dinner. Cheney takes Rumsfeld to one side.

                                 CHENEY
                        Don, I’ve been meaning to ask you. 
                        In all seriousness now. You don’t 
                        think Powell is going to cause us 
                        problems down the line? Assuming 
                        things move forward.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        In all seriousness? We’ve both 
                        known General Powell now for, what, 
                        most of three decades? Sure, we’ve 
                        had our differences over the years. 
                        But I’ll say this. He is first and 
                        foremost a soldier. A good soldier.

           Cheney nods, understanding the double-edged compliment.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Powell scribbles notes on a yellow legal pad, discarded pages 
           all around him. Armitage paces restlessly.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s no good. 

           He tosses down the pad.

                                 POWELL
                        Whichever way I frame it, it sounds 
                        like I’m pre-judging his position. 
                        That’s only going to antagonize him.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        The president trusts you.
                (off his look)
                        He respects your wisdom, how about 
                        that? You’re the secretary of 
                        state, for Christ’s sake. He knows 
                        that you know that war is a real 
                        possibility here -- he can’t object 
                        if you give a clear account of 
                        where you stand.
                                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        I don’t know that I can give myself  
                        a clear account, there’s too much 
                        we simply don’t know. And honestly 
                        I want Saddam Hussein gone as much 
                        as the next man.

           Wilkerson enters.

                                 WILKERSON
                        It’s on.

                                 POWELL
                        Now?!

                                 WILKERSON
                        The car’s waiting.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m not ready. I don’t have the 
                        pitch.

                                 WILKERSON
                        He’s leaving early for Crawford. It 
                        has to be now.

           Powell hastily gathers his notes. His secretary, AMY, 30s, 
           knocks and enters.

                                 AMY
                        Excuse me, sir. I’ve got the White 
                        House kitchen on the line.

           She hesitates, knowing how ridiculous he’ll find this.

                                 AMY
                        They want to know how you’d like 
                        them to cook your burger.

           Powell just stares at her.

                                 AMY
                        I’ll tell them however the 
                        president likes his?

                                 POWELL
                        Please.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, I’ll tell them.

           She leaves. A beat.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        We’ve already got a war we haven’t 
                        won yet. We don’t need another one.

                        He’s not going to take invasion off 
                        the table. Not for you, not for 
                        anyone. If you urge that now, 
                        you’ll make yourself irrelevant.

                                 POWELL
                        You’re right.
                (to Armitage)
                        He’s right. We’ve got to stay in 
                        the conversation if we want to 
                        affect the outcome.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Okay, fine. But you’re not going in 
                        there to pledge fealty. You have to 
                        ask for something.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Powell and Rice wait in an anteroom. It’s a little awkward, 
           not least because of the SECRET SERVICE AGENT at the door, 
           pretending not to listen.

                                 POWELL
                        Are you getting away at all?

                                 RICE
                        Oh, maybe just to my aunt’s for a 
                        weekend.

                                 POWELL
                        Ah.

                                 RICE
                        You?

                                 POWELL
                        Yes, our place on the coast. Just 
                        Alma and I. You know, it’s our 
                        fortieth anniversary coming up.

                                 RICE
                        I didn’t know. Congratulations.

           Powell smiles. Another awkward beat.

           The door opens and Bush waves them in.

                                 BUSH

PRESIDENT’S PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The three of them eat. Cheeseburgers and good claret -- 
           though Bush avoids the wine, of course.

                                 POWELL
                        Sir, if I may -- the presentation 
                        by General Franks brought home to 
                        me just how rapidly the military 
                        planning is moving forward.

                                 BUSH
                        You can’t be shocked that we’re 
                        doing due diligence there, Colin. 
                        You of all people.

                                 POWELL
                        No, sir. Of course not.

                                 BUSH
                        There’s no commitment to any course 
                        of action. No decisions have been 
                        decided.

                                 POWELL
                        No, I understand that. And that’s 
                        why I’d like to take this 
                        opportunity to talk about an  
                        alternative approach.

                                 BUSH
                        You can speak freely.

                                 POWELL
                        That’s good to know, sir, because I 
                        want to impress this on you.

           He gathers his thoughts. Picks up his wine glass as a prop.

                                 POWELL
                        When you hit this thing, it’s like 
                        a crystal glass. It’s going to 
                        shatter. There will be no 
                        government. There will be a 
                        breakdown in civil order. There 
                        will be consequences beyond 
                        anything you or I can even imagine. 
                        You break the glass, you own it -- 
                        and you are going to be the proud 
                        owner of 25 million people.

                                 BUSH
                        That’s well said, Colin. I 
                        appreciate it. And it’s your job to 
                        be tactical like that. But it’s my 
                                                            (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 BUSH(cont'd)
                        job to be strategic. And I believe 
                        that freedom is something the Iraqi 
                        people long for. I believe that 
                        given the opportunity they will 
                        seize their chance for freedom.

                                 POWELL
                (beat)
                        Yes, sir.

           He tries to catch Rice’s eye, but she’s focused on Bush.

                                 BUSH
                        So. What do you think I should do?

           Powell hesitates. He’s still not sure about this.

                                 POWELL
                        Take it to the U.N. 

           Bush grimaces.

                                 POWELL
                        A new resolution won’t preclude 
                        military action, but if you make a 
                        commitment to diplomacy, you’ll end 
                        up in a position of much greater 
                        strength. 

           Bush looks unconvinced, but Powell is warming to his own 
           argument even as he formulates it. 

                                 POWELL
                        If Saddam fails to comply, if he 
                        refuses to disarm, you’ll be poised 
                        to go in with a unified 
                        international coalition. The moral 
                        high ground will be yours.

           Bush takes another bite of cheeseburger as he thinks it over. 
           He’s nodding -- something about that registered.

                                 BUSH
                        Okay. Let’s try it.

           Powell looks shocked. He wasn’t expecting it to be that easy.

                                 BUSH
                        Is that all?

                                 POWELL
                        Uh, yes. Yes, I think so.

                        Sure thing.

           Powell and Rice leave the president to his burger.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Moments later. They walk along a portico.

                                 RICE
                        You persuaded him. Congratulations.

                                 POWELL
                        Maybe. On the U.N., yes. But I’m 
                        not at all sure I got through to 
                        him on the bigger picture. I don’t 
                        think he understands the 
                        consequences. Going to war is the 
                        most profound decision a president 
                        can make. It’s not something you do 
                        on a gut impulse.

                                 RICE
                        You should give him a little more 
                        credit. He gets it. 

           They reach an entrance to the West Wing. Powell hangs back.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m going to walk around for a 
                        minute.

                                 RICE
                        Well, good night then.

                                 POWELL
                        Thanks again for making this 
                        happen. Thanks for your support.

           It’s almost a question -- is she really on his side here? But 
           Rice just nods curtly and enters the building.

           Powell sighs, rubs his brow. The enormity of the situation 
           starting to take hold in his mind.

           He looks out towards the Washington Monument, brightly lit 
           against the night sky. He looks along the deserted portico 
           and seems suddenly to sense his isolation.

                        This is absolutely the last thing 
                        we should be doing. We go to the 
                        U.N., they turn this into junior 
                        high debating society, they send 
                        inspectors in for the nine 
                        thousandth time. What happens? 
                        Saddam will play us for fools. I 
                        may not be everybody’s favorite 
                        cabinet member, but I am nobody’s 
                        fool. No, we’ve played this game 
                        long enough. It’s time to act. It’s

                        environment...

                        They tell me they stocked this 
                        thing with yellow perch. I don’t 
                        know, I can’t ever seem to catch 
                        any. Maybe fishing’s just not my 
                        sport. But I find it calming, you 
                        know? Just a soul-calming way to 
                        start the day.

                        I hear that, sir. I’ve always loved 
                        to fish.

                        Mr. President, about this speech 
                        I’d like to give.

                                 BUSH
                        Yeah, you know, Dick -- I am 
                        scheduled to address the U.N. in a 
                        few weeks. Don’t you think it’s 
                        going to pre-empt that for you to 
                        go out now and talk about all this?

                                 CHENEY
                        On the contrary, I see it as a 
                        chance to prepare the way for the 
                        message you yourself will deliver 
                        next month.

                                 BUSH
                (only half-joking)
                        Prepare the way -- kinda like John 
                        the Baptist.

                                 CHENEY
                (beat)
                        If you like.

           Bush returns his attention to the elusive perch, seemingly 
           pondering the analogy he just conjured.

                                 CHENEY
                        Sir? Mr. President, I really 
                        believe I need to make this speech. 
                        I believe it’s extremely important 
                        that I do so.

                                 BUSH
                        Okay, make it. 
                (joshing)
                        Just don’t cause me any trouble.

           Cheney: silent, inscrutable.

                                 ALMA
                        I was just thinking how nice it is 
                        to have such an extended family.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s only for a day or two. I’ll 
                        make it up to you.

                                 ALMA
                        When? Our fiftieth anniversary?

                                 POWELL
                        When everybody’s gone. I’ll take 
                        you clam digging.

           Alma laughs in spite of her annoyance.

                                 ALMA
                        That’s sweet, sort of.

                                 POWELL
                        Come here.

           He tries to bring her in for a hug, but she brushes him off, 
           not quite ready to forgive him.

                                 ALMA
                        You should get ready, the Foreign 
                        Secretary is on his way.

           EXT. COASTAL ROAD - DAY

           A 1960’s VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE speeds alongside the ocean. A 
           SECRET SERVICE SUV struggles to keep up.

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN, TRAVELING - DAY

           JACK STRAW, 50s, in the passenger seat, looks a little sick 
           as Powell, in his element, takes a bend at speed.

           The car’s engine makes an ominous NOISE.

                                 POWELL
                        Huh. That doesn’t sound so healthy.

           SUPER: JACK STRAW, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY.
                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 STRAW
                        Don’t you think we should, um, pull 
                        over or something?

           EXT. OCEAN BLUFF - DAY

           Powell checks the engine as Straw gulps some sea air. SECRET 
           SERVICE AGENTS keep watch around them.

                                 POWELL
                        Yeah, looks like I’m going to have 
                        to spend a few hours with this one.

                                 STRAW
                        That’s inconvenient.

                                 POWELL
                        No, that’s the whole point.
                (off Straw’s confusion)
                        Never mind.

                                 STRAW
                        Can we talk shop now for a minute?

                                 POWELL
                        Please.

                                 STRAW
                        Look, my government’s position is 
                        that diplomacy simply must be seen to 
                        have been exhausted. And that means 
                        allowing the weapons inspectors to do 
                        their work, it means getting the 
                        necessary resolutions from the U.N. 
                        The prime minister is going to urge 
                        the president to pursue a unified 
                        coalition. 

                                 POWELL
                        Where do you think the French are 
                        on this?

                                 STRAW
                        You should talk to Dominick.

           He means Dominique.

                                 POWELL
                        Ah, crap. I was hoping you might do 
                        that for me.

                                 STRAW
                        Ha. Sorry, old friend. Just don’t 
                        let him start quoting Descartes at 
                        you and you’ll be fine.

POWELL VACATION HOME, STUDY - DAY

           Powell on the phone. Straw is with him. Armitage too.

                                 POWELL
                        Bonjour, Dominique.

           INTERCUT WITH DE VILLEPIN, 50s, suave, silver-haired 
           philosopher-statesman. He’s on a YACHT somewhere on the 
           sparkling Mediterranean.

           SUPER: DOMINIQUE DE VILLEPIN, FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Bonjour, Colin! I hope you are 
                        enjoying your holiday.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes, thank you. And you?

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Oh, wonderful, wonderful. The sea is 
                        clear, the food is magnificent... 

           A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN passes in front of him.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        The women are beautiful.

           Powell rolls his eyes at Straw, who laughs quietly.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay. Listen, Dominique -- before we 
                        meet, I’d like to get a sense of 
                        your government’s position if we try 
                        for another resolution at the U.N.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        I would have to discuss that with 
                        President Chirac.

                                 POWELL
                        Sure, but candidly now, just 
                        between ourselves.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Candidly, I think it is something 
                        that could be agreed upon, but I do 
                        not expect the deliberations to be 
                        entirely without incident.

                                 POWELL
                        All right, thank you, Dominique. 
                        We’ll talk again soon.

                        I look forward to it.

           They hang up.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I could have saved you the cost of 
                        the phone call.

                                 POWELL
                        Yeah.

           Wilkerson enters.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Sir, you need to see this. Cheney’s 
                        giving a speech to the V.F.W.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Everyone gathers round a TV showing Cheney making a speech in 
           front of a large crowd of MILITARY VETERANS.

                                 CHENEY (ON TV)
                        A return of inspectors would 
                        provide no assurance whatsoever of 
                        his compliance with U.N. 
                        resolutions. On the contrary, there 
                        is a great danger that it would 
                        provide false comfort that Saddam 
                        was somehow “back in the box”. 

                                 POWELL
                        What the hell is he doing?

                                 CHENEY (ON TV)
                        Simply stated, there is no doubt 
                        that Saddam Hussein now has weapons 
                        of mass destruction. 

           A chorus of “Oh!” And “Goddamn!” from the room.

                                 CHENEY (ON TV)
                        There is no doubt that he is 
                        amassing them to use against our 
                        friends, against our allies -- 
                        against us.

                                 POWELL
                        Son of a bitch.

POWELL VACATION HOME, DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Powell attacks the Volkswagen engine with a wrench. His way 
           of relieving the stress.

           Armitage approaches.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Sir?

                                 POWELL
                        I can’t fix this damn thing.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Sir, you need to get back to 
                        Washington.

                                 POWELL
                        I don’t know what the hell is wrong 
                        with it.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Mr. Secretary -- look at me, 
                        please, sir. You need to take a 
                        deep breath, jump in the fucking 
                        ocean if that’s what it takes. But 
                        you need to get your head straight 
                        and go back to Washington.

           Powell throws down the wrench. Takes a breath.

                                 POWELL
                        It was for my benefit, you know.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 POWELL
                        A man who’s never served a day in 
                        his life -- the sheer chutzpah of 
                        it -- to go in front of men and 
                        women who’ve risked their lives for 
                        this country, half of them in 
                        wheelchairs -- to get up there and 
                        act like we’ve got cause to march 
                        on Baghdad, when we don’t. Not yet. 
                        We don’t know. We do not know the 
                        nature of the threat. And now it’s 
                        all over cable news like this is 
                        administration policy, and it’s one 
                        step short of a declaration of war!
                (beat)
                        It was for my benefit. It was bait.

                        Take it.
                (off Powell’s surprise)
                        Take the bait -- why not?

                                 POWELL
                        I made my case. We’re going to the 
                        U.N. I will not trade tit for tat 
                        with Dick Cheney on an issue of 
                        this gravity.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        And I’m saying that you have to 
                        take him on precisely because the 
                        issue is so grave. You think you 
                        can’t beat him at this?

                                 POWELL
                        I don’t care about “beating” him, 
                        or anyone else for that matter. I’m 
                        not turning this into a personal 
                        vendetta.

           A beat. Armitage trying to gauge how far he can push this.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I know you want to stay above the 
                        fray. I even admire you for it. But 
                        sometimes it’s just not possible.

                                 POWELL
                        You want me to act more like a 
                        politician, fine. But I still take 
                        my orders from my commander in 
                        chief and there’s still a thing we 
                        like to call the chain of command.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Yes! Yes, sir, there absolutely is. 
                        And tell me what it does to that 
                        chain of command if the vice 
                        president is allowed to run 
                        roughshod over it.

                                 POWELL
                        The president is his own man -- 
                        credit him that at least.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You can parse it any way you want. 
                        All I know is I’ve never seen a 
                        deputy exert that kind of 
                        influence, not once in my career -- 
                        military, civilian -- never.

           Powell allows himself a quick smile, breaking the tension.
                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        Are you excluding yourself from 
                        that analysis?

           Armitage grins back, a little sheepishly.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        No, sir. You always do things the way 
                        you want to do them no matter how 
                        much I try to talk you out of it.
                (serious again)
                        But I’m not going to let this one 
                        slide, not this time. Because I 
                        know I’m not saying anything you 
                        don’t already believe.

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Powell’s car pulls up. A crowd of REPORTERS and TV NEWS CREWS 
           waits. Powell gets out of the car and pushes through.

                                 JOURNALIST #1
                        Are you at odds with your own 
                        administration’s position on Iraq?

                                 JOURNALIST #2
                        Is it true you’re planning to

                                 JOURNALIST #3
                        General Powell, do you agree with 
                        the vice president?

           Powell is about to enter the building, but turns back. He 
           surveys the reporters, choosing his words carefully.

                                 POWELL
                        The president has been quite clear 
                        about the need for weapons 
                        inspectors to return to Iraq. I 
                        agree with the president.

           And he ducks inside as the questions fly.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Powell meets with Bush. Rice is here too.

                                 POWELL
                        Mr. President, that is your 
                        intention, isn’t it? The return of 
                        inspectors?

                        It is. That’s my intention, that’s 
                        what we agreed on. I’m just not 
                        sure it’s gonna do any good.

           Powell has to mask his exasperation.

                                 POWELL
                        Be that as it may, sir, if we are 
                        committed to this course of action, 
                        it’s going to require a U.N. 
                        resolution. I know I don’t have to 
                        tell you this, but securing that 
                        will be far from easy.

                        You can handle the French, Colin.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes, sir. But my point is -- sir, 
                        what exactly do you intend to say 
                        when you go before the U.N.?

           Off Bush’s blank expression --

                        The agenda is the president’s 
                        forthcoming speech to the U.N.

           INT. CAMP DAVID, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Rice meets with Powell and Cheney. Armitage, Libby and other 
           AIDES keep to the background.

                                 RICE
                        I’d like to reach a consensus today 
                        on what the focus of the speech 
                        should be so that I can take it to 
                        the president for his approval. 
                        Colin, why don’t you lead us off?

                                 POWELL
                        I believe we’re generally in 
                        agreement that the focus will be 
                                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)

                        Iraq. But the president can’t go 
                        before the General Assembly and 
                        talk about what a terrible guy 
                        Saddam is, and not say what he 
                        wants them to do about it. This 
                        will be the most important speech 
                        of his presidency to date. It’s got 
                        to have a punch line.

                                 CHENEY
                        We’re overcomplicating the matter. 
                        Saddam is an evil man. He has 
                        repeatedly violated U.N. 
                        resolutions. All the president 
                        needs to say is that the United 
                        States reserves the right to act 
                        unilaterally.

                        The international response if we go 
                        to war alone -- we’ll be closing 
                        embassies around the world and that 
                        will only be day one.

                                 CHENEY
                        This is not the issue. The clear 
                        threat is the issue.

                                 POWELL
                        Which is what?

                                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 CHENEY
                        I’m frankly amazed we’re still 
                        having this conversation.

                                 POWELL
                        We’ll have this conversation until 
                        the case has been made, your 
                        personal amazement notwithstanding.

           Cheney is speechless, not used to being confronted like this.

                                 POWELL
                        If the president doesn’t ask for 
                        another resolution, it will be seen 
                        as a statement of intent to go to war 
                        no matter what. It’s that simple.

                                 CHENEY
                        The United States doesn’t need 
                        anyone’s permission to protect its 
                        interests from terrorists and 
                        dictators.
                (looking Powell in the eye)
                        Not even yours.

           Silence. If there was any remaining mutual respect between 
           these two men, it’s gone now.

           EXT. CAMP DAVID, WOODS - DAY

           Powell walks through the trees with Armitage, hacking at 
           undergrowth with a stick as he tries to cool off.

                                 POWELL
                        You remember how he was when things 
                        were ramping up for Desert Storm? 
                        He used to be so calm, so 
                        pragmatic. And now he’s, there’s no 
                        getting around this -- he is hell-
                        bent on war. No, beyond hell-bent. 
                        He has a fever about it. 
                (beat)
                        You know, I’ve wondered from time 
                        to time if somewhere along the way 
                        Dick didn’t actually lose his mind.

           Armitage starts laughing. Powell is annoyed at first, he 
           wasn’t kidding. But then he laughs too.

                                 POWELL
                        Oh, God. Maybe I’m losing my own 
                        mind a little bit.
                                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 ARMITAGE
                        You can lose it in front of me, 
                        sir, that’s what I’m here for. When 
                        you lose it back there in the room, 
                        that’s when we’ve got a problem.

                                 POWELL
                        I thought I showed admirable 
                        restraint back in the room.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You were walking a line. You gotta 
                        be careful. Don’t think because 
                        Cheney has a fever that he is not 
                        in command of his faculties. He is 
                        the best player of this game 
                        probably that Washington has ever 
                        seen. If he senses you losing your 
                        grip on the situation, he will -- 
                        pardon my French, sir -- he wipe 
                        the floor with your black derriere.

                                 POWELL
                        Never let ‘em see you sweat.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Never.

           They hear someone approaching through the trees. It’s Rice.

                                 RICE
                        There you are. Well, I just spoke 
                        to the president and he’s willing 
                        to ask for a new resolution. So. 
                        You got your punch line.

           Powell and Armitage share a smile. A small victory. But they 
           know things are only starting to get tough.

           INT. CAMP DAVID, LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Powell sits by a flickering log fire, jotting notes on a 
           yellow legal pad.

           Rice passes by the door, sees a lamp on and clicks it off.

                                 POWELL
                        Hey!

                                 RICE
                        Oh, I’m sorry.

                                 POWELL
                        No, I didn’t mean to yell.
                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)

                        I thought everyone had gone to bed.

           She turns the lamp back on.

                                 POWELL
                        I was just making some notes for 
                        tomorrow.

                                 RICE
                        You’ll have lots to discuss with 
                        Jack.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes.

                                 RICE
                        I’ll let you get back to it.

           She turns to go.

                                 POWELL
                        Listen -- things got a little 
                        heated this afternoon.

                                 RICE
                        Yes, I’d say so.

                                 POWELL
                        It must be frustrating for you, 
                        always having to arbitrate these 
                        disputes.

                                 RICE
                        It is what it is.

                                 POWELL
                        But, what I mean is -- Condi, don’t 
                        you ever want to do more to make 
                        your own feelings known?

                                 RICE
                        I give the president my best advice 
                        whenever he asks for it.

           An awkward pause.

                                 RICE
                        Colin... is there something you’d 
                        like to say?

                                 POWELL
                        No. No, I was just thinking. I don’t 
                        know why, I’ve been dwelling a lot 
                        lately on what happened to my son.
                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 RICE
                        To Mike?

                                 POWELL
                        Yeah. Have I told you this?

                                 RICE
                        No. Not the details of it.

           She hesitates, then sits across from him.

                                 POWELL
                        This was back when he was stationed 
                        in Germany. He and another two 
                        lieutenants were out driving on the 
                        autobahn one night when their Jeep 
                        flipped. The others escaped with 
                        cuts and bruises, but Mike was 
                        thrown clear and the vehicle landed 
                        on him. It ruptured his pelvis. 
                        They took him first of all to a 
                        local German hospital and one of 
                        the other men -- a Lieutenant 
                        Brechbuhl -- he knew the language 
                        and overheard the doctor say, 
                        “There’s nothing we can do for this 
                        one.” There’s nothing we can do -- 
                        can you imagine? But they wouldn’t 
                        accept it, they knew how tough Mike 
                        was, they weren’t about to give up 
                        on their friend. They shouted and 
                        screamed and jumped up and down and 
                        finally got him transferred to the 
                        Army hospital in Nuremberg. Four 
                        days later he was at Walter Reed. 
                        And if they hadn’t done it, if 
                        those two men hadn’t said anything, 
                        if they hadn’t spoken up and forced 
                        the issue -- there’s no question 
                        Mike would have died.

           Rice is visibly moved but she can’t seem to summon an 
           adequate response.

                                 RICE
                        That’s quite a story.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes.

           He looks to her for more of a reaction, a vulnerability in 
           his eyes he seldom reveals. But her defenses remain up.

                        Well, good night then.

           Rice leaves. Powell just sits there, alone with his thoughts, 
           the dying fire throwing his shadow high against the wall.

           EXT. CAMP DAVID - DAY

           A HELICOPTER lands. TONY BLAIR steps out. Jack Straw follows. 
           Bush greets them.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay, let’s see what we can do.

           INT. CAMP DAVID, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Powell meets with Straw.

                                 POWELL
                        Jack, I’d like you to know, and I’d 
                        like the prime minister to know 
                        before the two of them sit down, 
                        that the president has decided to 
                        ask the U.N. for a new resolution.

                                 STRAW
                        I see. That’s a breakthrough.

                                 POWELL
                        It is. But it’s fragile. 

                                 STRAW
                        Really? I thought that once he’d 
                        decided, he’d decided.

                                 POWELL
                        Nothing’s been made public yet, 
                        obviously. And you must realize 
                        that a great deal of pressure is 
                        being exerted in favor of a 
                        different course of action.
                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 STRAW
                        Yes, but look, we’re not here to 
                        add ballast to your agenda. We’ve 
                        got our own concerns to voice.

                                 POWELL
                        I appreciate that. But we 
                        essentially want the same thing. 
                        And I’m giving you a heads up that 
                        the president is in a place right 
                        now where he’s already agreed in 
                        principle to do this. I’m simply 
                        trying to cement the deal.

                                 STRAW
                (beat)
                        Okay. I’ll talk to the prime 
                        minister.

           INT. CAMP DAVID, PRESIDENT’S STUDY - DAY

           Bush meets with Blair. Cheney watches silently.

                                 BUSH
                        Saddam is a threat. He’s a menace.

                                 BLAIR
                        Yes.

                                 BUSH
                        We can’t let him carry on getting his 
                        own way like he’s been getting it.

                                 BLAIR
                        Agreed.

                                 BUSH
                        The world will be better off 
                        without him.

                                 BLAIR
                        I’ve been saying so since before 
                        9/11.

                                 BUSH
                        Good. We’re on the same page then. 
                        We’re like-minded on this issue.

                                 BLAIR
                        I believe we are, George. And 
                        you’ll make all these points at the 
                        U.N., I’m sure.

                                 BUSH
                        I plan to.
                                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 BLAIR
                        Forgive me for being direct then, 
                        but do you know what else you’re 
                        likely to say?

                                 BUSH
                        Tony, I know you’ll be watching. 
                        It’s going to be a great speech. 
                        I’d sure hate to spoil it.

           Blair laughs, but he looks a little uncomfortable.

                                 BUSH
                        Looking beyond the speech -- if we 
                        do invade, and I’m not saying we 
                        will. But I’ll want to know who’s 
                        with me.

                                 BLAIR
                        I understand that. But you have to 
                        realize the political climate I’m 
                        facing back home. My party is 
                        fundamentally a party of peace. The 
                        British people are a pacifist nation.

                                 BUSH
                        Nobody wants war.

           Blair glances at Cheney, who is impassive as ever.

                                 BLAIR
                        No, of course not. But the question 
                        I’ll be asked is: What is the role 
                        of the U.N. here? Is everything 
                        being done diplomatically to make 
                        war the absolute last resort?

                                 BUSH
                        I get it. I get what you’re saying. 
                        It’s -- we’re still working on the 
                        language.

                                 BLAIR
                        But you’ll ask for a resolution?

           Now Bush glances at Cheney, who shakes his head almost 
           imperceptibly.

                                 BUSH
                        Yeah. I’m gonna ask for a 
                        resolution.

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s excellent news.

           Not to Cheney.
                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 BUSH
                        So you’re with me?

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m with you.

                                 BUSH
                        I appreciate that, Tony.

           They shake hands.

                                 BUSH
                        We’ll do the press conference now.

                                 BLAIR
                        Good.

           Bush catches Cheney’s eye.

                                 BUSH
                        I’ll follow you.

                                 BLAIR
                        Fine.

           Blair leaves.

                                 BUSH
                        He’s a good guy.

                                 CHENEY
                        He’s loyal.

                                 BUSH
                        Yeah.

                                 CHENEY
                        And as much as I appreciate he’s 
                        got a difficult situation to manage 
                        back home, we can’t let that get in 
                        the way of our own agenda.

                                 BUSH
                        Sure, Dick. I know. It’ll work out.

           He walks past him to catch up with Blair. Cheney just got 
           frozen out and he doesn’t like it a bit.

           EXT. CAMP DAVID - DAY

           Powell and Straw stand waiting with their Aides. JOURNALISTS 
           are gathered on the lawn. 

           Bush and Blair walk up to take questions. Bush turns to Straw 
           as he passes by.
                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 BUSH
                        Your man’s got cojones.

                                 STRAW
                (confused)
                        Oh.

           Bush continues on to his podium. Straw looks to Powell.

                                 POWELL
                        Cojones. Balls.

                                 STRAW
                        Ah. Yes.

           Wilkerson approaches.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Sir? 
                (to Straw)
                        Excuse us.

           He pulls Powell aside. Armitage is there too.

                                 WILKERSON
                        We need to talk strategy for a 
                        moment.

                                 POWELL
                        I know what you’re going to say.

                                 WILKERSON
                        It’s an important move at this 
                        point.

           Powell notices Armitage scowling.

                                 POWELL
                (amused)
                        Richard doesn’t think so.

                                 ARMITAGE
                (deadpan)
                        How would you know that? My face is 
                        a mask.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Seriously though. Do the Sundays, 
                        talk about biological weapons for 
                        five minutes.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Who’s the audience for this? We 
                        can’t put him on national TV just 
                        to suck up to Cheney.

                        It’s not about Cheney.
                (to Powell)
                        If you want the president to take 
                        your arguments for diplomacy 
                        seriously, you have to show him 
                        you’re not trying to pull military 
                        action off the table. The case 
                        might not have been made -- that’s 
                        not to say there is no case.

           Powell looks behind them to where Bush and Blair are taking 
           questions from the press.

                                 POWELL
                        All right, set something up. One 
                        show. I’m not doing the whole 
                        carnival.

                                 WILKERSON
                        CBS? NBC?

                                 POWELL
                        Anyone but Fox. If I’m going to go 
                        through with this, I don’t want to 
                        have to look at Chris Wallace’s 
                        smug face while I’m doing it.

           INT. POWELL HOME, KITCHEN - DAY

           Alma works on her laptop at the table, papers spread around 
           her. She doesn’t react when the front door OPENS, O.S.

           Powell walks in. He looks exhausted.

                                 POWELL
                        Hi.

                                 ALMA
                (not looking up)
                        Hi.

           Powell registers her lack of a proper greeting. He grabs a 
           soda from the fridge, giving her a chance to finish what 
           she’s doing, but she just keeps on working.

                                 POWELL
                        So...?

                                 ALMA
                        So what?

                                 POWELL
                        How did I do?

                                 ALMA
                        I’m sure you were very persuasive.

                                 POWELL
                        Well, that sounds like you didn’t 
                        even watch.

                                 ALMA
                        I’m actually pretty busy. If you

                        be married and someone has to

                        Didn’t I give you a list of names?

                                 ALMA
                        Yes, and I’m sure Annemarie will be 
                        thrilled to share her big day with 
                        the 3rd Armored Division, the 23rd 
                        Infantry Division and the Pershing 
                        Rifles class of 1958.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s just a few friends. We don’t 
                        have to include every one of them.

                                 ALMA
                        It’s fine. It’s a big venue.

           Alma returns her focus to her lists. Powell considers leaving 
           it there, but something’s still eating at him.

                                 POWELL
                        Is this about the anniversary?

                                 ALMA
                        What?

                                 POWELL
                        I’m trying to understand your mood.

                                 ALMA
                        Colin, I really need to get this 
                        done.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s not about the anniversary?

                        I’m sorry our getaway got hijacked, I 
                        really am. But there wasn’t any way 
                        around it given the circumstances.

                                 ALMA
                        You’re trying to “understand my 
                        mood”? Is that what you just said?

                                 POWELL
                        You really didn’t watch?

           And now Alma looks at him properly for the first time.
                                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                 ALMA
                        Yes, I watched. I watched you and 
                        then I watched the rest of them, 
                        and honestly I don’t know that I’ve 
                        ever seen such an impressive 
                        display of -- what’s that phrase 
                        they use? Message discipline.

                                 POWELL
                        All right.

                                 ALMA
                        What happened to taking a stand?

                                 POWELL
                        Alma--

                                 ALMA
                        What happened to speaking up for 
                        something even if it wouldn’t make 
                        you any friends?

                                 POWELL
                        I haven’t changed my position.

                                 ALMA
                        And yet you allow them to wheel you 
                        out there and feed you the talking 
                        points and then you come home 
                        expecting me to compliment you on 
                        your performance!

                                 POWELL
                        There’s still a long way to go, 
                        it’s a delicate process and this 
                        was something I needed to do. 

                                 ALMA
                        Who’s idea was it?

                                 POWELL
                        And no, I wasn’t expecting any 
                        compliments. But I’m sure I haven’t 
                        earned this interrogation.

                                 ALMA
                        Whose idea was it?

                                 POWELL
                        What does it matter whose idea?

                                 ALMA
                        They’re not stupid. They might be 
                        wrong but they’re not stupid and 
                        they know what it does for public 
                                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 ALMA(cont'd)
                        opinion when they make you the 
                        point man on something like this.

                                 POWELL
                        It was Larry’s idea. Okay? He 
                        thought it was a necessary move. 
                        Are you going to question his 
                        motivation?

                                 ALMA
                        No. Of course not.

           They both take a moment to cool off.

                                 ALMA
                        I don’t want to see you get used. 

                                 POWELL
                        Alma, that’s not going to happen.

                                 ALMA
                        You’re too certain about that.

           She picks up her laptop, the lists.

                                 ALMA
                        I have to run to the printers. Any 
                        last-minute regiments you want to add?

                                 POWELL
                (quietly)
                        No.

                                 ALMA
                        Okay then.

           She leaves the room. And as Powell stews, the voice of HARRY 
           BELAFONTE is heard.

                                 HARRY BELAFONTE (O.S.)
                        In the days of slavery, there were 
                        those slaves that lived on the 
                        plantation, and there were those 
                        that lived in the house.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Powell and Armitage watch HARRY BELAFONTE on CNN. The chyron 
           reads: “Harry Belafonte, Musician and Activist.”

                                 HARRY BELAFONTE (ON TV)
                        Colin Powell was permitted to come 
                        into the house of the master. When 
                        Colin Powell dares to suggest 
                        something other than what the 
                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)

                        master wants to hear, he will be 
                        turned back out to pasture.

           Armitage clicks off the TV and looks at Powell for a 
           reaction. He’s pissed but trying to hide it.

                                 POWELL
                        Big deal.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Sir--

                                 POWELL
                (changing the subject)
                        Did it come yet?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        We’d have it if it came.

                                 POWELL
                        Well, what’s taking so long?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Sir--

                                 POWELL
                        We should have had it an hour ago.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Mr. Secretary, I wanted you to see 
                        that tape for a reason.

                                 POWELL
                        Oh, Christ, Richard. Does anyone in 
                        their right mind honestly give a 
                        damn what Harry Belafonte thinks 
                        about anything?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I think you do.

                                 POWELL
                        About Harry Belafonte?!

                                 ARMITAGE
                        About any time someone slaps you 
                        like this with a piece of wet crap. 
                        I think it gets under your skin. I 
                        think it festers there.

                                 POWELL
                        You have a way with the English 
                        language, Richard. Does anyone ever 
                        tell you that?
                                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 ARMITAGE
                        Yeah, I find it distracts ‘em from 
                        what a bald, ugly bastard I am.

           Powell smiles in spite of his annoyance.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You’re going to get asked about 
                        this and it can’t turn into an 
                        issue.

                                 POWELL
                (rehearsing his response)
                        To use a slave reference is... 
                        unfortunate. A throwback to another 
                        time. But Mr. Belafonte is entitled 
                        to his opinion. Greatest respect 
                        for his work on civil rights 
                        issues. Et cetera.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Okay.

           Wilkerson enters.

                                 WILKERSON
                        It came.

                                 POWELL
                        Good.

           He starts to follow Wilkerson out into the bullpen.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Sir?

           Powell turns back.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        No festering.

           Powell nods, a little exasperated.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE, BULLPEN - DAY

           Amy takes delivery of a thick manila envelope from a White 
           House SECURITY GUARD. She hands it to Wilkerson.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Thanks, Amy.

           The envelope is marked: “Top Secret”. Wilkerson opens it, 
           takes out three copies of a bound speech: “Address by

                        They sent the wrong draft.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        They fucked us.

                                 WILKERSON
                        This is an old draft. It’s a 
                        mistake.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It’s not a mistake, Larry. 
                        Goddamnit! I could kill somebody 
                        right now.

           Amy and two other SECRETARIES who have gathered nearby 
           quickly back off and pretend to be busy at their desks.

                                 POWELL
                        He can’t give this speech.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Actually the founding fathers never 
                        did figure out a smart way to stop 
                        the president saying dumb things. He 
                        can get up there and talk about his 
                        golf swing if the mood takes him.

           He slams his copy in a trash can and storms off.

                                 POWELL
                        We’ve got less then twenty-four 
                        hours. Make something happen.

                        You want me to meet with Libby?

                                 POWELL
                        No, we need to circumvent the V.P.’s 
                        office at this stage. Find a way for 
                        me to get five minutes with Secretary 
                        Rice without every West Wing staffer 
                        and their dog knowing about it.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

           Powell tries to select a bowling ball, but none of them have 
           holes that fit his large fingers. Eventually he grabs one and 
           rolls it two-handed down the lane.

           (cid:13)           A strike! He looks pleased. When he turns, Rice is there.

                                 RICE
                        Not bad.

                                 POWELL
                        Think you can match it?

           Rice smiles, but makes no move to pick up a ball.

                                 POWELL
                        C’mon, when was the last time we 
                        bowled together?

                                 RICE
                        I would say... never.

                                 POWELL
                        That long?

                        What happened to the punch line?

                                 RICE
                        I believe the speechwriters cut it.

                                 POWELL
                        At whose request?

                                 RICE
                        What’s the difference? You know the 
                        president always has final approval.

                                 POWELL
                        And he approved this?

           She avoids his look.

                        chance to review the last-minute 
                        changes yet.

                        He hasn’t read it? He hasn’t read 
                        it?! He’s got to give the thing 
                        tomorrow!

                                 RICE
                        It’s one line.

                        Would you talk to the president?

                        I’m not going to do that.

                                 POWELL
                        Of course not. We’re talking about 
                        invading a sovereign nation but

                        I can try to speak to him first 
                        thing in the morning.

                        Fine.

           Rice turns to leave.

                        Yeah, that’s my line too.

           She starts to go again, but stops herself.

                        You want to hear what I’d really

                        A few. But I ate the same bad food 
                        they gave us in restaurants. I held 
                        my head up when folks shouted at me 
                        in the street. I tried my dresses 
                        in the storage area at the 
                        department store when they wouldn’t 
                        let me use the fitting rooms. I 
                        sure as hell don’t need any lessons 
                        from the likes of Harry Belafonte 
                        on what it means to be black.

           Powell just nods. Nothing he can add to that.

                                 RICE
                        I’ll call you as soon as I’ve

           INT. POWELL’S CAR, TRAVELING - DAY

           Powell on his cell phone. Armitage with him.

                                 POWELL (ON PHONE)
                        When was the last time we were in New 
                        York on the same day?... Of course 
                        not, I’ll have a couple free hours 
                        after the speech... Hold on a minute, 
                        Annie. I’ve got to take this.
                (switching lines)
                        Condi?... That’s good news...
                (to Armitage)
                        We got it.

           Armitage punches the air.

                                 POWELL
                (to Rice)
                        Thanks. We’ll talk afterwards.
                (switching lines)
                        Annie?... No, I’m not letting you 
                        off the hook on this one. I’ll call 
                        you later... I love you too.

           He hangs up.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You’re sure we got it?

                                 POWELL
                        That’s what she said.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        All right then. Now we just have to 
                        hope he doesn’t get up there and 
                        ask the assembled delegates to work 
                        towards a new revolution.

           Powell allows himself a quick smirk, but sobers up as the car 
           passes an ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION outside the U.N. entrance. A 
           line of POLICE holds back the angry, shouting PROTESTERS.

           Powell glimpses an ARMY VET with a hand-written sign: “COLIN 
           POWELL TRAITOR.” He’s visibly stung.

           Armitage notices Powell’s reaction. There’s an uneasy silence 
           as the car pulls past and into the U.N. compound.

                (to break the tension)
                        That was Annemarie on the phone?

                                 POWELL
                        She’s in town. I’m going to help 
                        her pick out some stuff for the 
                        gift registry.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        She’ll appreciate your fine taste 
                        in bed linen and culinary 
                        knickknacks, Mr. Secretary.

           Powell glares at him.

           The car pulls up and they climb out to be welcomed by a host 
           of U.N. OFFICIALS and other DIGNITARIES.

           INT. UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY - DAY

           DELEGATES and POLITICIANS from two hundred nations.

           Powell and Armitage find their seats. Powell notices De 
           Villepin across the aisle. They nod to each other.

           Two rows below them, Cheney flicks through a copy of the 
           speech, then puts it down, satisfied. Powell reacts.

                                 POWELL
                        Are we getting copies?

           He looks around. Everyone else seems to have the speech.

           Armitage reaches back and lifts a copy from in front of a 
           LATIN AMERICAN DELEGATE, who flirts with the attractive 
           SCANDINAVIAN DELEGATE behind him.

                                 ARMITAGE
                (handing it to Powell)
                        Here.

           Powell goes straight to the last page.

                                 POWELL
                        Unbelievable!

           He shows it to Armitage.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Christ. What do we do?
                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           STAGE

           A U.N. OFFICIAL introduces the president.

                                 OFFICIAL
                        Please welcome the President of the 
                        United States.

           Bush swaggers on. Muted APPLAUSE.

           AUDIENCE

                                 POWELL
                        The teleprompter.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        What?

                                 POWELL
                        They can insert the line before he 
                        gets to the end.

           He starts to get up but Armitage pulls him back.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You can’t walk out of here with the 
                        president on stage and the cameras 
                        rolling.

           Powell looks down at the TV CAMERAS on the floor, some 
           focused on Bush, others scanning the hall. He sits back down.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I’ll take care of it.

           He pushes through to the aisle and hustles out.

           STAGE

           The applause dies down and Bush begins his speech.

                                 BUSH
                        Mr. Secretary General, distinguished 
                        delegates, ladies and gentlemen. We 
                        meet one year and one day after a 
                        terrorist attack brought grief to my 
                        country and brought grief to many 
                        citizens of our world.
                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           HALLWAY

           Armitage breaks into a walk-run as he exits the main hall. 
           Bush continues in the background.

                                 BUSH (O.S.)
                        Yesterday we remembered the innocent 
                        lives taken that terrible morning. 
                        Today we turn to the urgent duty of 
                        protecting other lives without 
                        illusion and without fear.

           STAIRWELL

           Armitage runs down. He’s perspiring now.

           He reaches the bottom. Tries the door. It’s locked.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Fuck.

           He bangs on it with his fist. Nothing doing.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Fucking Fort Knox.

           He starts back up the stairs, dripping sweat as he goes.

           STAGE

                                 BUSH
                        Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded 
                        Kuwait without provocation. Had 
                        Saddam Hussein been appeased 
                        instead of stopped, he would have 
                        endangered the peace and stability 
                        of the world.

           AUDIENCE

           Powell shifts in his seat, drums his fingers on the desk in 
           front of him. He’s not hearing anything the president says.

           STAIRWELL

           Armitage descends another set of stairs. Another door at the 
           bottom. It opens.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Thank God for that.
                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           BACKSTAGE

           Armitage reaches the WINGS to the side of the stage, from 
           where various AIDES and OFFICIALS watch the speech.

           The TELEPROMPTER OPERATOR, 30s, sits in a cordoned-off area 
           with a direct line on the president. As Bush speaks, the 
           Operator scrolls slowly through the speech.

           Armitage starts towards him but a SECURITY GUARD blocks him.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Excuse me, sir.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It’s okay.

           He shows his I.D.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I’m sorry, sir. You can’t be back 
                        here right now.

                                 ARMITAGE
                (re: the Operator)
                        I have to speak to him.

           The Guard just looks at him. Armitage leans in and whispers.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You have no idea how fucking 
                        important this is.

           The Guard makes himself taller. He’s got a good four inches 
           on Armitage.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I’m the Deputy Secretary of State!

           That was a little too loud. He realizes and backs away as two 
           more SECURITY GUARDS move towards him.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Okay.

           He retreats into the crowd.

           STAGE

                                 BUSH
                        By breaking every pledge, by his 
                        deceptions and by his cruelties, 
                        Saddam Hussein has made the case 
                        against himself.

           Armitage realizes he’s still holding the copy of the speech. 
           He snatches a pen from an unsuspecting U.N. OFFICIAL and 
           scribbles a few words on the last page. 

           STAGE

                                 BUSH
                        As we meet today, it's been almost 
                        four years since the last U.N. 
                        inspector set foot in Iraq. 

           BACKSTAGE

           Armitage pushes back through the crowd of people towards the 
           stage. The Security Guard spots him, moves to intercept. 

           STAGE

                                 BUSH
                        Four years for the Iraqi regime to 
                        plan and to build and to test 
                        behind the cloak of secrecy.

           BACKSTAGE

           Armitage stumbles through to the edge of the cordoned-off 
           area and throws the speech towards the Operator before the 
           Guard can get to him.

           It lands a couple feet short. The Operator doesn’t notice.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Shit.

           STAGE

                                 BUSH
                        We must choose between a world of 
                        fear and a world of progress. We 
                        cannot stand by and do nothing 
                        while dangers gather. 

           BACKSTAGE

           Armitage can only stand by and do nothing, pleading silently 
           for the Operator to see the speech on the ground next to him.
                                                         (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           He does! He picks it up. Looks to Armitage, recognizes him. 
           Armitage frantically mimes typing.

           The Operator doesn’t get it. He returns his attention to the 
           teleprompter, rolls it on to keep pace with Bush.

           Then he sees Armitage’s scribbled notes on the speech. His 
           eyes widen. Now he gets it.

           STAGE

                                 BUSH
                        We must stand up for our security 
                        and for the permanent rights and 
                        the hopes of mankind.

           He stops. Looks at his teleprompter. The next words are:

           “Thank you. [Acknowledge applause] [END].”

           BACKSTAGE

           The Operator shrugs apologetically to Armitage: too late.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Fuck.

           AUDIENCE

           A few people CLAP, believing the speech is over, then stop. 
           Silence fills the hall.

           Powell holds his breath.

           Cheney looks worried.

                                 CHENEY
                (under his breath)
                        Get off the stage.

           STAGE

           Bush has a deer-in-headlights look on his face, but he knows 
           this isn’t how the speech is supposed to end.

                                 BUSH
                (ad-libbing)
                        And -- and we will work with the 
                        U.N. Security Council for the 
                        necessary resolutions. Thank you.
                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)           The hall erupts in APPLAUSE. Bush, back on script, 
           acknowledges it.

           AUDIENCE

           Powell heaves a huge sigh of relief.

           Cheney stalks away from his seat as the applause continues. 
           He glances at Powell -- he looks furious, for once unable to 
           mask his feelings in public. Powell waits for him to pass by 
           before smiling to himself.

           BACKSTAGE

           Armitage beams. He’s never looked so happy. Absent anyone 
           else to celebrate with, he punches the Security Guard 
           playfully on the shoulder.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        How about that!

           INT. UNITED NATIONS, FOYER - DAY

           A BUZZ of excitement as everyone files out of the hall. 
           Powell bee-lines for De Villepin.

                                 POWELL
                        Dominique.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Ah, Colin. This was the speech you 
                        wanted, no?

                                 POWELL
                        Yes indeed.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        I must confess, I had my doubts 
                        when they appointed you to the 
                        Secretary of State. Général le 
                        Desert Storm at the UN. Ha!
                (off Powell’s look)
                        Not to offend.

                                 POWELL
                        Of course.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        But here you have pulled off 
                        something quite unexpected. A real 
                        piece of statecraft. Congratulations!

                        Well, it’s a start. We’ll need to 
                        talk.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        To discuss the resolutions.

                                 POWELL
                        Let’s not get carried away. One 
                        resolution will do it.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Forgive me, but I heard the 
                        president quite clearly. He said 
                        “resolutions”. Plural.

           De Villepin has a Gallic twinkle in his eyes. Powell, by 
           contrast, looks suddenly miserable.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        This makes things more interesting, 
                        no? We’ll talk soon.

           He walks on.

                                 POWELL
                        Shit.

           Armitage catches up to him.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        What was that about?

                                 POWELL
                        He said resolutions.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Who did?

                                 POWELL
                        The president.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Oh are you kidding me? We go 
                        through all that and now the French 
                        are going to screw with us because 
                        of one stupid slip of the tongue?

                                 POWELL
                        Welcome to the United Nations.

           EXT. STATE DEPRARTMENT - DAY 

           Leaves on the trees are starting to turn. A brisk wind cuts 
           in off the Potomac.

POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Powell meets with Armitage and Wilkerson.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You don’t think it was him?

                                 POWELL
                        Maybe it was really a mistake.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You don’t believe that.

                                 POWELL
                (beat)
                        No.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Sir, we can sit here all day and 
                        argue about who took out the line. 
                        The important thing is the 
                        president ultimately said the right 
                        thing, and now we get to ask the 
                        Security Council to give us what we 
                        want. Agreed?

                                 POWELL
                        Agreed.

                                 WILKERSON
                        So, what are we going to ask for?

           INT. WHITE HOUSE, ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

           Powell meets with Rice, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Tenet.

                                 POWELL
                        As I see it, the weapons issue, the 
                        return of inspectors, is the most 
                        obvious one. But I’m open to 
                        discussing Saddam’s links with 
                        terrorism. There’s also his human 
                        rights record.

                                 TENET
                        The terrorism angle is an 
                        intelligence nightmare. We’ll never 
                        get the Russians and the Chinese on 
                        board, much less the French.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        And human rights. I mean, okay, but 
                        how do you make that into a 
                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 RUMSFELD(cont'd)
                        tangible case? W.M.D is the only 
                        thing that’s going to fly here.

           Powell is pleasantly surprised.

                                 POWELL
                        I agree. I think it’s our best 
                        chance for nine votes.

                                 RICE
                        Well, all right. Let’s work 
                        something up that we can take to 
                        the president.

                                 CHENEY
                        My office has been drafting some 
                        language on the weapons issue. I’ll 
                        have them send it over.

           Now Powell looks unpleasantly unsurprised.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Powell and Armitage look at a draft of Cheney’s “language”.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        “Material breach of any part of 
                        this resolution... Automatic 
                        authorization... All necessary 
                        means.” Is he kidding with this? We 
                        might as well resolve to send in 
                        the eighty-second airborne the next 
                        time Saddam says something mean 
                        about our mothers.

                                 POWELL
                        We have to start somewhere. Let’s 
                        float it.

           LATER

           Powell on the phone.

           INTERCUT WITH DE VILLEPIN IN HIS PARIS OFFICE.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Colin, may I know who came up with 
                        this proposal?

                                 POWELL
                        It was a joint effort. Why?

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Because it is so extreme, and if I 
                        might say, so magnificently 
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 DE VILLEPIN(cont'd)
                        baroque, that I can only assume it 
                        was designed to fail.

                                 POWELL
                        You’re saying we won’t get nine 
                        votes if we take this to the 
                        Security Council?

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        I’m saying you will be subjected to 
                        public mockery in at least nine 
                        languages if you take this to the 
                        Security Council.

           INT. STATE DEPRARTMENT - DAY

           Powell walks a hallway with Wilkerson. 

                                 WILKERSON
                        We’ve worked up some new language.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s toned down?

                                 WILKERSON
                        Yes.

                                 POWELL
                        But not too toned down?

                                 WILKERSON
                        No.

                                 POWELL
                        I feel like I’m fighting on both 
                        sides here.

           They reach the bullpen. Amy meets them.

                                 AMY
                        Sir, the vice president wants to 
                        talk to you.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay, call him back.

                                 AMY
                        No, I mean he’s in your office.

           Powell takes a deep breath, steels himself, and enters--

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cheney is on the couch, like he owns the place.

                        What can I do for you, Dick?

                                 CHENEY
                        There’s nothing wrong with the 
                        language I sent over. 

                                 POWELL
                        These things always get amended.

                                 CHENEY
                        It’s the robust statement this 
                        situation calls for.

                                 POWELL
                        There’s a process here.

                                 CHENEY
                        Saddam Hussein is not going to be 
                        impressed by half-measures and 
                        diplomatic cant.

                                 POWELL
                        No one’s suggesting we lessen the 
                        force of the threat. But we’ve got 
                        to come up with something that will 
                        actually pass a vote. 

           Cheney stands, confrontational.

                                 CHENEY
                        Screw the vote. 

                                 POWELL
                        Excuse me?

                                 CHENEY
                        Screw it. We should be doing what’s 
                        right, not what the United Nations 
                        is willing to rubber-stamp.

                                 POWELL
                        You may believe that “what’s right” 
                        is whatever Dick Cheney says it is, 
                        but that’s not the world the rest 
                        of us choose to live in.

                                 CHENEY
                        Damnit, there’s nothing wrong with 
                        the language!

                                 POWELL
                        That’s not how the French see it. 
                        Frankly, it’s not how I see it.

                        You’re taking your cues now from 
                        the Elysee Palace?

                                 POWELL
                        I’d advise you to weigh your words 
                        carefully when you’re standing in 
                        this office, Dick, because that 
                        sounded an awful lot like you meant 
                        to impugn my patriotism.

                                 CHENEY
                        In all candor, Colin, I never have 
                        been very much in awe of your 
                        vaunted patriotism. I may never have 
                        dazzled anyone with all the medals 
                        on my chest, but I’ve served this 
                        country my whole life, I’ve 
                        governed, I’ve made the hard 
                        decisions, I’ve -- You don’t even 
                        know. You don’t know what it takes. 
                        You think you’re so damn superior. 
                        You don’t know. You have no idea.

           He breaks off, veins popping, gulping air. Is he about to 
           have another heart attack? But then he abruptly stalks out 
           without so much as another look in Powell’s direction.

           Powell sinks into his chair, shaking his head wearily. 
           Wilkerson enters.

                                 WILKERSON
                        What in the hell was that?

                                 POWELL
                        God only knows. I can’t fathom it, 
                        Larry. I can’t understand what 
                        makes him act like this.

                                 WILKERSON
                        It’s monomaniacal. That’s all you 
                        can really say about it.

           He notices how distracted Powell looks.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Sir? Are you all right?

           Powell nods.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Don’t let him get to you. Sir?

                                 POWELL
                        I ever tell you how first came to 
                        Washington?
                                                    (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 WILKERSON
                (wearily)
                        Yes, sir. The fellowship thing. 

                                 POWELL
                        The White House Fellowship Program! 
                        That’s not an honor they give away 
                        on the street corner.

                                 WILKERSON
                        No, sir, it’s not. 

                                 POWELL
                        I show up, fresh out of Vietnam, 
                        ready to change the world... and 
                        there’s Dick. Four years my junior 
                        and already the most connected guy in 
                        the Nixon administration. I spend the 
                        next two-and-a-half decades working 
                        my way through the ranks. Finally I’m 
                        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs -- guess 
                        who’s running Defense. Now I’m 
                        secretary of state -- of course he’s 
                        the vice president. He practically 
                        appoints himself to these jobs, I 
                        don’t know how in the hell he does 
                        it. But somehow he’s always a rung 
                        above me, a step ahead. Always him. 
                        Always Dick.

           A beat.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Come out here for a minute.

                                 POWELL
                        Why, what’s going on?

           They step into the bullpen and look out across the large open-
           plan office. STAFFERS go about their work. A sense of 
           important business quietly being taken care of.

                                 WILKERSON
                        This place was a dysfunctional mess 
                        before you took it over. No one 
                        communicated, no one trusted anyone 
                        else. The paranoia was dripping 
                        from the ceiling. You made this 
                        department what it is today -- 
                        nothing complicated, folks just 
                        followed your example. That’s 
                        leadership. And these guys are 
                        loyal, they’ve got your back. They 
                        also don’t care about the political 
                        day-to-day. It might sound 
                        simplistic but honestly, sir, they 
                        just want to do what’s right for 
                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 WILKERSON(cont'd)
                        the citizens of this great country. 
                        And if they ever see you straying 
                        from that mission, they’ll be the 
                        first to pull you back in. Why? 
                        Because they know that’s nothing 
                        less than what you expect of them.

           He hands Powell a document.

                                 WILKERSON
                        The new language. Let me know your 
                        thoughts before we send it over.

           He leaves Powell looking thoughtfully at his small army of 
           dedicated public servants.

           INT. CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cheney and Libby read the new document.

                                 LIBBY
                        Well, I’m glad we’re determining to 
                        “remain seized of the matter”. That 
                        is encouraging.

                                 CHENEY
                        They want to water this thing down. 
                        They want to water it down and 
                        leave it in the sun until all we’re 
                        left with is a big bucket of horse 
                        piss. And meanwhile Saddam is 
                        laughing at us.

                                 LIBBY
                        Here’s something that might make it a 
                        little less excremental. What if we 
                        were to insert a deadline? Something 
                        meet-able, but aggressive.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE, ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

           Powell meets again with Rice, Rumsfeld and Cheney.

                                 CHENEY
                        Thirty days. He gets thirty days to 
                        make full disclosure of all his 
                        weapons of mass destruction.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        I actually think that’s smart. It 
                        gives the whole thing a sense of 
                        urgency.

                                 RICE
                        Colin?

                                 POWELL
                        I can’t see any reason to object.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Powell on the phone with De Villepin.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        The new language is generally more 
                        acceptable, and the thirty days 
                        provision is something we can 
                        accommodate. But --

                                 POWELL
                        Why is it that every time we agree 
                        on something I just know there’s 
                        going to be a “but” in your next 
                        sentence?

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        But in the event that Saddam is 
                        found to be in material breach of 
                        the resolution... we wish to return 
                        the issue to the U.N. 

                                 POWELL
                        No, Dominique--

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        This cannot simply be a green light 
                        for invasion.

                                 POWELL
                        Let me say this as plainly as I 
                        can. A second resolution is a non-
                        starter for the president. 

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Then why did he not make that clear 
                        in his speech?

                                 POWELL
                        Because he misspoke. He misspoke!

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        That was careless.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes. Yes, it was careless. 

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Extremely careless.
                                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        But if you knew how close he came --

           He trails off.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Colin?

                                 POWELL
                        Never mind. Here’s the bottom line. 
                        If you turn this into a deal-
                        breaker, we’ll end up with no 
                        resolution at all. Nothing. I know 
                        you think you’ve got the whip hand 
                        here. I imagine you’re enjoying 
                        that quite a bit.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                (offended)
                        Colin, I assure you--

                                 POWELL
                        But do you really want to push so 
                        hard to avoid war that you make it

           It’s still dark as Powell’s car pulls up outside the infamous

                        The French want to change the “or” 
                        to an “and”.

                                 RICE
                        Because they think this process 
                        doesn’t already resemble a piece of 
                        absurdist theatre?

                                 POWELL
                        De Villepin really seems to believe 
                        it’s an important distinction. To 
                        constitute a material breach Saddam 
                        would have to make a false 
                        declaration about his weapons 
                        capabilities, and fail to cooperate 
                        with the inspections. Not just one 
                        or the other.

                                 RICE
                        Well, when you put it like that it 
                        sounds an awful lot like a back-
                        door way of getting two 
                        resolutions. I’m not sure I can go 
                        to the president with that.

                                 POWELL
                        But it’s not two resolutions. It’s 
                        not going back to the U.N. and 
                        starting over.

                                 RICE
                        I don’t know.

                                 POWELL
                        Look, maybe we just give the French 
                        this one. Would that be so bad? 
                        Chances are, if Saddam is going to 
                        fail on one part of the resolution, 
                        he’ll fail on the other part too, 
                        so what’s the difference?

           Rice still looks unconvinced.

                                 POWELL
                        If he’s going to screw with us, 
                        he’s going to do it in style.

                                 RICE
                        Okay, that I can take to the 
                        president.

                        for it.

                                 POWELL

                        Then we have reached an impasse. 

                                 POWELL
                        You’re saying it’s over?

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        You are too much the pessimiste, 
                        Colin. Impasse does not have to 
                        mean the end. 

           That Gallic twinkle again.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Who knows, maybe it is only the 
                        beginning? We will talk soon.

                        areas I pointed to are where we

                        Of course not.

           Powell leaves them. They stand there, looking nervous. 

           At that moment, Scooter Libby just happens to stroll past the 
           waiting area and just happens to notice them there.

                        Excuse me, Dr. Blix? Dr. ElBaradei? 
                        I’m Scooter Libby, the vice 
                        president’s chief of staff. 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

           Powell enters to find a couple of MILITARY ANALYSTS at 
           computers, but no one else.

                                 POWELL
                        What’s going on?

                                 ANALYST
                        Sir?

                                 POWELL
                        Where is everyone?

           INT. CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Libby ushers in Blix and ElBaradei. Cheney greets them.

                                 CHENEY
                        Gentlemen, thank you for stopping by.

           They shake hands.

                                 ELBARADEI
                        Of course.

           Blix goes to take a seat.

                                 CHENEY
                        No need to sit, I’m not going to 
                        keep you.

           Blix stands again, awkwardly.

                                 CHENEY
                        Let me get straight to the point. 
                        If weapons inspections are carried 
                        out but fail to produce results in 
                        a timely manner, this admin-
                        istration stands ready to discredit 
                        both the substance of those 
                        inspections, and the credibility of 
                        the agents who conduct them.

           Blix and ElBaradei stare back at him, stunned.
                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           INT. OVAL OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY

           Powell hurries back to find Blix and ElBaradei waiting for 
           him. Before he can say anything, the Secretary calls them in.

                                 SECRETARY
                        The president will see you now.

           They enter the Oval Office.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Powell sits glumly at his desk. Armitage enters.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        How did it go?

                                 POWELL
                        Terribly. They were too polite to 
                        say it but I’m sure Cheney got to 
                        them. They barely answered the 
                        president’s questions and now he’s 
                        more skeptical than ever.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I’m sorry, sir, it was a bad idea.

                                 POWELL
                        No, we got outmaneuvered, that’s 
                        all. Damnit, we’ve got to get the 
                        French on board or this whole thing 
                        is going to fall apart.

           INT. RICE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Powell and Rice.

                                 POWELL
                        What if we look at this in a purely 
                        political context? The mid-terms 
                        are coming up. Wouldn’t the 
                        president love to have something he 
                        can call a victory?

                                 RICE
                        Not if it can be spun as the U.N. 
                        scoring one over us.

                                 POWELL
                        “Agreement reached at the United 
                        Nations.” That’s all the headlines 
                        are going to say. I’ll be amazed if 
                        a single member of congress 
                                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 POWELL(cont'd)
                        actually reads all the language, 
                        let alone anyone in Peoria.

           Rice nods. Makes sense.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Powell on the phone with De Villepin. Armitage and Wilkerson 
           look on.

                                 POWELL
                        You got your wish, Dominique. We 
                        are willing to change the “or” to 
                        an “and.”

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        I am with the president at this 
                        very moment. Let me put it to him.

           He puts him on hold.

                                 POWELL
                        Goddamnit.

                                 WILKERSON
                        What happened?

                                 POWELL
                        He put me on hold.

           They wait.

                                 POWELL
                        What the hell are they talking 
                        about? We’re giving them what they 
                        wanted.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        If they’re going to screw with us 
                        now I will personally raise an army 
                        and storm the beaches.

           De Villepin comes back on the line.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Colin?

                                 POWELL
                        Yes.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        The president gives his approval. 
                        We have our resolution.

           Powell punches the air. Armitage and Wilkerson high five.

           REPRESENTATIVES from fifteen member nations sit at the

           The COUNCIL PRESIDENT addresses the chamber.

                        I’d like to thank Secretary Powell 
                        for his leadership, his good work,

                        the implementation of this

           FOOTAGE of Blix and ElBaradei arriving in BAGHDAD.

                                 FOX REPORTER
                        Quite simply, these inspections 
                        will determine whether or not 
                        there’s a war. Hans Blix described 
                        it as a new chapter, but it’s also 
                        Saddam’s last chance.

           Blix giving a press conference outside the U.N. in Baghdad.

                        We will inspect, and we will report 
                        cooperation and lack of cooperation.

           INT. CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Cheney and Libby watch the report, both grim-faced.

           ON TV: Footage of an IRAQI NEWS ANCHOR reading a statement.

                                 FOX REPORTER (ON TV)
                        State-run TV read out a letter from 
                        Saddam Hussein to parliament, 
                        explaining why he had agreed to 
                        comply with the U.N. resolution, 
                        despite its advice to say no. 

           SADDAM HUSSEIN meeting with his CABINET.

                                 FOX REPORTER (ON TV)
                        Iraq, he said, had nothing to hide. 
                        But Saddam’s dilemma now is that 
                        within thirty days he has to come 
                        up with a full disclosure of 
                        weapons he insists he doesn’t have.

           Libby turns off the TV.

                                 CHENEY
                        So. Now we’re in the inspections 
                        business.

                                 LIBBY
                        It’s a shame.

                        I don’t trust him.

                        Saddam?

                                 CHENEY
                        Blix. The Swedes are a duplicitous 
                        people. That’s just a matter of 
                        historical fact.

           INT. ARMITAGE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Some time later. Armitage works at his desk. Powell enters.

                                 POWELL
                        Listen, what are you hearing from 
                        your friends at Langley? 

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I’m hearing a lot of colorful 
                        language that you might 
                        characterize as anti-Swedish.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m hearing the same thing. He’s 
                        withholding information -- giving 
                        them locations but not details of 
                        the inspections.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Yeah.

                                 POWELL
                        Should we be worried?

           Armitage shrugs: “what do you want me to say?”

                                 POWELL
                        Should we?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Look, the C.I.A. is for sure spying 
                        on Blix, Cheney for sure had them 
                        do it, and Blix for sure knows it’s 
                        happening. Can you honestly blame 
                        the guy for not wanting to put out 
                        before he’s ready, when they’re 
                        acting like he is the one with 
                        weapons hidden under his bed?

                                 POWELL
                        But if he keeps this up, if they 
                        think he’s stonewalling, that could 
                        jeopardize the whole operation.

                        It’s a waiting game now though, 
                        sir. Blix isn’t going to release 
                        anything at least until after 
                        Saddam makes his declaration. We 
                        have to bide our time a little bit.

                                 POWELL
                        What is this? You’re learning 
                        patience in your old age?

           Armitage grins.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE, BULLPEN - DAY

           Armitage, Wilkerson and other STAFFERS pore over copies of an 
           enormous DOCUMENT -- Saddam’s W.M.D. declaration.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Would it have killed them to 
                        summarize this?

           Powell comes out of his office.

                                 POWELL
                        All right. What have we got?

                                 WILKERSON
                        There’s nothing here, sir. Most of 
                        it is just copies of information 
                        they already declared in the ‘90s. 
                        It’s old news and irrelevance and a 
                        whole bunch of obfuscation. 

                                 ARMITAGE
                        But what if it’s --

           He trails off.

                                 WILKERSON
                        What if it’s what?

           Armitage doesn’t want to say it.

                                 POWELL
                        What if all this is simply the 
                        truth? What if there’s really no 
                        there there?
                (beat)
                        Either way, I’m finding a new 
                        respect for the French. We can 
                        argue back and forth about this --
                (the document)
                        But it doesn’t mean anything on its 
                        own. They made sure of that.

                        On that point, sir --

           He notices other STAFFERS close-by, pretending not to listen. 

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE

           The three of them huddle out of anyone else’s earshot.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Tenet met with the president this 
                        morning to talk about W.M.D.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Why would that happen?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        They want to have a case ready in 
                        the event that Blix doesn’t come 
                        through quickly enough for the 
                        president’s liking.

                                 POWELL
                        How strong was the case?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I’m told the president actually 
                        pushed him pretty hard. He wasn’t 
                        buying it at first.

                                 WILKERSON
                        But?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Tenet pushed back, said it was a 
                        sure thing. He said it was a slam 
                        dunk.

                                 WILKERSON
                        He said that? He actually said 
                        those words?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        He didn’t just say it, he jumped up 
                        off the couch like Magic fucking 
                        Johnson.

                                 WILKERSON
                        When was the last time you heard 
                        the director of central 
                        intelligence talk about anything 
                        with that kind of certainty?

                        They can’t just circumvent the 
                        inspections process.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        No, but Blix doesn’t have the last 
                        word. If the president wants to 
                        say: “here, see? We caught him 
                        moving trucks full of chemicals out 
                        of X facility the day before the 
                        inspectors went in, that’s why they 
                        didn’t find anything” -- that’s it. 
                        Failure to declare, failure to 
                        cooperate, away we go. Everybody 
                        have a nice fucking war.

           Powell slumps in his chair. He looks miserable.

                                 POWELL
                        All of this was for nothing. We 
                        drove ourselves half-mad fighting 
                        for a resolution that Saddam is 
                        almost bound to contravene. If 
                        anything, we made invasion more 
                        likely, not less.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        That’s not true, sir. This thing 
                        still has to play out. 

           Powell shakes his head, he doesn’t buy it.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Get on the phone with Blix. Excuse 
                        the expression, but you’ve got to 
                        put a rocket under his ass.

           LATER

           Powell on the phone with Blix.

                                 BLIX
                        This is not a process that can be 
                        rushed.

                                 POWELL
                        I understand that, Dr. Blix. But 
                        you have to realize what the 
                        political ramifications are here. 
                        It would be enormously helpful if 
                        you could do more to stress the 
                        aggressiveness of the inspections.
                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 BLIX
                        The inspections have been nothing 
                        if not aggressive.

                                 POWELL
                        Maybe. But I have to tell you, the 
                        president is getting a little sick 
                        of seeing grinning Iraqi officials 
                        leading camera crews around 
                        whitewashed, empty warehouses.

                                 BLIX
                        All right. I will discuss this with 
                        my team.

                                 POWELL
                        Thank you, I appreciate it.

           INT. POWELL HOME, GARAGE - DAY

           Powell tinkers with another one of his old cars. A small TV 
           plays CNN in the background.

           After some spluttering, the engine starts to PURR. Powell 
           looks pleased, but it doesn’t altogether lift his mood.

           He notices the TV. Blix on the news. He turns up the volume.

                                 BLIX (ON TV)
                        My team is working harder than 
                        ever, we have increased the number 
                        of inspections, and we continue to 
                        insist on unconditional access.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay.

                                 BLIX (ON TV)
                        But for now we are looking forward 
                        to returning to our families for 
                        the holidays.

           Powell can’t believe what he’s hearing.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           Bush and Rice. The president looks unusually tired.

                                 BUSH
                        This pressure isn’t holding 
                        together.

                                 RICE
                        No, sir. I don’t believe it is.

                        How do they shut down for Christmas? 
                        I mean, everyone loves Christmas. I 
                        love Christmas. But how much longer 
                        do they think I can wait?

                                 RICE
                        I agree, sir. It’s a poor decision. 
                        It looks like they’re unserious 
                        about the inspections.

           Bush goes to the window and stares out. For a moment it seems 
           like he might have forgotten Rice is still here. Eventually, 
           he turns back to her.

                                 BUSH
                        Condi, I haven’t asked you directly 
                        about this before.

                                 RICE
                        No, sir.

                                 BUSH
                        Not because I don’t value your 
                        opinion.

                                 RICE
                        I understand.

                                 BUSH
                        Because I didn’t want to put you on 
                        the spot until it was the right 
                        time to put you there. I’m asking 
                        you now.

                                 RICE
                        You’re asking me if I think you 
                        should go to war?

                                 BUSH
                        Yeah.

           Rice doesn’t hesitate. She’s been waiting for this question 
           and she knows her answer.

                                 RICE
                        Mr. President, I believe that to 
                        carry out coercive diplomacy, you 
                        have to back it up with a credible 
                        threat. You made the threat; you 
                        have to follow through on it. You 
                        have to go to war.

           Rice works at her desk. KNOCK on the door. It’s Powell.

                                 RICE
                        Colin. Come in.

                                 POWELL
                        The president asked to see me. 
                        Thought I’d stop and say hi on my 
                        way over.

                                 RICE
                        Of course.

           An awkward beat.

                                 POWELL
                        They didn’t say what it was 
                        concerning. Any ideas?

                                 RICE
                        No.

           Powell looks at her. He knows she’s lying.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s unusual. To bring me in this 
                        late, I mean. I’m not sure I can 
                        remember the last time I spoke to 
                        him in the Oval Office and it was 
                        after lunch.

           He laughs. Rice smiles, a little weakly. 

           Powell doesn’t know what else to say. There’s a sadness in 
           his eyes: he can’t get an honest response from her even now.

                                 POWELL
                        Well, I should head on in there.

           He starts to leave.

                                 RICE
                        Colin -- I just wanted to say. 
                        You’ve done a terrific job these 
                        last few months.

           Powell nods, unsure exactly what to make of that.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           Powell and Bush.

                                 POWELL
                        Of course.

                                 BUSH
                        You’ve done a terrific job.

           Powell reacts. That phrase again.

                                 BUSH
                        But I’ve come to a realization. The 
                        inspections aren’t going to get us 
                        there. They’re just not going to 
                        work the way we want them to.

           Powell nods, resigned to what’s coming.

                                 BUSH
                        Colin.... Colin, I really think I’m 
                        going to have to do it. 

           A long, awful silence.

                                 POWELL
                        You’re sure about this?

                                 BUSH
                        Yeah.

                                 POWELL
                        Your mind is made up?

                                 BUSH
                        It’s made up.

                                 POWELL
                        You understand, once again, sir -- 
                        you do understand the consequences?

                                 BUSH
                        I understand, you’ve told me. But I 
                        think I have to do this. My gut is 
                        telling me I have to do it.

                                 POWELL

                        Yeah, I get it. I get it. 

                                 POWELL
                        With respect, Mr. President, you 
                        can’t possibly know what it means 
                        to actually fight in a war.

           Bush stares at him.

                                 POWELL
                        That was out of line.

                                 BUSH
                        No kidding.
                (beat)
                        But if anyone can say it... Finish 
                        your point.

                                 POWELL
                        I think I’ve said enough already.

                                 BUSH
                        I said finish it.

                                 POWELL
                        All right. The point is this. I 
                        don’t believe we’re simply going to 
                        roll into Baghdad and be welcomed 
                        as liberators. This is a country 
                        that’s unified only by its 
                        subjection to tyranny. When you 
                        remove that--

                                 BUSH
                        I’m not expecting it to be easy.

                                 POWELL
                        No, but Mr. President, I’m saying 
                        you have to have it settled in your 
                        mind that this is the right thing 
                        to do, and know that you’ll be 
                        placing our troops in a theatre 
                        where civil war is not out of the 
                        question.

           Bush nods, as if thinking this over. But his demeanor does 
           not really change. Powell senses he hasn’t broken through.

                                 BUSH
                        Colin, I value your wisdom, you 
                        know that.

                                 POWELL
                (flatly)
                        Yes, sir. 
                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 BUSH
                        But now I want to know that you’re 
                        with me. Because I think I have to 
                        do this and I want you to be with 
                        me on it.
                (no response)
                        So I’m asking you. Are you with me?
                        Because we’re going to have to sell 
                        this thing. Go out and sell it to 
                        the American people. We’ve got a 
                        great case, it’s real strong. But 
                        the people don’t know it yet, so 
                        we’re gonna have to tell ‘em.

           Powell realizes where this is heading and the blood is 
           draining from his face.

                                 BUSH
                        This actually was Dick’s idea. He 
                        thought you’d be best. 

                                 POWELL
                        Did he?

                                 BUSH
                        You’re popular, you’re well liked, 
                        you’re credulous.

                                 POWELL
                        Credible.

           He’s not sure if that was a Bushism, a Freudian slip, or 
           what.

                                 BUSH
                        Right. So Dick suggested it, but 
                        it’s my decision to ask you. Colin, 
                        it’s time to put your soldier’s hat 
                        back on. 

                                 POWELL
                (distant)
                        My soldier’s hat?

                                 BUSH
                        Yeah, your hat, your war uniform. I 
                        don’t mean -- not literally put it 
                        on. But you know we’re not debating 
                        it anymore, and I need you to go 
                        out and sell this thing. Be our 
                        point man on this.
                (beat)
                        Will you do that for me?
                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                (long pause)
                        That’s no small thing you’re 
                        asking.

                                 BUSH
                        I know that. But I’d like your 
                        answer now.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m sorry, Mr. President. I’m not 
                        prepared to make a decision like 
                        this without giving it more than a 
                        moment’s consideration.

           A tense beat.

                                 BUSH
                        Okay. I respect that. But do your 
                        thinking quick -- we need to get 
                        boots on the ground. Get in there and 
                        get this over with before the summer 
                        comes. Hot as hell in the summer time 
                        out there in that desert.

           INT. POWELL’S CAR, TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Powell sits in back, staring out at nothing, the weight of 
           the world on his shoulders.

                                 POWELL
                (to the DRIVER)
                        Pull over a minute, please.

           EXT. VIETNAM MEMORIAL - NIGHT

           Powell walks slowly alongside the wall. It’s deserted on this 
           bitter night and his SECRET SERVICE DETAIL gives him space.

           He stops. Reads the inscribed NAMES silently to himself. 
           Trying to extract some new meaning from this awful catalogue 
           of his fallen cohorts.

           INT. POWELL HOME, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Powell lies awake in bed as Alma sleeps next to him. After a 
           moment, she wakes.

                                 ALMA
                        You shouldn’t sit up worrying like 
                        this.(cid:13)
                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        You don’t think I have cause to 
                        worry?

           She does, of course. An uneasy silence.

                                 POWELL
                        I know what you’re thinking. You 
                        were right.

                                 ALMA
                        I wasn’t thinking that.

                                 POWELL
                        I wouldn’t blame you if you were. 
                        You tried to warn me and look what 
                        happened. I got sucked in. I got 
                        sucked in and he played me for a 
                        fool.

                                 ALMA
                        That’s not true.

                                 POWELL
                        Isn’t it? If I do this, he gets 
                        what he wants. If I don’t do it, he 
                        gets what he wants -- with the 
                        added bonus of forcing me out of 
                        the administration. Either way, 
                        it’s a coup de grace. Three-and-
                        half decades of military service, 
                        but all anyone’ll remember me for 
                        is whether or not I gave a speech.

                                 ALMA
                        I can’t tell you which way to turn 
                        here.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m not asking you to.

                                 ALMA
                        But I can tell you this: if Dick 
                        Cheney is part of the equation when 
                        you make this decision, if something 
                        he said or did is even a factor at 
                        the back of your mind -- well, that 
                        will be a sorry state of affairs.

           Powell has no response. That hit home.

           EXT. THE MALL - DAY

           Powell and Armitage walk briskly alongside the Carp Pond. 
           It’s a bright morning, but clearly very cold. 
                                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           Powell appears to have shaken off his despondency and has a 
           new sense of purpose about him.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I hate to complain--

                                 POWELL
                        Is that a fact?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I hate to complain, but I think my 
                        testicles are about to freeze off.

                                 POWELL
                        Keep the pace up, keep the blood 
                        flowing. Your testicles will be 
                        fine.

           They walk on.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You can do it. You know that? If 
                        it’s what you want, you can do it 
                        with your head held high.

                                 POWELL
                        It’s not that simple.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It’s a civilian job. It’s not like 
                        walking away from the Army.

                                 POWELL
                        I know. I understand that -- on an 
                        intellectual level, I understand it.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I appreciate how agonizing this 
                        decision must be--

                                 POWELL
                        I’m not ready to make it yet. 
                        That’s the simple fact. 

           Powell stops before they get close to a group of TOURISTS.

                                 POWELL
                        Richard, I wanted to talk to you 
                        privately because, well -- look, 
                        you’ve been more than just a deputy 
                        these last few months. I’ve served 
                        in my career with some of the 
                        finest men and women you could ever 
                        hope to meet. No one’s been more 
                        loyal than you. No one’s been a 
                        better friend. 
                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 POWELL(cont'd)
                (off his embarrassment)
                        I know that’s corny. It also 
                        happens to be the truth. But now I 
                        need to know that I’ll have your 
                        full support going forward.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You’re asking me if I want to step 
                        aside?

                                 POWELL
                        I’ll understand if that’s what you 
                        feel you have to do.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        I’m ready to do it, sir. I was 
                        hoping to follow your lead.

                                 POWELL
                        That’s not what I’m putting on the 
                        table.

           Armitage considers this. But it’s not a hard decision.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        No. Of course not, are you kidding? 
                        I’m with you as long as you need me.

                                 POWELL
                        Good.

           They start walking again.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Anything to get out of this 
                        shrivelling cold.

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE, BULLPEN - DAY

           As Staffers bustle around it, a TV plays CNN. Footage of 
           AFGHAN FIGHTERS on the move. The chyron reads: “TALIBAN 
           RESURGENT? EVIDENCE OF NEW JIHAD AGAINST U.S. TROOPS”.

           The door to Powell’s office is closed --

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE 

           Powell, Wilkerson and Armitage study copies of a thick, top-
           secret INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Some of these claims aren’t even 
                        sourced. Are we supposed to just 
                        take their word for it?
                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 ARMITAGE
                        And the language of the thing. It’s 
                        histrionic.

                                 WILKERSON
                (to Powell)
                        What do you want to do?

           Powell shakes his head, frustrated. But then he has an idea.

                                 POWELL
                        The French are about to assume 
                        presidency of the security council.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Haven’t we been hearing about it.

                                 POWELL
                        I told them I wouldn’t attend the 
                        meeting. It’s MLK Day.

                                 WILKERSON
                        They’d have to understand that.

                                 POWELL
                        I just changed my mind. We’ll move 
                        forward on the speech, but no one’s 
                        closed off the diplomatic route. No 
                        one’s told us to stop. Maybe 
                        there’s another gasp in this.

           A KNOCK on the door and Amy enters.

                                 AMY
                        Sir, the vice president for you.

           Powell picks up the phone.

                                 POWELL
                        Dick.

                                 CHENEY
                        Colin, I wanted to thank you for 
                        agreeing to do this.

                                 POWELL
                        I haven’t agreed to anything yet.

                                 CHENEY
                (surprised)
                        But the president asked you?

                                 POWELL
                        He did.
                                                    (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 CHENEY
                        You realize what it will mean if 
                        you refuse?

                                 POWELL
                        I’m clear on the nature of the 
                        situation. Is there something I can 
                        help you with?

                                 CHENEY
                        The document Scooter sent over--

                                 POWELL
                        I have it in front of me.

                                 CHENEY
                        All the key intelligence is there. 
                        You’ll find it compelling.

                                 POWELL
                        We’re giving it every consideration.

                                 CHENEY
                        Good. When can the president expect 
                        your decision?

                                 POWELL
                        I’m sure you’ll be the first to 
                        know.

           He hangs up before Cheney can push him any further.

                                 POWELL
                (the document)
                        Toss it.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Sir?

                                 POWELL
                        If they don’t have the evidence, 
                        that makes the decision for us. I’m 
                        not about to go selling snake oil 
                        at the United Nations. But I can’t 
                        tell one way or the other from 
                        reading this alarmist propaganda. 
                        Toss it.

           Armitage happily slam dunks his copy in a trash can.

                                 POWELL
                        We’re going to start from scratch. 
                        As soon as I get back from New 
                        York, I want a room at Langley. I 
                        want every piece of information and 
                        every source they’ve got. And I 
                                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 POWELL(cont'd)
                        want the director with me right 
                        there in the room.

           INT. UNITED NATIONS, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A private, informal meeting of the Security Council. 

           De Villepin holds court at the head of the table, clearly 
           enjoying his new position of authority.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        France has long been at the 
                        forefront of the global fight 
                        against extremism, and my 
                        government intends to use the honor 
                        of presiding over this council as 
                        an opportunity to continue to 
                        expand our historical leadership on 
                        this grave issue.

           Powell exchanges a look with Jack Straw, who rolls his eyes.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        Now, although the purpose of this 
                        meeting was to focus on 
                        international terrorism, I feel 
                        compelled to relate this to the 
                        current situation.

           That got Powell’s attention.

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        It is a matter of some concern that 
                        a military strike in Mesopotamia 
                        would have consequences for our 
                        efforts to curb the activities of 
                        the terrorists. Rather than 
                        suppressing them, my fear, the fear 
                        of my government, is that it will 
                        only embolden them.

           Powell reacts, irritated.

           INT. FRENCH AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - DAY 

           DIPLOMATS and POLITICIANS mingle and drink Champagne. Powell 
           talks with Straw.

                                 POWELL
                        I came here thinking there might 
                        still be a chance to make this 
                        work. But the French only appear to 
                        have hardened their line.

                        party after all.

           Powell’s cell phone RINGS. He answers.

                                 POWELL

           INT. AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, FOYER - DAY 

           Powell and Straw find a TV playing CNN.

           ON TV: De Villepin gives a press conference outside the U.N.

                                 DE VILLEPIN (ON TV)
                        If war is the only way to resolve 
                        this problem, we are going down a 
                        dead end.

                                 POWELL
                        What the hell is he doing?

                                 DE VILLEPIN (ON TV)
                        Already we know for a fact that 
                        Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 
                        programs are being largely blocked, 
                        even frozen. We must do everything 
                        possible to strengthen this 
                        process. We believe that today 
                        nothing justifies envisaging 
                        military action. Nothing! Rien!

           Powell can only shake his head in dismay and disbelief. 
           That’s the end of that.

                        This information is one-hundred-
                        percent reliable.

           INT. C.I.A., BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           Tenet briefs Powell. Armitage and Wilkerson are here too, as 
           well as a number of C.I.A. ANALYSTS and LAWYERS.
                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 TENET
                        It’s been corroborated by four 
                        different sources, including a 
                        chemical engineer, a civil 
                        engineer, and two high-ranking 
                        military defectors.

           They’re looking at a SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH, projected on a 
           screen. It’s unclear exactly what it shows -- a desert area 
           with indeterminate buildings dotted around.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m looking at this and I see... I 
                        don’t know what I see.

                                 TENET
                        Well, the area here. The different 
                        shading on the ground, the pattern 
                        of it. The proximity to the 
                        facility here, which we know 
                        produced mustard gas used by Saddam 
                        against the Kurds. All of this is 
                        indicative of attempts to cover a 
                        chemical spill, most likely caused 
                        by a rushed effort to transport the 
                        chemicals from the vicinity.

                                 POWELL
                        George, I’d like you for a moment 
                        to imagine me repeating what you 
                        just said in front of a worldwide 
                        television audience of half a 
                        billion people, many of whom may 
                        not have trained as intelligence 
                        analysts.
                (beat)
                        Scrap it.

                                 TENET
                        This is good intel.

                                 POWELL
                        I said scrap it. What else?

           INT. C.I.A., HALLWAY - DAY 

           They take a break. Powell huddles with Armitage. Wilkerson is 
           on his cell phone nearby.

                                 POWELL
                        This is a mess.

                        Yeah, but you’re taking the right 
                        approach. You’ve got to press them 
                        on every detail.

           Wilkerson hands Powell the phone.

                        There’s a lot to work through.

                        He’s getting anxious.

                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 RICE
                        And really it was a courtesy.

                        there and then. We’ve tried to be 
                        accommodating.

                                 POWELL
                        Well, I’m afraid you’ll have to 
                        accommodate me a little longer.

           He hangs up, fuming.

C.I.A., BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           Back to work. A heightened air of tension in the room. 

                                 TENET
                        This is something we intercepted 
                        just a few days after the 
                        inspectors went in.

           He signals to an ANALYST, who plays an AUDIO RECORDING of two 
           IRAQI MEN talking.

           Powell listens. Looks to Wilkerson in desperation.

                                 WILKERSON
                        George?

                                 TENET
                        Yes, Larry?

                                 WILKERSON
                        They’re speaking Arabic.

                                 TENET
                        Yeah. Well, what they’re discussing 
                        is the removal of nerve gas.  

                                 WILKERSON
                        From a facility?

                                 TENET
                        From an inventory of substances 
                        being held at a particular 
                        facility.

                                 WILKERSON
                        So they’re not discussing the 
                        actual gas?

                                 TENET
                        Not as such.

                                 WILKERSON
                        So who’s to say they’re not removing 
                        it from the list because it isn’t 
                        actually there anymore? Maybe it 
                        hasn’t been there in years.

                                 TENET
                        No. Like I said, this was just 
                        after the inspectors returned. It’s 
                        obviously a cover-up.

           He looks to Powell for a decision.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        Get me a clean translation. Maybe 
                        we can use it. What else?

           Tenet places a small VIAL filled with a WHITE SUBSTANCE on 
           the table in front of Powell.

                                 POWELL
                        What’s this?

                                 TENET
                        Anthrax.

           Powell looks at him: are you kidding me?

                                 TENET
                        Not actual anthrax. It’s baking 
                        soda.

                                 POWELL
                (fighting to stay calm)
                        Okay. What’s it for?

                                 TENET
                        It’s a prop. Makes the moment more 
                        vivid. The idea that something this 
                        small could shut down Capitol Hill.

                                 POWELL
                        George, can I speak with you 
                        privately, please?

           INT. TENET’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Powell confronts Tenet, the stress of the situation getting 
           the better of him.

                                 POWELL
                        Adlai Stevenson-- 

                                 TENET
                        Okay--

                                 POWELL
                        Adlai Stevenson went to the U.N. 
                        during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

                                 TENET
                        I know.

                                 POWELL
                        When the Soviets denied the 
                        existence of the missiles, do you 
                        know why no one believed them?
                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 TENET
                        Because he had photographs.

                                 POWELL
                        He had photographs of the damn 
                        missiles!

                                 TENET
                        Colin, I know what happened when 
                        Adlai Stevenson went to the U.N. 
                        But this isn’t 1962, Saddam isn’t 
                        the Soviet Union and it’s not the 
                        Cold War anymore. And you know what 
                        else? Our intelligence is higher 
                        caliber than anything they had back 
                        then, and my agents risk their 
                        necks every day to get it.

                                 POWELL
                        I’m not attacking the quality of 
                        your field work.

                                 TENET
                        You have to piece it together. You 
                        have to build the argument. Isn’t 
                        that the whole point of this 
                        speech? Isn’t that why they asked 
                        you to do it? No, it’s not going to 
                        be an Adlai Stevenson moment. 
                        Christ, I wish it would be! But 
                        this is the twenty-first century 
                        and people don’t just leave their 
                        nuclear warheads out on the lawn 
                        for all the world to see.

           A long pause as they both cool off.

                                 POWELL
                        Let’s get back in there. But 
                        George, I’d like to be clear about 
                        one thing. If I do give this 
                        speech, you’re going to be sitting 
                        right there with me.

           Tenet nods, but he looks at least a little scared.

           INT. C.I.A., BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 

           Powell and Tenet return to the room. An expectant silence. 
           Powell picks up the “anthrax” vial, considers it.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay, we’ll use this. What else?
                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           INT. CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cheney and Libby.

                                 CHENEY
                        This is absurd. We gave him the 
                        case.

                                 LIBBY
                        I wrote that document myself.

                                 CHENEY
                        And now he’s dithering over it, 
                        tinkering away like it’s one of his 
                        goddamn vintage cars. 

                                 LIBBY
                        We’re going to have to speed this 
                        up. Sir? We’re going to have to.

           Cheny hesitates. Then gives his assent with a quick nod.

           INT. LIMO, PARKED - DAY

           Outside a hotel, Powell talks to Armitage on his cell phone. 

                                 POWELL
                (to phone)
                        Tenet has a point. It’s not 1962.

                                 ARMITAGE (O.S.)
                        Okay, so he has a point. Is that 
                        enough?

                                 POWELL
                        I think the intel is good enough 
                        for me to make the case, yes. I’m 
                        still not saying I’ll do it.

           Annemarie slides into the back of the car next to him, 
           looking stunning in her wedding dress. She’s annoyed to see 
           Powell on the phone. 

           The car pulls away.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Sir, for the record -- my position 
                        on this hasn’t changed.

                                 POWELL
                        I know.
                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 ARMITAGE
                        With your head held high, sir. 
                        That’s all I’m saying.

           Annemarie is losing patience.

                                 POWELL
                        Richard, I’ll have to call you 
                        later.

           He hangs up, but that’s not enough for Annemarie, who 
           snatches the phone from his hand.

                                 POWELL
                        Hey!

           She leans forward and passes it to the Secret Service Agent, 
           ROGER, 40s, in the front passenger seat.

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Roger, take this for me?

                                 ROGER
                        I’d be happy to.

           Roger turns off the phone, pockets it.

                                 POWELL
                        Roger--

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        I’d let it go, Dad. He’s got a gun.

           Powell can’t bear this, but he also knows this is not the 
           moment to cross his daughter. He fumes silently for a moment 
           before relaxing into the situation.

                                 POWELL
                        You look beautiful.

                                 ANNEMARIE
                        Thank you.

                                 POWELL
                        I don’t want to give you away.

           She smiles, a little choked up.

           EXT. WEDDING HOTEL - NIGHT

           A TV NEWS VAN pulls up near the entrance. The CREW gets out 
           and starts setting up equipment.

           Another van approaches.

HOTEL, LOBBY - NIGHT

           As in the opening sequence, Armitage and Wilkerson watch the 
           news report on TV.

                                 CNN REPORTER (ON T.V.)
                        ...In exclusive breaking news this 
                        evening, sources within the 
                        administration have told CNN that 
                        Secretary Powell will indeed appear 
                        before the UN Security Council, and 
                        he is expected to do so within a 
                        matter of days.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Oh, fuck me.

           INT. BAR AREA

           Powell has a beer with Mike as the party flows around them.

                                 MIKE
                        What happens if we’re invaded? 

                                 POWELL
                        Tonight?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. I mean, is there a rear 
                        admiral or someone who isn’t here, 
                        just in case? Like when they do the 
                        State of the Union and the 
                        secretary of agriculture gets 
                        hidden away in a bunker.

                                 POWELL
                        I wouldn’t worry, Mike. I think 
                        we’ve got it covered.

           A beat.

                                 POWELL
                        Let me ask you something.

                                 MIKE
                        Sure, Dad. What’s on your mind?

                                 POWELL
                        You ever wish you were still in the 
                        Army?

                                 MIKE
                        Every day. You know I do.
                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        Even now?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course. But listen -- when those 
                        doctors told me I’d never serve 
                        again, I thought my whole life was 
                        over. But that’s just the point: my 
                        life very nearly did end with that 
                        accident, and here I am now, watching 
                        my little sister getting married.

                                 POWELL
                        But if things had turned out 
                        differently--

                                 MIKE
                        If I was still a soldier? 

                                 POWELL
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        And if we’re about to go to war?

           Powell nods.

                                 MIKE
                        Come on, Dad. You have to ask me 
                        that?

                                 POWELL
                        I’d like to hear you say it.

                                 MIKE
                        I’d go wherever they sent me, I’d 
                        fight whoever they told me to 
                        fight, and I’d be honored to do it. 
                        I’d be proud.

           That’s the answer Powell was expecting, and it seems to 
           solidify something in his mind.

           Just then, Alma, Armitage and Wilkerson enter on the other 
           side of the room, talking heatedly. Powell sees them and 
           knows immediately that something’s wrong.

           He looks into the ballroom, sees Annemarie dancing.

                                 POWELL
                        Mike, do me a favor.

                                 MIKE
                        Sure.
                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 POWELL
                        Keep an eye on your sister.

                                 MIKE
                        Why, what’s going on?

                                 POWELL
                        Just keep her dancing, okay?

           EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE 

           More NEWS CREWS and REPORTERS have arrived. A whole crowd of 
           them now, blocking the entrance.

           INT. BAR AREA

           Powell huddles with Armitage and Wilkerson.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        The report is false. Deny it.

                                 WILKERSON
                        It’s not that simple. If you deny 
                        it now it’ll be seen as a finite 
                        signal you oppose invasion.

                                 POWELL
                        If I deny it now the president’s 
                        going to want my resignation.

           A tense beat. Powell looks again at Annemarie dancing.

                                 POWELL
                        I can’t think in here with this 
                        music.

           EXT. HOTEL BALCONY

           Powell steps out. Takes a deep breath.

           He looks down and sees the gathering pack of journalists.

           EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE 

           Wilkerson comes out of the hotel.

                                 WILKERSON
                        You guys don’t miss a beat, do you?

                                 JOURNALIST #1
                        Larry, is he coming out?

           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 WILKERSON
                        No. So you might as well go home

                                 JOURNALIST #1
                        We were told to expect a statement.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Are you out of your mind? His kid 
                        just got married.

                                 JOURNALIST #2
                        That’s what they told us.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Who did?

                                 JOURNALIST #2
                        It came out of the press office.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Shit.

           EXT. BALCONY

           Armitage joins Powell. They stand in silence for a moment.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It was a beautiful wedding.

                                 POWELL
                        Wasn’t it?

                                 ARMITAGE
                        It’s a low move to pull this now, 
                        even by Cheney’s standards.

                                 POWELL
                        Yeah.

           He just shrugs, he’s got nothing more to say about Cheney.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        You want me to leave you alone?

                                 POWELL
                        No. You got me into this, you can 
                        stand her and suffer through it 
                        with me.

           Armitage smiles ruefully, but then turns serious again.

                                 ARMITAGE
                        Look, you know my feelings. This 
                        war is going to happen. That 
                        doesn’t mean it’s right. The 
                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 ARMITAGE(cont'd)
                        statement it would make if you were 
                        to resign now. It would be 
                        powerful, sir. It would really mean 
                        something.

                                 POWELL
                        What would it mean to the troops 
                        though? If I get on my high horse and 
                        wash my hands of the whole thing, are 
                        they going to follow my lead? Are 
                        they going to walk away because they 
                        don’t happen to like the deployments 
                        they get handed? I’m a soldier, 
                        Richard. I will never not be a 
                        soldier. And I may not fight in this 
                        war, but I can’t turn my back on the 
                        men and women who will.

           Armitage nods. He understands.

           EXT. UNITED NATIONS - DAY 

           The sun rises over the East River. Flags hang in the still, 
           freezing air. 

           SUPER: FEBRUARY 5TH, 2003.

           A brief moment of calm. Then --

           MEDIA CIRCUS

           NEWS CREWS swarm around the U.N. compound. COPS everywhere, 
           directing traffic, trying to marshal the chaos.

           ANTI-WAR PROTESTERS, their numbers visibly swelled since 
           Bush’s speech, spill past barricades and block the street.

           A long line of TV NEWS REPORTERS, speaking excitedly in a 
           dozen languages --

                                 REPORTERS
                        With less than an hour to go... 
                        The world holds its breath as we 
                        wait to hear what Secretary Powell 
                        will reveal... 
                        Will this be Powell’s “Adlai 
                        Stevenson moment”?... 
                        Can he convince the skeptics that 
                        war in Iraq is the answer?...

           and test equipment: giant screens, lights, speakers.
                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        This is not for our benefit, I 
                        feel.

                                 STRAW
                        Oh? How do you mean?

                                 DE VILLEPIN
                        This is for the Hollywood movie 
                        fans, no?

           Straw can’t argue with that. It does have the feel of a 
           soundstage being prepped.

           INT. WALDORF HOTEL, LOBBY - DAY 

           SECRET SERVICE AGENTS all over the place. Powell sits with 
           Alma on a couch. He plays nervously with something in his 
           hands. The vial of “anthrax.”

           Wilkerson approaches.

                                 WILKERSON
                        Sir, we’re ready.

           INT. POWELL’S CAR, TRAVELING - DAY

           Nearing the U.N. Powell catches sight of the Anti-war 
           Protesters, now some distance away behind a POLICE CORDON.

           He looks away and Alma squeezes his hand to reassure.

           INT. UNITED NATIONS, BACKSTAGE - DAY 

           Powell waits in the wings as the Security Council chamber 
           fills up. Tenet joins him.

                                 TENET
                        Just wanted to wish you luck.

                                 POWELL
                        George, you know it’s not too late. 
                        If there’s anything I’m about to 
                        say that you’re not completely 
                        confident in --

                                 TENET
                        Nothing. I stand by every claim.
                        You’re going to do great.

           He leaves him.
                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)           Powell has the speech in his hand. He flicks through it. Not 
           reading it, nervous. When he looks up, Cheney’s there. 

                                 POWELL
                        Have you come to wish me luck too?

                                 CHENEY
                        No. I’m sure you don’t want that.

           Powell just looks at him.

                                 CHENEY
                        All the same, you should know that 
                        this will not go unappreciated.

                                 POWELL
                        We’ll let history be the judge, 
                        shall we?

                                 CHENEY
                        History will look kindly on this 
                        day. It’s an admirable thing you’re 
                        about to do.

                                 POWELL
                        Okay.

                                 CHENEY
                        It’s admirable, it’s moral.

                                 POWELL
                        All right, Dick --

                                 CHENEY
                        It’s patriotic.

           Powell almost laughs -- it would be funny if it wasn’t so 
           disturbing. Cheney looks confused.

                                 POWELL
                        No, Dick. No -- let me tell you: 
                        the kids who’ll die in this war. 
                        Those kids, they’re the patriots. 
                        Not you, not me either. But maybe 
                        if you say it enough times, 
                        folks’ll think you understand. They 
                        might even think it applies to you. 
                        Dick Cheney. Serves his country. A 
                        patriot. I’ve got news for you, 
                        Dick. You’re not fooling me. I 
                        don’t believe you’re fooling many 
                        people at all. Maybe the only 
                        person you are fooling, is you.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           INT. SECURITY COUNCIL - DAY 

           Powell walks to his seat. Polite APPLAUSE around the hall.

           He sees the rest of them sitting there: Bush, Rice, Rumsfeld. 
           Tenet in the seat directly behind his.

           He sits. Organizes his papers. Takes a sip of water. He’s 
           still shaken from his confrontation with Cheney.

           But then, a little stiffly at first, he begins.

                                 POWELL
                        Mr. President, Mr. Secretary 
                        General, distinguished colleagues, 
                        I would like to begin by expressing 
                        my thanks for the special effort 
                        that each of you made to be here 
                        today.

           LATER

           Powell finds his rhythm: methodical, forceful. The way he 
           presents the case, it is convincing.

                                 POWELL
                        Let me say a word about satellite 
                        images before I show a couple. The 
                        photos that I am about to show you 
                        are sometimes hard for the average 
                        person to interpret, hard for me. 
                        But as I show you these images, I 
                        will try to capture and explain 
                        what they mean, what they indicate 
                        to our imagery specialists. Let's 
                        look at one. 

           A SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH, much like the one they studied 
           earlier, is projected on screens around the hall.

                                 POWELL
                        This one depicts a weapons munition 
                        facility at a place called Taji. 
                        This is one of about sixty-five 
                        such facilities in Iraq. We know 
                        that this one has housed chemical 
                        munitions. Here, you see fifteen 
                        munitions bunkers in yellow and red 
                        outlines. The four that are in red 
                        squares represent active chemical 
                        munitions bunkers. How do I know 
                        that? How can I say that? Let me 
                        give you a closer look.
                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           LATER

           He has been speaking for a while now, but the audience 
           continues to hang on his every word.

                                 POWELL
                        When Iraq finally admitted having 
                        biological weapons in 1995, the 
                        quantities were vast. 

           He holds up the “anthrax” vial.

                                 POWELL
                        Less than a teaspoon of dry 
                        anthrax, a little bit about this 
                        amount -- this is just about the 
                        amount of a teaspoon -- less than a 
                        teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an 
                        envelope shut down the United 
                        States Senate in the fall of 2001. 
                        Iraq declared 8,500 liters of 
                        anthrax. If concentrated into this 
                        dry form, that amount would be 
                        enough to fill tens upon tens of 
                        thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam 
                        Hussein has not verifiably 
                        accounted for even one teaspoon-
                        full of this deadly material.

           LATER STILL

           His voice is strained now, every word an effort.

                                 POWELL
                        We wrote Resolution 1441 not in 
                        order to go to war, we wrote 1441 
                        to try to preserve the peace. We 
                        wrote 1441 to give Iraq one last 
                        chance. Iraq is not so far taking 
                        that one last chance.

           He continues --

           INT. POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Powell is alone at his desk.

                                 POWELL (O.S., CONT’D)
                        We must not shrink from whatever is 
                        ahead of us. We must not fail in our 
                        duty and our responsibility to the 
                        citizens of the countries that are 
                        represented by this body. Thank you.
                                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           Silence. Powell just sits there, lost in thought. 

           The office is packed up, everything in boxes.

           SUPER: JANUARY 19TH, 2005. 22 MONTHS AFTER THE START OF 
           OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM. ONE DAY BEFORE BUSH’S SECOND 
           INAUGURATION.

           With some effort, Powell gets up, gathers the last few things 
           from his desk, drops them in a box.

           A KNOCK and Alma enters.

                                 ALMA
                        Hi.

                                 POWELL
                (pleasantly surprised)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ALMA
                        Oh, I thought maybe you could use a 
                        hand.

                                 POWELL
                        You didn’t have to. They’ve got 
                        someone coming to collect all this 
                        anyway. I don’t know why, it’ll 
                        just take up space in the garage.

                                 ALMA
                        Well, I’ll walk out with you then. 
                        Are you ready?

           Powell takes a last look around the office.

                                 POWELL
                        I always assumed I’d know when it 
                        was the right time to leave. 

                                 ALMA
                        You said from the start you’d do 
                        this job for one term and that 
                        would be it.

                                 POWELL
                        Yes. I’m not saying now is too 
                        soon. Now I’m just another card in 
                        the re-shuffle. 
                (quietly)
                        I could have left and it would have 
                        meant something.

           A long pause. Alma doesn’t know what to say.

                        All right. Let’s go.

           BULLPEN

           They step out of his office. The place is deserted.

                                 POWELL
                        Didn’t anyone want to say goodbye?

           He holds back, troubled.

                                 ALMA
                        Colin? What is it?

                                 POWELL
                        Something Larry told me once. He 
                        said -- he said if I ever strayed 
                        from my mission the people who work 
                        in this building would find a way 
                        to let me know.

           He looks almost helplessly across the empty office.

                                 ALMA
                        Come on.

           She gently takes his arm.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Powell looks exhausted, a spent force. He loosens his tie. 
           Alma straightens it again. Before he can react, the elevator 
           doors open --

           INT. LOBBY

           The place is packed. The entire State Department staff. A 
           “THANK YOU” banner hangs from a crowded mezzanine balcony.

           As Powell steps out of the elevator, a mighty CHEER goes up. 
           He looks overwhelmed. Alma is beaming.

           The crowd parts, letting him through to where a small podium 
           has been set up. He steps up onto it. Everyone quiets down.

                                 POWELL
                        I know the last thing you want to 
                        hear from me now is another speech.

           Some nervous LAUGHTER. But it wasn’t really meant as a joke.

                        So let me just say this. I leave 
                        this post after forty years of 
                        government service. Thirty-five of 
                        those years were in the United 
                        States Army. I am proud that I have 
                        had this chance to serve my country 
                        once again. I am proud to have 
                        served with all of you. You are the 
                        foot soldiers in the battalion.
                (beat)
                        Now get back to work.

           APPLAUSE and CHEERS as he steps down into the crowd. Armitage 
           is there. Wilkerson. A hug from Amy. And as he accepts the 
           well-wishes of his staff, the following words appear:

           “COLIN POWELL’S SPEECH AT THE U.N. WAS WIDELY CREDITED WITH 
           SHIFTING PUBLIC OPINION IN THE UNITED STATES IN FAVOR OF WAR.

           SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, ACKNOWLEDGING 
           THAT NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION HAD BEEN FOUND IN IRAQ, 
           POWELL CALLED THE SPEECH A “BLOT” ON HIS RECORD.

           ON OCTOBER 19TH 2008, POWELL APPEARED ON “MEET THE PRESS” TO 
           ENDORSE BARACK OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT.

           HIS APPROVAL RATINGS WENT THROUGH THE ROOF.”
