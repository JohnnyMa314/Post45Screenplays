           A BLACK SCREEN. We hear the thundering of a steam train 
           clawing along twisted rails. Smoke coughing out in angry, 
           asthmatic bursts. Railcars creaking.

           The train we’re on bursts out of a tunnel and -

                                                         LIGHT REVEALS:

           I/E. PRISONER RAIL CAR/FREIGHT TRAIN - DAY

           NICK LOWELL (30) sits huddled, hands bound in a dark, packed, 
           rattling prisoner car. Face bruised and clothes stained with 
           sweat and filth. He is sinewy, hungry, eyes like a wolf.

           Emaciated JAPANESE PRISONERS fill the car. They stare at 
           Nick. He ignores them. Looks out a slat in the railcar:

           Thirsty summer dirt and tall, waving grass. POOR FARMERS 
           carry sacks along an unpaved road. They look hungry too.

           A title appears, superimposed in large, white letters:

                                         小阪
                                        OSAKA

           EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN DEPOT - SAKAI - DAY

           SHEEEK. Railcar doors grind open to reveal the car full of 
           prisoners. PRISON GUARDS shout and unmercifully yank 
           prisoners from the car, herding them like cattle.

           Nick is one of the last to be pulled out. As he staggers down 
           to the dry earth, the guards can’t help but stare at his dirt-
           spattered, unshaven, WHITE FACE.

           Nick puts his head down and falls in line silently. Doing his 
           best to blend in. Which is to say not at all.

           A YOUNG GUARD ties Nick’s already bound hands to the ROPE the 
           other prisoners are attached to.

           And then conical STRAW SHROUDS are pulled over the prisoners’ 
           heads. Including Nick. He can’t see shit. The line moves.

           An endless march of blind prisoners following the sound of 
           shuffling feet.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. OSAKA PRISON - PROCESSING - DAY

           THE STRAW SHROUD IS LIFTED OFF NICK’S HEAD AND HE CAN SEE:

           He’s in a PRISON processing area. Dirty cement walls. Guards 
           shouting at prisoners as the straw hats are roughly removed.

           The guards shout more commands in Japanese and the prisoners 
           do as they’re told: they quickly disrobe.

           Nick strips down. And as he pulls off his clothes, he can’t 
           help but notice others looking - apparently curious about the 
           rumors of the bigger Caucasian penis.

           One by one, nude prisoners step forward to have their open 
           mouths searched by a PAIR OF GUARDS.

           An ALCOHOLIC PRISONER with a pitted face looks over Nick’s 
           shoulder and down at his dick. He turns to the others, 
           mutters something.

           Prisoners laugh.

           Guards SHOUT. The prisoners shut up. It’s Nick’s turn.

           He steps forward. Dozens of untrusting eyes watch as the 
           guards search his cheeks. One of the guards is taken aback as 
           he notices Nick’s arm.

           HIS ENTIRE SHOULDER IS HORRIBLY SCARRED as if his flesh was 
           at one point carved and ripped open.

           Nick makes inadvertent eye contact with the guard. The scar 
           holds a dark story and the guard knows it. But he just writes 
           in his ledger and gives Nick his new name:

                                 PROCESSING GUARD
                        <1-4-1-0.>

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CELL BLOCK - OSAKA PRISON - NIGHT

           “1410” on his back, in prison fatigues now, Nick walks down 
           the cell block single file with FOUR PRISONERS. A GUARD walks 
           alongside, escorting them to their respective cells. Each 
           prisoner carries his own ratty futon mat. They trudge ahead. 
           Nick seems to be the only one surprised as he sees:

           A MOUSE EATS ANOTHER DEAD MOUSE.

                                 GUARD (O.C.)
                        <1410!>
           Nick’s cell door. Three-inch thick steel with a barred slot 
           for the guards to see in.

           K-CHACK! The guard unlocks it. Nick steps in hesitantly.

           INT. PRISON CELL - CONTINUOUS

           He BOWS slightly to the guard, as he’s seen the others do.

           The guard shouts at him. And Nick must understand because, 
           humiliated, he bows deeper.

           The guard smiles, enjoys the degradation.

           K-CHACK! He locks Nick in utter darkness.

           The details of his room lost to the black, Nick unfolds his 
           stained mat, lays down and embraces sleep like a woman he 
           hasn’t seen in years.

                                                              DARKNESS.

           INT. PRISON CELL - OSAKA PRISON - MORNING

           SHOUTING. The gray light of dawn. Nick struggles to wake and 
           suddenly TWO GUARDS are yanking him up onto his knees. 
           Screaming at Nick maniacally in Japanese.

           Disoriented, Nick kneels as they want him to. In the proper 
           position: feet under his ass; back straight; eyes forward.

                                 GUARD
                        <1410!>

           Nick gives the awkward half-nod-half-bow that’s typical of 
           confused Westerners in Japan.

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        <1171!>

           Nick turns to realize he has a CELL MATE. Kneeling on the mat 
           next to him. But not bowing. In time, we will know him as -

           KIYOSHI. Smart but violent. Honorable but unforgiving. His 
           stare is unblinking apathy.

           K-CHACK! They slam the cell door shut. Nick tries to engage 
           his cellmate, but Kiyoshi won’t even acknowledge him.

           Instead, Kiyoshi moves on his knees to the door, lifts the 
           food slot hatch and pulls out -
           A SMALL BENTO TIN.

           Kiyoshi lowers his head over his meal. Praying or something. 
           Starving, impatient, Nick grabs his own tin from the slot -

           OVER-COOKED RICE. SALTED FISH. SOME KIND OF BOILED ROOT.

           HE ATTACKS THE FOOD like an animal, barely chewing. In 
           seconds, his dirty fingernails are digging the last bits of 
           rice from the corners of the bento box. Done.

           Still hungry, he takes in his cell for the first time:

           No windows. No chairs. Just a dank cement room with a rusted 
           hole that serves as a toilet. He looks back at Kiyoshi.

           Still not eating. Not yet. Kiyoshi holds the fish up by its 
           tail. Inspecting it. Slow, creeping revulsion overcomes Nick.

           MAGGOTS.

           Kiyoshi puts the fish down. He starts to eat his rice.

           Nick looks down at his empty tray.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

           BZZZZ BZ BZ BZZZZZ. The incessant patterned buzzing of 
           cicadas. The unique rhythm of the Kansai region.

           K-CHUNK. Shovels cut into hard dirt. The prisoners sweat on a 
           rural road, digging a massive trough for a sewer line.

           Nick works. Pale, nauseous and weak from his breakfast.

           A GUARD SHOUTS. On command, the prisoners stop digging 
           abruptly and all face the ditch, heads down as -

           A TWELVE YEAR-OLD GIRL APPROACHES. PUSHING A BICYCLE.

           The guards face her, stand at attention. Standard procedure. 
           For her safety. And because she’s above the prisoners.

           She’s pretty. Lost in the shy innocence of youth. 
           Uncomfortable with the attention. Her bike has a flat tire.

           Quietly, the LANKY PRISONER next to Nick turns his head. He 
           watches her sweat through her schoolgirl uniform. And he 
           fucks her roughly with his eyes. She sees him looking. So -

           He licks the air like he would her clitoris. TONGUE flicking.
           Violated, she looks away. Acknowledging it would be more 
           degrading. She just pushes her bike, head down. Cicadas BUZZ.

           The guards are oblivious. The pedophile sees Nick staring 
           hard back at him. But he ignores Nick and just turns back to 
           the trough. No one else seems to care.

           They all just look down. Kiyoshi too.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHANGING ROOM - OSAKA PRISON - DAY

           The cicada buzz has been replaced by the LOUD HUMMING of the 
           massive laundry machines outside the CHANGING ROOM.

           A guard walks along rows of lockers, checking prisoners as -

           Nick changes into prison fatigues amid lockers and other 
           prisoners. The guard is at the far end of the room, Nick’s 
           locker row unwatched. A few prisoners down his bench:

           The pedophile smells his dirty clothes, breathes deep as if 
           hunting for the young girl’s smell. Nick turns, surprised as -

           SOMEONE moves toward the pedophile. It happens fast -

           BAM! The pedophile’s feet KICK against a locker as he is 
           grabbed from behind, hair pulled -

           SHIK! BROKEN GLASS JAMMED into his open mouth -

           SCREAMING. He FALLS - BLOOD pours out in pulses - he drools 
           out BLOOD-SLICK GLASS along with -

           HIS SEVERED TONGUE. And his attacker stands over him:

           KIYOSHI.

           GUARDS ARRIVE. UNGODLY TONGUELESS SCREAMS come out of the man 
           as he writhes. The guards see the severed tongue. The glass.

           And KIYOSHI. “Helping” the pedophile up now.

                                 GUARD
                        <What the fuck happened here!?>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <He had glass in his mouth!>

           Unsatisfied, the guard turns to another prisoner:
                                 GUARD
                        <WHAT HAPPENED!?>

           The PRISONER looks at Kiyoshi. Stares at:

           A GLIMPSE OF A TATTOO, barely peeking out from under 
           Kiyoshi’s sleeve. He knows better than to speak up and -

           CRACK! The guard BACKHANDS HIM HARD. That’s when the guard 
           catches Nick staring at him, eye contact.

                                 NICK
                        Nobody saw anything.

                                 GUARD
                        <You look me in the eye?>

           Nick breaks eye contact, looks away. The guard boils:

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        <You were next to him, you let hide 
                        a shiv in his mouth?>
                             (to all, explodes)
                        <If he can’t eat, none of you eat. 
                        Two days, no meals!>
                             (re: the pedophile)
                        <Which one’s this?>

                                 SECOND GUARD
                        <1021... serving 2 years for rape.>

                                 GUARD
                        <Put him in solitary.>

           Prisoners glare at Nick as they’re forced to file out.

           INT. CELL BLOCK - OSAKA PRISON - EVENING

           Nick walks in line down the block, hungry prisoners all 
           giving him the evil eye. He notices now just how bony and 
           underfed these men are. And he walks by a familiar sight -

           The dead mouse has been stripped clean of flesh. Suddenly it 
           clicks. Nick is a marked man. He steals a look back -

           Kiyoshi walks several prisoners behind him, apathetic.

           INT. PRISON CELL - OSAKA PRISON - SAME

           Nighttime. Darkness.
           Whispers. Nick flutters awake in the middle of the night. 
           Lying still, he steals a glance toward the door:

           KIYOSHI CROUCHES, sliding A FOLDED PAPER under the door. A 
           NOTE. Someone pulls it from the other side. And then -

           Footsteps fade away. Kiyoshi moves quietly back to his dirty 
           mat and as he lies down -

           HE LOCKS EYES WITH NICK. Each of them caught by the other. A 
           tense moment. Kiyoshi stares, unblinking.

           But Nick just rolls back onto his side. No words. Fuck him.

           EXT. SEPTIC DITCH - DAY

           A pit around a BROKEN SEWER MAIN along a dirty Sakai road. 
           Prisoners shovel mud and shit. Weak. Hungry.

           A PRISONER PASSES OUT right next to Nick. No one responds.

           A GUARD SMIRKS as he slowly devours a RICE BALL. And the 
           prisoners steal deadly glances at Nick. He ignores them.

           LATER

           Guards SHOUT. End of the work day. The prisoners line up 
           along the ridge overlooking the deep septic pit. Shit and 
           filth teems below, stewing under the sun.

           Guards SHOUT again. Nick and the others start walking. And -

           THUD! Someone SLAMS NICK HARD and he goes off-balance, down 
           the ridge, riding slick mud down to a HARD LANDING in a 
           swirling pool of feces and urine. Human shit in his nostrils.

           He looks back up at the ridge -

           The prisoners smile down at him, the humiliated outsider. 
           Nick is fury. And he sees the one who pushed him:

           A WIRY, BIG-FOREHEADED, COLD-EYED BASTARD.

           Guards SHOUT at Nick for slipping. He has to bow as he climbs 
           back up, bathed in shit.

           Guards SHOUTING again. Ordering Nick to the back of line. On 
           his way he passes Kiyoshi. Who doesn’t even look Nick in the 
           eyes. An utter lack of respect.
           INT. SHOWERS - OSAKA PRISON - DAY

           SSSSHH - the SHOWERS run as prisoners herd single file toward 
           them. One by one, they disrobe and toss their clothes in a 
           bin. Then they have just 60 seconds to shower before being 
           ordered ahead so other prisoners can take their turn. Cattle.

           NICK’s turn to disrobe.

           He can see the man who pushed him in the showers ahead. He 
           lowers his head shamefully. Cowardly. But then, as Nick 
           disrobes, we watch HIS HANDS:

           He balls up his shirt, caked with shit, clutches it in his 
           fist. Anxious. Anticipating it...

                                 GUARD
                        Tsugi!

           Nick’s turn.

           SSSSSSSHHHH. Nothing but the sound of the showers now. He 
           steps forward. Heart beating through his chest. A guard sees 
           the shirt in his hand. Yells.

           NICK. Ignores the guard, if he can even hear him. Stares at -

           THAT FUCKER IN THE SHOWER. Grips the shirt tighter in a fist. 
           Walks past the available shower he was supposed to stop at.

           GUARDS SHOUT MADLY -

           The asshole turns, sees Nick and -

           NICK JUMPS HIM. THROWS THE SHIT-COVERED SHIRT AROUND HIM HARD 
           AND FAST, PULLING IT VIOLENTLY BETWEEN HIS TEETH.

           The fucker fights back, kicking, hitting but -

           NICK TWISTS HARD WITH THE SHIRT IN ONE HAND, with the other -

           HE CLAWS AT THE FUCKER’S EYES. BRUTAL. The guy’s punching 
           Nick hard in the head over and over but Nick doesn’t even 
           feel it. He just digs his fingers into the guys eyes as -

           NICK SHOVES THE SHIT COVERED SHIRT DEEP IN THE GUY’S MOUTH -

           GUARDS SWARM HIM. IT TAKES FIVE OF THEM TO PULL HIM OFF.

           Everyone stares in shock as the guards drag Nick away, saliva 
           roping from his mouth like a wild dog, bare feet streaking 
           shit across shower floors. His victim bleeding from the eyes.

           SSSSSHHHH. Blood snakes toward the shower drains.
           INT. CELL BLOCK - OSAKA PRISON - MOMENTS LATER

           Guards drag Nick down the block. Prisoners in line for work 
           duty stare as he passes - naked, hands slick with blood.

           And Nick is dragged all the way to -

           INT. THE PRISON KITCHEN

           The prison kitchen is a place of steam, grease and grime. The 
           guards drag Nick past boiling pots and prison cooks, to a 
           large STORE ROOM:

           It’s empty but for ONE MAN. Standing patiently, like he’s 
           been waiting here all day -

           THE DEPUTY WARDEN (THE DW). His hair is perfectly slicked 
           across his scalp. Pants creased. Shoulders crisp. As 
           regimented in appearance as he is in life.

           The guards force Nick to his knees, stand behind him and shut 
           the door. And then a long silence.

           The DW studies Nick’s face. His bloody hands.

           He turns to the HEAD GUARD. They speak for a good 15 seconds. 
           Then the DW turns to Nick and seems to ask a direct question. 
           But we have no clue if Nick understands it, because:

                                 NICK
                        I don’t speak Japanese.

                                 DEPUTY WARDEN
                        No Japonisu?

           Nick shakes his head no. Silence. The DW just stares at him. 
           Eyes dissecting. Waiting for something. And then it comes...

           THE DOOR OPENS.

           GUARDS drag a man in, force the man to his knees beside Nick.

           KIYOSHI. And then the guards escort someone else in, on foot:

           ANOTHER GUARD. He’s terrified. Can’t bring his eyes to meet 
           the Deputy Warden’s. The DW makes a subtle signal to the head 
           guard. Who steps forward and produces from his jacket pocket:

           A HANDWRITTEN NOTE. The one Kiyoshi slipped under the door.

           The scared guard lowers his head, guilty. The DW smiles.
           He looks from the guard to Kiyoshi. Who just stares forward. 
           And then the DW turns to Nick. Signals for the head guard to 
           bring the note right in front of Nick’s face.

                                 DEPUTY WARDEN
                        Kore wa nan desu-ka?

           Tense now, Nick knows damn well what he’s being asked. But -

                                 NICK
                        ...I don’t speak Japanese.

           Nick stares past the note. The DW turns to his head guard.

           Who SHOUTS out to the kitchen.

           IN THE KITCHEN: A GUARD DIPS A LADLE INTO A BUBBLING OIL POT.

           ON NICK. The guard approaches behind him, brings the full, 
           smoking ladle into the store room, careful not to spill. He 
           stands behind Nick. Nick breathes faster. Last chance...

                                 DEPUTY WARDEN
                        Kore wa nan desu-ka?

           Nick stares into the middle distance. Shaking now -

                                 NICK
                        I don’t speak Japanese.

           The DW nods and -

           SHISSSSSS! BOILING OIL POURS DOWN NICK’S BACK. SKIN BLISTERS 
           AND BLEEDS. NICK SCREAMS. The guard stops pouring.

           The DW is unaffected. The head guard pulls Nick’s hair, 
           forcing him to look at the note. Nick just drools in pain.

                                 DEPUTY WARDEN
                        ...Kore wa nan desu-ka?

           Blood runs down Nick’s back. In perfect Japanese now:

                                 NICK
                        <I don’t speak Japanese.>

           The DW smiles. He BARKS AN ORDER. GUARDS DRAG NICK AWAY.

           Kiyoshi watches him go. Can’t believe it. His turn now.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT - NIGHT

           Darkness. Labored breathing. A small door slides open, 
           casting dim light on NICK. The light is blinding to him after 
           days of darkness. He sits weak, pale and wasting away in a 
           solitary cell the size of a small refrigerator.

           He’s bound tightly by thin ropes. It’s hojojutsu - feudal 
           rope bondage. A rope is wrapped cruelly around his neck so 
           that if he were to move even an inch, he’d choke himself.

           A guard looks in through the small doorway. Asks something of 
           Nick in Japanese. But Nick just looks down, choosing not to 
           answer.

           The door slides shut again, leaving him in dark misery.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CELL BLOCK - OSAKA PRISON - EVENING

           Nick is escorted by two guards down the cell block. Emaciated 
           now, the prisoners on the block look at him differently. They 
           avoid eye contact, in either deference or fear.

           INT. PRISON CELL - EVENING

           Nick enters his cell. Surprised to find KIYOSHI inside, 
           looking weaker but either his punishment was less harsh or he 
           survived it more admirably. Nick turns to face the guard and -

           BOWS DEEPLY, sarcastic exaggeration.

           The cell door SHUTS. And Nick sits feebly on his mat. 
           Silence. Nick avoids looking at Kiyoshi out of disgust. The 
           guy owes him and here he sits, just staring at -

           THE FOOD SLOT. The sound of food arriving. Kiyoshi slides 
           toward the slot on his knees. Opens it. Turns back -

           He holds TWO BENTO TRAYS. He hands one to Nick. Nick takes 
           it, confused by the courtesy. And then -

           Kiyoshi briefly examines Nick’s tray. Nods. Safe to eat. No 
           maggots. Nick nods awkwardly in thanks. And then, starving, 
           he eats. Kiyoshi just watches. His English is surprisingly 
           good but spoken with a strong accent:

                                 KIYOSHI
                        You speak Japanese?
                                 NICK
                             (voice raw)
                        You speak English.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        The man you fight is out of prison. 
                        In hospital. You make him blind.

           Nick seems unaffected. He just goes back to eating. And as he 
           finishes his rice, Kiyoshi slides his own tray to Nick.

           Nick is taken aback. A small gesture that means everything.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        This place is hell.

                                 NICK
                        It’s better than out there. ‘Least 
                        in my experience. <Here is good.>

           Kiyoshi quietly lifts his mat. Nick stops eating and stares 
           at what’s hidden underneath it: A SMALL KNIFE.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        The man you fight is out of prison.
                             (off Nick’s confusion)
                        Prison doctors can not fix bad 
                        things.

                                 NICK
                        Like knife wounds?

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Like seppuku.

           Guards’ footsteps. They stare at each other, silent. And as 
           the footsteps clack, Kiyoshi demonstrates “seppuku”. He mimes 
           slicing across his own abdomen.

           There’s a desperation in his eyes. A humanness he hasn’t 
           shown before. It’s trust.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

           The quiet dead of the night. And then a rustling. Kiyoshi 
           rouses Nick and Nick sits up, ready.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        If I cut too deep... cut my throat.

           Nick nods. Kiyoshi leans forward -
           Wraps his hand behind Nick’s head. Forehead to forehead. Nick 
           grabs Kiyoshi’s head so that they mirror each other. This is 
           a vow. A bond.

                                 NICK
                        You’re not gonna die.
                             (an attempt at levity)
                        Unless you fuck up.

           Kiyoshi smirks, lets go of Nick.

           Cross-legged, he unbuttons his shirt, peels it off. Through 
           darkness, we barely make out that his back, arms and chest 
           are covered with:

           ORNATE YAKUZA TATTOOS. DENSE GREEN AND BLUE. SNAKE SCALES.

           Nick stares, curious, as Kiyoshi folds his shirt perfectly, 
           places it beside him and -

           He takes THE KNIFE. Holds it in front of his belly. Peaceful. 
           He breathes. Slow in, slow out. And -

           HE DRAGS THE KNIFE DEEP ACROSS HIS ABDOMEN -

           Kiyoshi starts hyperventilating, his body losing control. 
           Panic sets in. Nick goes alert as Kiyoshi drops the knife. 
           BLOOD RUNNING FAST - KIYOSHI SPITS WORDS -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Oh fuck! Fuck!>

           Nick moves fast, checking Kiyoshi’s slashed open abdomen. 
           Blood gushing out in the black of night but -

                                 NICK
                        You’re okay!

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Kill me! Kill me!>

           Kiyoshi reaches for the knife but Nick kicks it away and 
           BOLTS to the door - POUNDING at it, SCREAMING -

                                 NICK
                        TASUKETE!!! TASUKETE!!

           Seconds pass, blood pools out under Kiyoshi. He’s foaming mad 
           - screaming in Japanese now, ordering Nick to kill him. But -

           GUARDS BUST IN, turn on the light - see Kiyoshi bleeding out -

                                 NICK
                        He fuckin’ cut himself!
           The guards SHOVE NICK out of the way, GRABBING KIYOSHI - 
           pulling him away, blood streaking -

           A guard stays behind - SHOUTS at Nick and Nick does as 
           ordered: he kneels, hands on his knees. And he watches 
           Kiyoshi SCREAM as he’s dragged down the cell block.

           THE GUARD PICKS UP THE BLOOD-COVERED KNIFE. Looks at Nick’s 
           hands: no blood. Innocent. It was seppuku.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PRISON CELL - DAYS LATER - DAWN

           SHOUTING. Nick snaps up, alert. Dawn. He’s used to the 
           process now, kneels perfectly as the guards shout -

                                 GUARD
                        <1410! 1487!>

           Nick looks lifelike again after weeks of recovery. His new 
           CELLMATE’s mat soiled by the fading red-brown stain of blood.

           INT. CELL BLOCK - OSAKA PRISON - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick walks in line down the cell block. His cellmate watches 
           a MOUSE skitter down the hall. The survivor. Nick ignores it.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

           Nick sweats, shoveling. The prisoners give him a 
           conspicuously wide berth. An exhausted prisoner accidentally 
           tosses part of his shovelful of dirt in Nick’s direction.

           He bows immediately, overly apologetic. Respect and fear.

           GUARDS SHOUT. The prisoners drop shovels. End of the day -

           INT. CHANGING ROOM - OSAKA PRISON - DAY

           The prisoners dress under the watch of guards. And as Nick 
           pulls his shirt on, a guard arrives from the hall -

                                 GUARD
                        <1410!>

           He waits for Nick to come with him.
           INT. THE WARDEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nick is escorted into a large, pristine office. A man sits 
           behind the expansive desk, looking down at paperwork until a 
           guard stands at attention, heels clicking quietly -

           THE WARDEN looks up from his desk. Balding, thick glasses. 
           He’s paunchy, meek-looking. At odds with the brutality of the 
           world he oversees. He looks at Nick, seems confused, and 
           turns to one of the guards who brought the white man in:

                                 THE WARDEN
                        <1410?>

                                 GUARD
                        Hai.

           The warden shakes off his confusion, signals, and as the 
           guards step back, Nick sees - against the wall -

           THE DEPUTY WARDEN. Humbly, he approaches Nick. Carrying a 
           pile of FRESH CLOTHES. He gently hands the pile to Nick. And 
           before Nick can even process what’s going on, the Deputy 
           Warden takes a step back. Stands at attention. And -

           HE BOWS. Eyes down, respectful.

           He stands back up. Takes a step back, to the wall. And the 
           warden waves his hand, dismissing them all. The guards bow, 
           turn, and escort Nick out. But not before Nick sees a PAPER-
           WRAPPED GIFT on the Warden’s desk, A PLAIN BLACK SILK BOW.

           EXT. OSAKA PRISON - DAY

           Nick exits the massive, cement block of a prison in a clean 
           pressed shirt and pants. Guards bow and - K-CHUNK! - close 
           the door behind him. In front of him -

           A PARKED 1953 CHEVY BEL AIR. A sparkling American behemoth.

           A YOUNG JAPANESE MAN leans against the car, waiting by the 
           open back door. He wears SUNGLASSES and a suit that costs as 
           much as the car. He just stares at Nick, chewing gum.

           Nick approaches tentatively. Sees ANOTHER MAN in the driver’s 
           seat. Might as well be this guy’s big-boned cousin.

           EXT. BLACK MARKET STREET - JUSO, OSAKA - EVENING

           The Juso black market is buzzing not with cicadas but with 
           crawling, urban humanity. 
           Wooden shacks selling everything that isn’t strapped down are 
           crammed into the flashing cement city growing around them. 
           The squeak of bicycles and the growl of cars. Kimonos and 
           suits. Electric light everywhere.

           Women roam in threes and men prowl in packs of fifteen. Crime 
           and vice meet everyday life. This is the real Osaka.

           The Bel Air pulls into a narrow black market street and just 
           stops, idling. Traffic behind it has to wait as -

           Pedestrians clear the way, recognizing Nick’s escorts as 
           shatei (low-level “little brothers”). The shatei escort Nick, 
           pressing through people, shacks, alleys. Noise and movement.

           A NINETEEN YEAR-OLD HOOKER gives Nick the I-need-it-now look - 
           why else would a white guy be here? But he’s dragged along -

           Toward a WOODEN BUILDING behind it all. Dark in a back alley. 
           They take Nick up stairs on the side of the building. To a 
           second floor entrance -

           INT. MATSUOKA FAMILY HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           They stop in an ANTEROOM where TWO YAKUZA sit guarding a 
           door, HANDGUNS casually in their laps. The escort in 
           sunglasses turns to Nick.

                                 SUNGLASSES
                        Kotoba ni kiwotsukero.

                                 NICK
                        <I don’t understand.>

           Sunglasses just chews his gum, fixes Nick’s lapel like he’s 
           an embarrassment. And then he gestures for the guards to get 
           out of the way. He KNOCKS on the door -

           A voice shouts inside. And he slides the door open -

           INT. OFFICE - “THE SMOKE ROOM” - CONTINUOUS

           SIX MEN sit around a table. The room is filled with smoke, 
           all of it coming from one man -

           AKIHIRO MATSUOKA. Oyabun of the Matsuoka crime family. Late 
           fifties. His eyes are heavy and unflinching. They have seen 
           more death than life and they don’t prefer one to the other.
           He wears a yukata (cheap cotton kimono). The men around him 
           wear suits, jackets off and sleeves rolled up to fight the 
           humidity. And the man sitting directly next to him has his 
           shirt open to his navel: 

           KIYOSHI. Bandages across his gut. He smiles slyly at Nick. 
           Akihiro drags his cigarette as the men wait for him to speak.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <You speak Japanese?>

                                 NICK
                        <A little.>

           Akihiro looks at one of the men at the table: EIICHI - in his 
           forties, the family’s kaikei (accountant). His English is 
           decent and he translates as Akihiro speaks:

                                 EIICHI/AKIHIRO
                        You are soldier?

                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 EIICHI/AKIHIRO
                        Businessman?

                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <You just come out of your mom’s 
                        pussy today?>

           Eiichi doesn’t know how to translate that one. So:

                                 EIICHI
                        What are you?

                                 NICK
                        I was a prisoner until about two 
                        hours ago.

                        Why a prisoner?

                                 EIICHI
                        He says you are a stray dog. No 
                        loyalty.

                                 NICK
                        Is that a bad thing?

                                 AKIHIRO
                             (signals Eiichi to stop)
                        <What’s your name?>

                                 NICK
                        Nick.

           Nick sees the typical Japanese confusion at hearing a Western 
           name that ends in a consonant. He repeats it for them:

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Nikku.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Kiyoshi says you tried to rip a 
                        man’s eyes out of his head.>

           Akihiro can see that Nick is hesitant to speak. He turns to 
           Eiichi, who picks up, deadly serious:

                                 EIICHI
                        Are you patoriotiku?

                                 NICK
                        Patriotic?

                                 EIICHI
                        For Amerika.

                                 NICK
                        No. If you’re talking about 
                        Nagasaki or somethin’... like I 
                        said, I’m not a soldier.
                             (beat)
                        Why?

           A voice GROWLS from the table. OROCHI - late twenties, sharp 
           and cool. He exudes sex and violence. He’s Elvis, if Elvis’ 
           first guitar was a .38 revolver.

                                 OROCHI
                        <Why isn’t important, okay buddy?>

           Akihiro puts a hand out to silence Orochi. And he answers 
           Nick’s question with another question:
                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Do you need money?>

           Nick’s hungry, disheveled stare answers for him.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <We have a job that pays 50,000 
                        yen. It’s just one day.>

                                 EIICHI
                        You understand what he say?

                                 NICK
                        Yes.

           He nods to Akihiro. Tries to hide his eagerness but everyone 
           sees it. Eiichi writes on a SMALL SLIP, which he hands to the 
           bigger of the shatei who brought Nick in, the driver - along 
           with an order:

                                 EIICHI
                        <Bring him back up here tomorrow.>

           The shatei lead Nick away. But Orochi calls after them -

                                 OROCHI
                        <And tell him to take some fucking 
                        Japanese lessons.>

           Nick stops on a dime, turns and looks Orochi in the eye. 
           Flawless Japanese. A haiku recitation:

                                 NICK
                        <O snail - climb Mount Fuji - but 
                        slowly, slowly.>

           And he exits with his escorts, leaving Kiyoshi amused.

           INT. MATSUOKA GAMBLING HALL - NIGHT

           The sound of rough Japanese jazz and humanity grows loud as 
           the shatei walk Nick down steep stairs to -

           A GAMBLING ROOM. The place is packed. Degenerate, red-faced 
           gamblers who can’t handle their liquor choke on cigar smoke 
           while young girls serve beer and smiles to keep them spending 
           money they don’t have. Nick is led to -

           THE CASHIER. The big-boned shatei hands over Eiichi’s slip 
           and within seconds, the cashier is counting out 25,000 yen.
                                 BIG-BONES
                        <Stay at the Uma-Raida Inn. If they 
                        make you pay, we’ll get the money 
                        back. Understand?>

                                 NICK
                        What’s your name?

           Big Bones just stares back, cold. Nick hands him 500 yen.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for picking me up.

                        Arigatou, Satoru-san.

           Satoru leaves. And Nick turns, pocketing his cash -

           THUD! He bumps right into a GIRL that could charge him for 
           the privilege. Twenty years old, jet black hair up to show 
           off a thin neck. Her thick lips done-up red for work and it 
           does work cause they’re about all he can look at.

           Somehow she doesn’t spill her tray, full of bottles -

                                 NICK
                        Sorry.

                                 HER
                        American beer? It’s one-hundred.

           She bites her lip. She knows what she’s doing and so does 
           Nick but that’s okay.

                                 NICK
                        I only got big bills.

                                 HER
                        It’s okay.

           He takes a beer. Hands her 1,000 yen. Expects change but she 
           takes the money, smiles, turns her ass and walks off.

           He watches her go flirt with customers. Somehow it was worth 
           the money. Nick swigs the beer. Tastes like piss. He leaves.

           EXT. OSAKA ROAD - DAY

           A new summer day. Bicycles everywhere. A SKY BLUE ‘53 BUICK 
           SUPER pushes through it all.
           I/E. ‘52 BUICK SUPER - SAME

           Nick sits in back. Kiyoshi next to him. Mid-conversation.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        They sell at half cost of our 
                        companies and they will not pay us 
                        for protection. If it was Japanese 
                        company, it would be easy, but 
                        Americans are first class citizen 
                        in Osaka. You can not touch them if 
                        you are Japanese.

                                 NICK
                        So you just want me to talk to 
                        these guys? And say what?

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Make him understand they cannot 
                        sell cheap in Osaka. Or he has to 
                        pay us. We fix problems police can 
                        not fix. That is yakuza.

                                 NICK
                        What if he says no?

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Talk louder.>

           I/E. ‘53 BUICK SUPER - FACTORY ROW, CITY OUTSKIRTS - LATER

           The Super pulls to a stop on a shaded industrial road on the 
           Osaka outskirts, up the Yodo river. Out here, you can hear 
           the cicadas again. Nick looks out, staking out the area.

           Time to go but he sees Kiyoshi’s bandages. One last question.

                                 NICK
                        How’s your stomach?

           Kyoshi sees a takoyaki cart in the road. Serving up steaming, 
           fried octopus meat for a short line of dock workers.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Hungry. <Go.>

           Nick climbs out. And the Buick u-turns away.
           EXT. FACTORY ROW - CITY OUTSKIRTS - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick walks the filthy street. A side of Osaka we haven’t seen 
           yet. The industrial docks. Streets filled with trash and 
           sleeping vagrants. Urban poverty. He rounds a corner -

           A RIVERSIDE WAREHOUSE ahead. American flag over the entrance.

           INT. SHEET METAL WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Nick is escorted past sheet metal palettes by an eighteen 
           year-old AMERICAN KID. Eager, happy to see another American.

                                 AMERICAN KID
                        If you’re lookin’ for a job he pays 
                        kinda cheap cause the Japs around 
                        here’ll work for nuthin’, y’know -

                                 NICK
                        I’m not lookin’ for a job.

                                 AMERICAN KID
                        Oh okay, you got a company or - ?

                                 NICK
                        I’m here about a contract.

                                 AMERICAN KID
                        Crazy, man. I got ya.

           The kid stops at a door at the back of the warehouse floor. 
           Blinds shut. “A. PANETTI - PRESIDENT”. The kid knocks.

                                 ANTHONY PANETTI (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 AMERICAN KID
                        Mr. Panetti, I got a guy out here

                                 ANTHONY PANETTI (O.S.)

           INT. PANETTI’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           ANTHONY PANETTI is in his mid-thirties. Fat off too much 
           money and too much free time. He studies Nick.

                                 ANTHONY PANETTI
                        Look, I’m sure you got respect for 
                        these people cause they all wear 
                        fuckin’ silk pajamas and they bow 
                        like you’re the fuckin’ sun god 
                        when they serve you coffee. But 
                        frankly, I don’t care about their 
                        rules or their tradition or 
                        whatever the fuck you’re here to 
                        explain to me.

           Nick just stares at this guy. Doesn’t like him.

                        gives me metal at two cents a cubic 
                        yard. They got that metal from

                        these fuckers built to sneak attack 
                        us. Excuse me if the Japs gotta buy

                        You know my name? You know me?

           Panetti shakes his head no.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Cause I know who you are, Tony. I 
                        know where you work every day. You 
                        said you grew up in Elmhurst? I got 
                        friends there too. These slanty-
                        eyed cops can’t arrest someone if 
                        they don’t know who they are or 
                        where to find them. And they don’t 
                        arrest a white man unless he does 
                        something really bad. You still 
                        hear me okay?
           Panetti nods.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Now when my friends come here and 
                        ask you to pay them what you owe 
                        them - and I know you can afford it 
                        you fat, rich motherfucker - you 
                        can go ahead and call the cops on 
                        them. But I’ll still be out there. 
                        And you’ll have a new typewriter.

           Nick fishes out Panetti’s wallet. Takes all his cash. And he 
           leaves Panetti there bleeding as he walks out.

           EXT. FACTORY ROW - CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           Adrenaline pumping, Nick hands Panetti’s cash to one of the 
           vagrants on the curb. And he rounds the dusty corner to -

           THE BUICK SUPER. Kiyoshi watches Nick storm towards the car. 
           The same rage he had in prison. Nick climbs in. Breath short, 
           wiping blood on his shirt. Sees Kiyoshi staring at him.

                                 NICK
                        I had to talk loud.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CROWDED STREET - MINAMI, OSAKA - NIGHT

           Nick and Kiyoshi walk a crowded Minami sidewalk at night. 
           Lights sell sex and drinks and Kiyoshi walks Nick down a 
           flight of stairs, music growling, to a basement club -

           INT. “RED BAR” - ROCK CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           AMERICAN ROCK MUSIC - Bill Haley’s CRAZY MAN, CRAZY - blasts 
           on a record player. It’s deafening and Kiyoshi gets gin 
           drinks for him and Nick.

           Nothing but Japanese faces and they’re all dressed like 
           extras in Rebel Without A Cause, dancing to music that came 
           out in the US less than a year ago. Culture clash.

           Nick and Kiyoshi have to shout to hear each other.

                                 NICK
                             (pulling out cash re: gin)
                        How much?
                                 KIYOSHI
                        Akihiro owns this place.

                                 NICK
                        That’s your boss? Akihiro?

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Akihiro Matsuoka. He’s been yakuza 
                        for forty years. Killed fifteen 
                        people. He owns this street to the 
                        Yodogawa. The rest belongs to Seizu 
                        family. Enemy yakuza. Drink.

           Nick downs his entire glass.

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        You fucked up today. <”Violence

                        No one told me any rules.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        You’re gaijin. Outsider. The rules 
                        are not for you.

                                 NICK
                        Then it doesn’t matter what I do.
                             (off Kiyoshi’s look)
                        That guy was gaijin too. He shoulda 
                        known better. He grew up in Queens.

           Kiyoshi finishes his drink. Gets them another round.

           EXT. MATSUOKA FAMILY HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

                                 DOCK WORKER
                        Matsuoka-san! MATSUOKA-SAN!

           A DRUNK DOCK WORKER in dirty coveralls pounds on the door to 
           the Matsuoka family headquarters, it isn’t long before -

           TAKESHI emerges, furious - he’s one of Akihiro’s kyodai (“big 
           brother”), a “made man”, and we recognize him from Matsuoka’s 
           table last night. A shark in a checkered coat and gold watch.

           No words. Takeshi just grabs the dock worker by his hair and 
           starts dragging him down the stairs.

                                 DOCK WORKER
                        <I have to see Akihiro!>
                                 TAKESHI
                        <It’s Matsuoka-san, asshole! Have 
                        some respect ->

                                 DOCK WORKER
                        <Fuck you kid, I’ve known him for 
                        thirty years!>

           THUD! Takeshi shoves the worker and he falls in the dirt.

                                 DOCK WORKER (CONT’D)
                        <I lost my job today! Some gaijin 
                        comes in and beats the shit out of 
                        my boss and now I don’t have a job! 
                        Akihiro has to do something!>

           Takeshi stops on the stairs.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <What gaijin?>

           EXT. STREET - MINAMI, OSAKA - NIGHT

           OROCHI, TAKESHI, SATORU and four other SHATEI walk through 
           the Minami alleys like jackals. Ready to kick ass, moving 
           fast, with purpose. No one gets in the way.

           INT. “RED BAR” - CONTINUOUS

           Their power is terrifying as they enter RED BAR: PEOPLE CLEAR 
           THE DANCEFLOOR as the SEVEN YAKUZA cross the room to NICK AND 
           KIYOSHI AT THE BAR, looking mean, music still blaring -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <What’s this?>

           Orochi stares down Kiyoshi, gives no explanation.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Akihiro sent us. For him.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Then I’m coming with you.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <Be my guest.>

           Kiyoshi steps aside, guilty conscience. Satoru smirks at 
           Nick. And ALL SEVEN DRAG NICK OUT, bar patrons staring.
           EXT. STREET - MINAMI, OSAKA - NIGHT

           They drag Nick across the street - cars braking hard, people 
           practically running out of the way. Nick knows better than to 
           fight back, but we can see him thinking through an escape.

           They drag him toward a doorway. Flashing lights. ADS FOR LIVE 
           NUDE DANCING plastered all over the place. They pull him in -

           INT. A STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Strip club patrons stare - the DANCERS just keep dancing - as 
           SEVEN YAKUZA drag a white man into the place and SLAM HIM 
           DOWN IN A CHAIR, right in front of the stage. Takeshi turns 
           to a cocktail waitress.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Get him a drink. GO!>

           Nick looks up at Takeshi. Confused. Takeshi talks to Kiyoshi:

                                 TAKESHI
                        <The fat American laid off all his 
                        workers. Akihiro’s offering them 
                        jobs on our docks in exchange for 
                        30% of their first year pay. They 
                        say the guy’s gonna put his entire 
                        warehouse up for rent.>

           Nick is lost, didn’t understand half the words.

                                 OROCHI
                        You did okay, white man. <Relax.>

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Look at some tits.>

           Kiyoshi relaxes, the fight leaves his tense shoulders. And 
           the yakuza call out orders for drinks. They take seats around 
           the two mostly-nude CHINESE GIRLS on stage.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           SIX DRINKS LATER. Nick is less drunk than the others. They 
           have a table by the stage now. Satoru drunkenly flirts with 
           their hostess, who’s having none of it.

           Nick has been relegated to the edge of the table. No one 
           talking to him. Everyone speaking Japanese, cracking each 
           other up. Until one of them has a serious observation.

                                 A MATSUOKA SHATEI
                        <Look at this.>
           The yakuza all look across the club as EIGHT MEN WALK IN. 
           Yakuza with their bow-legged strut and tailored suits.

                                 SATORU
                        <Seizu.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <Hey.>

           The stripper near Orochi looks over as he pulls out 20,000 
           YEN and tosses it on the stage.

                                 OROCHI
                             (re: the Seizu yakuza)
                        <Ignore them.>

           The Seizu sit at a table, see the Matsuokas across the stage 
           from them and put on tough faces.

           The Chinese girls put more filth in their act, right in front 
           of Orochi. But he isn’t even looking at them. He’s staring at 
           the Seizu. A look that says I OWN YOU.

           The senior SEIZU KYODAI (30) - gray sharkskin suit and a 
           ratpack toothpick - looks at a dancer and -

           HE WHISTLES. She turns, sees the 40,000 yen in his hand. And 
           she approaches him as he tosses it on stage. Takeshi boils.

                                 TAKESHI
                             (to Kiyoshi)
                        <This is our district.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <But it isn’t our club. We don’t 
                        own this place.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <We do tonight. Hey, China girl.>

           Orochi throws even more money on stage. A Chinese girl turns 
           back. It’s monkey in the middle. Satoru gets involved, 
           holding out cash for one of the girls as she rubs her nipple 
           against his sweaty, chubby face. Satoru glares at the Seizu.

           But the Seizu have had enough. They stand, straighten their 
           jackets as they walk around the stage - to the Matsuokas -

           The KYODAI looks down at Nick. Smirks.

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <What’s this?>
                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Get out of our shiba.>

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <You expect me to take you 
                        seriously with this little white 
                        kitten at your table?>

           The kyodai pats Nick on the head.

                                 OROCHI
                        <Why don’t you take him with you?>

           Nick bottles fury and sips his vodka.

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <You trained her to drink vodka! 
                        Nah, you keep her. Considering you 
                        bring in half the money we do, you 
                        might wanna save it. Take this, 
                        stick to drinks tonight.>

           The kyodai drops cash on the table. The Matsuokas are quiet. 
           And the kyodai turns to go. As he does, he pats Nick on the 
           head again, spilling vodka down Nick’s chin and -

           SMASH!

           NICK SLAMS HIS GLASS INTO THE KYODAI’S FACE - GLASS SHATTERS -

           HE HAMMERS HIS FISTS INTO THE GUY -

           The Seizu GRAB NICK - the Matsuokas leap up - PUNCHES FLY - 
           dancers scream - Nick takes a glass to the back of the head -

           He falls to his knees, bleeding badly and -

           K-CLICK - A GUN AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD but -

           K-CLICK - OROCHI has a gun at the Seizu kyodai’s forehead.

           A STANDOFF. Orochi looks like he actually wants to pull the 
           trigger. The kyodai signals his men to back down. They do, 
           lowering guns and stepping back. But that isn’t enough:

                                 OROCHI
                        <Run back to your shiba.>

           The kyodai nods to his men to go. He’s on his knees, 
           bleeding, face gashed. His men resentfully back out. Finally, 
           Orochi laughs. Looks at Nick as Kiyoshi helps him up.
                                 OROCHI
                        Holy shit, white boy! <You’re 
                        bleeding. You wanna hit him again?>

           Nick doesn’t move. Orochi still has the gun on the kyodai.

                                 OROCHI (CONT’D)
                        <Don’t be scared.>

           Nick doesn’t want to do it but Orochi has a gun and he’s 
           clearly fucking nuts so... Nick stands over the Kyodai and -

           CRACK! It hurts Nick’s knuckles. Orochi watches the kyodai go 
           face down on filthy strip club carpet.

                                 OROCHI
                        <Never let anyone humiliate you.>
                             (to Takeshi)
                        <Give me 20,000.>

           Takeshi does. Orochi tosses it at the dancers onstage, one of 
           whom is crying. And he heads out, everyone else follows.

           INT. BEDROOM - UMA-RAIDA INN - DAWN

           Nick wakes up hungover, head hurting, lip scabbed. He stands 
           at the window and looks out over Juso. Different at dawn. 
           Peaceful. Old women shopping. Men going to work.

           The sun slowly rises.

           INT. SHOKUDO - NOODLE HOUSE - MORNING

           Nick sits at a small taishu shokudo - the cheapest breakfast 
           you can get in Osaka. Steam, noodles and quiet working class 
           Japanese men in bargain suits.

           The server quickly brings Nick a hot bowl of soba, briefly 
           glancing at the wounds on Nick’s face. Doesn’t want trouble.

           Nick starts to eat his soba American-style: rolling up the 
           noodles around his chopsticks, biting into it. But he hears 
           the slurps - the Japanese men are all sucking up the stuff in 
           long strands. Nick’s sick of standing out.

           So he emulates them. Slurping. Just another man at the bar 
           now. As he eats, something stops him.

           Down the bar, SHE SITS DOWN alone. THE GIRL from the gambling 
           room. The one who extorted a thousand yen from him.
           No makeup and tired, she looks even more beautiful. Nick 
           watches as the server brings her soba. The men glance at her - 
           this is a man’s place - but she ignores it. Slurping. Hungry. 
           Fighting a hangover. Nick watches her. Fuck it.

           He gets up. Walks over. Sits next to her.

                        Is that a family name?

           She just slurps her soba. Almost finished already.

                        Does it mean cherry blossom or

                        I dunno, it’s just usually, when 
                        someone fucks me, I like to get 
                        their name first.

           She is grotesquely offended.

                        I’m not going to fuck you.

                        No you did fuck me. You took a 
                        thousand yen from me the other 
                        night. I just thought it would be 
                        polite if you told me your name 
                        cause I’m still a little raw. You 
                        know I been walking funny.

           She collects her bicycle. Hikes up her skirt away from the 
           bike chain, gets on the seat. She catches Nick looking.

                        I don’t like American movies.

           INT. MATSUOKA FAMILY HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           OROCHI. KIYOSHI. EIICHI. TAKESHI. AKIHIRO. And RYO - mid-
           thirties, sharp and measured in everything. We’ve seen him 
           before, but this is the first time we’ve heard him speak. 
           He’s the family’s saiko komon, Akihiro’s main advisor.

                        <I think it’s best to retain his

                        full responsibility?>

           The words sit with Kiyoshi. Orochi glares at him, hoping 
           Kiyoshi does the smart thing but... Kiyoshi nods. Accepts it.

           Akihiro listens. He lights a cigarette. Burns his fingers.

           Neither man wants to work with the other and Akihiro knows 
           it. But that’s how he solves problems. Trial by fire.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - JUSO - EVENING

           A shatei leads Nick up a stairwell to -

           HIS NEW APARTMENT. Lights off. The place overlooks an alley 
           lined with bars and gambling dens. Above it all, the 
           developing Osaka skyline. The shatei flicks the lights on, 
           revealing a cheap furnished apartment. But -

                                 NICK
                        Nah, turn it off.

           The shatei flicks the lights back off and leaves. Nick stands 
           alone in the dark. Takes in the view. Osaka. His city.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TAILOR - NIGHT

           A TAILOR finishes fitting Nick in a suit. Nick checks himself 
           in the mirror. He looks dangerous.

           EXT. COVERED ARCADE - JUSO, OSAKA - MOMENTS LATER

           Kiyoshi pays the tailor and they exit onto one of Juso’s 
           busy, covered arcades.

                                 NICK
                        You didn’t hafta pay for this.

                        <You wanna be a little white kitten 
                        or a big bad wolf?>

           Nick sees the everyday citizens. Heads down. Timid. He walks 
           with purpose now. All work and no play.

           INT. “RED BAR” - LATER

           A corner booth at Red Bar. Nick and Kiyoshi sit down across 
           from Orochi and a fearless nineteen year-old shatei.
                                 KIYOSHI

                        <He won’t even need a gun.>

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - MORNING

           Tall grass for miles. Train tracks. Kansai cicadas. A 
           deserted dirt road runs along the forest beyond the tracks.

           A train approaches.

           I/E. LOCOMOTIVE - SAME

           The CONDUCTOR and RAIL GUARD, both in their forties, watch 
           the forest roll by as the train chugs along loudly. But then 
           the conductor sees something as the train rounds the bend -

           ON THE TRACKS: A PERSON. WAVING A COAT.
           The guard pulls a SHOTGUN from a rack in the cab as the 
           conductor slows the train. He’s already sweating, anxious.

                                 RAIL GUARD
                        <It’s chinpira. Keep going. He’ll 
                        move or get run over.>

           The guard hangs out the window, he watches the treeline for 
           an ambush. But the conductor squints as the figure on the 
           tracks gets closer. There’s blood. A white man.

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        <No. It’s an American. His leg’s 
                        all fucked up.>

           The guard relaxes as the train slows and SCREECHES TO A STOP. 
           Steam groans out.

           A CAR FULL OF CATTLE LURCHES. The cows complain.

           EXT. THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - SAME

           Nick lays on the tracks. His pant leg swathed in blood.

                                 NICK
                        Hey! I need a fuckin’ doctor!

           The conductor and guard hop down and approach Nick. Seeing 
           the massive amount of blood, they hurry to help.

           They pick him up, shotgun lowered, supporting his weight 
           across their shoulders when, from out of the tall grass -

           OROCHI, KIYOSHI and BANJO approach - HANDGUNS COCKED.

           I/E. CATTLE CAR - LATER

           Tied up, the conductor and guard watch Nick standing on his 
           perfectly good leg, resenting this foreigner as he and the 
           yakuza push cattle out of the railcar, into the back of -

           A TRUCK.

           BANJO aims his gun at the guard. Nervous with all that power.

           INT. THE TRUCK - MOVING - LATER

           The cows groan in the dark of the moving, rumbling truck.
           EXT. THE JUDGE’S ESTATE - EVENING

           The judge arrives home at dusk. He places a candy on his 
           mistress’ tongue as they ascend the stone steps. A gift waits 
           for him at his doorstep. A HEAVY COTTON SACK.

           The bottom of the sack is soaked with blood.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLACK MARKET - JUSO, OSAKA - MORNING

           SLABS OF RAW KOBE BEEF being sold at a cut rate at the Juso 
           market. People line up for the deal.

           EXT. SHITENNOJI BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY

           Akihiro drops coins into the slatted offering box at 
           Shitennoji temple. He claps his hands twice. And prays.

           Finished, he descends the temple steps to where his 
           lieutenants wait for him - Eiichi, Ryo, Kiyoshi, Orochi, 
           Takeshi. They all walk back across the temple grounds.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <I paid Buddha. Pay them.>

           Eiichi hands thick envelopes to Takeshi, Orochi and Kiyoshi. 
           Takeshi is impressed by the amount of cash.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <Go get drunk.>

           INT. CUBAN BAR - NIGHT

           50’S MAMBO CRAZE MUSIC. Nick and Kiyoshi at the bar - the 
           bartender pours two drinks. And Kiyoshi slaps A STACK OF CASH 
           on the bar, slips a bill off it to pay the bartender -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <It’s on him.>
                             (to Nick, re: cash)
                        <It’s yours. For the train.>

           Nick looks across the room at Orochi, Takeshi and several 
           lower-level guys taking up tables in a private section.

                                 NICK
                        <I’ll get their drinks.>
                                 KIYOSHI
                        <No. Stay here.>

           Kiyoshi says it firmly, a warning. And Nick understands why:

                                 NICK
                             (re: Orochi)
                        He doesn’t trust me.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <He doesn’t have to. You aren’t 
                        part of his family.>
                             (a consolation)
                        <Akihiro trusts you.>

                                 NICK
                        <Only because he trusts you.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <You aren’t yakuza.>

           Nick sees the TV behind the bar. A “PRO” WRESTLING MATCH: 

           RIKIDOZAN, the legendary Japanese wrestler, fights a GIANT 
           AMERICAN. One of Rikidozan’s nationalist bouts. America as 
           the enemy. Kiyoshi can see Nick is getting lost in it.

                                 NICK
                        <...stray dog.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Dogs can be trained.

           MEANWHILE: ACROSS THE BAR, AT A TABLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTION:

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Miyu’s here.>

           Orochi turns to see what Takeshi sees. Sure enough, Miyu 
           crosses the dancefloor. All dolled up. Buzzed. She is sex. 
           The possibility of it. The smell and taste of it.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <I’d kill my mother for that.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <I’d kill you.>

           He stares Takeshi down. And then his eyes devour Miyu, a 
           history of desire in his stare. He sees other men looking at 
           her. And he turns to Satoru - distracted at the next table:

                                 OROCHI
                        <Tell Kiyoshi his sister’s here.>
           THE DANCEFLOOR

           Miyu drips sweat, dancing to Cuban heat. She keeps her body 
           to herself and her drunk dance partner tries to keep up.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Excuse me.>

           Suddenly Kiyoshi is pulling her off the dancefloor - her 
           partner starts to protest but Kiyoshi is not someone to fuck 
           with. She stumbles as he pulls her all the way to the dark of 
           the bathroom alcove. They’re alone.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <What are you doing?>

                                 MIYU
                        <Let go of my arm.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <You know what kind of bar this 
                        is.>

                                 MIYU
                        <What kind of bar is this?>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <You aren’t stupid.>

           As if on cue, they notice the COUPLE standing a little deeper 
           in the dark of the alcove, the woman with her hips pressed 
           against the man, drunk, her neck craned. It’s a pick-up bar.

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        <You can do what you want but don’t 
                        come here drunk. You know what guys 
                        do with drunk girls.>

                                 MIYU
                        <I know what drunk girls do with 
                        guys.>
                             (off his look)
                        <I came for the music.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <That’s not what they came for.>

                                 MIYU
                        <Aren’t these your friends?>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <I’m not worried about my friends.>

           Orochi watches from afar like a hungry coyote, unnoticed.
                                 MIYU
                        <If you want me to leave, I’ll just 
                        go to a bar in Seizu shiba.>

           And Kiyoshi EXPLODES, grabs her roughly -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <C’mere.>

           Furious, he marches her all the way to the bar. To Nick:

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        <You want something to do? Take my 
                        sister home. She’s drunk.>

                                 MIYU
                        <I’m not drunk.>

                                 NICK
                        You want me to take her home?

           She eyes Nick. Smirking. Kiyoshi catches it.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <You know each other?>

                                 MIYU
                        I never met him before in my life.

           She stares deep into Nick’s eyes. Nick can’t figure her out.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <He’s taking you home.> She lives 
                        in Asahi. I owe you.

           Kiyoshi means it. Nick says nothing. He looks at -

           I/E. TROLLEY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Miyu holds a rail for support in a rumbling trolley car. She 
           looks up at Nick. Alcohol behind her eyes. The kind of drunk 
           where just about anything could set her off laughing.

                                 MIYU
                        You got a suit.

                                 NICK
                        Is that funny?

                                 MIYU
                        Yes.
           They’re the only ones talking on the trolley. The everyday 
           citizens judge them quietly for standing too close. 
           Inappropriate behavior and it’s a Monday night.

                                 MIYU (CONT’D)
                        It fits well.

                                 NICK
                        Your brother chose it.

                                 MIYU
                        Is that a problem? Who my brother 
                        is?

                                 NICK
                        Why would it be a problem?

           She shrugs. Straightens the strap on her shoulder.

           And they ride in silence.

           LATER

           The trolley rolls to a stop. Ding ding!

                                 MIYU
                        This is my stop.

           Nick nods. She walks toward the exit. But as she gets a 
           couple feet away, she tugs Nick by the hand.

                                 MIYU (CONT’D)
                        It’s a dangerous neighborhood.

           EXT. STREET - ASAHI-KU - NIGHT

           It’s the opposite of a dangerous neighborhood. Asahi-ku is 
           picturesque along the Yodo river. No one on the street.

           Nick walks Miyu through a small garden to her place. A small, 
           traditional guest house - more typical of Kyoto than Osaka.

           She stops at the door.

                                 MIYU
                        You’re drunk.

                                 NICK
                        So are you.

           She shakes her head no. A sly smile.
                                 MIYU
                        I’m a good actor. People say I 
                        watch too many movies.

                                 NICK
                        American movies?

                                 MIYU
                        Sometimes.

           She steps inside. Slowly slides her shoes off. Starts to 
           close the door. He stops it. She looks in his eyes.

           And pulls him toward her. They kiss hard.

           She pulls at his shirt. He lifts her dress and they move 
           through the dark of her house, until she falls back against 
           something - a bed or a couch, too dark to tell, but it works.

           She tastes the liquor on him as he grabs the back of her 
           thigh and she grips him by the neck -

           And he’s inside her now. They slow down a moment, realizing 
           what this is. Dangerous. But that’s what makes it good.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MIYU’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Bright sun. Nick wakes up a mess. He’s naked next to Miyu. 
           She’s asleep. And he looks at her naked back:

           COVERED IN TATTOOS. Dark flowers twist from the nape of her 
           neck to the small of her back. Nick stares like he’s been let 
           in on a secret. And then he sees HER SCAR:

           A BURN that snakes down her back, masked by the tattoos. She 
           moves. He drops the sheet. She turns and looks him in the 
           eyes. Sleepy:

                                 MIYU
                        You move in your sleep. You make 
                        fists.

                                 NICK
                        I get in a lot of fights.
                             (beat)
                        You watched me sleep?

                                 MIYU
                        No. You watched me.
           He looks in her eyes, the sun lighting them up. Somehow he 
           feels exposed, transparent.

                                 MIYU (CONT’D)
                        My brother’s going to kill you.

           EXT. STREET - ASAHI-KU - MORNING

           Nick leaves her home in the harsh light of day. Looks around 
           anxious like someone might be watching. Guilty.

           INT. MATSUOKA GAMBLING HALL - MORNING

           KIYOSHI listens as Orochi speaks. The lieutenants sit in the 
           dim, empty gambling club. Glasses and beers strewn about from 
           last night. Akihiro presides. Mid-plan:

                                 OROCHI
                        <The company’s insured, so we won’t 
                        lose face with them.>

                                 RYO
                        <What about the driver?>

                                 OROCHI
                        <He tells the company he lost the 
                        shipment, he loses his job, and we 
                        pay him a year’s salary. For a 
                        truck driver, that doesn’t even 
                        dent the 22 million we’ll make.>

           Akihiro looks to Eiichi. Eiichi nods. Orochi’s right.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Where do we get the truck?>

                                 OROCHI
                             (hesitates)
                        <Nanko.>

                                 RYO
                        <That’s Seizu territory.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <It’s a lot of fuckin’ money.>

                                 RYO
                        <Dead people don’t need money.>

           Quiet. The lieutenants wait for Akihiro to decide.
                                 AKIHIRO
                             (to Orochi, firm)
                        <No. Find something else.>

           Orochi stares at Akihiro. Fuming.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <Is that a problem??>

                                 OROCHI
                        <No.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Find a way to do it outside Seizu 
                        shiba or forget it. Get out of 
                        here.>

           The lieutenants stand and bow to Akihiro. Orochi is last.

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

           Still anxious, Nick comes up the stairs in his rumpled suit. 
           Disheveled, his tie in his hand. Something stops him:

           A WHITE CAT stalks along the hall. It looks lost, confused. A 
           phone rings. Nick opens his door, wary of the cat and -

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           He picks up the ringing phone:

                                 NICK
                        Moshi.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Put your suit on.>

           Nick looks down at his messy suit and -

           EXT. STREET - MINAMI, OSAKA - NIGHT

           He follows Kiyoshi through the streets of Minami. Flashing 
           lights and pedestrians in the way of growling cars. Nick is 
           distracted, still guilty, he keeps looking at Kiyoshi and -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <You’re thinking about something.>

           Nick looks like he’s been caught but before he can respond -
                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        <Don’t.>
                             (beat)
                        <You’re a warrior. Out here, you 
                        can’t care about anything because 
                        everywhere you go, they see your 
                        face. Look at me.>

           Kiyoshi’s face is pure inhuman apathy. Nick stares at him and 
           slowly relaxes. Lets go of his guilt. It makes him look cold.

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        <You want the others to trust you 
                        like I trust you?>

                                 NICK
                        <Yes.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Then I have to teach you.>

           He walks, Nick follows. They walk into a THEATER. Ignoring 
           the VELVET ROPE across the entrance.

           INT. KABUKI THEATER - SAME

           A KABUKI ACTRESS and ACTOR act out the final scene in a 
           traditional shinjuu (”double suicide”) play. Gripping each 
           other under a single spotlight.

           The actors/lovers plunge their knives into each other. The 
           spotlight overhead goes instantly red and a cloth is drawn 
           out under them by unseen strings pulled by unseen stage 
           hands. The cloth spreads in crimson folds, overtaking the 
           stage as the actors collapse in each other’s arms.

           After a devastating silence, the audience applauds.

           INT. THEATER BOX OFFICE - LATER

           The theater manager pulls all the cash out of the theater’s 
           cash box. He hands stack after stack to Kiyoshi. Nick just 
           watches like a good apprentice. And as the manager hands over 
           the last of his cash, he bows reverently to Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi 
           nods his thanks. And Nick follows him out to -

           INT. THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Kiyoshi walks, counting cash, pulling off just about HALF THE 
           STACK. Nick follows alongside him, surprised when Kiyoshi 
           suddenly turns off the hall and into -
           INT. A DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The actress from the play wipes away her makeup.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Miss... you were beautiful.>

           He lowers his eyes, bows as he hands a STACK OF CASH to her. 
           She blushes. And he bows again, hands her ANOTHER STACK.

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        <And for your co-stars.>

           As he comes out of his bow this time, he keeps his eyes on 
           hers. There’s sex in the look and she knows it. She smiles.

                                 ACTRESS
                        <I’m blushing.>

           Kiyoshi turns to leave, taking Nick with him.

           EXT. STREET - MINAMI, OSAKA - LATER

           A street vendor serves Nick and Kiyoshi beer and takoyaki. 
           They speak English to keep the conversation private.

                                 NICK
                        First you steal all their cash, 
                        then you give it back to them.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        A kabuki producer comes to me. He 
                        needs money to put on a play. He 
                        says the city won’t give him a 
                        permit. So I give him money. I pay 
                        the cops to ignore the permit and 
                        he puts the play on in our shiba. 
                        <In return, he gives me ticket 
                        sales every Friday night.>

                                 NICK
                        But you throw the money away.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        I give it to the actors. They’re 
                        poor. The audience is rich. Every 
                        night, they cross the street to our 
                        bars. <And the bars jack up the 
                        prices so they feel more at home.>

           Orochi nods toward the RESTAURANT-BAR just beyond the cart. 
           Wealthy couples walking in.

           THE BAR’S ENTRANCE: A CURIOUS PLANT sits in the display 
           window. BAMBOO AND PINE SPRIGS wrapped together.

                        Yeah.

                        It’s called kadomatsu. Decoration 
                        plant. It means we protect them. 
                        They pay 5,000 yen every two weeks 
                        to rent the plant from us.

                        yakuza were too busy making money 
                        to put on uniforms and get shot at

           Nick sees the intent look on Kiyoshi’s face and knows enough 
           to read into it. He repeats Kiyoshi’s line back to him:
                                 NICK

                        Akihiro turned down 22 million yen 
                        today. Because we have to go into 
                        Seizu shiba to get it. It would 
                        start a war if a yakuza went.

                        ...but I’m not yakuza.

                        If you want them to trust you, 
                        bring them 22 million yen.

           Nick smiles. But Kiyoshi’s face is stern, forbidding.

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        Think about it. It’s your choice. 
                        You can always start small.
                             (hands Nick half the cash)
                        Give that to Akihiro tomorrow. Wrap 
                        it in paper with a black bow.

                        It’s okay...

           Kiyoshi eats a takoyaki ball. Dry:

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <I get to fuck an actress tonight.>

           Nick sees the kabuki actress exiting the theater across the 
           street. So he finishes his beer. Smiles at Kiyoshi and pats 
           him on the shoulder before he goes, pocketing the cash.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OKONOMIYAKI RESTAURANT - MORNING

           An okonomiyaki restaurant has closed its upper floor in 
           deference to the yakuza: Orochi, Eiichi and Banjo sit across 
           from Nick and Kiyoshi. Half-drunk beers on the table.

                                 NICK

                                 OROCHI
                        <You aren’t yakuza, but if the 
                        Seizu catch you, they’ll cut your 
                        dick off and feed it to you.>

           The WAITRESS arrives with okonomiyaki, all crisscrossed with 
           ketchup and mayonnaise. Dead silence until she leaves.

                                 KIYOSHI
                             (to Nick)

                                 OROCHI
                        <I thought you trusted him.>

           Orochi smiles cruelly at Nick. Like he knows about Miyu. But 
           Nick just stares back at him, fight in his eyes.

                                 NICK
                        <I’m not scared of anything.>

           Orochi grinds out his cigarette. Looks at Eiichi:

                        <Tell him.>

                        everything from his truck to yours. 
                        It’s heavy, 400 kilos of guns.>

                        know about this are us and the

                        Yeah but I got a question...
           They all look at Nick. He draws it out, ominous...

                                 NICK
                        <When do we get paid?>

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL DOCK - NANKO PORT - SUMINOE-KU, OSAKA - NIGHT

           Osaka Bay is quiet at night. The industrial docks at Nanko 
           are abandoned. Until A TOYOTA TRUCK creeps onto the dock. 
           Lights off. It parks along stacks of shipping crates.

           Nick climbs out of the driver’s seat. No one in sight. A ONE 
           TON ‘53 CHEVY TRUCK parked 50 feet away. He approaches -

           Rounds the front of the truck, looks in the cab -

           EMPTY.

           CLICK.

           Nick knows that sound. He doesn’t have to turn around to know 
           someone’s behind him with a GUN COCKED:

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        <Don’t fucking move.>

           FIVE YAKUZA approach, one of them turns Nick around, puts a 
           SNUB-NOSED REVOLVER to his forehead.

                                 THE ONE WITH THE SNUB-NOSED
                        <They sent a fuckin’ gaijin.>

           And Nick locks eyes with -

           THE SEIZU KYODAI he disfigured with a shattered glass. Face 
           scarred. He takes special pleasure in seeing Nick. Turns to 
           one of his men and utters the words Orochi said before Nick 
           knocked him out cold, sinister:

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <You wanna hit him?>

           CRACK! The one with the snub-nosed COLD-COCKS Nick in the 
           face and on the kyodai’s command, his men drag Nick back to -

           NICK’S TRUCK. They force him to his knees, revolver at the 
           back of his head now as he looks up to see a NERVOUS MAN who 
           stands out among the yakuza: THE TRUCK DRIVER.
                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <You know these are our docks? Your 
                        friend here knows that. He told us 
                        about your exchange tonight.>

           The truck driver just keeps his head down. Terrified.

                                 SEIZU KYODAI (CONT’D)
                        <Where’s the money?>

                                 NICK
                        I don’t speak your language, man. 
                        I’ve never seen this guy before in 
                        my life.

           The kyodai smiles. He nods to his men. They open the cab to 
           Nick’s truck. Start searching.

           They check under the seats. Nothing. One of them pops open a 
           switchblade and slices the driver’s seat down the middle. 
           Pulls out stuffing. Does the same with the passenger seat.

           Nick waits as they keep searching until -

                                 SEIZU SHATEI
                        <It’s empty.>

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <Bring the driver over here.>

           A yakuza pushes the nervous truck driver over to the kyodai -

                                 SEIZU KYODAI (CONT’D)
                        <On his knees.>

           The driver’s forced to his knees. Right in front of Nick. The 
           kyodai puts a gun to his head. The man shakes.

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                             (to Nick)
                        <Where’s the money?>

           Nick says nothing. He just looks the driver in the eyes. The 
           man betrayed him. But the driver’s eyes plead with Nick.

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <WHERE IS THE MONEY?>

           Nick doesn’t even move. He watches as -

           BANG! BLOOD, TISSUE AND BONE BLAST OUT OF THE DRIVER’S SKULL -

           The man crumples, blood pouring from his head - flecks of his 
           blood on Nick’s face. He tries to ignore it.
                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <Where’s the money?>

           The kyodai points his handgun at Nick’s forehead now and - 
           CLICK. The yakuza behind Nick cocks his snub-nosed -

                                 SEIZU KYODAI
                        <Three... two...>

           The kyodai gets in a firing stance, one leg back - slowly 
           lowers his aim to Nick’s BALLS now and -

           In the time it would take the kyodai to say “one”:

           NICK STANDS SUDDENLY - WRENCHES THE REVOLVER BEHIND HIS HEAD 
           FORWARD - the man behind him becomes a human shield as -

           BOOM! The kyodai FIRES, hits the human shield - and Nick -

           KBANG-KBANG! FIRES TWO ROUNDS THROUGH THE KYODAI’S CHEST - 
           KBANG! AGAIN IN HIS FACE and -

           Nick puts the revolver to his human shield’s head now -

           Ready to fire.

           It all happened in two seconds. Professional, efficient. 
           Where the fuck did that come from? It’s quiet now except for 
           Nick’s breathing. He stares down -

           THE THREE OTHER YAKUZA. Utter disbelief. Nick is shaking, 
           blood on his face. No doubt he’ll do it. They lower their 
           weapons: two guns and a knife. And drop them to the ground.

                                 NICK
                        Open the fucking truck.

           The Seizu back off toward the big Chevy truck. Nick marches 
           them over, gun jammed into his human shield’s temple. He 
           watches as one of the Seizu opens the back of the truck to 
           reveal: it’s empty. Nick isn’t surprised. Plan B:

                                 NICK
                        Get in. <GET IN.>

           The three terrified yakuza climb in the back of the Chevy. 
           Nick forces the human shield inside too. And he shuts the 
           door, shoves the chained pin-bolt in, LOCKING THEM INSIDE.

           NICK BACK AT HIS TRUCK. He climbs in the cab. Looks out at 
           the two bodies. At his own hands. They’re shaking. But he’s 
           been here before. He stares at his hands, willing them to 
           stop... they do. He starts the engine.
           PULLS AWAY. The engine fading until all we hear is -

           Water lapping against the docks. Two bodies slowly go pale, 
           blood drying in cool night air.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNDERPASS - NIGHT

           Banjo waits under an overpass in the middle of the night. A 
           faint light, he looks up -

           The truck approaches -

           Pulls to a stop. The back is empty, so Banjo walks around to 
           the driver’s side door. And sees Nick staring back.

           BLOOD SPATTERED AND DRIED ON HIS FACE. Pale as a ghost. Fuck.

           I/E. TRUCK - LATER

           Nick drives. Banjo in the passenger seat, wired now.

                                 BANJO
                        <They didn’t take the cash??>

           Nick shakes his head no.

                                 BANJO (CONT’D)
                        <They cut the shit outta these 
                        seats. Fuck! Don’t mention Orochi. 
                        Don’t mention Kiyoshi or Eiichi. No 
                        one sent us to do this, got it?>
                             (off Nick’s look)
                        <You never rat out your boss. Rats 
                        choke on their own blood. They shot 
                        the driver in front of you?>
                             (off Nick’s nod)
                        <Good.>

           Nick wipes his face, but the blood doesn’t want to leave.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ANTEROOM - MATSUOKA FAMILY HEADQUARTERS - DAWN

           Nick and Banjo sit outside the smoke room. The silence is 
           oppressive. They’re pale, eyes heavy with lack of sleep.

           A commanding shout from beyond the doors. Banjo stands. Nick 
           follows suit. FOUR SHATEI escort them through the doors to -
           INT. THE SMOKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Akihiro sits at the ebony table inside. Kiyoshi, Orochi, 
           Takeshi and Eiichi alongside him. The same kyodai who were 
           present when Akihiro forbade going into Seizu territory.

           Akihiro stares poison as Nick and Banjo enter with their 
           hands folded, heads lowered.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Step forward.>

           Both of them do.

                                 BANJO
                        <Boss, it was my idea ->

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Bullshit.>

           Silence. Akihiro just stares at them.

                                 NICK
                        <It was mine.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <You?>

                                 NICK
                        I’m not yakuza.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Speak Japanese! I’ll slit your 
                        fucking throat.>

           Nick’s Japanese is fluent but simple, he searches for words:

                                 NICK
                        <I’m a stray dog. I have no shiba. 
                        I have no rules to follow. What I 
                        do is on my head, no one else’s. 
                        That was my idea.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Was it your idea to kill a kyodai 
                        of the Seizu family?>

                                 NICK
                        <I brought no weapons. They were 
                        waiting for me. Someone told them 
                        you sent me.>
                                 AKIHIRO
                             (re: Orochi et al)
                        <Did we send you?>
                             (off Nick’s silence)
                        <ANSWER ME!>

                                 NICK
                        <I’m sorry. I can’t.>

           Orochi, Eiichi and Kiyoshi all watch Nick. But he doesn’t 
           even glance their way.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        <They were waiting for me.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <The driver told them you were 
                        coming.>

                                 NICK
                        <No. I don’t know how to say this 
                        in Japanese.>

           Akihiro nods to Eiichi: translate. Eiichi does.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Those guys ripped up the seats 
                        looking for cash and just gave up. 
                        Anyone searching a car who has his 
                        head on straight checks the glove 
                        compartment. They never even 
                        fuckin’ opened it. If they had, 
                        they woulda found their 2 million 
                        yen. But someone told them the 
                        money was in the seats.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Someone. Someone in this room?>

           Nick doesn’t answer. But his silence is answer enough. 
           Kiyoshi studies Banjo, Eiichi and Orochi... did they do it?

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <You’re calling one of these men a 
                        traitor? You were the only one 
                        there?>

           Nick nods. Akihiro addresses a shatei behind Nick, cold:

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <Kill him.>
           The two big SHATEI behind Nick grab him - he struggles 
           furiously as they drag him to where another shatei pulls up 
           the tatami, exposing the bare wood floor below cause they 
           don’t want to get blood on the matting -

           They kick Nick’s legs out - he slams down hard on the wood -

           A ROPE IS WRAPPED TIGHTLY around Nick’s throat and pulled 
           hard - he tries to scream but nothing comes out as his neck 
           turns beet red - skin ripping around the rough rope and -

           KIYOSHI SHOVES THE SHATEI, PULLS THE ROPE AWAY from Nick’s 
           throat - he stands between them all, feral -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <GET THE FUCK OFF HIM! You wanna 
                        kill him, you kill me first! 
                        Everyone understand that!?>

           The air goes stale. Kiyoshi stands at the center of a roomful 
           of eyes, all staring at him, allegiances unclear. No one 
           wants to be the first to move, the first to speak. Until -

                                 OROCHI
                        <He fucked your sister.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <What?>

                                 OROCHI
                        <He fucked her the night you asked 
                        him to keep her safe. She has his 
                        poison inside her.>

           Kiyoshi looks at Nick. And Nick’s eyes tell him all he needs 
           to know. It’s true. But Kiyoshi turns back to Orochi:

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Better him than you.>

           Orochi’s eyes turn black.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <We’ll have a war with the Seizu. 
                        We have to give them something. 
                        Would you rather sacrifice yourself 
                        than him?>

           ON KIYOSHI. No. He wouldn’t.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <What then?>
                                 NICK
                             (voice destroyed)
                        ...yubitsume.

           The wall of eyes turn on Nick as he raises his hand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TEA CEREMONY ROOM - DAY

           A large, ceremonial room with tatami mats from one end to the 
           other. The type of room where shoguns address their samurai 
           in Kurosawa movies. Tonight, it’s filled with yakuza from the 
           Matsuoka and Seizu families.

           Akihiro Matsuoka and HIROMITSU SEIZU, the two kumicho 
           (godfathers) of their respective families, sit on the raised 
           platform at one end of the room, overlooking dozens of their 
           soldiers. The soldiers keep to their own sides of the room.

           In the center of the room is a one foot tall petrified wood 
           altar of sorts. Like a footstool. A white cloth on it. And -

           A KNIFE. Ivory handle. Shining blade.

           Akihiro turns to Hiromitsu. And Hiromitsu starts the ceremony 
           by looking at his soldiers and -

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <Sit down.>

           The Seizu all kneel. Akihiro raises his hand and the Matsuoka 
           family follows suit, Nick included.

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <Where is he?>

           ON NICK. He looks at Hiromitsu. Stands. The eyes on the Seizu 
           side of the room bleed murder and vengeance.

           But Hiromitsu betrays no emotion. His weathered, 60 year-old 
           face is framed by a gray beard. Eyes heavy as Nick approaches 
           the stool. For Nick, every step takes an eternity. Finally -

           Nick bows deeply, first to Akihiro and then to Hiromitsu. 

           He kneels before the stool.

           Rolls up his left sleeve. Then his right. Still not sure if 
           he’s doing this right, but they’re all just waiting for him.

           He picks up the knife.
           Places it just past the last knuckle of his left pinky.

           Looks at Kiyoshi. Who nods discreetly: it’s the right spot.

           Nick tries not to shake. He looks down at his finger and -

           PRESSES DOWN HARD. Winces. Blinding pain.

           No one else makes a sound. Blood pours out. The tip of his 
           finger is no longer a part of him. It just sits there on the 
           cloth. Nick hides pain. Wraps the thing in the cloth. And -

           A kyodai from the Seizu side of the room steps forward. Takes 
           the cloth from Nick. Steps up and presents it to Hiromitsu.

           Hiromitsu opens the cloth. Inspects the severed fingertip.

           And he hands it back to the kyodai. Not pleased. Instead, 
           Hiromitsu looks at Nick, waiting for something.

           The kyodai approaches Nick. And he places A FRESH CLOTH on 
           the still bloody stool.

           Nick’s fist is blood-covered now. But he looks at his hand, 
           the pinky missing its tip. And the RING FINGER, just waiting -

           Nick picks up the knife. Puts his palm down on the cloth, 
           pinky still pulsing, and he places the knife at the last 
           knuckle of his RING FINGER. This time, no fear -

           HE LOOKS HIROMITSU DEAD IN THE EYE. And he -

           PRESSES DOWN HARD. No wincing now. Just the sound of meat 
           being sliced and the knife cutting hard down to the wood.

           Nick wraps up the second finger tip. Puts the knife down. 
           Squeezes his fist to slow the blood pumping out of it.

           The kyodai collects the cloth-wrapped fingertip. Brings it to 
           Hiromitsu along with the pinky. And Hiromitsu inspects the 
           second digit. He draws it all out to punish Nick. Finally -

           He wraps it back up. Places both finger tips in his own 
           handkerchief. And into his kimono.

           On his knees, NICK BOWS forehead-to-floor, to Hiromitsu -

           And to Akihiro.

                                                                CUT TO:
           I/E. CHEVY BEL AIR - MOVING - DAY

           Nick’s hand is wrapped in bloody gauze. He’s in the back seat 
           of a rumbling black Chevy with Akihiro. Looks uncomfortable 
           to be so close to a man who wanted him dead 24 hours ago.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <You know why you’re riding with me 
                        instead of your friend Kiyoshi?>

           Nick shakes his head no. Knows to be silent now.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <When a yakuza sacrifices for the 
                        family, he’s forgiven completely.>
                             (beat, into Nick’s eyes)
                        <But you’re not yakuza.>

           Akihiro watches the road. Leaving Nick uncomfortable. And the 
           car pulls off the road. Parks along grass and reeds.

           Alone in the middle of nowhere. Stone steps lead off along a 
           creek. The driver gets out. Comes around and opens Akihiro’s 
           door. Akihiro gets out. The driver waits for Nick to follow.

           EXT. CREEK WALK - CONTINUOUS

           Nick is alert as he clutches his bloodied hand, walking 
           alongside Akihiro through the brush. The driver walks behind 
           them about ten feet back. The trees tower over them. Quiet.

           Just footsteps and water and the GUN in the driver’s belt.

           EXT. CHANIWA GARDEN - LATER

           Finally, they emerge into a CHANIWA GARDEN. Ornately 
           designed, vibrant in September sun. They walk stone steps 
           toward an ancient TEA HOUSE. And as they round the house -

           THE MATSUOKA FAMILY. DOZENS OF THEM. Still in their suits, 
           they kneel in a long row along a mat that’s been rolled out 
           over the garden pebbles.

           The driver walks Nick over to an open spot in the center of 
           the row. Nick kneels there. Confused as hell. And -

           Akihiro walks around to the opposite side of the mat. He 
           kneels, facing the assembled family members as -

           A MAN emerges from the tea house carrying a bottle of sake 
           and a wooden box. He sets the box down beside Akihiro. And 
           from out of the box, he pulls -
           TWO SAKAZUKI CUPS.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <We sit outside the tea house 
                        because we’re outsiders. We use the 
                        cheapest sake because we survive by 
                        any means necessary.>

           The man pours sake into the two cups. Pours more into one 
           than the other - the “7:3” ritual.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <Do you know what these are?>

                                 NICK
                        Sakazuki.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <If I drink from this cup, and you 
                        drink from yours, you’ll be bound 
                        by our rules.>

           Ryo watches Orochi. Trying to gauge the hot-head’s reaction.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <I become your oyabun. And you 
                        become my kobun. I protect you as 
                        you protect me. You understand?>

           Nick nods.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Say it.>

                                 NICK
                        <I understand.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Are you thirsty?>

           Nick nods again. And Akihiro picks up his sake cup. Drinks in 
           two slow sips. Puts the cup back in the box.

           The man who brought everything out now brings the box to 
           Nick. Nick looks at his partially filled cup. Picks it up.

           DRINKS. Places it down. BOWS. Stays there with his head down.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. KAISEKI RESTAURANT - KYOTO - NIGHT

           The warm lanterns of a traditional kaiseki restaurant are 
           reflected in the slow-moving Katsura river below. Arashiyama, 
           just outside Kyoto, is a land of the past. People on the 
           street walk in kimonos. But inside -

           Nick, Kiyoshi, Takeshi, Orochi, Ryo and Eiichi sit sweating 
           in their suits, drunk with other familiar faces at a table of 
           12. The Matsuokas responsible for the Minami area in Osaka.

           Their hostess and several other women bring in the sixth 
           course: wooden box towers with sliding drawers. Each layer of 
           the boxes contains immaculately conceived foods designed to 
           look like flowers and animals.

           The hostess explains to Ryo (and the table) what each is. But 
           Nick is confused by a brown-gray lump in his tower.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Crab brain.>

           As the hostesses leave, the kyodai all start talking and 
           eating, laughing about something at the end of the table as 
           Nick decides to try his kanimiso. But next to him, Kiyoshi’s 
           voice is cool in his ear, he speaks English for privacy -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        You sleep with my sister.

           Nick looks at him. Any response is dangerous.

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                        She’s 20 years old. I don’t want 
                        her with yakuza. Wakari masu-ka?

                                 NICK
                        You got her a job in your 
                        headquarters and you don’t want her 
                        with yakuza?

           Kiyoshi has said his piece. He drinks. Nick can’t let it die.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        What if I like her?

                                 KIYOSHI
                        She was a virgin.

                                 NICK
                             (laughs)
                        I don’t think so.
           Nick stops laughing as he sees Kiyoshi’s eyes. Unblinking as 
           always, they focus on Nick like he’s an enemy. Just the two 
           of them now - the laughing gangsters around them fade into 
           the background. Nick relents. For his life and his friend:

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        <I’ll leave her alone. I promise.>

           Kiyoshi turns back to his food, almost embarrassed. And the 
           silence gives way as a sweaty-faced kyodai shouts:

                                 SWEATY KYODAI
                        <Fuck, haven’t they heard of air 
                        conditioning in Kyoto?!?>

                                 TAKESHI
                        <People here still kill their own 
                        fuckin’ chickens. Take your shirt 
                        off, they don’t care.>

                                 SWEATY KYODAI
                        <Fuck it. Let’s scare the 
                        hostesses.>

           He pulls off his shirt, revealing his body-suit - covered in 
           tattoos. Others follow suit. Some go completely shirtless, 
           others like Kiyoshi play along, unbuttoning their shirts but 
           leaving them on.

           Nick leaves his shirt completely buttoned. Hesitant.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Don’t worry, we aren’t going to 
                        fuck you.>

                                 NICK
                        <Yeah? Orochi’s been trying to get 
                        me drunk all night.>

           Everyone laughs. Orochi actually smiles under his sunglasses.

                                 OROCHI
                        Fuck you. Take your shirt off.

           Nick peels his shirt off. Immediately he stands out. His 
           flesh is pale, bare, void of tattoos. The only marking is the 
           scar on his shoulder. Takeshi smirks:

                                 TAKESHI
                        No baita?

                                 NICK
                        Baita?
                                 TAKESHI
                        All American have naked lady 
                        tattoo. Prostitute. Tits.

                                 NICK
                        Nah. <I just like virgins.>

           He smiles at Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi finally relaxes. Smirks along. 
           Everyone laughs. Takeshi pours Kiyoshi more sake. To Nick:

                                 TAKESHI
                        <You need horimono.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <Motherfucker, are you kidding? 
                        He’s funny enough. You’re all 
                        laughing. You want him tattooed so 
                        the other families can laugh too?>

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Fuck the other families.>

                                 EIICHI
                        <I agree.>

                                 TAKESHI
                        <He killed a Seizu. He committed 
                        yubitsume. Twice. He’s yakuza.>

           Orochi looks to Ryo. Who says nothing. Orochi knows he’s 
           alone now. He looks at Nick’s shortened fingers, dry:

                                 OROCHI
                        <So he is.>

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - ALONG THE KATSURA RIVER - NIGHT

           TAIKO DRUMS pound on the soundtrack as the yakuza move in a 
           pack along the river walk. Nick in the midst of them. And the 
           pack stops at a small, century-old, two story MACHIYA home.

           Takeshi KNOCKS on the wood siding and waits. Pounds again. A 
           woman calls from within, craggy-voiced.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        <People are sleeping!>

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Mitsuda! We have fresh skin for 
                        you.>
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAKESHI (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        <And 500,000 yen.>

           The drums stop. Silence. And the DOOR SLIDES OPEN. A tired 
           woman in her 40’s stands there in a yukata.

                                 MITSUDA’S WIFE
                        <Who’s it for?>

           Kiyoshi steps forward with Nick. Off her surprise, we -

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MITSUDA’S HOUSE - LATER

           MITSUDA’s eyes are heavy and unrevealing. In his mid-fifties, 
           he sits across from Kiyoshi and Nick, studying them both 
           while his wife serves them tea. She leaves them alone. And 
           Mitsuda is unexpectedly icy, hostile:

                                 MITSUDA
                        <You bring money into my house and 
                        try to buy me by the hour like a 
                        prostitute.>

           Nick stops drinking tea mid-sip.

                                 MITSUDA (CONT’D)
                        <Kiyoshi... you disgrace my work.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                             (calculated)
                        <If your objection is money, I 
                        won’t pay you.>

                                 MITSUDA
                        <You bring this person into my 
                        home?>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <What person?>
                             (beat, re: Nick)
                        <This? This is no person. No person 
                        claws a man’s eyes out with his 
                        bare hands. No person cuts his own 
                        fingers off. No person withstands 
                        beatings and burnt flesh and 
                        starvation. I didn’t bring a person 
                        into your home.>
                             (beat)
                        <I brought an animal.>
                                 MITSUDA
                             (cold)
                        <He’s white.>

                                 NICK
                        <That’s why we need to cover his 
                        skin.>

           Mitsuda is surprised by Nick’s Japanese. Disarmed by his 
           unwavering eye contact. He addresses Nick for the first time:

                                 MITSUDA
                        <Take your shirt off.>

           Nick does. And Mitsuda sees the burn scars on his back, the 
           gouged scar in his shoulder, the missing fingertips. They’re 
           the undeniable wounds of a warrior.

                                 MITSUDA
                        <What’s his design?>

                                 KIYOSHI
                             (firm)
                        <Mizuchi and nishikigoi. We go back 
                        to Osaka tomorrow.>

           Mitsuda deliberates and -

           LATER

           Mitsuda rakes a sake-soaked rag down Nick’s back. Cleaning 
           his canvas. Kiyoshi’s gone. Nick lays face down in silence, 
           staring at a sumi-e painting on the wall: A TATTOOED SAMURAI. 

           Mitsuda picks up his TEBORI STICK - a bamboo rod with a small 
           cluster of needles at the end. And he dips a small brush in a 
           bowl of sumi ink. Wets the tebori needles in the brush.

           He grips the stick at its end, places it millimeters over 
           Nick’s bare skin and -

           Nick blocks the pain. Needles puncture skin again and again. 
           Drawing blood, injecting ink, as Mitsuda rams his palm into 
           the end of the stick twice per second. Shikshikshik...

           The painting of the tattooed samurai stands watch.

           DAWN

           A sliver of sunlight crawls across the tatami now. The mat 
           under Nick is stained slightly crimson.
           The sound of laughter. The door opens and a YOUNG BOY (5) 
           stumbles in looking for a place to hide, but he sees Mitsuda 
           wiping Nick’s back, the design obscured by bruising and warm 
           blood. The boy locks eyes with Nick, suddenly looks down and -

           He bows reverently and quietly slips out barefooted.

                        He bows to Americans?

           Mitsuda breaks a brick of Sumi like charcoal into the bowl, 
           mixing the powder to black. And he answers Nick.

                                 MITSUDA
                        No. Yakuza.

           SUNSET

           A FLY walks along a bowl filled with bloody water, trying to 
           get a sip. A used, twisted rag sits in the bowl. The young 
           boy - Mitsuda’s son - watches from afar as -

           NICK rises from the river, water runs down his back clean and 
           cool. We get just a glimpse of his raw skin and the fresh 
           black lines - the design is still an unseen mystery. He 
           senses something, turns to see Kiyoshi sitting by the bank.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Time to go home.

                        I didn’t say sayonara yet.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        No sayonara. You see him every week 
                        for a year.

           The peace of the Katsura river gives way to -

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OSAKA STATION - UMEDA, OSAKA - NIGHT

           It’s raining hard in Osaka. 8 P.M. People rush from Osaka 
           station to their cars and bicycles. And -

           I/E. TROLLEY CAR - LATER

           Nick climbs into a trolley car, holds onto the rail as it 
           starts to move. He smiles to himself, content. 
           His grin is a sharp contrast to the uncomfortable, soaked 
           commuters. He feels eyes on him and he looks across the aisle 
           to see -

           A WOMAN stares at his shortened fingers. She realizes he’s 
           caught her looking and quickly looks away, nervous -

           It fills Nick with power. He likes it.

           THE TROLLEY STOPS. People get off. And as someone climbs on, 
           Nick recognizes her instantly:

           MIYU. Shit. He turns around, faces out the trolley windows. 
           Away from her. The trolley moves again. Hammered by rain.

           She sees him. He looks at her. Looks away. She gets it.

           EXT. TROLLEY CAR - LATER

           Nick covers himself from the rain as he walks home. He looks 
           back to see the trolley pull away.

           INT. BATHROOM - NICK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Nick’s bathroom is old Japanese-style. A porcelain trough in 
           the floor instead of a toilet with a seat. Standing in the 
           open door, Nick pulls off his shirt and looks at himself in 
           the mirror, turning so he can see his back:

           It’s lightly bruised but otherwise healed. He stares at the 
           design. Black outlines cover his back. A DRAGON and a KOI 
           FISH intertwined. Water crashing around them.

                                 MIYU (O.S.)
                        It fits you.

                                 NICK
                             (spins)
                        Jesus Christ.

           Miyu stands in his main room. Damp from the rain.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck’re you doing here?

                                 MIYU
                        So you do get scared.

                                 NICK
                        I’m not scared.
                                 MIYU
                        You’re scared of my brother.

           He has no answer for that. She looks casually at his body.

                                 NICK
                        You don’t act like a Japanese girl.

                                 MIYU
                        What does a Japanese girl act like?

           He crosses his hands femininely in front of him and bows 
           gently like a Japanese woman. Eyes down. Then he becomes Nick 
           again. Looks her dead in the eyes.

           She plays along. She folds her hands, gracefully moves toward 
           him as a geisha would, feet shuffling, cheek turned.

           She stops just a foot from him. And becomes Miyu again.

                                 NICK
                        You do that pretty good.

                                 MIYU
                        My brother paid for good schools. 
                        He thinks he knows what’s best for 
                        me.

           She takes a certain pleasure in mentioning Kiyoshi again, it 
           makes Nick uncomfortable. Vulnerable.

                                 NICK
                        He probably does.

           She looks over his shoulder, his back reflected in the 
           mirror. She recognizes the design.

                                 MIYU
                        You know what it means?
                             (off his silence)
                        It’s a fable. The koi fish who can 
                        swim up a waterfall becomes a 
                        dragon. It means you’re arrogant.

                                 NICK
                        You could get me killed.

                                 MIYU
                        But isn’t that exciting?

           She takes his hand, the one with two bandaged, shortened 
           fingers, and brings it around her back. He leaves it there.
           And she kisses him slowly. He kisses back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BACH’S POLONAISE FROM THE BRANDENBURG CONCERTOS BLASTS 
           OPERATICALLY OVER A -

           MONTAGE:

           THE JUSO BLACK MARKET. RESERVOIR DOGS: Nick, Kiyoshi and the 
           other Matsuoka brothers flank Akihiro as he walks through the 
           Juso market. People clear the way. Nick briefly locks eyes 
           with a COMMON MAN. The man bows fearfully.

           TOBITA SHINCHI. The red light district. Girls kneel on tatami 
           mats in open doorways. Old women beside them solicit the 
           johns. Nick and Takeshi “escort” a drunk, belligerent john 
           out of their district, face first into pavement.

           A SHOP SELLING GINGER. A small kadomatsu plant on the 
           counter. The PROPRIETOR hands Nick cash. Protection money.

           MITSUDA’S HOUSE. Mitsuda sweats over the blood and ink on 
           Nick’s back. The dragon is gaining color. Becoming real.

           AN ONSEN. The Matsuoka brothers fill a public bath house. 
           Steam and tattoos everywhere and Nick just watches as some of 
           the others enjoy being bathed by a few SISTERS (women also 
           adorned with tattoos). KIYOSHI smirks, nudges Nick for 
           staring. But we know what Nick’s really thinking about...

           MATSUOKA HQ. Nick hands Eiichi a thick, cash-shaped PACK 
           WRAPPED IN WHITE PAPER, A FAMILIAR BLACK BOW. And - 
           DOWNSTAIRS. He barely glimpses at Miyu as she serves drinks. 
           She tries to stop herself from looking over.

           MIYU’S HOUSE - DAYTIME. He’s inside her. Tattoos blending. 
           Faces close, their hands intertwined. She looks up out her 
           window, blissful as red maple leaves fall over Japan and -

           INT. CORNER OFFICE - DAY

           BACH’S POLONAISE sounds tinnier now as it comes from the tiny 
           speaker on a small portable, PERSONAL RADIO.

           Akihiro and Ryo sit across an incredibly expensive desk from 
           the sharply-dressed 30-something STOCK BROKER holding the 
           radio. Smiling, impressed with his own demonstration, the 
           broker clicks the radio off for emphasis:
                                 STOCK BROKER
                        <They’re new to the Tokyo Exchange 
                        and the offering is unprecedented.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Do I look like a radio salesman?>

                                 STOCK BROKER
                        <I’m not selling you radios, I’m 
                        selling you stock. In ten years, 
                        they’ll be making more than radios. 
                        After the IPO, they’ll be pouring 
                        money into research. TV, auto 
                        technology... they have a 
                        subsidiary in the US.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Sony. What the fuck is that? What 
                        does Sony mean?>

                                 STOCK BROKER
                        <They say it comes from Latin.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Latin? Fuck!>

                                 RYO
                        <With 400,000 shares, we’d have a 
                        controlling stake.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <And it’ll cost us 400 million yen. 
                        And make this asshole rich off us.>
                             (to stock broker)
                        <You think I’m stupid?>

           Orochi speaks up from where he sits with Kiyoshi, on the 
           pristine white couch against the wall. Cocky and pedantic:

                                 OROCHI
                        <He said himself there are two 
                        Tokyo families willing to buy in 
                        and split the 400 ->

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <You want us in business with the 
                        Tetsu family?? Are you sick!?>

                                 OROCHI
                        <I’m sick of making less money than 
                        a FUCKING USED CAR SALESMAN!>
           Immediate silence. Akihiro doesn’t know hot to respond to the 
           pure insolence. Ryo glares at Orochi. Turns his look to the 
           broker, apologetic. And the broker tries to salvage things:

                                 STOCK BROKER
                        <Look. I have the best seats in the 
                        house for the last day of the sumo 
                        honbasho in Tokyo. Bring whoever 
                        you want. The Tokyo families will 
                        be there. If you don’t agree to a 
                        deal, forget about the stock, enjoy 
                        the matches.>

           To avoid any further animosity, Ryo stands, bows.

           I/E. CHEVY - PARKED ON THE STREET - LATER

           Outside, Ryo helps Akihiro into a waiting Chevy. The loud 
           clash of construction. Ryo gets in. Akihiro huffs:

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Stock markets. A yakuza’s place is  
                        down here, in the streets.>

           Ryo looks up, out the window. Above the streets, the steel 
           skeleton of a new building crawls with workers. Osaka’s 
           future. The old man doesn’t even see it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CUBAN BAR - NIGHT

           Mambo music. Dark red lights and dancing. But from the 
           private section, Orochi finds it all pathetic, small and 
           dirty. He sits alone with Kiyoshi.

                                 OROCHI
                        <How many nights have we spent 
                        here?>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <I don’t count my days.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <You should.>
                             (off Kiyoshi’s glare)
                        <I’ve known you for thirteen years. 
                        You’ve always been strong. You’ve 
                        always been able to see weakness.>
                             (beat)
                        <Akihiro is weak.>
                                 KIYOSHI
                        <The only weakness I see is yours. 
                        Don’t mistake your ambition for 
                        strength.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <He invited a gaijin into our 
                        family.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <No. I invited a gaijin into our 
                        family.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <And he accepted. He should’ve 
                        stopped you like he should’ve 
                        stopped me today. He let me 
                        humiliate him in front of 
                        everyone.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <He could’ve asked for your finger 
                        today.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <If he was a man, he would.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <He’s our father. He took us both 
                        in from the street. Do you forget 
                        that?>

                                 OROCHI
                        <Our “father” is getting old.>

           They’re at an impasse. Orochi sees Nick and Takeshi 
           approaching from the bar. Stands abruptly.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Akihiro loves you as a son.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <No. He loves you.>

           And Orochi leaves, bitter. He bumps shoulders roughly with 
           Nick as he goes. Nick sits down, confused.

                                 NICK
                        What was that?
           INT. ANTEROOM - MATSUOKA FAMILY HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Orochi walks drunk to the smoke room door. Knocks. But the 
           younger shatei sitting by the door stands up, blocks Orochi.

                                 SHATEI
                        <He doesn’t want to see you.>
                             (off Orochi’s glare)
                        <I’m sorry, sir.>

           Orochi is fury and disbelief.

           INT. MATSUOKA GAMBLING HALL - NIGHT

           Miyu checks the clock. 1:55. Almost done. She pours two 
           watered down draft beers, puts them on a tray and rounds the 
           bar. She heads for one of the busy card tables as she sees -

           Orochi enters, fuming. He doesn’t see her yet. Heads for the 
           same card table, sits and tosses way too much cash on the 
           table. The PATRONS go quiet, nervous to gamble with a yakuza.

           The DEALER hesitates, deals him in. And before Orochi sees 
           his cards, he sees Miyu. She avoids eye contact. But -

                                 OROCHI
                        <Beer. Not one of the watered down 
                        ones you gave these fuckers.>

           She’s uncomfortable. So are the other players.

                                 OROCHI
                        <Don’t look at me like that.>

           She nods, eyes lowered. Goes to the kitchen.

           Orochi simmers at the table. Looking dissatisfied with the 
           cards as they come out. And...

           ANOTHER HOSTESS comes out with Orochi’s beer.

                                 OROCHI
                        <Where is she?>

                                 THE OTHER HOSTESS
                        <Her shift’s over.>

           Orochi gets up, pushes past her, leaving his cash and cards.
           INT. THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           He closes the kitchen door behind him. Locks it. And Miyu 
           looks back at him, trying to hide any semblance of fear.

           He pulls a thick stack of cash from his jacket. Thumbing 
           bills out. Stops after several thousand. Looks at her:

                                 OROCHI
                        <How much?>

                                 MIYU
                        <I’m not seventeen anymore.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <You can use your hands.>

           She just stares back. So he sets the cash on the counter. 
           Steps toward her, hand on his gun.

                                 OROCHI (CONT’D)
                        <Unzip me.>

                                 MIYU
                        <No.>

           Her eyes are defiant and -

           CRACK! He hammers her across the face with the gun - she 
           falls, glasses shatter and -

           WHUMP! He kicks her in the face -

           She cowers, arms over her head, balled up, trying to stop the 
           blood from coming out of her nose and mouth. She looks up -

           HE’S POINTING THE GUN AT HER FACE. She’s expecting the worst 
           now. But he jams his gun back in his belt.

                                 OROCHI
                        <You’re still a whore. See?>

           He tosses the cash onto her. Bills fluttering. And he leaves 
           her there bleeding. Crumpled cash around her.

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Nick gets home. Flicks the lights on. Weird. The place is 
           empty. He walks around, searching. Empty bed. Empty bathroom.
           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Nick wakes up on his bed in the same position in which he 
           fell asleep. Sitting up, still in his clothes, watching the 
           door. Still alone.

           EXT. MIYU’S HOUSE - MORNING

           He walks through the garden to Miyu’s house. Wary of anyone 
           who might see him here. He gets to the door. Knocks. Waits. 
           Knocks again. Tries the door handle. Locked. He walks around -

           BEHIND THE HOUSE. Back door’s unlocked. He goes in -

           INT. MIYU’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The floor creaks under him. No sign of life or movement. But 
           the bedroom’s RICE PAPER DOOR is closed. Nick approaches. As 
           he reaches to slide the door, he stops. Sees -

           The silhouette of a hand holding the door shut.

                                 NICK
                        Where were you last night?

           Her silhouette speaks. A soft shadow against the paper.

                                 MIYU (O.S.)
                        <Who said you could come in?>

                                 NICK
                        Open the door.

                                 MIYU (O.S.)
                        <It’s not a “door”, it’s shoji.>

                                 NICK
                        Can you open the shoji?

                                 MIYU (O.S.)
                        <What would you do if I told you I 
                        was fucking someone else?>

                                 NICK
                        Open the door.

                                 MIYU (O.S.)
                        <I’m fucking someone else.>

           NICK FORCES THE DOOR OPEN and freezes on the spot -
           Her face. Bruised and scabbed. Her lip split where it was 
           crushed between tooth and shoe. Nick’s stomach twists up.

                                 NICK
                        Who did that to you?

           She tries to close the door, he gets in the way -

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Who did that to you!?

                                 MIYU
                        Go -

                                 NICK
                        When did this happen!?

                                 MIYU
                        Last night.

                                 NICK
                        Motherfucker! Who did it!? Who hit 
                        you!? Your brother!?

           Now SHE EXPLODES.

                                 MIYU
                        NO! It isn’t your business! You 
                        understand that? Wakari masu-ka?!?

           She grabs the shoji door, shutting it and -

           CRASH! Nick rips the door off its rails - paper rips and wood 
           splinters in his hand, drawing blood, fury bursting - CRACK! 
           He heaves what’s left of the door across the room.

           She’s stunned silent.

           He stares down at what he’s done to the door, his fury 
           quieted by shame. He sits on the floor, holding his bleeding 
           hand. And she kneels beside him, calm and quiet now:

                                 MIYU
                             (re: the outburst)
                        It’s what I like about you. But I’m 
                        not going to tell you what you want 
                        to hear. And I don’t want you to 
                        ask me again. I can take care of 
                        myself.

           He turns, looks in her eyes. They’re nose-to-nose now, her 
           voice filled with confidence in him:
                                 MIYU (CONT’D)
                        Go to work. Show them what you’re 
                        made of.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KURAMAE KOKUGIKAN HALL - SUMO ARENA - TOKYO - EVENING

           People mob the streets outside the Kuramae sumo hall. 
           Colorful, twenty-foot tall banners wave in support of 
           wrestlers. And the tournament drums bang loudly to announce 
           the high-ranking bouts are about to begin.

           CONSPICUOUS, EXPENSIVE AMERICAN CARS press through the mass 
           of people outside the hall. Yakuza with their suits and 
           sunglasses ride inside, unfazed by the madness.

           INT. THE ARENA - KURAMAE KOKUGIKAN HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           The arena is a place of sweat and noise. One of the few 
           places in Japan where it’s acceptable to shout like a madman.

           NICK walks with nearly two dozen MATSUOKA FAMILY MEMBERS. All 
           in suits, they surround Akihiro, escorting him to their 
           seats. Down the row from them sit dozens more suit-clad 
           YAKUZA. The Tokyo families. Two old men amidst them:

           TETSU and SANGA. Both in their sixties. The heads of their 
           respective families. They sit in the front row, an open seat 
           beside them. Akihiro takes the seat and the three old men 
           acknowledge each other. It’s an uncomfortable formality.

           Kiyoshi and Nick sit in the row behind Akihiro with the rest 
           of the family. And Nick takes in his surroundings:

           They’re just fifteen feet from the sumo ring. The enormous 
           WRESTLERS are preparing for the bout by throwing SALT into 
           the ring to purify it. The audience is deafening.

                                 KIYOSHI
                             (privately to Nick)
                        <It’s their last bout in the 
                        tournament.>
                             (re: the crowd)
                        <They’re rooting for Hakuryuzan. 
                        He’s the better wrestler. His 
                        record in the tournament is already 
                        13 and 1. Kotonotsuki is only 25 
                        and he’s been average.>

                                 NICK
                        <What’s average?>
                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Seven wins. Seven losses.>

           Nick looks at the two combatants. KOTONOTSUKI (25) is indeed 
           young. And he narrows his eyes viciously as he looks at his 
           opponent, the stronger, taller, more regal HAKURYUZAN (33).

                                 KIYOSHI (CONT’D)
                             (re: Kotonotsuki)
                        <He’s gonna get his ass kicked.>

           AKIHIRO, SANGA AND TETSU. An uncomfortable silence between 
           them as they watch the wrestlers prepare. Until -

                                 TETSU
                        <Have you considered our proposal?>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <I came here for the sumo. Nothing 
                        else.>
                             (off Tetsu’s look)
                        <I believe in tradition. We’re 
                        hustlers, not stock investors.>

                                 TETSU
                        <Hustlers like to gamble.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Only when they know the odds. And 
                        they don’t gamble on radios.>

                                 TETSU
                        <So let’s gamble on this.>
                             (off Akihiro’s look)
                        <Choose your wrestler. If he wins, 
                        I invest where you choose and I pay 
                        for your trip home. If he loses, 
                        you invest with us. 133,000 shares 
                        worth of radios.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                             (suspicious)
                        <Hakuryuzan is guaranteed to win.>

                                 TETSU
                        <If you know the odds, make your 
                        bet.>

           ON NICK. Overhearing this. He shouldn’t be listening. 
           AKIHIRO. He’s eager. Can’t resist a sure bet and -

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Fine...>
           ON NICK. He sees the wrestlers and catches something. A look. 
           The most subtle of acknowledgements from the older to the 
           younger. Like they’re both in on something.

                                 NICK
                        <Don’t.>

           Akihiro turns and glares at Nick for his insolence.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        <I’m sorry, but the young one’s 
                        gonna win. If you’re gonna bet, bet 
                        on him.>

                                 SANGA
                        <Who is this??>

                                 NICK
                             (continuing, to Akihiro)
                        <His record’s 7-7. He has 
                        everything to fight for. One match 
                        makes him a winner or a loser. The 
                        big one’s got nothing to lose. He 
                        might as well throw the match.>

           Nick looks into Akihiro’s eyes, and Akihiro gets it: Nick 
           knows something he doesn’t. But -

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <I’ll bet anyway.>
                             (beat)
                        <On the young one. Kotonotsuki.>

           TAIKO DRUMS POUND. The bout begins.

           The wrestlers face each other and CLAP. POUND their feet down 
           into a wide stance. The crowd goes insane as the two whale-
           sized men spring up and slam into each other -

           Slapping at each other, pulling at each other’s belts, they 
           spin - the crowd responds with each move - FLASH BULBS 
           blinding - and it only lasts thirty seconds, ending when -

           The young upstart Kotonotsuki steps out of the way as 
           Hakuryuzan charges - Kotonotsuki gives an extra push and -

           Hakuryuzan rolls out of the ring. The crowd can’t believe it, 
           aghast, but as the judge points his fan at the young victor -

           They cheer. Sanga looks at Nick, grossly offended. But Tetsu 
           has something else in his eyes. Curiosity.
           INT. THE ARENA - KURAMAE KOKUGIKAN HALL - LATER

           The fans file out of their seats. The tournament is over. 
           Nick and Kiyoshi stand with the family at the top of the 
           arena steps. They watch as -

           AKIHIRO, TETSU and SANGA are still sitting together in their 
           seats by the empty ring. Alone. In discussion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KURAMAE KOKUGIKAN HALL - NIGHT

           The Matsuoka family walks through the dissipating crowd 
           outside the sumo hall. Nick keeps his distance as Kiyoshi 
           walks Akihiro to a black Bel Air.

           But Akihiro stops at the car door. Turns right to Nick:

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Come here.>

           Nick comes close. The other family members continue on to the 
           other cars. And Nick is alone with Akihiro.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <The match was fixed.>

                                 NICK
                        <I know.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Tetsu fixed it, that bastard.>

                        again.>

           And it’s only as he takes his hand away that Nick realizes 
           Akihiro had his hand on Nick’s shoulder. The Bel Air pulls 
           away and Nick turns, proud of himself.

           He walks alone toward a waiting CHEVY a hundred feet ahead. 
           TAKESHI and KIYOSHI getting inside it and -

                                 AN AMERICAN VOICE (O.S.)
                        Nick? Nick Lowell?
           Nick turns to look.

           PAULIE BOWERS (29), an American in a Marine service uniform. 
           He’s standing fifteen feet away on an adjoining side street - 
           a narrow walk of shops and ramen houses lit up bright and 
           crowded after the tournament. Nick stops dead.

                                 PAULIE
                        Captain.

                                 NICK
                        Paulie.

                                 PAULIE
                        You’re fuckin’ kiddin’ me.

           Paulie smirks. Nick looks back, Takeshi and Kiyoshi don’t see 
           him so he steps out of view, toward Paulie, onto -

           THE SIDE STREET

                                 PAULIE
                        You look fuckin’ good for a dead 
                        man. They said you blew your brains 
                        out, no offense.

                                 NICK
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 PAULIE
                        What are you doing here? Where you 
                        been for five years?

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know. Putting the brains 
                        back in my head.

           A man passes, looking at them. And Nick unconsciously pulls 
           Paulie further from the main road, into a dark corner by a 
           Ramen house. Paulie sees Nick’s hand, missing two fingers:

                                 PAULIE
                        Your hand.

                                 NICK
                        It’s nothing.

                                 PAULIE
                        Nothing? The fuck happened?

                                 NICK
                        ...Grenade.
                                 PAULIE
                             (dubious)
                        Alright.

           He notices Nick staring at his uniform and misunderstands 
           why. So he shows off the silver stripe on his shoulder:

                                 PAULIE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, First lieutenant.

                                 NICK
                        Congratulations.

                                 PAULIE
                        It’s bullshit. Three years in 
                        Okinawa. There’s no one to fight 
                        anymore, y’know. So what’s the 
                        point a’this?

           He flicks at his silver stripe. Something dark in his eyes:

                                 PAULIE (CONT’D)
                        You ever miss the violence?

                                 NICK
                        Not really.

                                 PAULIE
                        Looks like you got a good life out 
                        here.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t live here.

                                 PAULIE
                        Yeah? Where you livin’ that you 
                        dress like a fuckin’ lounge singer?

           Nick’s reply is cold. He wants the questions to end here.

                                 NICK
                        Osaka.

                                 PAULIE
                        Osaka? Well, you’re in Tokyo now. 
                        And I’m on leave for another...
                             (checks watch)
                        Eight and a half hours. That’s 
                        enough time to regret somethin’.

                                 NICK
                        I can’t, Paulie.
                                 PAULIE
                        Ten beers, that’s all.

                                 NICK
                        I said I can’t, alright? Do me a 
                        favor, stay here.

                                 PAULIE
                        “Stay here?” You tellin’ me where 
                        to stand? You’re not my Captain 
                        anymore.

                                 NICK
                        No, I’m not. Do what you want. Just 
                        don’t follow me.

           Nick nods his goodbye Japanese-style, Paulie scoffs:

                                 PAULIE
                        Don’t follow you? You can’t talk to 
                        a guy from your own fuckin’ unit?? 
                        You’re acting so goddamn squirrely 
                        if I didn’t know better, I’d say 
                        you were dodging court martial.

           NICK SLAMS PAULIE AGAINST THE GLASS OF A RAMEN RESTAURANT. 
           The patrons inside turn in shock. Paulie seethes.

                                 PAULIE
                        Don’t mess up your suit.
                             (dry, digging at him)
                        I’m just playin’.

                                 NICK
                        Don’t play with me.

           Nick lets go. Knows his temper got the better of him. But he 
           walks off. And Paulie straightens his roughed-up uniform, 
           glaring as Nick leaves.

           EXT. NICK’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

           Nick climbs out of the Chevy after an all night ride. Tired. 
           Takeshi watches him go.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <You look like shit.>
           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick sits on the bed and looks out the window. Osaka. The 
           sunlight is oppressive coupled with his anxiety. He turns on 
           the radio:

           AMERICAN MUSIC. Unnerved, he changes the station.

           TRADITIONAL KOTO MUSIC. Nick lays back. Closes his eyes. At 
           home now. And the koto takes over the soundtrack until we -

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - KISHIWADA - NIGHT

           MAYHEM IN THE STREETS.

           The Kishiwada Danjiri Matsuri is a street festival but it’s 
           better described as a mad frenzy. People line the streets, 
           packed shoulder to shoulder. They wait, cheer and watch as 
           wooden shrines on wheels (danjiri) roll through the streets 
           loaded with paper lanterns and DRUMMERS. Each danjiri is 
           pulled by a crew of about 100 people with ropes. The crews 
           pull the danjiri slowly at first and then ready themselves, 
           SHOUTING... before RACING them through the streets.

           It’s dangerous as hell and every year since 1703, people die.

           Nick, Kiyoshi and Takeshi watch from inside a bar that has 
           been taken over by the Matsuoka family:

           INT. STREETSIDE BAR - SAME

           Bottles everywhere. A TRASHY GIRL sits on Nick’s lap, drunk. 
           Her hand pays too much attention to his upper thigh but he 
           doesn’t seem to notice, maybe because GIRLS are also sitting 
           on Kiyoshi and Takeshi’s laps.

           They all race to the bottom of a round of drinks.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <If your dad made textiles you must 
                        know all about them. What’s this?>

                                 THE GIRL ON TAKESHI’S LAP
                        <That’s cotton.>

                                 TAKESHI
                             (his hand slides to where 
                              skirt meets stockings)
                        <And this?>
                                 THE GIRL ON TAKESHI’S LAP
                        <Nylon.>
                             (as his hand moves up)
                        <That... I can’t say out loud.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                             (to the girl on his lap)
                        <Sorry for my friend.>

           Nick just stares out the window at the insanity.

                                 NICK
                        They do this every year?

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Since 1700.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Akihiro used to pull those things 
                        when he was a kid so every year he 
                        buys out a shitty bar and makes us 
                        all come and watch. He even invites 
                        our fucking card dealers.>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <At least he foots the bill.>

                                 OROCHI
                             (sarcastic)
                        <Akihiro looks out for us. He puts 
                        girls in our laps.>
                             (directly to Nick)
                        <But the world is full of easy 
                        girls.>

           Orochi blows smoke rings. Smirks at Nick from behind his 
           sunglasses. No girl in his lap. And Nick is suddenly aware of 
           the girl in his, she’s rubbing his hair. He moves her hand.

                                 NICK
                        Why don’t you sit with him?

                                 THE GIRL
                        <I like your lap.>

           She rubs his hair. Kiyoshi smiles. Nick hides discomfort.

           ACROSS THE BAR. MIYU enters with her co-worker, the hostess 
           Orochi shoved past before assaulting Miyu.

                                 THE HOSTESS FRIEND
                        <I told you. All yakuza and 
                        hookers. I don’t wanna get groped 
                        tonight, thanks.>
           But Miyu seems distracted. She’s looking for something.

           NICK. The girl in his lap grabs his hand, slides it along her 
           thigh, making him feel her stockings.

                                 THE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        <You know what this is?>

           And she turns his face toward hers as -

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Your sister’s here.>

           NICK JERKS AWAY FROM THE GIRL. DRINKS SPILL AND CRASH.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <What the fuck!?>

                                 NICK
                        <She pulled my hand.>

           Nick hurries away from the booth, wiping his pants with a 
           handful of napkin. Kiyoshi stares, suspicious.

                                 THE GIRL
                        <I think I made him nervous.>

           NICK sees Miyu. She’s heading toward the exit. Shit. He can’t 
           follow, everyone’s eyes are on him. He heads to the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nick locks the door behind him. Finds the open window...

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           He emerges on the street, scanning wildly for Miyu. The 
           danjiri race down the streets of Kishiwada, people shout. A 
           cacophony and it’s impossible to find anyone here.

           Nick presses through people so forcefully that he leaves near 
           fist-fights in his wake. But he sees her ahead. She’s 
           crossing, right in front of a moving danjiri -

           Nick runs after her, in danger of being stampeded -

                                 NICK
                        Miyu!

           As they get to the other side, she finally turns to face him. 
           She doesn’t even look upset. It puts Nick off-balance.
                                 MIYU
                        Your pants are wet.

                                 NICK
                        I spilled.

                                 MIYU
                        I know.

                                 NICK
                        Let me explain.

                                 MIYU
                        Why?

                                 NICK
                        You’re upset.

                                 MIYU
                        No, you’re upset because you feel 
                        guilty. But you’re wrong to feel 
                        that. You should fuck whoever you 
                        want. That’s what I do.

           The words hurt.

                                 NICK
                        It isn’t what I do.
                             (off her shrug)
                        You can’t pretend you don’t care 
                        about me.

                                 MIYU
                        I care about you. But that’s all. I 
                        don’t know what you think this is.

           He looks in her eyes. There’s no feeling there. Did he 
           imagine all of it?

                                 NICK
                        Why’d you leave the bar?

                                 MIYU
                        My friend wanted to leave.

           Nick sees Miyu’s hostess friend, standing impatiently in the 
           crowd twenty feet ahead, wondering what all this is about.

                                 MIYU (CONT’D)
                        Go have fun. Get drunk. Someone 
                        might see you with me.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t care.
                                 MIYU
                        You should.

                                 NICK
                        Don’t fucking walk away from me!

                                 MIYU
                        Why not?!

                                 NICK
                        Because I’m talking to you!

                                 MIYU

                                 NICK
                        No, don’t do that! Talking Japanese 
                        like I’m just some guy.

                                 MIYU
                        You’re the fourth guy I’ve been 
                        with. There will be a fifth.

                                 NICK
                        Bullshit. Marry me.

                                 MIYU
                        Fuck you!

                        Fuck me??

                                 MIYU
                        I DON’T LOVE YOU.

                                 NICK
                        The fuck does that matter!? In this 
                        country, you people marry each 
                        other because you think you’re 
                        getting too old, no one’s gonna 
                        want you. Or maybe the guy’s gonna 
                        be rich some day and the girl’s 
                        young and pretty and that’s enough, 
                        right?

                                 MIYU
                        That’s not who I am.

                                 NICK
                        I know. So marry me.

           The world around them is a blur. Her eyes are wet. Suddenly -
           THUMP! KIYOSHI grabs Nick by the collar - Takeshi tries to 
           pull him back but Kiyoshi is pure drunk violence -

                                 MIYU
                        <Get off him!>

           Kiyoshi SLAMS Nick against a danjiri, the drummers stop, 
           everyone turns to watch -

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Defend yourself!>

                                 NICK
                        I’m not gonna hit you.

           He drives Nick to the ground, slamming his back to pavement.

                                 MIYU
                        <Get the fuck off him!>

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Why shouldn’t I kill him? Huh?>

                                 MIYU
                        <Because we’re getting married!>

           Kiyoshi stops. Looks up at his sister. Sees her eyes. And -

           HE LAUGHS. Drunken violence becomes joy. He slams Nick down 
           again, playfully this time. And again. And then he pulls Nick 
           back up to his feet and -

           HUGS HIM.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <We’re gonna be brothers?>

           But Nick just stares at Miyu. Is she for real?

           EXT. SHINTO SHRINE - DAY

           OROCHI’S SUNGLASSES reflect a wedding procession.

           It’s spring and the cherry blossoms are out. The Matsuoka 
           family, in their suits and sunglasses, watches outside as -

           A SHINTO PRIEST and two MAIDENS lead Nick and Miyu, in their 
           kimonos, into the shrine. Kiyoshi and some OLDER RELATIVES 
           with them.
           INT. SHINTO SHRINE - DAY

           The maidens dance their ritual to deliver sacred evergreen 
           sprigs to Nick and Miyu, who sit before the shrine. They look 
           in each other’s eyes as they exchange the sprigs.

           Kiyoshi watches his sister stare at Nick, nervous.

           INT. GATHERING ROOM - LATER

           Laughter and clinking glasses. Everyone drinks and eats in 
           one of the shrine’s anterooms. Some are drunk. OROCHI watches 
           across the room as -

           NICK SITS WITH AKIHIRO. THUD. TWO SHEATHED SAMURAI SWORDS 
           BOUND TOGETHER BY ROPE. One long, one short at just two feet. 
           Akihiro puts them on the table in front of Nick.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <You know what that is?>

                                 NICK
                        I think so.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <When I married my first wife, my 
                        father gave me a gift. I hadn’t 
                        seen him in six or seven years, he 
                        was drunk as usual. But he sat me 
                        down after the wedding and he put 
                        two swords on the table. Like this. 
                        We were alone. He said, “Do you 
                        know what that is?” I don’t 
                        remember what I said but it was 
                        something smartass cause he hit me 
                        hard across the face, which he 
                        hadn’t done since I was a boy.>

           The story is vivid for Akihiro. Nick finds himself staring.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <He grabbed me by the collar and he 
                        said, “This is a daisho. Long and 
                        short. One for war and one for 
                        honor. One to kill and one to 
                        decapitate. One for murder, one for 
                        suicide.” Katana and wakizashi.>
                             (re: wakizashi)
                        <This never left a samurai’s side, 
                        even in sleep. It was his honor.>
                             (beat)
                        <You have a home to watch over now. 
                        Take it.>
           As Nick feels the weight of the gift in his hands, Kiyoshi 
           talks across the table, a joke with meaning behind it:

                                 KIYOSHI
                        He’s trying to say the short one’s 
                        for cutting off anyone’s dick who 
                        goes near her.

           BACK WITH OROCHI. He turns to Banjo beside him.

                                 OROCHI
                        <Do you remember when the emperor 
                        surrendered?>

                                 BANJO
                        <I was ten.>

           EIICHI sits next to Orochi. Pours them both drinks. Nods 
           knowingly. A suspicious camaraderie as they both drink.

           And Orochi just stares at Nick.

           INT. NICK AND MIYU’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nick and Miyu walk into their new single-story home. It’s 
           Miyu’s first time here. The place is small and typical but 
           she’s in awe because it’s theirs.

                                 MIYU
                        Is this going to be different now? 
                        We were just... sex. And now 
                        there’s this house.

                                 NICK
                        I chose it cause it looked like a 
                        good place to have sex.

           That pushes her anxiety away. She looks at his shirt.

                                 MIYU
                        Can I see it?

           Nick knows what she means. He stands there as she unbuttons 
           his shirt. Gently pulls it off him. And looks at his back:

           COVERED IN TATTOOS NOW. The Mizuchi design is finished. The 
           shading is dark and intense.

                                 MIYU
                        Do you feel like a dragon now?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miyu lays on Nick. They’re asleep, or at least Nick is until -

                                 MIYU
                        Do you want a baby?

                                 NICK
                        ...what?

                                 MIYU
                        Do you want a baby?

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know.

           He starts slipping back to sleep.

                                 MIYU
                        I’m pregnant.

                                 NICK
                        What?

                                 MIYU
                        I’m pregnant.

                                 NICK
                        You’re pregnant? With a baby?

                                 MIYU
                        Yes.

           He sits up. Wide awake now.

                                 MIYU (CONT’D)
                        Do you want a baby with me?

                                 NICK
                        Do I have a choice?

                                 MIYU
                        Yes.

           The silence is oppressive.

                                 NICK
                        Jesus. Yes. Yeah.
                             (beat)
                        Do you want a baby with me?

           She nods. Wipes her eyes, the only indication that she might 
           have been crying.
                                 NICK
                        Okay, can we go to bed now?

           She climbs on top of him. Puts him inside her. And as she 
           moves, he looks into her possessed eyes, for the first time 
           his mind goes to Japanese before English:

                                 NICK
                        <You’re crazy.>

           But that’s what he wants.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - KITA, OSAKA - DAY

           A lone CICADA chatters as it clings to a tree. Osaka is green 
           now, the cherry blossoms long gone.

           INT. ENTRYWAY - SILK TAILOR - SAME

           A KADOMATSU PLANT sits in the entry to a SILK TAILOR’s shop. 
           The tailor watches anxiously through the storefront:

           OUTSIDE. A CHEVY BEL AIR pulls to a stop. Nick and Kiyoshi 
           step out. They help Akihiro climb out. The old man seems 
           tired as Kiyoshi opens the door for him and they step -

           INSIDE.

                                 THE SILK TAILOR
                        <Matsuoka-san.>

           The tailor bows. Sweating despite the fan behind the counter.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Don’t bow.>

           Akihiro starts walking back into the workshop. And the tailor 
           escorts him, nervously nodding to Nick and Kiyoshi as they 
           sit in the chairs by the counter.

           They wait alone.

           The cicadas buzz. And Nick watches through the storefront as -

           A YOUNG WOMAN (20) walks by the store. She’s tall, thin, 
           pretty, enough makeup to be a little tasteless. And she 
           glances in as she passes. Smiles suggestively at Kiyoshi.

           Kiyoshi doesn’t smile back. Just coldly watches her walk by.
                                 NICK
                        You’re gonna die alone.

                                 KIYOSHI
                             (dry)
                        I only like virgins.

           Nick smiles. Watches the girl as she crosses the street to -

           A PARKED YELLOW AND WHITE ‘53 FORD CROWN VICTORIA. A shiny 
           American import. The girl leans in the window, talking to 
           someone. Nick sits up, suspicious now and -

           INT. CHANGING ROOM - SAME

           Akihiro stands alone in a small changing area partitioned off 
           by silk. He tries on a kimono, examines the fabric. Lost in 
           his own world, oblivious as -

           INT. SILK WORKSHOP - SAME

           The tailor sweats in the dark of the workshop. He watches:

           THE BACK DOOR OPENS QUIETLY. A figure enters, face in shadow. 
           In his hand - a length of CORD. The tailor nods and looks 
           away. And the figure stalks right for the changing area.

           INT. ENTRYWAY - SAME

           Nick stares out the storefront, wary, he stands up.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <What?>

                                 NICK
                        Crown Victoria.

           Kiyoshi looks out at the car. Anxious now as Nick signals him 
           to watch it and walks back into the dark of the workshop -

           INT. SILK WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                                 NICK
                        Akihiro? <Tailor?>

           No response. Just the LOUD BUZZ OF CICADAS. Loud because - 

           THE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE SHOP IS OPEN. Adrenaline pulses 
           now as Nick senses the presence of the enemy and bolts for -
           THE SILK PARTITION. Nick rips silk down -

           AKIHIRO IS CHOKING - a GARROTE PULLED TIGHT AROUND HIS THROAT 
           BY A YOUNG KILLER and -

           Nick grabs the killer by the throat, shoves him back - 
           Akihiro is freed, gasping - as the killer CLAWS at Nick and -

                                 NICK
                        Kiyoshi!!!

           SILK RIPS from its hangers and Nick and the killer are 
           wrapped up, as they -

           SLAM! against the loom. The killer shoves at Nick’s face, 
           forcing his chin up -

           SILK THREADS TANGLE AROUND THEM as suddenly -

           SHIK! SHIK! SHIK! BLOOD EVERYWHERE because KIYOSHI STABS the 
           killer over and over and over -

           The killer goes limp - SHIK! SHIK! SHIK!

           Blood pouring out, over Kiyoshi’s hands, Nick’s suit, it runs 
           and drips along silk threads -

           Kiyoshi finally stops stabbing and sees the killer’s face:

           BANJO. Dead. Kiyoshi grips BLOODY SHEERS in his hand. 
           Speechless until he looks at Nick, covered in blood.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        <You okay?>

           Nick nods. And Kiyoshi moves for Akihiro, helps him up. Nick 
           extricates himself from the tangle of silk and lends a hand. 
           The old man processes the fact that he’s not dead.

           And then he sees Banjo’s face. It breaks his heart.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The cicadas are incessant as Nick and Kiyoshi walk Akihiro 
           through the narrow alley behind the silk shop. Just a small 
           walkway between backs of buildings that seem to be 
           haphazardly crammed up against each other.

           Only one way to go, they follow the path quietly to a GATE 
           that separates the alley from the main street beyond. They 
           stop a moment. Akihiro sitting, holding his bruised throat.
                                 KIYOSHI
                        <Fucking tailor ran.>

           Kiyoshi leans against the gate, peers out between the cracks - 
           all clear. So he opens the gate, steps out -

           B-B-BANG-B-BANG! Gunfire blasts through the streets - 
           disorienting as Kiyoshi goes down and Nick lunges for him, 
           pulling him back from the gate and covering him as -

           B-B-B-B-BANG! WOOD SPLINTERS off the sides of buildings. TWO 
           YAKUZA with snub-nosed revolvers who run out of bullets and 
           bolt back into THE IDLING CROWN VIC, SHOUTING -

           TIRES SQUEAL -

           The Vic screams away - ONE OF THE GUNMAN hanging out the 
           window, RED-TINTED GLASSES AND A FACE NICK WON’T FORGET. But -

           KIYOSHI. Blood pumps out from a hole in his ribcage -

                                 NICK
                        NO!

           Nick holds Kiyoshi in his lap, presses his hand hard against 
           the wound but the blood just courses out between his fingers. 
           Kiyoshi looks up at him, trying to speak but can’t -

           He knows now that he’s dying. He grabs Nick’s hand. Locks 
           eyes with his friend. Kiyoshi actually looks at peace as he 
           pulls Nick’s hand away from the wound. Let it happen. The 
           blood runs.

                                 KIYOSHI
                        Brother.

           Kiyoshi fades. And he looks into Nick’s eyes even in death.

           INT. THE SMOKE ROOM - MATSUOKA HQ - NIGHT

           Akihiro’s hands shake as he lights a cigarette. An emergency 
           meeting. But his soldiers don’t quite seem to fill the room.

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Who’s missing?>

                                 RYO
                        <Besides Orochi?>
                             (he reads a list)
                        <Yasushi, Hiro, Shuichi, Kanji...>

           The soldiers listen in disbelief to the number of defectors.
                                 RYO (CONT’D)
                        <Taro, Ichiro, Kazuo, Kon.>
                             (this one for emphasis)
                        <And Eiichi.>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <He’ll come.>

           Akihiro looks at Eiichi’s empty desk. Ryo’s not so sure.

                                 AKIHIRO (CONT’D)
                        <That car was full of Seizu, not 
                        our people.>

                                 RYO
                        <Because Orochi made a deal with 
                        them. He wants to seize power for 
                        himself by allying with the Seizu. 
                        It would be dangerous to go to war 
                        now with a fifth of your soldiers 
                        defected.>

                                 NICK
                        Fuck you. <Dangerous? It would be 
                        dangerous not to go to war.>

                                 RYO
                        <You’re emotional.>

           No shit. Nick boils, still covered in Kiyoshi’s blood. But 
           Akihiro stops a fight before it starts.

                                 AKIHIRO
                             (re: Nick)
                        <I’m making him my second in 
                        command.>

                                 RYO
                        <He’s a wakagashira now?>

                                 AKIHIRO
                        <Who else?>
                             (beat, Ryo has no answer)
                        <When my wakagashira says we should 
                        go to war, I listen.>

                                 RYO
                        <What about your senior advisor? 
                        What about the rest of the family?>

                                 AKIHIRO
                             (to all)
                        <Who wants to go to war?>
           The men look at him, nervous. But TAKESHI steps forward. 
           SATORU too. Subordinates follow, they can’t turn down the 
           boss. And Ryo is resigned to his fate as always. It’s war.

           INT. FURNACE - DAY

           KIYOSHI lies in a box in the dark. Dignity even in death as -

           FLAMES RISE UP AROUND HIM. An inferno.

           INT. CREMATORIUM - SAME

           Nick stares at the closed furnace. Miyu next to him. He looks 
           at her expecting tears, but instead she speaks breathlessly:

                                 MIYU
                        Kill them for me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. A DARK TATAMI ROOM - NIGHT

           Nick, Takeshi and Satoru sit cross-legged around a table in a 
           small, dark tea room. They look at each other with shared 
           purpose. On the table before them -

           AN URN.

           Takeshi takes the top off the urn. Picks it up with both 
           hands, and brings it up above his chin. He opens his jaw -

           POURS SOME ASH INTO HIS MOUTH. Stops. Swallows the ash whole. 
           He passes the urn to Satoru.

           Who performs the same ritual. And passes on to -

           NICK holds the urn. He stares into the abyss inside. Lifts it 
           up. And pours Kiyoshi’s soul into his own.

           He sets the urn down. Stares at it. Filled with power.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. A HIGH-RISE HOTEL - TOKYO - NIGHT

           A TAXI pulls to a stop outside an expensive western-style 
           hotel in Tokyo. And out from the backseat steps -

           A man in RED GLASSES. The gunman from the Crown Vic. A tall, 
           blonde woman steps out after him: a RUSSIAN PROSTITUTE.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           The gunman lays on the bed as the woman unbuckles his belt, 
           unzips his pants. And pulls something out of her bag -

           HANDCUFFS.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        <What the fuck is that?>

                                 THE PROSTITUTE
                        <It’s fun.>

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        <You think I’m gay??>

                                 THE PROSTITUTE
                        <You can put them on me later.>

           He likes that. So she raises his hands behind his head, her 
           big-bra-clad-breasts hanging in his face. And -

           SHE LOCKS HIS HANDS together behind the headboard. And steps 
           away from him. He follows her eyes to the bathroom:

           The bathroom light flicks on and -

           NICK AND TAKESHI POINT SILENCED .22’S AT HIM. The gunman eyes 
           his 9MM, on his jacket all the way across the room. Shit.

           Nick points the .22 at the bastard’s head.

                                 NICK
                        <Who was in the car with you?>

           The gunman just looks Nick in the eyes. Smirks.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Gaijin.

                                 NICK
                        <Name them.>

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        <Fuck you.>

           TWIP! TWIP! TWIP! BLOOD SPITS ACROSS THE PILLOW as Nick 
           unloads into the gunman’s face. Dead in an instant.

           Takeshi looks down at the guy as blood spreads through the 
           pillowcase like spilled ink and he raises his own gun -

           TWIP! TWIP! The head jerks subtly with the impact of bullets.
           Nick hands the Russian girl a thick envelope, wrapped with a 
           black bow. They exit. She stares at the body.

           INT. MEETING ROOM - SEIZU HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Orochi and Eiichi sit with Hiromitsu Seizu at the Seizu 
           headquarters. Everything is gold and glass and gaudy. 
           Hiromitsu hangs up a phone. Livid with the bad news.

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <Your man was supposed to kill 
                        him.>

                                 OROCHI
                        <I made a promise to you and I’m 
                        going to keep it. Unlike Akihiro, 
                        I’m a man of honor.>

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <We’re on the verge of a war now! 
                        Don’t patronize me.>

           Orochi bristles, but he lowers his head. Eiichi interjects.

                                 EIICHI
                        <The Matsuoka family is too small 
                        and disorganized to pose a threat. 
                        Trust me, there will be no war.>

           BOOM! The windows SHATTER, the building SHAKES. Lights flick 
           out. The explosion came from downstairs.

           EXT. SEIZU HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Hiromitsu hurries out onto the street, Seizu soldiers flank 
           him protectively as he watches -

           FIREFIGHTERS put out the blaze in the entryway.

           EXT. NICK AND MIYU’S HOUSE - MORNING

           A BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE of the aftermath of the Seizu bombing 
           dominates the front page of the OSAKA MAINICHI NEWSPAPER.

           Miyu picks the paper up from the doorstep. Looks at the 
           image, tired in her work clothes as she steps inside -

           INT. NICK AND MIYU’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           But before she can close the door -
                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Excuse me.

           A WHITE AMERICAN WOMAN (30) stands in the doorway. Long brown 
           hair expensively done-up. An air of education and wealth.

                                 THE WHITE WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you speak English?
                             (off Miyu’s silence)
                        I’m looking for Nick Lowell. Does 
                        he live here?

                                 MIYU
                        Yes.

           The woman’s eyes seem to immediately mist. And Miyu’s eyes 
           narrow. Who is this slut looking for her husband?

                                 THE WHITE WOMAN
                        I’m sorry. Mary. Cartwright. I’m 
                        his sister.

           Miyu looks at Mary’s hand. A wedding ring. Her heels are 
           expensive. Her purse patent leather. From a different world.

                                 MIYU
                        He doesn’t have a sister.

           Mary looks pained. But then she reaches into her purse. Pulls 
           out A PHOTO. We see just a glimpse as Miyu takes the photo in 
           her hand: NICK IN A UNIFORM. She stares at it, breathless.

                                 MARY
                        You must live with him.

                                 MIYU
                        He’s in Tokyo.

                                 MARY
                        Would you mind if I...

           Mary peers inside past Miyu, who steps out of the way, in a 
           daze. And Miyu watches as Mary enters, her heels click across 
           the floor, American custom not to take them off.

           ON MARY. Her eyes are wet and she takes in her surroundings 
           like she’s in a museum. Everything at a distance, not to be 
           touched. Vague. Until she reaches the door to the bedroom -

           She looks down at the bed. Slept in. And then she sees -

           THE SAMURAI SWORDS on the wall. The place is decidedly 
           Japanese. Decidedly foreign and unfamiliar.
                                 MIYU
                        You’re in our room.

           Mary looks at Miyu. And then she sees it... Miyu’s belly and 
           oh-my-god. She’s PREGNANT. It takes time to find words.

                                 MARY
                        I’m sorry. Do you know when he’ll 
                        be home?

                                 MIYU
                        I said he’s in Tokyo.

           Miyu waits for Mary to get out of their bedroom.

                                 MARY
                        I understand.

           Mary moves past. But as she steps back into -

           INT. THE MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She stops dead. NICK stands in the doorway.

           Neither can speak. She just stares, studies his face, older 
           than she remembered. In shock.

                                 MARY
                        You’re alive.

                                 NICK
                        Why’d you come here, Mary?

           Miyu sees the raw emotion in both of them.

                                 MIYU
                        <You know her?>

                                 NICK
                        <She’s my sister.>
                             (to Mary, true concern)
                        You shouldn’t be here.

                                 MARY
                        You got older. You’re a man.

                                 NICK
                        What should I be?

                                 MARY
                        We thought you were dead.
                                 NICK
                             (re: the ring on her hand)
                        What’s your name now?

                                 MARY
                        Cartwright.

           There’s a distance between them. The name makes it wider.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        He works for the state department.

                                 NICK
                        Did he pay for this trip?

                                 MARY
                        You don’t have to hide here 
                        anymore. We can make a court 
                        martial go away. You can come home.

                                 NICK
                        I am home.

           She looks in his eyes. A dark history unspoken but 
           understood. And she knows it was a mistake to use the word.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        When did I die?

                                 MARY
                        What kind of question is that?

                                 NICK
                        If you thought I was dead, when did 
                        I die? You remember what day? What 
                        month?

                                 MARY
                        You married one of them.

           Nick looks at Miyu. And he sees the NEWSPAPER in her hand, 
           the BOMBED SEIZU HEADQUARTERS on the front page.

                                 NICK
                             (to Mary)
                        You don’t belong here.

           For the first time, she sees the .22 IN HIS WAISTBAND. She 
           just studies him. Her brother, so long separated now, is 
           utterly foreign to her. An orphan raised by wolves.

           She looks at Miyu, nods an embarrassed apology. And she 
           gathers her dignity, tears in her eyes. She walks outside -
           EXT. NICK AND MIYU’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           And she turns to Nick -

                                 MARY
                        You died on May 2nd, 1948.

                                 NICK
                        I died a long time before that.

           She looks at him for the last time, sees a trace of something 
           familiar, something vulnerable. And then she walks away. 
           Heels clicking and fading until she’s gone from them.

           INT. NICK AND MIYU’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick closes the door. He just stands there. His back to Miyu. 
           Head heavy and he knows the questions are coming.

                                 MIYU
                        You were in the army?

                                 NICK
                        Does it matter?

                                 MIYU
                        Did you kill Japanese?

                                 NICK
                        Yes.
                             (off her silence)
                        And I killed an American.

                                 MIYU
                        Why?

                                 NICK
                        Because he deserved it.

           He turns to face her. She stares, wondering who he is.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got scars on your neck. They 
                        run down your back and they’re 
                        rough to the touch. And I never 
                        asked you where they came from.

                                 MIYU
                        Why not?

                                 NICK
                        Because it doesn’t matter.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICK (CONT'D)
                        Because I know who you are without 
                        knowing that.

           She looks in his eyes and sees truth in there. Puts a hand on 
           the .22 in his waistband. Both afraid and enamored with it.

                                 MIYU
                        Did you use this in Tokyo?

           His silence is an affirmation. He sees the NEWSPAPER on the 
           table behind her. The bombed Seizu headquarters.

                                 NICK
                        Seizu wants a meeting with Akihiro. 
                        If it doesn’t go well, they’ll 
                        bring in more guys from Kobe. I 
                        want you to be safe. Don’t answer 
                        the door for anyone.

                                 MIYU
                        Are you going to the meeting?

                                 NICK
                        Yes.

                                 MIYU
                        Because you’re a wakagashira?

                                 NICK
                        Yes.

                                 MIYU
                        Will you bring this?

           She looks at him, her hand on the gun. Vengeance in her eyes.

                                 NICK
                        He was my brother too.

           EXT. SEIZU HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

           It’s raining. Gray skies. A Seizu brother holds an umbrella 
           over Hiromitsu’s head as he escorts the old man into a 
           waiting Buick. Meanwhile -

           I/E. CHEVY BEL AIR - SAME

           Akihiro slides into the backseat of the Bel Air. Takeshi and 
           Ryo get in on either side of him. Satoru shuts their door and 
           gets in the driver’s seat while Nick waits in shotgun.

           Rain splatters the windows.
                                 AKIHIRO
                        <It’s a beautiful day to watch an 
                        old bastard grovel for peace.>

           Satoru pulls away from the curb.

           NICK’S ANKLE: A BULGE. Nick stares forward, inconspicuous.

           I/E. BUICK - MOVING - SAME

           Hiromitsu looks out the windows of the Buick’s backseat, 
           flanked by his silent soldiers on their way to the meeting.

           EXT. TENNOJI ZOO - DAY

           The rain falls over the gate at Osaka’s TENNOJI ZOO. The 
           place is almost empty due to the weather. A mother and her 
           young daughter walk the footpaths.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

           The Bel Air pulls into the parking lot, puddles of rain water 
           sloshing. It comes to a stop a few spaces from a BUICK.

           Car doors open. The Matsuokas climb out of the Bel Air and 
           Satoru opens an umbrella over Akihiro as -

           TWO SEIZU BROTHERS get out of the Buick.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Where’s Seizu?>

                                 SEIZU BROTHER
                        <You think we’d leave him sitting 
                        in a parking lot for you? He’s in 
                        the zoo. There’re kids in there, so 
                        leave your bombs in the car.>

           Fuming, Takeshi opens his jacket and lifts his shirt to show 
           he has no weapons. The others follow suit. The Seizu too.

                                 SEIZU BROTHER
                        <Okay.>

           They don’t see the bulge at Nick’s ankle. Akihiro signals 
           Satoru to return to the car as the rest of the group walks to 
           the only open TICKET BOOTH.

           The CASHIER tries not to betray his nervousness as the Seizu 
           brother buys six tickets for six yakuza.
           EXT. TENNOJI ZOO - MAIN CONCOURSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Seizu yakuza step to the sides as the Matsuokas walk onto 
           the sparse, main concourse at the zoo. Far ahead, beyond an 
           archway, two men hold an umbrella for the third behind them, 
           waiting. Akihiro glares at the trio as he walks.

           CLOSE ON HIROMITSU. Umbrella over his head, he stares 
           patiently through the rain, stone-faced -

           And as the Matsuokas pass through the archway -

           A MAN JUMPS AKIHIRO -

           SHIK! SHOVES A KNIFE IN HIS THROAT - Akihiro goes down, BLOOD 
           COURSING, horror in his eyes.

           Nick lunges forward but FOUR YAKUZA are on him. In fact, 
           there are four yakuza for each of the Matsuokas. An ambush:

           SIXTEEN SEIZU YAKUZA. Nick and the others struggle but the 
           Seizu force them to their knees. They can only watch as 
           Akihiro bleeds. And -

           HIROMITSU just stares coldly through the rain, but he isn’t 
           looking at Akihiro. Because he isn’t at the zoo. He’s at -

           A BUDDHIST TEMPLE. Looking at the big BUDDHA in front of him. 
           He drops coins in the offering box. Prays. While, far away -

           AT THE ZOO. Akihiro bleeds out from the throat.

                                 SEIZU BROTHER (CONT’D)
                        <The Matsuoka family doesn’t exist 
                        anymore. But Hiromitsu wants you to 
                        live. On Eiichi’s recommendation, 
                        he extends an offer to Ryo and 
                        Takeshi to work with us.>

           Ryo stares hatred up at the man talking. Akihiro’s eyes, 
           glassy and weak, turn up to see Nick. And the Seizu brother 
           turns his attention to Nick as well:

                                 SEIZU BROTHER
                        <For you, on your brother Orochi’s 
                        recommendation, we offer peace if 
                        you leave Osaka and your wife 
                        behind. We make no promises for her 
                        safety if you stay.>
                             (to Ryo)
                        <Do you accept?>
           Akihiro gurgles softly for air as his lungs fill with blood. 
           Nick watches him die, well aware of THE GUN STRAPPED TO HIS 
           ANKLE but just as aware of how outnumbered he is.

                                 TAKESHI
                        <Yes.>

           Nick and Ryo look at Takeshi. Can’t believe what they just 
           heard him say. Takeshi’s face is blank.

                                 SEIZU BROTHER
                        <Then get up. Get out of here. We 
                        know where to find you.>

           The men holding them all loosen their grip. But the three of 
           them - Nick, Ryo and Takeshi - hold for a moment. Eyes on 
           their dead oyabun.

                                 SEIZU BROTHER
                        <I said get out of here.>

           They stand. Nick is seething, doesn’t understand the 
           complacency and that’s when -

           TAKESHI JUMPS A SEIZU like a wild animal. Choking, frenzied - 
           the Seizu swarm him and Nick acts fast, reflexes -

           HE PULLS THE GUN - SHIT! Duct tape blocking the trigger -

           A SEIZU sees him with the gun - aims his 9MM just as Nick 
           rips the tape off, it’s a race and -

           BANG! BANG! NICK FIRES - bullets RIP through the guy but -

           K-BANG! THE GUY FIRES BACK as he falls - Nick’s shin blasts 
           open and he falls and -

           BANG! BANG! Fires at another Seizu who’s pulling a gun - the 
           man’s KNEE IS DESTROYED, blood bursting - the Seizu scramble 
           out of the way of the gunfire -

           And RYO pulls Nick back to his feet as Nick realizes that -

           TAKESHI LIES BLEEDING, THROAT SLIT on the ground. Nick 
           struggles toward Takeshi but Ryo drags him the other way, 
           supporting Nick on his bloody leg. The Seizu close in but -

           BANG! Nick fires indiscriminately, fury in his eyes.

           The Seizu hit the deck as Ryo pulls Nick away fast. Rounding 
           a corner, he helps Nick heave over a fence into -
           A SAVANNAH-STYLE ANIMAL ENCLOSURE. Ryo hops the fence too. 
           Giraffes watch unmoved from within their sad, tall cages as 
           the rain comes down and Nick trails blood across the dirt.

           A YOUNG GIRL (7) stares, her head following the bizarre sight 
           of a bleeding white man being dragged by a Japanese man 
           through a space normally reserved for African mammals.

           TWO-HUNDRED YARDS BACK. The Seizu have scattered, leaving 
           bloody bodies to be pummelled by the rain:

           Akihiro. Takeshi.

           It’s quiet now but for the rain. LIONS prowl, defending their 
           small, fenced-in domain against nothing in particular.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RAMEN RESTAURANT - DAY

           Customers eat ramen. A KADOMATSU PLANT sits by the cash 
           register. No indication of what’s going on in the -

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Ryo kneels by Nick as a COOK wraps Nick’s bleeding leg. Nick 
           winces, talking through gritted teeth.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t want your fuckin’ money.

                                 RYO
                        What do you want?

                                 NICK
                        Whaddayou think I want?

                                 RYO
                        <If you don’t leave Osaka, they 
                        will find you. They won’t care that 
                        she’s pregnant. Take it.>
                             (beat)
                        Take it.

           Nick reluctantly takes crumpled cash from Ryo.

                                 RYO (CONT’D)
                        <They’ll go to your house. Go home 
                        and take her far away from here. 
                        There is no war without you here. I 
                        will not protect you.>
                                 (MORE)
                                 RYO (CONT’D)
                             (to cook)
                        <Get him a cab.>

           Ryo leaves.

           EXT. NICK AND MIYU’S HOUSE - DAY

           The small garden behind Nick and Miyu’s house soaks in the 
           rain. Nick stalks through the wilting flowers, bandages 
           already bloody, paranoid as hell. He moves to the back door -

           KNOCKS ON IT. And ducks back against the siding, gun in hand. 
           He listens and stares at -

           THE WINDOW adjoining the door. A faint reflection that allows 
           him to see -

           THE DOOR. It opens slowly, quietly. Nick ready to shoot but -

           It’s MIYU. She sees his ghostly face. His shin -

                                 MIYU
                        You’re bleeding.

           He limps inside, dripping water -

           INT. NICK AND MIYU’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 NICK
                        I told you not to open the door for 
                        anyone. You remember that??

                                 MIYU
                        What happened?

                                 NICK
                        Pack your clothes, okay?

                                 MIYU
                        What’s going on??

                                 NICK
                        Just pack your fuckin’ clothes!
                             (re: the gun)
                        You wanted me to bring this, right? 
                        You wanted me to bring that!?

           He opens the cylinder and dumps out the bullets - all of them 
           SPENT CASINGS. She watches them jingle out on the counter.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        <Akihiro’s dead.>
           She’s never seen Nick like this. Pale, the rain water drips 
           heavy off his nose like sweat off a death row inmate.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Would you rather live without me?

                                 MIYU
                        What?

                                 NICK
                        Would your rather live without me 
                        or die with me?

           He’s dead serious. It’s frightening. She answers, disbelief:

                                 MIYU
                        Neither.

                                 NICK
                        Then we gotta leave here.

           INT. ROOM 513 - DAY

           A HOTEL ROOM PHONE RINGS. And RINGS. And Rings. And click -

                                 MARY
                        ...Yes... I’ll take it.

           INTERCUT: NICK AT A PAY PHONE, BLEEDING IN THE STEADY RAIN.

                                 NICK
                        You’re still here.

                                 MARY
                        I’m still here. Don’t worry, I’m 
                        leaving.

                                 NICK
                        You’re my sister, right? You’re 
                        still my sister?

           His breathlessness worries her. Fear behind it.

           EXT. MATSUOKA FAMILY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           POLICE swarm outside the Matsuoka headquarters. The black 
           market is closed but the shifty characters who still mill out 
           in the rain slink away at the sight of the cops.
           INT. MATSUOKA GAMBLING HALL - SAME

           The cops raid the gambling hall but there isn’t a yakuza in 
           sight. Just empty tables, empty offices, empty glasses.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OKONOMIYAKI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Ryo and the remaining Matsuokas sit in a familiar Okonomiyaki 
           restaurant. They’ve taken over the second floor room.

                                 RYO
                        <Akihiro’s gone but we still have a 
                        family. You still have a kumicho.>

           The room around him is a roiling mourning and anger. But as 
           he speaks, the brothers look up to Ryo. The man has power. 
           He’s different from Akihiro. Younger, more assured.

                                 RYO (CONT’D)
                        <We still have money. That’s what 
                        gives us power. Not guns and knives 
                        and swords. While the Seizu and the 
                        other families in Osaka and Kobe 
                        are cutting each other down in the 
                        streets, when the cops are clamping 
                        down on them and they’re running 
                        scared, we’ll be winning the real 
                        war. Soon, Japan will be run by 
                        corporations. And we will own 51% 
                        of their stock.>

           He fans out cash like a magician. He has their attention.

           INT. THE SMOKE ROOM - MATSUOKA HQ - DAY (EARLIER SCENE)

           The cops continue their raid into the empty smoke room. The 
           lead DETECTIVE stops dead in his tracks at the sight of:

           GUNS SPLAYED OUT ON THE MEETING TABLE. Dozens of them. And A 
           THICK ENVELOPE. A name on it, in kanji, translated for us:

                                   DETECTIVE FUKUI

           INT. LOBBY - HOTEL NEW OSAKA - NIGHT

           The receptionist watches as Nick and Miyu approach, bags in 
           hand. She tries not to react to Nick limping on a bloody leg.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        You are staying with us?

                                 NICK
                        Room 513.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mary Kattorighto. You call before?

                                 NICK
                        Yeah.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Sign here prease, sank you.

           He does. She points to the elevator. They head for it.

           A private moment: the receptionist looks at Miyu, sees that 
           she’s pregnant, walking with a white man. Disapproves in the 
           most glancing, polite, Japanese way possible.

           INT. HALLWAY - FIFTH FLOOR - HOTEL NEW OSAKA - NIGHT

           513. Nick KNOCKS on the door. Waits. KNOCKS again. Tries the 
           door and it opens to -

           INT. MARY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Empty. Bed made. The bathroom door is open. Light on. Nick 
           walks in, approaches the bathroom door and the sound he makes 
           is inhuman - wailing, the word “no”, cried and unfinished, 
           choked by his own throat. Miyu sees what he sees -

           MARY SITS UP IN THE BATHROOM LIKE A PORCELAIN DOLL. We don’t 
           get the whole picture. Just images. Her face: pale and heavy 
           with death. Blood spilt from her slit wrists.

           Nick can’t stand anymore. He can’t move. He just stares at 
           her, breaking down. Miyu tries to hold him together.

           INT. LOBBY - HOTEL NEW OSAKA - NIGHT

           The receptionist smiles at nothing as she sits pert in her 
           chair alone. Ding. She sees Nick coming from the elevator, 
           Miyu following. And Nick looks every kind of wrong.

           He walks right up to her sign-in book and starts reading down 
           it. He stops on an entry.

                                 NICK
                        Who’s this?
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Sir?

                                 NICK
                        Who was this? They came before me.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Ah... two salesmen. Very young.

                                 NICK
                        Yakuza?

           She’s taken aback - that isn’t something you talk about. And 
           now Nick is holding a .22 like it’s nothing, checking that he 
           has bullets in the chambers, waiting for her response.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Gimme your phone.

           She slides the phone toward him. As he dials:

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I want you to give her a room. No 
                        one visits her, understand, unless 
                        you have them call up first and she 
                        says okay to you directly.

           He palms cash out on the reception desk as someone picks up 
           his call and he talks into the phone now:

                                 NICK
                        <Get Ryo.>

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           NICK HANDS MIYU THE .22 in a fresh hotel room. He’s talking 
           fast, mind on fire.

                                 NICK
                        You use that if you have to.

                                 MIYU
                        Where are you going?

                                 NICK
                        I’ll be back.

                                 MIYU
                        Let’s leave together.
                                 NICK
                        I’ll be back tomorrow night. Look 
                        at me, hey. You aren’t safe with me 
                        until then. They’re sending someone 
                        to wait with you, you’re gonna be 
                        okay.

           He pulls another gun, a 9MM, from his bag. And then he grabs 
           the WAKIZASHI - the short sword of honor. He stuffs both 
           through his belt. She grabs him. Makes him kiss her.

                                 NICK
                        Remember the day I broke your door? 
                        ...Who hit you?

           She stares back at him, afraid now what he might do. But her 
           fear betrays the truth. Nick knows now.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you tomorrow. I promise.

           She watches him go. And she locks the door, sits back, 
           looking at the gun in her hand like it weighs the world.

           EXT. YODO RIVERBANK - MORNING

           No cicadas today. Just the river softly lapping and the kchuk-
           kchuk-kchuk of a subway car crossing the bridge.

           Osaka is at peace so early in the day.

           EXT. HOTEL NEW OSAKA - SAME

           A BLACK BEL AIR pulls to front of the hotel. Ryo and Satoru 
           get out.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           A knock at the door. Miyu gets up from where she sits by the 
           phone, still holding that gun. She approaches the door and -

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TEA CEREMONY ROOM - DAY

           The very same room where Nick severed his fingers. The room 
           is filled with members of the Seizu family. A long roll of 
           paper down the center of the room. Hiromitsu sits at one end, 
           his kyodai kneeling in two long columns along the paper.
           It’s familiar, more so when -

           A MAN enters the room carrying a BOTTLE OF SAKE and a WOODEN 
           BOX. He kneels next to Hiromitsu and sets the box down. 
           Begins pouring SAKE into a sakazuki cup. And we see now -

           OROCHI. He kneels among the others along the paper. Awaiting 
           the sakazuki ritual.

           EXT. TEA HOUSE - DAY

           NICK walks past stunned hostesses in the garden outside a tea 
           house complex. Limping, his leg bandaged, saturated with 
           dried blood, sleepless, gun in his waistband, wakizashi in 
           his hand. The women scatter off, terrified.

           He just marches straight for THE MAIN TEA HOUSE.

           INT. TEA CEREMONY ROOM - DAY

           The man pouring sake sets the bottle down. And as Hiromitsu 
           reaches down for the cup -

                                 SEIZU BROTHER
                        <Boss!>

           Hiromitsu looks ready to break the man’s face for 
           interrupting the ritual, but the man looks scared and now 
           it’s too late as -

           THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE ROOM SLIDES OPEN.

           NICK STANDS THERE. But only for a second as -

           SHOUTING - MAYHEM - FLASHES OF MOTION -

           YAKUZA TACKLE HIM, THEY WREST THE GUN AND SWORD from him and 
           in seconds he finds himself disheveled on his knees at the 
           end of the long paper, A DOZEN GUNS AIMED AT HIS HEAD -

           He just smiles to himself. Almost dizzy.

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <You think you can just walk in 
                        here??>

           Nick looks up at Hiromitsu at the far end of the paper from 
           him. Long rows of yakuza staring back along the periphery.
                                 NICK
                        You know you have a newspaper? A 
                        yakuza newspaper where you 
                        advertise this shit. Your 
                        ceremonies and your meetings. 
                        You’re all so fearless and proud. 
                        That’s your tradition, right?

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <You came here to kill me?>

           Nick’s eyes are locked with Hiromitsu.

                                 NICK
                        <No.>

           Hiromitsu stares back, confused, as Nick stands. Slowly, leg 
           in blinding pain. Nervous yakuza shout and press their guns 
           to his head. But he doesn’t even flinch. No fear of death.

           He takes a step. The men follow, anxious with their guns 
           cocked but Hiromitsu signals them to hold any fire.

           As Nick walks -

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <Stop.>

           Nick ignores him. STILL IN HIS SHOES, he steps onto the 
           paper. It crinkles underfoot as he makes his way. The kyodai 
           all staring up at him as he slowly passes until he gets to -

           OROCHI. Eiichi sits next to him, practically shaking. But 
           Nick stares down into Orochi’s eyes, guns still at his head:

                                 NICK
                        Get up.

                                 OROCHI
                        <I gave you a deal.>

           Nick’s words are meant for Hiromitsu, but he doesn’t take his 
           eyes off Orochi for a second:

                                 NICK
                        <He hasn’t had sakazuki yet. He 
                        isn’t a member of your family.>
                             (beat)
                        <He’s still my brother.>

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <What do you want?>
                                 NICK
                        <I want my fingers back.>

           Hiromitsu scoffs. Nick holds his hands up, fingers missing:

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        <I gave you my respect. I thought 
                        you cared about justice.>

           Hiromitsu stares at Nick, standing in his shoes on the clean 
           sakazuki paper, bloodied and offensive.

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <More than you do.>

                                 NICK
                        <Then let me kill him.>

                                 HIROMITSU
                        <I can’t let you kill him.>

                                 NICK
                        <Give him a weapon.>

           Hiromitsu is silent. He processes the idea. Orochi’s getting 
           nervous. He notices some of the Seizu looking at him now.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        <If I kill him, I’ll leave your 
                        country. If he kills me, I’ll be 
                        dead.>

           Dead silence. Hiromitsu looks to Orochi for his response. 
           Orochi knows that backing down means losing face.

           He stands. Time to be an alpha dog. He looks Nick dead in the 
           eye. And then he takes Nick’s sword from the yakuza holding 
           it. He smirks at the quaint thing in his hand.

                                 OROCHI
                        <You think you’re a yakuza with 
                        this? You aren’t yakuza. You’re an 
                        outsider. Wherever you go now, 
                        you’re an outsider. With those 
                        fingers and that dragon on your 
                        back you think you can go back to 
                        America? They don’t let you through 
                        “customs” if you’ve been cut. 
                        Without a yakuza family, you’ll 
                        have to run far. No cities for you. 
                        Can’t get a job in Japan with a 
                        tattoo. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OROCHI (CONT'D)
                        If you steal to survive, cops’ll 
                        arrest you and with fingers like 
                        that they won’t treat you like the 
                        other white men. If Yakuza see you, 
                        forget it, they’ll kill you on 
                        sight for being an abomination. Let 
                        me guess, even Ryo told you to run. 
                        Maybe he gave you some cash to help 
                        you out, send you far away?>

           Orochi puts the wakizashi back in Nick’s hands. He’s almost 
           sympathetic:

                                 OROCHI
                        <Akihiro was crazy. Ryo knew that. 
                        Everyone knew that. So no, I won’t 
                        kill you. The world will do that.>

           The room is hostile with stares.

                                 NICK
                        You think I don’t know that? You 
                        think I’m here because I wanna be a 
                        part of your world?
                             (beat)
                        <You think I’m here for my honor?>

                                 OROCHI
                        What are you here for, gaijin?

           Nick looks into Orochi’s eyes, a long beat and -

           SHIK! HE SLICES OROCHI’S THROAT OPEN -

           BLOOD POURS OUT. A steady stream flowing over skin sliced 
           open. Orochi’s eyes staring back in horror as he knows he’s 
           dying and fast. He falls to his knees. Collapses at Nick’s 
           feet. And Nick sheathes the wakizashi.

           Orochi’s blood courses out over the paper. Nick looks around. 
           Nobody moves. Everyone in shock. He faces Hiromitsu:

                                 NICK
                             (re: Eiichi)
                        You should have him translate this.

           No one flinches but as Nick speaks, Eiichi starts to catch 
           up, translating as much as his shock will allow him:

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re not gonna kill me 
                        here because your honor wouldn’t 
                        allow that. So I want you to know 
                        that you should kill me, right now. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Cause I’m gonna come for you and 
                        I’m gonna slit your fuckin’ throat 
                        too. I’m not leaving this city. 
                        Remember that when you try to sleep 
                        at night.
                             (beat)
                        Here’s my honor.

           He drops the wakizashi on the paper. Blood sticky.

           He turns and limps along the paper all the way to the door. 
           The men with guns don’t follow, they just stare at what’s 
           left of Orochi. Another quiet Japanese tea room.

           EXT. YODO RIVERBANK - DAY

           Finally the cicadas start buzzing as the sun is on the wane.

           INT. LOBBY - HOTEL NEW OSAKA - EVENING

           The receptionist stares in shock as Nick enters the lobby, 
           the colors of sunset outside but Nick’s hands are ghastly. 
           Palms ruddy-red with blood. A spray of blood on his shirt.

           But there is a look of peace on his face.

           She watches in awe as he heads for the elevators.

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           CLOSE ON MIYU. She sits still, staring. The oak headboard 
           behind her, stale wallpaper behind it. A sad, empty space.

           THE DOOR. It opens. Nick steps in.

           NICK’S POV:

           THE ROOM IS EMPTY. BED MADE. He knows it before we do -

           BANG! A BULLET BLASTS THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. He falls 
           forward onto the carpet. Dead in an instant. And his shooter:

           SATORU. His heart is broken. But he forces himself to watch 
           as the blood spreads out. Nick’s eyes, lifeless.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TRAIN STATION - SAME

           MIYU sits in front of that headboard, but as we circle round, 
           we realize it isn’t a headboard, it’s a bench along the wall 
           of a train station. And next to her sits -

           RYO. He’s somber, ashamed. She’s dead inside.

                                 RYO
                        <I made a promise to your brother a 
                        long time ago.>
                             (beat)
                        <You’re both safe now.>

           He nods toward her belly. She doesn’t respond.

           A train screeches to a stop. And Ryo knows that’s his cue, 
           she still hasn’t looked at him. He gets up. Walks away. An 
           ENVELOPE OF MONEY where he sat. But Miyu ignores it. She just 
           sits there, staring into an uncertain future.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE:

           A BULLDOZER PLOWS OVER STALLS at the Juso black market.

           Construction in Osaka. The skyline claws its way upward.

           Streets are jammed with cars. But the cars have changed, no 
           more muscle cars. More subdued. This is 1966.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           A board room in a high rise - one of Osaka’s first. A table 
           full of WELL-DRESSED BUSINESSMEN pay attention to ANOTHER’s 
           presentation concerning OIL FUTURES. And RYO sits at the 
           table, years older. An air of power and wealth about him. His 
           KAIKEI (accountant) sits beside him.

           As the presentation drones on, the businessmen turn their 
           eyes invariably to Ryo. Intimidated, seeking his approval.

           EXT. DOTONBORI - OSAKA - DAY

           Dotonbori is not too different from how it is today. A 
           shopping street dominated by electronics and technology sold 
           wholesale. SONY RADIOS sell like mad.

           But while Osaka teems...
           EXT. SOMEWHERE IN RURAL FUKUI - DAY

           A DIRT ROAD. The cicadas buzz.

           WE FOLLOW A TWELVE YEAR-OLD GIRL on a BICYCLE. Her face 
           unseen, she turns down a road, a ditch running along it -

           A ROW OF PRISONERS HALTS WORK ON COMMAND. The guards keep a 
           watchful eye as the girl bikes past. They bow to her.

           EXT. RURAL TOWN ROAD - DAY

           The girl turns onto a rural town road lined by traditional 
           single-story homes. She stops at one of them. Hops off her 
           bike and leans it against the house. Walks inside -

           INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house is empty, so the girl continues through to the 
           back, through open shoji doors to -

           MIYU. Thirty-one years old now. She sits at the back door, 
           looking out at a small garden. Lost in thought. But she turns 
           to see her daughter:

           MARIKO. Half-white, half-Japanese. She looks smart for her 
           age. Too smart, she might be trouble in a few years.

           And Mariko can see that her mom is distant again. So she 
           shows her mom her CLOSED HAND. Miyu watches her daughter 
           adoringly as Mariko opens her hand to reveal -

           A CICADA. Quiet and scared. But then it flies away.

                                                                   END.
