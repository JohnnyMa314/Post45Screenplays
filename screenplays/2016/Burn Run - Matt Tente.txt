           OVER BLACK:

           The roar of jet engines echo in the distance, the quiet 
           rumble of a truck motor right beside us. 

           A self-assured MALE VOICE speaks over the noise.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Repeat after me -- ‘I am a U.S. 
                        Contractor.’

           A muffled MONOTONE VOICE repeats verbatim.

                                 MONOTONE VOICE (V.O.)
                        ‘I am a U.S. Contractor.’

           SUPER: Since 2001, the United States has spent more than $7.6 
           billion to crush the Afghan Opium Trade.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        ‘I do this job for the opportunity 
                        to kill the enemies of my 
                        country...’

                                 MONOTONE VOICE (V.O.)
                        ‘I do this job for the opportunity 
                        to kill the enemies of my 
                        country...’

           SUPER: So far, cultivation has increased 3,500%. This black-
           market trade accounts for over 50% of Afghanistan’s GDP--

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        ‘...and to finally get that boat 
                        I’ve always wanted.’

                                 MONOTONE VOICE (V.O.)
                        ‘...and to finally get that boat 
                        I’ve always wanted.’

           SUPER: --and 90% of the world’s Heroin supply. Profits can be 
           traced to the Taliban, Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Pull your damn head through.

                                 MONOTONE VOICE (V.O.)
                        ‘Pull your damn head--’

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Not that part.

           SUPER: For all intents and purposes, Afghanistan has 
           deteriorated into a Narco-Terror-State.
           EXT. KABUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           The top of a balding head peeks through the neck-hole of a 
           ballistic body armor jersey. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.C.)
                        Again... ‘In any combat zone, I 
                        will locate the swimming pool, beer 
                        and women, because I can.’

                                 MONOTONE VOICE
                             (Muffled thru the jersey)
                        ‘In any combat zone, I will locate 
                        the swimming pool, beer and women, 
                        because I can.’

           An oily forehead breaches the hole--

                                 MALE VOICE (O.C.)
                        ‘I am my country’s scapegoat, the 
                        plausible deniability warrior and I 
                        love it.’

           --birthing a pair of brown eyes and bulbous nose; the jersey 
           resembling Under Armor with Kevlar plates sewn in.

                                 MONOTONE VOICE
                        But I’m not a warrior--

                                 MALE VOICE (O.C.)
                        That doesn’t matter for our 
                        purposes here today.

                                 MONOTONE VOICE
                             (Reluctant)
                        ‘I am my country’s scapegoat, the 
                        plausible deniability warrior and I 
                        love it.’

           Monotone’s chin finally slips through -- Meet: 

           SUPER: The PRINCIPAL or PACKAGE. What the Private Security 
           Contractors are paid to protect.

           He pulls the lower half of the jersey around his cushy love 
           handles and looks at the Male Voice across from him. 

           A bearded good old boy with the chiseled steroid infused 
           physique of a man half his age. 

           SUPER: BRAD HAWKINS - Handle: DUTCH -- // (Late 40s).

           He’s all jocked-up with wraparound Oakley shades and bulging 
           tattooed biceps stretching out the arms of his T-shirt. 
           The Ink: A lion’s paw encircled by a sniper score, the same 
           logo printed on the chest of his T-shirt.

                                 DUTCH
                        Lastly, ‘I will deploy on my terms 
                        and if it ever gets too stupid...’

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        ‘I will deploy on my terms and if 
                        it ever gets too stupid...’

                                 DUTCH
                        ‘I’ll simply find another company 
                        that pays more.’

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        ‘I’ll simply find another company 
                        that pays more.’

                                 DUTCH
                        Good. You’re an honorary Merc for 
                        the next eight minutes or so.

           Dutch presses a Kevlar helmet against the Principal’s chest.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Put that on.

           He does and waits for Dutch’s approval, jaw hitting the 
           ground when he hands him an M4 ASSAULT RIFLE instead.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I... I don’t know how to shoot--

                                 DUTCH
                        Don’t you worry about that, you’re 
                        our bullet bitch. 

           Dutch gestures to a second M4 slung over his shoulder.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        We get in the shit, you’re Johnny 
                        on the Spot with a reload. Get me?

           The Principal swallows hard.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Got you.

           Dutch smiles like a proud parent.

                                 DUTCH
                        Now... Take a look at yourself.
           He spins the Principal face to face with the tinted windows 
           of the tan up-armored GMC SUBURBAN they’ll be riding in.

           They stare at his reflection, decked out head to toe in full 
           Battle Rattle and wielding a weapon that can unload 700-950 
           lethal rounds per minute. 

           The Principal smiles despite himself.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        C - D - I.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Is that code?

                                 DUTCH
                        Bet your ass it is.

           The Principal’s eyes reflect back, requesting a translation.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Chicks - Dig - It. You look shit 
                        hot. Bosco, how’s he look?

           Another Contractor arrives at the truck with two cases of 
           beer wrapped in Duty-Free bags.

                                 BOSCO
                        Shit hot.

           SUPER: DARREL FOSTER - Handle: BOSCO -- // (Mid 40s). 

           Bosco sports a beard as well, same wraparound Oakleys, same 
           tan Royal Robbins 5.11 pants, same bulging biceps in a tight 
           company T-shirt. 

           His moniker and faux-hawk a tribute to MR. T of THE A-TEAM.

           Dutch shoves the Principal in back, behind another ripped 
           Contractor -- Same beard, same sunglasses, same toned arms...

           SUPER: MIGUEL RAMOS - Handle: LAMBO -- // (Mid 40s).

           Bosco tosses Dutch a TIC TAC multi-pack.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        God bless you brother.
           INT. GMC SUBURBAN - NEXT

           The Principal buckles his belt, but Lambo stops him.

                                 LAMBO
                        Leave it off. Will slow us down 
                        when we get in the shit.

           Bosco hops in the rear cargo area with the beer and Dutch 
           slides in the front passenger seat.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        So, it’s likely we’re going to... 
                        Get in the shit?

           Bosco chuckles -- Lambo tossing the Principal a stern glare.

                                 LAMBO
                        If the intel report’s legit--

                                 DUTCH
                        Don’t make the guy shit himself.
                             (Winks at the Principal)
                        Plenty of time for that later.

           Lambo eases on the gas, making his way through a maze of 
           jersey barriers towards the exit. A bold green sign 
           approaching the gate reads: ALL WEAPONS RED.

           The Team click off the safety catches on their M4s, the 
           Principal mimicking them when Bosco clamps down on his wrist.

                                 BOSCO
                        That don’t mean you.

           Lambo revs the engine, waiting for the automatic fence to 
           open like a caged horse at the starting gate. 

           Dutch hits play on the SUV’s stereo -- AC/DC’s HIGHWAY TO 
           HELL swelling through the speakers. The gate clears--

                                 DUTCH
                        Roll hard.

           Lambo punches the gas, screaming into a sea of Japanese cars. 

           The Principal takes in the sights out the tinted bullet-proof 
           windows. 

           EXT. GREAT MASSOUD ROAD - KABUL, AFGHANISTAN - NEXT

           Sidewalks teeming with locals in front of clay buildings 
           plastered with Arabic signs the color of cake sprinkles. 
           Bearded men don the traditional Shalwar Kameez or slacks and 
           button downs, but the women... They’re covered head to toe in 
           body length shawls with burqas masking their faces. 

           AFGHAN POLICE (ANP) are stationed on corners in grey uniforms 
           wielding AK-47s, glaring at the Suburban as it passes.

           INT. GMC SUBURBAN - NEXT

                                 BOSCO
                        ANP’s treacherous. Uniforms get 
                        “stolen” by Haji’s every other day.

                                 DUTCH
                        Truck right.

           A WHITE TOYOTA PICKUP merges in front of the Suburban. 

           Lambo cuts a hard left, speedometer creeping past 60mph, 
           clipping the Pickups rear bumper, sending it spinning out of 
           control.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Car left.

           A DATSUN tries to overtake them. Weapons ready, Lambo floors 
           it, making sure they don’t get boxed in.

           The Datsun keeps pace, Bosco the only one who can make out 
           the Passengers -- A FAMILY OF THREE.

           Before he can speak, Lambo cuts them off and the Datsun 
           Driver brakes hard to avoid a collision. The car skids--

           CRASH

           Rear-ended by the SUZUKI COMPACT tailing it. 

           The Principal spins around, watching the vehicles barrel off 
           the road, taking out a rickety kiosk in the process.

                                 LAMBO
                        Habudabi’s never learn...

                                 DUTCH
                        Group right up ahead.

           The Team turns their attention to a group of YOUNG AFGHAN MEN 
           congregating on a corner. The Principal locks eyes with one 
           of them as they drive by, tension in the truck thick until--

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Cart.
           --Dutch alerts them to a MERCHANT pulling a MULE yoked cart 
           across the road. 

           Lambo accelerates to 70mph. The Merchant dives out of the way 
           and the Suburban’s bumper becomes one with the animals head--

           THUD

           Blood and brains splatter across the windshield. Dutch tosses 
           a handful of Tic Tac’s in his mouth.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        You’re getting her washed soon as 
                        we get back.

           Lambo flicks on the wipers and adds fluid, washing the blood 
           away as quickly as it came.

           The Principal looks out the back windshield at the Merchant 
           shaking his fist in the air, but they’re already gone, none 
           of the Contractors giving him a second thought.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Kids!

           The Principal recognizes distress in Dutch’s voice for the 
           very first time.

           Lambo pumps the brakes and they skid to a stop, a yard away 
           from a line of SCHOOL CHILDREN crossing the road. Their 
           TEACHER like a mother mallard leading ducklings to water.

           They scan each and every Afghan outside -- Men, Women and 
           Children alike; zeroing in on their hands, looking for cell 
           phones, garage door openers -- All potential DETONATORS.

                                 LAMBO
                        I don’t like this boss.

                                 BOSCO
                        Too many eyes on us.

           Seconds feel like minutes as nervous fingers hover over 
           triggers. Dutch pops his door open and sticks his barrel out--

                                 DUTCH
                        Imshi, Imshi, Imshi!

           --firing two loud bullet bursts into the air. The Children 
           scream as tears fill their eyes, fear turning them to statues 
           when--

           CRACK
           --the side window splinters from a sniper shot, the crack in 
           the glass right next to the Principal’s head.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Get down! 

           The Principal falls to the floor. Outside the Teacher grabs a 
           few stragglers and carries them across the road.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Drive!

           Lambo floors it, driving straight towards the one remaining 
           child standing stone still in the middle of the street--

           CRACK

           Another bullet nails the back windshield across from Bosco, 
           the Suburban on a collision course with the Boy--

           CRACK - CRACK

           Two more bullets rip into the glass. 

           At the last possible second Lambo cuts the wheel, so close 
           that the draft blows the Massoud cap right off the Boy’s

           The Principal peeks at Bosco through the gap below the seat.

                                 BOSCO
                        This is the “kill zone.”

           Outside, two burnt out up-armored Suburbans have been left 
           for dead on the side of the road.

                                 DUTCH
                        Roundabout coming up.

           The TRAFFIC CIRCLE is PURE CHAOS -- Cars, buses, bikes, 
           pedestrians... Some moving with the current, others against.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Bike left - Car right - Man three 
                        o’clock.

           Dutch fires off directions, calling the game as only someone 
           with his experience can. 

           Lambo cuts right, left and right again, avoiding obstacles 
           like a Formula One Driver, never bringing the truck below 50.

           The Principal’s eyes bulge from their sockets, heart beating 
           through his chest. 
           The Contractors are cool and collected, just another typical 
           day driving THE GREAT MASSOUD ROAD from KABUL INTERNATIONAL 
           AIRPORT to the Coalition occupied RING OF STEEL.

           Bosco points to a CHECK POINT guarded by AMERICAN MARINES.

                                 BOSCO
                        That’s home, the Ring of Steel.

           The Principal’s pulse slows, relief washing over him when--

           A TAXI cuts across the median and stops in the middle of the 
           road.

                                 DUTCH
                        Got a V-Bed.

           Dutch’s voice betrays distress for the second time on the 
           trip, Bosco’s too, peering out the back.

                                 BOSCO
                        Haji’s on our six.

           The Principal spins around, seeing the Young Afghan Man he 
           locked eyes with behind the wheel of a car filled to the brim 
           with Insurgents wielding AKs and Kalashnikovs.

                                 LAMBO
                        He’ll set it off we get within 20--

                                 DUTCH
                        Don’t stop.

           Lambo punches the gas, the distance between the Suburban and 
           Taxi shrinking with each passing second.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Oh my God, is that a car bomb?

           Dutch can see a GARAGE DOOR OPENER in the Insurgent’s hand; 
           Lambo reciting the Hail Mary in Spanish.

                                 HAWK 
                        He’s got a plunger.

                                 LAMBO
                        Dios te salve, Maria.          
                        Llena eres de gracia...

           They pick up speed, closing in on the Taxi-- 

           40 yards... 35... 30...

           The Insurgent presses down on the Opener--
           25 yards... 20... 15...

           Nothing. 

           10 yards... 5... 

           The Principal stares at the Insurgent punching the Opener 
           over and over as they pass.

           5 yards... 10... 15... 20... 

           The separation between the vehicles growing when--

           BOOM

           The Taxi explodes blowing out the Suburban’s back windshield.

                                 DUTCH
                        Down!

           They speed through the Check Point into the Ring of Steel, 
           the Marines eyeing them with envy, counting down the days 
           until they can go private.

           Bosco breathes a sigh of relief and pats a DIGITAL BOX on the 
           floor beside the beer.

                                 BOSCO
                        On the sixth day the Lord said, 
                        “Let there be signal jammers.”

           The Suburban creeps below 50mph for the first time since 
           leaving the airport, Highway to Hell fading to a whisper.

                                 LAMBO
                        Welcome to the Ring of Steel.

           The Principal returns to his seat as Bosco sniffs the air and 
           looks over the Principal’s shoulder -- A moist urine stain 
           spreading across his crotch where the spare M4 is resting. 

                                 BOSCO
                        You piss on that weapon?

           Dutch and Lambo let out a soft chuckle, releasing the last 
           bit of built-up tension from their bodies.

           They pull up to the PARK PLACE HOTEL and Bosco snaps a photo 
           of the Principal’s soiled crotch with his cell phone - CLICK.

           Lambo and Bosco step out, but the Principal remains frozen in 
           his seat. Dutch takes pity on him.
                                 DUTCH
                        Adrenaline’s a funny thing. Some

                        puckers. 

           He tosses another handful of Tic Tac’s in his mouth.

           He hands Dutch his card, who dwells on the Principal’s 
           answer, considering the fact that he risked his life and the 
           lives of his Team for a lowly wanna be journalist.

                                                    SMASH CUT TO BLACK:

                                                     TITLE UP: BURN RUN

           EXT. HELMAND PROVINCE - AFGHANISTAN - DAWN

           A valley blanketed by a sea of blooming pink poppies, 
           insulated by a desolate mountain range that resembles the 
           surface of the moon.

           Bearded FIELD HANDS in turbans work the crop, scoring 
           flowerless pods with a tri-blade knife, letting OPIUM GUM 
           ooze through the cuts like blood from a surgeon’s scalpel.

           Other WORKERS collect day old gum caked to the pods, a 
           process they’ll do four or five times until the plant can no 
           longer produce the precious resin.

           SUPER: Opium Gum -- The raw ingredient used to cook HEROIN. 

           A REFINERY sits at the edge of the field, protected by a ten 
           foot wall patrolled by GUARDS armed with AK-47s. Two of the 
           Guards turn a corner and disappear from view when-- 
           The Field Hands collapse one by one below the flowers, like 
           their legs have been cut out from under them.

           Another Guard appears and looks towards the pastel field, 
           surprised by their sudden disappearance when--

           ZIP - THWACK

           A bullet rips into his skull, splattering blood and brains 
           across the wall, his body hitting the ground like a sack of 
           flour.

           The pink flowers sway in the wind like wakes on the ocean as 
           midnight blue specks rise above the crest, moving fast 
           through the stalks straight towards the Refinery. 

           The midnight specks come into sharper focus--

           Turtle shell helmets belonging to AFGHAN COMMANDOS decked out 
           in operational gear, carrying American made M4s with black 
           Balaclavas masking their faces.

           These are members of the U.S. trained FASTeam (Foreign 
           Advisory Support) -- the AFGHAN COUNTER NARCOTICS TASK FORCE.

           The very best this country has to offer from its thin pool of 
           law enforcement recruits.

           They approach in silence and press their backs to the wall, 
           the COMMANDER sticking a PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE against it when--

           Two Guards circle around the wall and catch them in the act.

           One raises his AK and fires, but is riddled by bullets before 
           he can aim, his shots flying wild into the air.

           The second Guard doesn’t even get that chance before his 
           chest is ripped open by M4 rounds.

           A YOUNG COMMANDO kicks their weapons away and puts a bullet 
           in each of their heads -- THWACK-THWACK -- for good measure.

           The Commander nods at his prized pupil. The rest of the Team 
           stare in awe, M4s rattling around in their nervous hands.

           VOICES echo from inside the Refinery as the Commander presses 
           a button on the explosive and turns away--

           BOOM

           The wall crumbles and a hole appears -- Their entryway.
           INT. HALLWAY - REFINERY - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           A squad of Guards grab their AKs and move into the hall when--

           CLINK - CLINK - CLINK

           Their eyes fall to a grenade rolling around on the floor--

           BOOM

           The blast rips their bodies limb from limb in a cloud of 
           dust. The midnight blue uniforms storm in and are met with 
           return fire--

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT

           The first two Commandos weapons misfire, eyes wide as bullets 
           tear into them and they collapse like a house of cards. 

           The Young Commando returns fire and takes out the Guards at 
           the end of the hall, like shooting fish in a barrel. 

           This is a two man operation, the rest of the Team nothing 
           more than human shields to throw in front of enemy fire. 

           The Young Commando releases his trigger when--

           BANG - THWACK

           An indiscriminate bullet catches him in the chest. 

           There’s a lull in the fire fight as the rest of the Team move 
           towards a room at the end of the hall, stepping over the 
           scattered bloody limbs of their enemies.

           Two Commandos take up positions outside the door, but the 
           Commander hesitates, his eyes focused on the injured Young 
           Commando behind them.

           The MEDIC cuts his shirt open, fortunate to find the bullet 
           flattened against the metal chest plate of his flak jacket.

           Relieved, the Commander counts down from three with his 
           fingers and they storm the room--

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT

           The last living Guard fires from behind the cover of a table 
           barricade, but the Commandos unleash hell-- 

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT

           Tearing it to splintered shreds.
           The Guard keels over and the Team continue towards a locked 
           door at the back and a Commando takes his boot to it--

           THUD - THUD - THUMP

           INT. BACK ROOM - REFINERY - HELMAND PROVINCE - CONTINUOUS

           The Team storm in shouting orders in PASHTO, the regional 
           dialect of ethnic Pashtuns, the southern majority.

                        Get down! On the ground! Now!

           The Commander scans the room through the rear sight of his 
           M4, eyes turning benign as he lowers the weapon.

           Behind boiling oil drums and makeshift lab equipment are 
           WOMEN and CHILDREN -- Tribal Families forced to refine the 
           Opium Gum into heroin bricks that resemble boxed brown sugar.

           He locks eyes with a YOUNG GIRL (10 or 11), her piercing 
           green eyes boring into him. 

           He pulls his Balaclava below his chin -- Meet:

           His thick black beard is peppered with flecks of grey below

           knowing they have little choice in the work they do.

                                 DUTCH
                        I’ve been in this shit hole risking 
                        my life day in and day out--

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (SKYPE)
                        For what? You didn’t kill Bin Laden 
                        Brad. You drive a truck. Hell, you 
                        don’t even drive it.

           He bites his tongue, refusing to get sucked into a battle 
           that was lost years ago.

                                 DUTCH
                        I don’t have that kind of money 
                        just lying around Sarah.
                                 SARAH (SKYPE)
                        Where’s it all go? You buying 
                        lingerie for skanks over there too? 

           Dutch stews, not in the mood for a trip down memory lane.

                                 DUTCH
                        Half goes right in your pocket 
                        every month...
                             (A beat - Soft)
                        ...and need I remind you about that 
                        Jodi fuck in your Dear John letter?

                                 SARAH (SKYPE)
                        You’re a real piece of work, you 
                        know that. I wouldn’t be asking, 
                        but the VA’s slower than molasses 
                        in January and won’t cover anything 
                        private.

           Tense silence lingers over the line.

                                 DUTCH
                        Can I talk to him?

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - SAME

           SARAH (late-40s), crows feet and wrinkles from a Military 
           Wife/ex-Wife’s existence; looks at her son -- BRANDON (20s), 
           unconscious in a hospital bed, an IV pumping fluid into him. 

                                 SARAH
                        He’s in a coma.

           *(Intercut between the Hospital and Dutch’s Bunk)*

           Tears well in her eyes.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Booze or grass I could handle, but 
                        this...

           Rock music blasts from another room, forcing Dutch to pump up 
           the volume on his speakers -- BERP - BERP - BERP.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        News says its an epidemic, paper’s 
                        calling I-91 the Heroin Highway--

                                 DUTCH
                        Jesus...
                                 SARAH
                        Doctor said Maple Leaf’s the best 
                        thing. Get a hold of it before he’s 
                        out of control-- 

                                 DUTCH
                        He’s already out of control Sarah, 
                        he OD’d for Christ’s sake. That’s 
                        why I told you to take’em to detox--

                                 SARAH
                        He’s been in and outta there eight-
                        nine times already. They clean him 
                        up and he’s back on that junk a 
                        week later. He needs rehab.

           Silence returns for a tense moment and Dutch changes tactics.

                                 DUTCH
                        I’ll move some savings around, 
                        transfer enough for the deposit and 
                        figure out the rest.

                                 SARAH
                        He needs more than that Brad--

                                 DUTCH
                        What else is there?

                                 SARAH
                        He needs you!
                             (A beat - Quiet)
                        He needs his father...

           The line goes dead. 

           Dutch pops out the earbuds, limps over to his Go Bag and 
           grabs a bottle of PAIN KILLERS. 

           He eyes them with trepidation before tossing two back and 
           mixing some in with the Tic Tac’s.

                                 DUTCH (PRELAP)
                        That ban gonna stick?

           INT. ASSIGNMENT OFFICE - COMPANY HOUSE - LATER

           The ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN (40s), is seated behind a plywood desk 
           in his makeshift office. The only decoration, a WWII era 
           poster with a smiling Marine holding a coffee mug that reads:

                How About a Nice Cup of Shut The Fuck Up
                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        If Ghani wants his own guys 
                        protecting his ass, be my guest.

           He’s rifling through a stack of manila file folders.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        It comes to that, I’d bet my kid’s 
                        college fund he’s dead in a month.

           The A.C. or what Field Ops call a FOBBIT -- Someone who never 
           leaves the Forward Operating Base. A meek pencil pusher who 
           fancies himself a badass by the company he keeps.

                                 DUTCH
                        Any news on my request?

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Not enough excitement on the 
                        Massoud?

                                 DUTCH
                        Done hundreds of back and forths 
                        down that road. Statistically I 
                        should’ve been tits up years ago.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Maybe it’s time to hang’em up. Put 
                        in your twenty with the army, got 
                        that pension waiting.

                                 DUTCH
                        “Those who have hunted armed men 
                        long enough and liked it, Never 
                        really care for anything else 
                        thereafter...”

           The A.C. grins.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Always with the quotes--

           His smile cut short by DEATH METAL blaring from an adjacent 
           room. He slams his fist against the wall--

           THUD - THUD - THUD

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Turn it down.

           --but the music carries on at full blast.
                                 DUTCH
                             (Louder)
                        I’d like to look back on my time 
                        here and think I made a difference. 
                        Did something important, you know. 
                        Tired of this Saving Private Ryan 
                        shit, risking three good lives for 
                        a guy with an iPhone camera or some 
                        blog journo. Maybe get a bump in my 
                        day rate while I’m at it.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        It’s bloggers and new assignments--
                             (Louder)
                        New assignments are easy to come 
                        by, I’ve got a stack right here.

           The A.C. spins around and pounds the wall again-- 

           THUD - THUD - THUD

           --shouting now.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        I said turn it down!

           He turns back, his demeanor pleasant. Jeckyll to his Hyde a 
           moment ago, but the Death Metal drones on.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                             (Loud)
                        You’re asking me to put you on a 
                        top detail. I can make recs, but 
                        you know full well the final 
                        decision isn’t mine.
                             (A beat - Hesitant)
                        And your whole negligent discharge--

                                 DUTCH
                        It was accidental, not negligent 
                        and it was five fucking years ago.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Guys still talk about it, like an 
                        urban legend.

                                 DUTCH
                        I’m former Special Forces for 
                        fuck’s sake. You’ve got beat cops 
                        from bum fuck nowhere with zero 
                        military training doing higher 
                        profile work. 
           The deafening music interrupts the A.C.’s train of thought. 
           He spins around and gives the wall another beating--

           THUD - THUD - THUD - THUD - THUD

           --screaming at the top of his lungs.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        TURN IT THE FUCK DOWN!

           Dutch steps out of the room - A moment later the music quiets 
           to a whisper. He steps back in and returns to his chair.

                                 DUTCH
                        Where were we?

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Limp’s looking better.

                                 DUTCH
                        What limp?

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                             (A beat - With a smirk)
                        Got a request for a three-man CAT 
                        Team to assist on a transpo.

                                 DUTCH
                        Where?

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Taliban country, Helmand Province.

                                 DUTCH
                        That the paper work?

           Dutch reaches for the folder, but the A.C. snaps it back.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Job needs to be accepted sight 
                        unseen.

           He’s piqued Dutch’s interest.

                                 DUTCH
                        Is it black?

           The A.C.’s smirk replies in the affirmative.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Using choppers?

           The A.C. shakes his head.
                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Ground convoy through there’s 
                        fucking insane.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Certifiable.

                                 DUTCH
                        Where do I sign?

           He slides a NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT across the desk and 
           Dutch scribbles his name on it without reading a word. The 
           A.C. hands him a folder labeled -- BURN RUN.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        What’s a Burn Run?

           Dutch flips through the contents -- Satellite photos of the 
           Refinery we witnessed being stormed by the Afghan FASTeam.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN

                                 DUTCH
                        Why don’t they burn it on site like 
                        they’ve been doing?

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Keep reading...

           Dutch turns a page to find a newspaper article with the 
           headline: AFGHAN MONEY PIT.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Press are making a stink about the 
                        open air burn pits. Congress is 
                        shitting a brick because they 
                        appropriated tens of millions of 
                        dollars for incinerators all over 
                        the damn place and they’re just 
                        sitting empty, collecting dust.

           He turns the page -- Photos of AMERICAN SOLDIERS and AFGHAN 
           CIVILIANS with gruesome red rashes all over their bodies.

                                 DUTCH
                        Christ... We do this?
                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Residual effects from the burn 
                        pits, thus the need to transport 
                        the seizure so it can be destroyed 
                        on the up and up. Filter out the 
                        toxic fumes and whatnot.

           Dutch holds on a picture of an AFGHAN MAN (50s), labeled:

                                 DUTCH
                        Always with the hearts and minds.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        You take orders from A-squad. No 
                        questions, no fuck ups. That clear?

                                 DUTCH
                        Crystal.

           Dutch flips through the photos of A-Squad and holds on one 
           labeled: SMITH, FRANCIS -- a wary look behind his eyes now.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        They request me specifically?

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        Not that I know of. Why do you ask?

                                 DUTCH
                        No reason. What happened to the 
                        team originally assigned?

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN
                        KIA. Rolled over the body of a dead 
                        Haji booby trapped with an IED.

           Dutch makes a Sign of the Cross against his chest and leaves. 
           The moment he’s gone, the Death Metal returns at full blast.

                                 ASSIGNMENT CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        SON OF A--
           PRELAP: The roar of a Jet Engine takes us to--

           EXT. CASA-212 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT - SUNRISE

           The plane sprints down the runway and takes off, cork 
           screwing straight up, gaining altitude as fast as possible.

           INT. CABIN - CASA-212 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT - NEXT

           The plane levels out and Dutch’s Team size up A-Squad, whose 
           pictures we’ve already seen:

           SUPER: FRANK SMITH - Handle: SMITH -- // (Mid 40s). 

           SUPER: DEREK ADAMS - Handle: ADAMS -- // (Early 40s).  

           SUPER: RICK WINFIELD - Handle: WINNIE -- // (Early 40s). 

           All three look like they were pulled straight from a SOLDIER 
           OF FORTUNE cover shoot -- Standard 5.11 Royal Robbins, but 
           instead of T-shirt’s, they’re wearing polos, faces clean 
           shaven, polished and professional. 

           These guys are the best of the best and don’t need to 
           advertise to prove it.

           Adams whispers in Winnie’s ear, noting the white, black and 
           brown complexions of their new colleagues. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Model of diversity these guys.

           Smith holds Dutch’s gaze for a nostalgic breath and Dutch 
           stumbles over to the empty seat beside him.

                                 DUTCH
                        Long time.

                                 SMITH
                        What’s it been, five-six years? 
                        You’re looking fit. Glad to see 
                        you’re still above ground.

                                 DUTCH
                        Same to you.

           The two shake and we catch a glimpse of the matching M.E.R.C. 
           tattoos on their knuckles, some solid history between them.

                                 SMITH
                        Where your boys schooled?
           Dutch looks at his guys, chatting up Adams and Winnie.

           Lambo states the “obvious.”

                        A little too close. Having one 
                        helluva time adjusting to civvy 
                        life. Anything I say to’em goes in 
                        one ear and out the other.

                                 SMITH
                        Can’t blame yourself.

                                 DUTCH
                        Can this time...

           Dutch’s thoughts turn to Brandon, but Adams interrupts.

                                 ADAMS
                        You work Embassy detail in the

                        I knew it! 
                             (To Winnie)
                        Pay up.

           Dutch looks at Smith, making a face that says: It wasn’t me.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        Told you I recognized his name. 

           Embarrassment breaks through Dutch’s tough veneer. 

                                 WINNIE
                        You’re a Goddamn legend man. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Almost killed one of Bush’s aides 
                        with a negligent discharge, right?

                                                              FLASH TO:

           Inside an up-armored SUV -- A PRESIDENTIAL AIDE leans forward 
           in his seat, Dutch behind him in the cargo area. The truck 
           brakes without warning and Dutch’s finger falls against the 
           trigger of his M4-- 

           BANG
           ON SMITH -- Beside the Aide, turning to Dutch wide-eyed.

                                 DUTCH (PRELAP)
                        Accidental and that was a long time

                                 WINNIE
                        Heard it went right through the 
                        guy’s headrest. That true?

                                 ADAMS
                        I knew I recognized your name.

           Smith puts an end to the inquiry.

                                 SMITH
                        Cut the shit. I’d be six feet under 
                        if it wasn’t for this guy. Saved my 
                        ass in Baghdad on a soup sandwich 
                        protection detail. Surrounded by 
                        Raghead’s and he blasts outta there 
                        lugging me over his shoulder.

           Smith puts a warmhearted hand on Dutch’s shoulder before he 
           dispels the tension.

                                 DUTCH

                                 DUTCH
                        A few times.

                                 SMITH
                        Whole discharge incident’s like a 
                        dark shadow, huh?

           Dutch frowns, he’s right.
                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Say, everything goes well on this 
                        run, let me put in a call.

           Smith leans forward, sincere.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        One mistake shouldn’t define the 
                        rest of your career, not a guy with 
                        your skills and background. Pay’s a 
                        helluva lot better too, eight fifty 
                        a day.

                                 DUTCH
                        I’d appreciate it Frank. Truly.

                                 SMITH
                        Can be just like old times.
                             (Whispering)
                        But keep it quiet. Looking for 
                        individuals, not teams.

           Dutch nods, when the plane suddenly hits a thin pocket of air 
           and vibrates hard. Bosco cinches his fingers around his 
           armrest as the Pilot’s voice comes over the loudspeaker.

                                 PILOT (RADIO)

           EXT. RUNWAY - CAMP BASTION AIR FIELD - MORNING

           The plane is parked. Bosco dives out the door and falls to 
           his knees, tossing his breakfast all over the tarmac.

           Smith steps by, greeted by a company ATTACHÉ who directs them 
           towards two desert camouflaged HUMVEES. 

           The Attaché gestures at Dutch’s crew.

                        back to Leatherneck. All goes well, 
                        we’ll be back in time for chow.

           Smith looks Dutch’s crew dead in the eye.

                        Watch our six, we’ll get us where

                        We get in the shit, split up... 
                        Where do we rendezvous?

           Smith stares back stone-faced.

                                 SMITH
                        This is a black contract. No one’s 
                        coming if shit gets heavy. So let’s 
                        make sure it doesn’t come to that.

           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - DAY

           --the humvees speed across HIGHWAY 1, the two-lane road that 
           makes up Afghanistan’s central highway system -- RING ROAD. 

           The mountains and desert bordering the highway are like 
           something out of a Western Dystopia, barren, yet beautiful. 
           The scenic route gives way to the congested provincial 
           capital - LASHKAR GAH - A sprawling grid of clay buildings 
           that blend in with the surrounding taupe topography. 

           WHITE FLAGS are waving several miles outside of the city.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           The humvees navigate more challenging terrain, traversing 
           narrow rock filled paths difficult enough to cross on foot, 
           let alone in a one ton military vehicle.

           They pass a Village populated by a Tribe that hasn’t left the 
           mountains for generations. 

           The Villagers aren’t surprised to see the humvees though, 
           familiar with occupying forces from decades of conflict. The 
           British during the 1800s, the Soviets through the 1980s and 
           since 2001, the U.S. Military.

           EXT. REFINERY - HELMAND PROVINCE - DAY

           The FASTeam and Field Hands are emptying a 20-ton JINGLE 
           TRUCK. A 10-wheel diesel behemoth painted with intricate 
           colored patterns and calligraphy, the art a popular time 
           honored tradition across Afghanistan and Pakistan.

           Thousands of chimes dangle from the base of the truck, meant 
           to stand-out, not blend-in like the camouflaged humvees.

           The Field Hands exchange bags of Seed for Heroin bricks, 
           sacks of raw Opium and Precursor Conversion Chemicals.

           This is all part of the U.S./Afghan Seed Exchange Program, 
           with the naïve hope that Poppy Farmers will swap their cash 
           crop for whatever seeds they’re given.

           The Women once working the Refinery are resting in the shade, 
           consoling crying Children while Saif and the Young Commando 
           dole out food rations.  

           SUPER: RAMIN - Officer with the Afghan FASTeam -- // (20s). 

           They speak DARI: The prevailing dialect in the northern, 
           ethnically Tajik region of Afghanistan.
                                 SAIF
                             (Dari - Subtitled)
                        You are a skilled fighter, but you 
                        need to be more careful.

                                 RAMIN
                             (Dari - Subtitled)
                        I am careful.

           He hands the Green Eyed Girl from the Refinery a meal box. 

                                 SAIF
                        Then why do you have a hole in your 
                        vest and a dent in your chest 
                        plate?

           The Girl hands Saif a poppy flower. He tucks it in his breast 
           pocket, the pink petals a vibrant addition to his midnight 
           blue uniform.

                                 SAIF (CONT’D)
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        I will cherish it.

                                 RAMIN
                        All your years on the battlefield 
                        and you’ve never been shot? 

           The Girl smiles, while Saif pulls Ramin aside.

                                 SAIF
                             (Dari - Subtitled)
                        I taught you better than that. 
                        Preservation first and foremost.

           They hold each others gaze for a prickly moment when--

                                 FARMER (O.C.)
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        How am I supposed to feed my people 
                        if you take our harvest?

           --their conversation’s cut short by an agitated FARMER.

                                 SAIF
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        We brought food, the wheat--

                                 FARMER
                        Wheat is no good. Poppies are the 
                        only crop the Taliban allows.
                                 SAIF
                        The Taliban doesn’t make the law. 
                        Fallow the poppies and plant the 
                        wheat.

           The Farmer takes a handful of seed and throws it in the air.

                                 FARMER
                        When you leave and the Taliban 
                        return, what then? We’ll be blamed

                                 FARMER
                        Only a Tajik would abuse a Pashtun 
                        like this. Your people are rats.

                                 SAIF
                        Careful what you say.

                                 FARMER
                        Laila, Laila... Come here.

           His daughter - Laila - The Green Eyed Girl, traipses over 
           with a push from her MOTHER.

                                 FARMER (CONT’D)
                        Look at her, look at her face.

           Saif locks eyes with the whimpering girl.

                                 FARMER (CONT’D)
                        She is the only virgin among the 
                        women. The Taliban will demand a 
                        baad and take her to settle my 
                        debts. You must bring her with you 
                        when you go or she’s doomed--

           The poor Farmer’s appeal interrupted by the rumbling engines 
           of the humvees rolling up to the Refinery. 

           Ramin and the bumbling Commandos take up defensive positions 
           with their M4s.

           Saif considers the offer for a dubious moment, before

           Commandos douse the walls with gasoline, the lab equipment 
           piled high in the middle of the room beside the desecrated 
           bodies of the Guards, limbs lying in a bloody heap. 

           EXT. REFINERY - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           Ramin runs a trail of gasoline away from the building and 
           Saif bends down to spark the fuel. 

           The flames race into the Refinery, plumes of black smoke 
           billowing through the windows for a few seconds before--

           BOOM

           The building explodes.

           ON DUTCH & SMITH--

           Watching the flames.

                        seize refined product and destroy 
                        the labs, but to steer clear of the 
                        crops. Obama wants to make nice

           Smith replies like he’s reading rule #64 from the company

           Saif stares at the Farmer and Field Hands, watching their

           the Refinery behind them. 
           He searches for Laila, but she’s M.I.A; her Mother struggling 
           to make a break for the truck, but the Farmer holds her back.

           The Convoy reaches the bottom of the Pass and turn onto Ring

           Convoys. Winnie’s voice comes over the radio a moment later.

                        Cover positions, stepping out.

           Winnie and Adams drop back to the Jingle Truck--

           EXT. JINGLE TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           --taking aim at Saif and Ramin.

           INT. REAR HUMVEE - SAME

           Dutch, Lambo and Bosco watch with trepidation.

                                 LAMBO
                        You know about this clusterfuck?

           INT. CABIN - JINGLE TRUCK - SAME

           Saif glares at Winnie outside his door.

                                 WINNIE
                        Out, now.

           Ramin cocks his M9 BERETTA below the window - CLICK-CLACK - 
           but Saif puts a hand over it.

           EXT. JINGLE TRUCK - NEXT

           Saif and Ramin’s boots hit the dirt as Dutch and Lambo exit 
           the Rear Humvee.

                                 SAIF
                             (English)
                        You know who that man is? What he 
                        has done to innocent people?

                        Frisk’em.

           Dutch and Lambo approach with their M4s raised. Saif keeps 
           his hands up as Dutch reaches for his Beretta.

                                 SAIF
                        Torture, rape, murder...

           Lambo reaches for the Ramin’s weapon, but he takes aim at his 
           head before he can grab it.

                                 LAMBO
                        Muji fucker drew on me!

           They’re trapped in a standoff -- Dutch’s M4 trained on Ramin.
                                 DUTCH
                        Drop the gun, drop it!

                        Ramin!

           Ramin’s aim is steady, trigger finger flexed.

                                 PETTY
                        --blow his fucking head off!

                                 SAIF
                        Please son...

                                 DUTCH
                        Son?

           Ramin puts pressure on the trigger, millimeters away from 
           firing when--

           He drops the gun to his side and Lambo punches him--

           CRACK

           Dutch breathes a sigh of relief and continues his pat down.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        They’re clean.

                        Cuff’em.

           Dutch pulls out a pair of zip ties and binds their wrists 
           behind their backs. 

                                 SAIF
                        You know where his money goes?

           He tries to tune him out. 

                                 SAIF (CONT’D)

                        the West. 

           Winnie shoves gags in their mouths and covers them with a 
           strip of tape.

                                 WINNIE
                        Shut the fuck up.
           EXT. JINGLE TRUCK - NEXT

           The Cargo Bed door is propped open. Khan smiles at the brown 
           bricks filling it, his grin vanishing when he sees--

           LAILA 

           --curled up in a ball, tears welling in her eyes.

                                 JUMA KHAN
                             (English)
                        What is this?

                                 WINNIE
                             (Whispering to Smith)
                        Farmer must of tucked her back 
                        there before we left.

           Smith plays along, like it’s no big deal.

                                 SMITH
                        Take her or leave her, up to you.

           Khan shares a look with his lieutenant -- TOFAN (30s), his 
           dark eyes examining the girl. 

                                 TOFAN
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        She will make for an obedient wife.

           Khan nods and Tofan yanks Laila’s arm, handing her off to 
           another Militant before he climbs inside the Cargo Bed with 
           an aluminum clutch. 

           He removes an eyedropper and test tube, digging a knife tip 
           of powder from a brick and slides it in the tube, adding a 
           few drops of clear liquid. 

           The mixture turns reddish brown. Khan grins and pulls Smith 
           aside.

                                 JUMA KHAN
                        I have another request.

                                 SMITH
                        What’s that?

           Khan gestures to Saif and Ramin.

                                 JUMA KHAN
                        Those Tajik mutts.

                                 SMITH
                        Saif’s high up in the regime...
           Khan’s expression turns dark, a man not accustomed to hearing 
           the word “No.”

                                 JUMA KHAN
                        Keep them alive and you risk 
                        exposure.

                        Tens-of-thousands of Pashtuns want 
                        to see those Tajik’s hang. What 
                        will it take?

           EXT. AIRSTRIP - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           Dutch and Bosco stand guard over Ramin and Saif -- Saif 
           biting through the tape covering his mouth.

                                 SAIF
                             (English)
                        You know of Juma Khan?

                                 DUTCH
                        Quiet.

                                 SAIF
                        Do you?

                                 DUTCH
                        Yeah.

                                 SAIF
                        Then you know your commander is 
                        making a deal with the devil.

           Saif falls silent when he sees Laila in Militant hands, now 
           understanding the source of her Mother’s distress. 

                                 BOSCO
                        What’s he bitching about?

                                 DUTCH
                        Tape him up--

                                 BOSCO
                        He saying they’re helping the 
                        enemy? That we’re helping the 
                        enemy?

           Dutch grabs Bosco by the vest and pulls him close.

                                 DUTCH
                        Tape him up and wait here.

           Dutch arrives at Smith’s side, the Militants delivering two 
           STEEL BRIEFCASES to Adams and Winnie.

                                 DUTCH
                        What the hell’s going on Frank?

                                 SMITH
                        Had to keep you in the dark. 
                        Couldn’t risk Saif catching wind.

                                 DUTCH
                        You’ve gotta do better than that.

                                 SMITH
                        Play ball with me here, Dutch. No 
                        one’s gonna miss that junk. It’s 
                        not even a blip on the Pentagon’s 
                        radar. 

           Dutch shoots him a cold glare.

                        Gotta hand over Saif and his kid to 
                        make it look like a hijacking. 
                        Managed to squeeze out a little 
                        something extra for them too, since 
                        we had to get rid of them anyway.

                                 DUTCH
                        This some Iran-Contra scam?

                                 SMITH
                        Not that heavy, just moving the 
                        cargo west. Load up the DC9 and 
                        it’s straight on to Canada. Move 
                        some there, the rest crosses the 
                        border.

                        Where do you think that shit all 
                        over New England comes from, 
                        Mexico? That’s the DEA selling 
                        Congress a bill of goods. Can’t 
                        tell the American people its coming 
                        from Afghanistan, not with a war 
                        on. 
           Dutch tries to keep it together in light of Brandon’s 
           overdose.

                                 DUTCH
                        We’re not drug runners Frank.

           Smith looks him dead in the eye.

                                 SMITH
                        Today we are. I need to know you’re 
                        with me on this.

           They hold each others gaze for a tense moment.

                                 DUTCH
                        There another option?

           Smith shakes his head.

                                 SMITH
                        Play your part and we’ll all go 
                        home with fatter pockets, no one 
                        the wiser.

           But Dutch isn’t so sure.

                                 DUTCH
                        How much?

                                 SMITH
                        Four hundred K. Each.

                        Now call off your dog.

           He looks deep into Smith’s eyes, searching for even the 
           slightest hint of betrayal.

                                 DUTCH

                                 DUTCH
                        Stand down.

           Bosco abandons Saif and Ramin. Tofan tugs Laila towards them 
           once he’s gone.
                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)

           Ramin spins around and attacks Tofan, but he’s quick to beat 
           him to the ground with the butt of his AK.

                                 TOFAN

                        On your knees.

           The Militant shoves Saif’s head against the ground; a brazen 
           Islamic insult. Tofan unsheathes a PESH-KABZ KNIFE, the 
           curved blade shining bright in the hot sun.

                                 RAMIN

                        Cowards!

           The blade scrapes across his neck stubble like a straight 
           edge razor, Saif and Laila forced to watch a few feet away.

                        Keep his eyes open. I want him to 
                        watch his son bleed.

           The blade draws its first drop of blood, Saif watching his 
           son’s last moments on earth, powerless.

           Ramin struggles as the knife parts his flesh and blood drips 
           down his neck.

           TIGHT CUTS BETWEEN DUTCH, LAMBO & BOSCO’S EYES--

           All watching with utter revulsion when--

           BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG

           Gunshots ring out, followed by dead SILENCE...

           Lambo and Bosco scan the stark landscape for the source of

           Saif’s Beretta smoking in his hand.

           Tofan and the Militants are splayed out on the ground, blood 
           seeping into the dry earth like a sponge.

           Lambo and Bosco’s stunned stares glued to Dutch.

                        God Dammit...

           ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE
           The Militants open fire sending the Contractors diving for 
           cover. Bosco returns fire, forcing the Militants to seek 
           refuge behind their Pickups.

           EXT. AIRSTRIP - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           Dutch runs towards Saif, Ramin and Laila as gunshots zip past 
           his head. He dives beside them and cuts the zip ties from 
           their wrists.

                                 DUTCH
                        Stay low.

           Laila is frozen a few feet away like a deer in headlights, 
           bullets kicking up dust by her feet. Dutch scoops her up and 
           shields her with his body--

           --letting out a guttural growl when a bullet grazes his back.

           Machine gun fire erupts from the Technical beside him--

           --spraying bullets at the Contractor Convoy.

           Bosco returns fire from the SAW-- 

           CA-CHUG - CA-CHUG - CA-CHUG

           Dutch considers the dash back to the humvees that will leave 
           them even more exposed.

                                 SAIF

                        Cover me. I need to close it.

           Dutch holds Laila close, firing indiscriminately at the 
           Militants, while Saif pulls out a mini-sewing kit and 
           stitches Ramin’s severed flesh with a hook needle.

                        It’s not deep--

           Blood bubbles from the gash with each breath Ramin takes, 
           Dutch covering Laila’s watery eyes to block out the horror.

                                 SAIF
                             (Dari - Subtitled)
                        Be still.

           Saif’s hand trembles as he threads his son’s flesh back 
           together, tying it off as best he can.

                                 DUTCH
                        Can you run?

           Ramin nods.

                        Let’s move.

           Dutch signals to Bosco, who lays down cover fire as they  
           sprint across the desert, enemy fire poking holes in the 
           ground by their feet.

           Dutch tucks Laila in the backseat and slides behind the

           He follows Ramin’s reflection in the side view mirror, making 
           it safely inside the Jingle Truck.

                        You qualified on that thing?

           Saif nods and slides through the turret. Dutch eases on the 
           brake and lets the Jingle Truck pull ahead, forming a 
           protective barrier beside the Rear Humvee.

           50mph, the Jingle Truck and its heavy payload not able to go 
           any faster.

           The lighter Toyotas keep pace -- A Technical and standard 
           Pickup flank left, while the second Technical veers right, 
           trying to get a clean shot at the Jingle Truck’s tires--

           Dutch reaches for the radio, but Saif gets to it first.

                             (English)
                        We do that, we have no protection. 
                        As long as we have the truck they 
                        won’t use RPG’s or IED’s. They 
                        can’t risk losing the seizure, it’s 
                        too valuable.

           He hands Dutch the radio. 

                                 DUTCH (INTO RADIO)
                        He’s right. Smith’s gonna come at 
                        us, hard.

                        off the Ring?

           Saif pulls out a paper map and draws a route with his finger 
           through the provincial capital -- LASHKAR GAH.

                                 SAIF
                        The road through Lashkar Gah is too 
                        dangerous. The city is filled with 
                        Warlords loyal to the Taliban and 
                        with nightfall coming... The 
                        highway is the only choice.

           Dutch glances at Laila’s reflection in the rearview mirror, 
           head buried in her arms.

                                 DUTCH
                        Highway it is.

           Dutch dwells on the question for a curious moment, tapping 
           out a couple Pain Pills from the Tic Tac pack and popping 
           them in his mouth.

           Dutch takes in the crude stone shelters and mud huts resting 
           at the bottom of a dry dirt slope that elevates the highway. 

           The Camp is inhabited by emaciated REFUGEES wandering around 
           like hollowed out skeletons, hair matted with filth, eyes 
           glossed over. 

           He looks closer... Several of them inhaling smoke from thin 
           scraps of foil.

           on the ground beside weeks old garbage swarming with flies. 
           He studies each and every face, searching until he finds--

           Bosco shakes her, but she doesn’t respond, lost in delirium.

           Laila looks for an escape route when she’s snatched up and 
           carried off, her screams muffled by a filthy hand covering 
           her mouth.

           They look towards the edge of the Camp where a horde of

           A hand is clamped over Laila’s mouth, dampening her cries for 
           help. 

           The ABDUCTOR runs his other hand up her thigh, making its way 
           higher when--

           SHE BITES DOWN

           The Abductor shouts and rips it away, Laila’s cries 
           earsplitting at full volume.

           He pulls out a protein pouch and tries to feed him, but the 
           mush just dribbles down the Baby’s chin.

           A Refugee breaks from the pack and scales the side of the

                        Get’em off’a there.

           Ramin abandons the wheel and hits the Refugee with the TIRE 
           IRON, but more and more flock to the truck, Lambo grabbing at 
           their legs as they continue to swarm.

                        Your kid’s in agony.

           The Mother turns to her Baby and rubs Heroin residue against 
           its gums. A moment later the cries subside, the Child an 
           addict before its first birthday.

           The Abductor rears back and slaps Laila across the face--

           She goes quiet, his hand returning to her thigh when--

           CRACK

           The Abductor collapses, the back of his head bleeding out, 
           walloped by the butt of Dutch’s M4.

           Lambo and Saif battle the horde, tearing at their legs as

           The sheer number of bodies is overwhelming, leaving Lambo no

           Bosco turns towards the shots and hops to his feet, but

           He turns back to the Baby, unable to turn a blind eye to the 
           abuse it will endure living like this.

           The traffic grows more and more congested the further they 
           travel, horns honking, radios blasting Persian Pop, Driver’s

           Bosco peeks around the edge of a car and--

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT

           --twisting back as bullets zip past.

                                 BOSCO (INTO RADIO)
                        Someone find these guys before I 
                        catch one in the mouth.

           INT. LEAD HUMVEE - NEXT

           Saif glances at the Rear Humvee, but Lambo isn’t there, the 
           SAW deserted.

           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           Dutch hears Smith’s voice echo from somewhere in the forest 
           of idling cars.

                                 SMITH (O.C.)
                        Give us the truck Dutch. Toss the 
                        money inside and go. No one needs 
                        to die over this. 
                                 DUTCH
                        I’m no drug runner Frank. You can 
                        have the money, but we keep the 
                        truck.

                                 SMITH (O.C.)
                        No can do.

           Smith’s voice rings out from a different location entirely, 
           not staying in one spot for more than a moment.

                                 SMITH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t a negotiation. It’s an 
                        offer, best and final.

                        Lambo, you have eyes on?

           He waits... No response.

                                 DUTCH (INTO RADIO) (CONT’D)
                        Lambo do you have--

           CLICK

           Dutch’s question cut short by a gun barrel hitting the back 
           of his head. He looks at the reflection in the car next to 
           him and sees--

           LAMBO

           --holding a pistol against his head.

                                 LAMBO
                        Do what he says Dutch.

                                 DUTCH
                        Ramos think about--

                                 LAMBO
                        About how you’re willing to get us 
                        all killed over some fucking smack?

                                 DUTCH
                        It’s bigger than that--

                                 LAMBO
                        Bigger than what? You want this to 
                        be the Op that gets you sent home 
                        in a box?

           Lambo presses the pistol even harder against Dutch’s skull.
                                 LAMBO (CONT’D)
                        Could kickoff a pretty nice third 
                        act with that cash cushion. Don’t 
                        have anyone vouching to get me on a

           Dutch’s face falls, Lambo having overheard his conversation 
           with Smith in the transport plane.

                                 DUTCH
                        It’s drug money, Taliban money--

                                 LAMBO
                        So? What’s your life worth or 
                        Bosco’s or mine? Risking it every 
                        damn day in this God forsaken 
                        place. We deserve it. Every penny.

           Lambo’s voice begins to tremble.

                                 LAMBO (CONT’D)
                        You and your Muj buddies can ride 
                        off into the sunset, but me and

           Bosco watches Lambo and Dutch materialize from below the hood 
           of a car.

                                 LAMBO (O.C.)
                        ...hold your fire.

           Lambo shouts into the maze of idling cars.

                                 LAMBO
                        I’ll take the deal.

                                 DUTCH
                        Ramos, we’re doing something 
                        important for once--
           THUD

           Lambo hits Dutch in the back of the head with the gun barrel.

                                 LAMBO
                        Shut up.

           Bosco doesn’t reply.

                        What do you say Smith?

           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - SAME

           Smith has the Sat Phone at his ear.

                        Put a bullet in his head.

           The gun barrel rattles against Dutch’s head, sweat dripping 
           down Lambo’s brow.

           Smith’s back against the opposite side of the same car, 
           hearing Dutch’s confession.

                                 DUTCH (O.C.)

           Smith fights his inner turmoil, spotting Tofan a few cars 
           back, taking aim with his AK. 

           He tries to wave him off, but Tofan ignores the order.

                                 SMITH
                        No!

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT

           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - SAME

           Lambo’s body goes stiff and he falls to the ground. 

           Dutch drops down beside him and drags his body behind the 
           cover of a car. 

           He takes in his injuries, blood seeping through the bullet 
           holes in his chest.

                                 DUTCH
                        Hey, hey... Look at me.

           Lambo glances up from his hemorrhaging torso.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        It’s alright, you’re gonna be fine.

           He holds Dutch’s gaze, struggling to speak.

                                 LAMBO
                        Shit man, I shouldn’a drawn on you.

           Dutch tries to plug the wounds, but blood spills out like 
           water through a sieve. 

                                 DUTCH
                        The hell you do that for, huh?
           Lambo takes his last dying breath, staring straight up at the 
           sky.

           There’s a break in the traffic and Ramin eases on the gas, 
           driving over a DEAD BODY lying in the middle of the road.

           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - SAME

           TIGHT ON THE BODY--

           The dead AFGHAN MAN from the Insurgents trunk, wires peeking 
           through the neck of his shirt.

           ON A UNIFORMED INSURGENT--

           Watching the Body close, a cell phone detonator in his hand.

           The Jingle Truck passes over it, the Lead Humvee trailing 
           right behind.

           through the air.

           Ramin sees the explosion in his side view mirror and slams on 
           the brake.
           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           He arrives at the humvee, smoke billowing from its 
           undercarriage, the front end blown apart.

                        Father, father, can you hear me?

           Saif dangles upside down in the drivers seat. 

           Dutch looks through the shattered back windows, finding Laila 
           lying among shards of broken glass, but the Baby isn’t there.

           Soft cries catch his ear and he looks up, the Baby wedged 
           underneath the seat, where Laila tucked him.

           ON BOSCO--

           Standing over them and laying down cover fire--

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT

           --keeping Smith, Winnie and Tofan at bay.

           ON RAMIN--

           Pulling Saif from the humvee, his face covered in gashes, 
           dripping blood.

           Bosco helps carry him to the Jingle Truck, Dutch arriving a 
           moment later with Laila and the Baby, tucking them inside.

           The Jingle Truck struggles to keep up with the humvee, its 22-
           foot-long body slowing them down at every turn.

           Saif stirs, just as Ramin spots the Technical gaining ground

           Ramin lands inside and lays across the Heroin bricks. He 
           crawls to the edge and peeks over at Winnie on the bolt 
           mounted .50 Cal, firing at the Jingle Truck’s back tires--
           CA-CHUG - CA-CHUG - CA-CHUG

           He grabs a plastic container of PRECURSOR CONVERSION 
           CHEMICALS and unscrews the top, stuffing a strip of cloth 
           down the neck.

           He lights the rag and lets the flame eat away at the cloth 
           fuse before he drops it out.

           from the Baby.

           EXT. CITY STREETS - LASHKAR GAH - NEXT

           The Lead Humvee races down another narrow stretch, the Jingle 
           Truck hot on its heels as they approach-- 

           PEACE SQUARE 

           A roundabout decorated by a statue of a GLOBE resting between 
           two massive DOVES.

           INT. LEAD HUMVEE - NEXT

           Dutch floors it-- 

           25mph... 30... 35...

           The Jingle Truck keeps pace, the Convoy moving with one 
           brain. 

           40mph... 45... 50...

           Dutch looks out his window, the traffic circle empty, not a 
           single automobile or pedestrian in sight.

                                 DUTCH
                        Something’s wrong...

           They roll into the roundabout and-- 

           CRASH

                                                                 BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:

           Shallow breaths, panicked moans... 

           A light clicks - ON - revealing Brandon in bed, in the throes 
           of a night terror. Dutch takes a seat on the edge of the 
           mattress and places a hand on his shoulder.
                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        It’s alright son, it’s alright...

           Brandon shoots up, beads of sweat dripping down his brow.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Here.

           Dutch drops a couple Pain Pills in his palm.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Helps with the aches and pains...

           He taps his temple.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        ...and that dark shit too.

           Brandon swallows them down and looks Dutch square in the eye.

                                 BRANDON
                        Wake up Dutch... Wake up--

                                                               BACK TO:

           Dutch’s eyes flicker open -- The Car that broad-sided them 
           crushed against the Jingle Truck’s front end, a hole in the 
           windshield where the driver was ejected. 

           Saif’s at his door, shaking him.

                                 SAIF
                        --Dutch, wake up...

           INT. CARGO BED - JINGLE TRUCK - SAME

           Ramin looks at the rooftops where Militants are taking aim. 

           EXT. PEACE SQUARE - LASHKAR GAH - SAME

           Even more swarm the square, AKs and Kalashnikovs at the 
           ready.

           INT. LEAD HUMVEE - SAME

           Bosco is unconscious on the floor below the turret.

                                 DUTCH
                        Help me with him.
           INT. CARGO BED - JINGLE TRUCK - SAME

           Ramin continues to scan the rooftops, spotting a Militant 
           taking aim with an RPG.

           INT. LEAD HUMVEE - SAME

           Dutch reaches for Bosco when Ramin’s voice comes through the 
           radio.

                                 RAMIN (RADIO)
                             (English)
                        Rocket, take cover!

           Saif looks to the rooftop where the Militant has them dead to 
           rights.

                                 SAIF
                        Come, now!

           He pulls on Dutch’s arm, but he swats it off.

                                 DUTCH
                        Help me dammit!

           The Militant fires the rocket and Saif tears him away--

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no...

           --Bosco’s hand slips though Dutch’s fingers.

           EXT. PEACE SQUARE - LASHKAR GAH - CONTINUOUS

           Saif drags him kicking and screaming behind a WALL and--

           BOOM

           The rocket explodes, the humvees armor plating and 
           bulletproof glass no match for the blast.

           Dutch tries to break free, but Saif holds him back, the only 
           one recognizing the grim reality of the situation.

           INT. DRONE CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           The Drone Op stares at his screen in horror.

                                 DRONE OPERATOR
                        At least one casualty. They’ll have 
                        video of it online within the hour.
           Clarridge is quiet, watching the mission unravel from the 
           safety of a computer screen. 

           He moves his hand towards the holster at his hip, draws his 
           PISTOL and takes aim at the Drone Op--

           BANG

           The Drone Op’s head crashes against his desk - THUD - blood 
           splattering across the flat-screens streaming video of the 
           Convoy.

           Clarridge creeps out and locks the door.

           EXT. CONTRACTOR ALLEY - CAMP LEATHERNECK - CONTINUOUS

           Clarridge leans against an up-armored Suburban, pulls out a 
           cigarette and lights up.

           EXT. PEACE SQUARE - LASHKAR GAH - SHORT TIME LATER

           Militants drag Bosco’s body from the wreckage, his skin 
           charred, face unrecognizable. 

           Another hops in the Jingle Truck and drives off -- Laila and 
           the Baby trapped inside, Ramin still hiding in the Cargo Bed.

           Dutch and Saif watch, utterly helpless in this moment.

                                 SAIF
                             (English)
                        We can’t walk the streets like 
                        this.

           Saif leads Dutch inside a bombed out APARTMENT BUILDING. 

           Militants fire celebratory bullet bursts into the air, 
           capturing video of Bosco’s charred remains on their cell 
           phones as they slap his corpse with the heels of their shoes.

           INT. DATSUN - NEXT

           Smith and Tofan roll past the smoldering humvee in a stolen 
           car, the Militants still celebrating over Bosco’s charred 
           remains.

                                 SMITH
                        Jesus Christ...
                                 TOFAN
                             (English)
                        You will not find him here.

           Tofan makes a call.

                             (Pashto - Subtitled)

                             (A beat - English)
                        Drive.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LASHKAR GAH - NIGHT

           Dutch and Saif have traded their uniforms for shawls and 
           turbans, Dutch looking native if you don’t get a good look at 
           his face.

                                 SAIF
                             (English)
                        Keep your head down.

           Saif pulls a TRACKING BEACON from his pocket, matching the 
           Tracker he left in the Cargo Bed earlier.

                                 DUTCH
                        You’ve had that the whole time?

           He nods as he picks the lock on the door of a PARKED CAR.

                                 DUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you think that would be 
                        something important for me to know?

                                 SAIF
                        Now you know.

           EXT. QALA-E-BOST RUINS - LATER

           The Jingle Truck is parked under an 11th Century arch 
           illuminated by Land Cruiser headlights, the entrance to the 
           ruins of the ancient citadel -- BOST. 

           Smith moves towards Juma Khan with Tofan at his back, when a 
           flashlight clicks on revealing--

           ADAMS 

           --down on his knees, face swollen and bruised.

                                 SMITH
                        You got it back, now let him go.
                                 JUMA KHAN
                        Yes, but you were not the one to 
                        recover it. 

           Tofan puts a gun to Smith’s head.

                                 JUMA KHAN (CONT’D)
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        Where is the other one?

                                 TOFAN
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        Dead.

           A Militant pours GASOLINE over Adams head and Khan flicks on 
           a lighter.

                                 JUMA KHAN
                        Americans and your arrogance. Just 
                        like the Soviets and the British 
                        before you. The Great Game. What 
                        Arthur Connolly called it before 
                        the Uzbek’s took his head. East and 
                        West fighting for control of lands 
                        they know nothing about. This place 
                        has stood for thousands of years. 
                        Our ancestors drove back Ghengis 
                        Khan and Tarlemene, great 
                        conquerors of their time.
                             (A beat)
                        Afghanistan has never fallen and it 
                        never will. We are a patient 
                        people. Time... it is our strongest 
                        weapon.

           He moves the lighter towards Adams when--

           LAILA 

           --steps out of the Jingle Truck with the Baby in her arms.

                                 TOFAN
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        It’s the girl.

                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        Bring her to me. I want her to 
                        remember this night.

           Tofan drags Laila over and Khan takes her by the hand.

                                 JUMA KHAN (CONT’D)
                        You see this man. 
           He lifts her chin, forcing her to look Adams in the eye, 
           mumbling at her through swollen and bloody lips.

                                 ADAMS
                        Shoot me, please shoot me...

                                 JUMA KHAN
                        He is our enemy and must punished. 

           Khan puts the lighter in her hand, the tiny flame flickering 
           in the wind.

                                 JUMA KHAN (CONT’D)
                        Touch it here...

           He moves her trembling hand towards Adams vest, light from 
           the flame highlighting his battered face.

                                 ADAMS
                        Don’t burn me alive, please--

           WHOOSH

           Flames engulf him, piercing screams echoing through the cold 
           night air as tears fall from Laila’s eyes. She tries to look 
           away, but Khan forces her to watch.

                                 JUMA KHAN
                        Do not look away.

           GUARDS patrol the entrance when--

           THWUCK - THWUCK

           --Dutch and Saif pop up from out of nowhere and slit their 
           throats, killing them softly.

           EXT. QALA-E-BOST RUINS - NEXT

           Smith is on his knees beside Adams smouldering remains, a 
           Militant holding the container of Gasoline above his head.
                                 JUMA KHAN
                        Your Government will not 
                        acknowledge your death. No one will 
                        know, no one will care.

           The Militant is about to pour the propellant when--

           VRRROOOM

           The Jingle Truck’s engine purrs, Ramin behind the wheel. Khan 
           and the Militants turn towards it.

                                 KHAN
                             (Pashto - Subtitled)
                        Kill him.

           They aim their weapons, ready to fire when--

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT

           ON DUTCH & SAIF--

           Raining down a hail of gunfire, Militants collapsing one by 
           one, along with Khan and Tofan.

           Saif grabs Laila and they race to the Jingle Truck.

                                 DUTCH
                        Go, go, go.

           Ramin drops the pedal to the floor and speeds away.

           EXT. QALA-E-BOST RUINS - NEXT

           Tofan runs towards the Jingle Truck and grabs hold of the 
           Cargo Bed, securing his footing on the back bumper, hitching 
           a ride.

           EXT. QALA-E-BOST RUINS - NEXT

           Smith pushes a Militant off him and he sits up, the container 
           of Gasoline right beside him. 

           ON KHAN--

           Lying in the dirt, a bullet wound to his stomach as Smith 
           steps beside him.

                                 KHAN

                        I don’t want it, not anymore.

           Khan realizes he can’t change Smith’s mind, no matter what he 
           offers.

                                 KHAN
                        Make it a quick death.

                        As quick as you gave him.

           Smith pours the fuel over Khan’s legs and sparks a flame, 
           bringing it to the bottom of his shawl--

           WHOOSH

           Khan’s robes ignite, his piercing screams echoing through the 
           cold night air.

           Headlights shine bright, blazing a trail.

           Outside a road sign reads: CAMP LEATHERNECK 5 MILES.

           Dutch replays Lambo’s words over and over in his head.

           The truck crests over an incline -- Headlights shining bright 
           in their eyes, casting the MAN standing in front of an up-
           armored GMC Suburban, in shadow.

           Dutch pulls out his binoculars, the dark silhouette flagging 
           them down.

           The Man arrives outside Dutch’s door and his worn face comes 
           into focus--

           CLARRIDGE

                                 CLARRIDGE
                        Word from dispatch said you might 
                        need some help.

                        Clusterfuck, lost most everyone.

           Clarridge shakes his head, playing up his grief.

                                 CLARRIDGE
                        Got med supplies in the truck. Food 
                        and water too. Whatever you need.

           The Baby cries.

                                 CLARRIDGE (CONT’D)
                        That a kid?

           Dutch nods and looks at Saif.

                                 DUTCH
                        Get Laila and the baby cleaned up?

           Saif nods in agreement. 

           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - NEXT

           Dutch follows Clarridge towards the Suburban with the Baby in 
           his arms, a paternal look coming across his face as Laila 
           clings to his leg.

                                 CLARRIDGE
                        Dispatch said you hadn’t called in 
                        since early this morning.

                        Who’d you say you’re with?

           Clarridge flashes a badge with the same company logo printed 
           across Dutch’s shirt and tattooed on his arm.

           A gun barrel enters frame. Saif looks at Ramin’s reflection 
           in the rearview mirror, his son aiming the gun at his head.

                                 SAIF
                        It is not that simple--

                                 RAMIN
                        When the Americans leave and the 
                        Taliban return at full force, the 
                        Mujihadeen will need that money. 

           Saif looks Ramin square in the eye.

                                 SAIF

                        Then nothing I say will change your 
                        mind.

           He turns to the door and pops it open when--

           THWUCK

           Blood splashes against the back of Saif’s neck. 

           He turns back, Ramin’s throat slashed open, Tofan clutching 
           the Pesh-Kabz Knife outside the window.

           Saif reaches for his gun but Tofan gets to his first--

           BANG

           --catching Saif in the gut and he falls out the door.

           EXT. RING ROAD - HELMAND PROVINCE - SAME

           Dutch passes the Baby to Laila and closes the door, 
           withdrawing his M4 when--

           CLICK

           --a gun barrel hits the side of his head.

                                 CLARRIDGE

           Clarridge glances at Tofan, who disappears behind the side of 
           the Jingle Truck.

                                 CLARRIDGE (CONT’D)
                        Let me ask you something... Is that 
                        truck really worth dying for?

           Saif is lying against the front right tire, clutching his 
           abdomen as Tofan kneels beside him and aims the Marakov

           engine stops him, turning to find one of Khan’s LAND CRUISERS 
           pulling up behind the Jingle Truck. 

           He holds Dutch in front of him like a shield, breathing a 
           sigh of relief when Smith steps out.

           help him to his feet when--

           Smith’s body shudders, bullets tearing into his back. 

           Dutch glances at the Jingle Truck, Saif with the Revolver 
           smoking in his hand.

           Saif drops the weapon and falls backs inside.

           Dutch crawls to Smith’s side, blood seeping into the dry 
           earth underneath him. He takes Smith’s hand, their matching 
           M.E.R.C. tattoos together again.

           Dutch shoves something between two of the stacked bricks.
           He punches the button, the belt buzzing as a high pitched 
           ALARM cries out and the pallets moves towards a steel door.

           It opens -- Two tame pilot lights ablaze.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           --a truck grill. The  GMC logo front and center, HIGHWAY TO 
           HELL playing softly through its speakers.

           We pull out wide to find that it’s not an up-armored Suburban

                                 BRANDON
                        Are you?

           Brandon moves towards the entrance, Dutch following in his 
           footsteps a moment later.
