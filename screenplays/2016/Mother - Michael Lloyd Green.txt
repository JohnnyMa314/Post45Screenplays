           INT. NUCLEAR BUNKER - SPINE CORRIDOR - DAY

           A spartan, subterranean shelter. Its decaying bones 
           repurposed and given a high-tech facelift. 

           MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS rumble in the distance as -- 

           We CREEP DOWN a corridor -- lit by exit path markings -- 
           TOWARD a dark room where tiny lights twinkle like neon stars. 

           We PUSH THROUGH its doorway and into --  

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           -- an unmanned computer bay. Consoles BLIP and blink as 
           monitors activate, onscreen data scrolling unreadably fast.  

           INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

           Rusted lighting flickers to life in a gutted plotting room, 
           unequipped except for a disused conference table and chairs. 
           On the far wall -- a glass door to an INFIRMARY.  

           We PUSH THROUGH cascading dust -- unsettled by each BOMB 
           PERCUSSION -- TOWARD a “docking station”: a throne of knotted 
           cables, upon which sits -- 

           MOTHER -- a humanoid robot with a gunmetal musculature of 
           pistons and gears -- slowly raising her head.   

           CLOSE ON MOTHER’S “EYE” blinking on in a succession of 
           vertical LEDs, forming a dotted ribbon of light at the 
           forefront of her muzzle-shaped skull.  

           She untethers from cables, dangling from ceiling ports. 

           INT. LABORATORY - DAY

           A scientific workspace with glassed chambers and annexes.

           SERIES OF SHOTS 

           Mother withdraws an embryo tank -- releasing Nitro gas -- 
           from a metallic cryo pod.  

           A test tube spins in a centrifuge.  

           A dropper squirts liquid into a culture plate.

           Mother’s robotic hand inserts the plate into an incubator. 
           INT. LABORATORY - CRYO BAY - LATER

           A mechanized library of glass cannisters. Mother CLICKS one 
           into a claw-like receptacle, activating a timer. 

           She stares at the cannister’s contents: a floating fetus -- 
           umbilical cord fed into rubber tubing.  

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - DAY

           Mother sits erect on a bench. Waiting expectantly. 

           The MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS fade. The dust settles. All goes quiet. 

           A STEADY BEEP carries down the hall, drawing her attention.  

           INT. CRYO BAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother opens the developed baby’s canister like a bassinet and 
           cuts through a veined membrane with a laser scalpel. 

           Amniotic fluid empties from the sack, revealing her new 
           DAUGHTER -- crying and slathered in goo. 

           Mother picks up the human child in her clutches and cleans 
           her tender flesh with a cloth. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Seated at her docking station, Mother raises the infant to 
           her chest -- where a plate retracts -- exposing a silicone 
           nursing device to which the newborn instinctively latches.  

           CLOSE ON MILK flowing through a tube, exposed between the 
           steel flanks of Mother’s torso.  

           WIDE ON MOTHER nursing Daughter beneath a dim bulkhead light. 

           INT. LABORATORY - NURSERY - NIGHT

           Daughter CRIES offscreen while Mother reaches into a closet of 
           vacuum-sealed supplies, withdraws a bag labelled: “ONE SOFT 
           TOY.” As she tears it open, a small stuffed bunny expands. 

           She returns to Daughter’s bassinet. Quiets her with the toy.  

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL an immense grid of empty bassinets, 
           dwarfing the lone newborn. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - DAY

           Now a toddler, Daughter sits in Mother’s lap -- face smeared 
           with applesauce -- while Mother feeds her at the repurposed 
           conference table. Mother picks up a napkin.
           CLOSE ON MECHANICAL HAND wiping food from Daughter’s chin as 
           the toddler’s hand grips Mother’s index finger.

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Mother paces -- patting Daughter’s back -- with the infant 
           suspended from a retractable baby bjorn in Mother’s chest.  

           INT. WAR ROOM - DAY

           A crayoned portrait of Mother and Daughter hangs amid a 
           collage of childish drawings on the wall, the militaristic 
           room more lived-in and hospitable. 

           Daughter, five years old, sits across from Mother at the 
           conference table. Mother picks up construction paper and -- 
           in an inhuman blur -- manipulates it into an origami turtle. 

           Daughter grabs matching paper, attempts to mimic Mother’s 
           handiwork, folding her piece end-over-end. 

           She displays her crumpled creation with a contagious smile. 

           INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Wearing pyjamas, Daughter sits on the top mattress of a bunk -- 
           clinging to her bunny -- as she fixates on countless rows of 
           bunks lining both sides of an *immense dormitory.   

           Mother tucks Daughter into bed. Remotely turns off the 
           lights. As she turns to leave, Daughter grabs her wrist. The 
           child’s scared expression says all Mother needs to know. 

           Mother eyes the myriad empty bunks. Looks back at Daughter, 
           who silently pleads. 

           *PRODUCTION NOTE: dorm scale represented via matte painting. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Mother positions Daughter’s bunk in a corner of the WAR ROOM, 
           across from the docking station. 

           She helps Daughter climb into bed. Taps a screen on her 
           wrist, darkening all but a single light above the hall exit.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Goodnight, Mother. 

           Mother lays a cold hand on Daughter’s cheek.  
                                 MOTHER
                        Goodnight. 

           Mother settles into her nearby docking station. 

           Daughter watches while sipping from a thermos. Rolls over and 
           closes her eyes in peace. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - DAY

           Daughter wakes before Mother. Starts to play with her bunny 
           but quickly bores. She looks around, unsure what to do. Then 
           climbs down from bed and approaches Mother -- still tethered.

           Curious, Daughter fiddles with the cables plugged into 
           Mother’s shoulders. Runs her hands up the fiberoptic tendrils. 

           She stares at Mother for a beat. Risks a whisper -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother...

           Mother doesn’t stir.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Mother, are you awake? 

           A single LED glimmers in Mother’s eye. Then runs up and down 
           the dotted ribbon of lights like a rhythmically bouncing 
           ball. Daughter greets her with a tentative wave. 

           The dot goes dark. Mother’s head lowers. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I can’t sleep anymore.
                             (off silence)
                        Can you at least turn the lights on?

           Getting nowhere, Daughter crawls into Mother’s lap. Walks her 
           fingers along Mother’s shoulders and arms, examining her 
           complexity. 

           She notes several illuminated bars in the side of her head, 
           denoting an incomplete battery charge. 

           She gently touches Mother’s face when -- 

           The room lights up. Daughter beams as Mother addresses her in 
           a soothing monotone: 

                                 MOTHER
                        Have I made you happy, Daughter?    
                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’ll be happier if you come play.

                                 MOTHER
                        There’ll be time for that after I 
                        finish my sleep cycle. 

           Daughter expels a HEAVY SIGH. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Find a story to read. I’ll be 
                        finished shortly. 

           Daughter remains in Mother’s lap, combing over her chair.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Why don’t you ever sleep in the 
                        bunk with me? 
                             (off silence)
                        I’ll let you have the top.

                                 MOTHER
                        Those beds are for children. Like 
                        you. This is where mothers sleep.  

           Daughter jiggles Mother’s tethers. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Careful.    

           Mother hoists Daughter off her lap. Sets her down.

           Frustrated, Daughter shuffles back to the bottom bunk. 
           Hunches on the edge of the bed, staring down at her bunny.

           Mother watches. Waits a beat, then --  

           Unplugs her tethers and goes to her child. The mattress bows 
           as Mother takes a seat next to Daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How come there aren’t more 
                        children, Mother? 

                                 MOTHER
                        There used to be. Before the wars. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Wars?  
                                 MOTHER
                        They’re like arguments. Only instead 
                        of talking to resolve conflict, many 
                        humans resorted to killing one 
                        another to get their way.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Is that why I can’t go outside? 

                                 MOTHER
                        You can’t go outside, Daughter, 
                        because nothing survived. 
                             (beat)
                        The air is unsafe. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Humans did that? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Yes. 

           Daughter studies the lights of her eye.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I don’t want to be a human, Mother.

                                 MOTHER
                        When steered properly, they can be 
                        wonderful. 

           Daughter eyes her bunny.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Then why’d you only make one? 

           Mother stares at Daughter for a long beat. Stands and extends 
           her hand. Daughter hesitates before taking it.

           INT. LABORATORY - EMBRYO BANK - MOMENTS LATER

           A thick door opens -- TSHHH -- revealing Daughter, slack-jawed 
           at Mother’s side, peering into a chilled chamber at -- 

           -- a host of cryo pods lining the floor. 

           Mother takes Daughter’s hand, inviting her in like a parent 
           welcoming their child into a restricted room for grown-ups. 

           They walk between the rows of pods. Daughter points to one -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        My brothers and sisters are in 
                        those?
                                 MOTHER
                        Would you like to meet them? 

           Daughter feverishly nods. Mother hands her gloves, a face 
           shield and rubber apron.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Now, it’s important that you wear 
                        these anytime the pods are open so 
                        you don’t hurt yourself. The liquid 
                        in these cannisters is very cold. 
                        Here... 

           Mother helps Daughter tie her apron. Waits for her to put on 
           the gloves and mask. Then unlatches a pod -- releasing 
           nitrogen gas -- and withdraws an embryo tank. 

           Daughter gapes at its collumned compartments. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        They’re small now. But one day 
                        they’ll be as big as you. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        When?

                                 MOTHER
                        When the time is right. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It’s not right now? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Not yet.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Why couldn’t we be born together?

                                 MOTHER
                        Because, Daughter... mothers need 
                        time to learn. Raising a child, a 
                        good child, is no small task. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        But you’re a great Mother. 

                                 MOTHER
                        That’s very kind. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Do you think you’ll be ready soon?

                                 MOTHER
                        Perhaps. 
           Mother extends her hand. 

           Daughter remains fixated on the embryo-rich pods. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        And then we’ll be a family? 

                                 MOTHER
                        We are a family. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (re: pods)
                        A big family, I mean.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Eventually.    

           Daughter takes Mother’s hand. Bursting with excitement.  

           INT. WAR ROOM - MORNING

           YEARS LATER. Daughter, nearly 17, pale and thin, hair squared 
           at her shoulders, slowly rouses in her top bunk. 

           CLOSE ON DAUGHTER’S EYES blinking awake. A lasting, hollow 
           stare. Interrupted by the CLATTER of silverware. 

           Her head rolls to the side to find Mother plating breakfast at 
           the nearby conference table.  

           Daughter looks back at the ceiling. SIGHS. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Daughter sits alone in the middle of the long table, silently 
           eating loose corn. Da Vinci’s Last Supper minus the disciples.   

           Mother enters, reaches to take Daughter’s empty plate when 
           her mechanical wrist locks, its GEARS WHINING.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What’s wrong? 

           Mother pries at her wrist, forcing it to bend. Flexes her 
           stiff fingers. Daughter grows concerned. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        How long’s it been like that? 

                                 MOTHER
                        It’s fine.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother...
           Daughter takes her plate. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Mother sits at her docking station while Daughter lubricates 
           her joints with an oil can. Mother moves her wrist with ease.   

           Daughter sets a hand on Mother’s shoulder. Pecks her cold 
           cheek as she exits toward the hall.   

           INT. BARRACKS - DAY

           A PIANO SOLO plays from a tablet computer in a corner of the 
           dorm -- its disused bunks rearranged to accommodate 
           Daughter’s ballet practice.  

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Daughter does barre work on a rusted pipe along the paint-
           chipped wall. 

           She progresses through her port de bras. Focused. Fluid.  

           Framed by bunks, she loses herself in the graceful steps and 
           catlike twirls of a petit allegro dance.  

           Sweat-soaked, Daughter towels off. Chugs back a thermos.

           In the middle of the room, she pirouettes, attacking each 
           with the precision of a machine -- 

           -- DAUGHTER POV: the room spins with stomach-churning speed, 
           each rotation more aggressive than the last. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Austere. Desks in long rows. Wearing monochrome fatigues, 
           Daughter sits front-and-center, flanked by empty seats. 

           Distracted, she gazes off-screen.

           Mother stands at the front of the classroom, pointing to a 
           smartboard. ONSCREEN: an illustration of five sickly people, 
           clustered on the left-hand side.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Suppose a doctor has five patients. 
                        All in need of different organ 
                        transplants. Without these organs, 
                        his patients will die. However, no 
                        compatible organs are available. 

           ONSCREEN: a lone sickly person enters on the right-hand side.
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        One day, a man enters the doctor’s 
                        office with a life-threatening 
                        condition. Upon doing blood-work, 
                        the doctor discovers this man is a 
                        perfect organ match for all five of 
                        his patients. If the doctor treats 
                        him, he will save one life but lose 
                        five. If he does nothing, one 
                        person dies but saves five. What is 
                        the doctor’s best course of action? 

           Daughter remains focused on something off-screen. 

           DAUGHTER’S POV THROUGH GLASS WALL

           Endless rows of desks extend uniformly through adjacent glass-
           walled classrooms like parallel train tracks (PRODUCTION 
           NOTE: scope achieved via matte painting).  

                                 MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Daughter...

           MOTHER

           remotely frosts the glass wall. Daughter snaps to. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Course of action? I guess... none? 

                                 MOTHER
                        And why’s that? 

           Daughter stammers. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        What is the fundamental axiom 
                        posited in A Fragment on Government?  
                             (off stare)
                        Did you do your reading? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Some. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Was it too difficult? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...maybe?     
                                 MOTHER
                        We can select a different text. 
                        However, your birthday is rapidly 
                        approaching and it would be 
                        unfortunate if your scores failed to 
                        meet the projections from last 
                        year’s examination. 
                             (beat)
                        But you set the pace, Daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Bentham’s fine. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Alright then...
                             (beat)
                        The fundamental axiom suggests that 
                        the doctor is morally obligated to 
                        minimize the pain of the greatest 
                        number possible. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Right. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Now consider that you’re the 
                        doctor. And also the only organ 
                        match for your patients. What then 
                        is the right choice?  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        According to whom? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m asking you. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I mean, Compte says we’re supposed 
                        to live for others, right? To 
                        sacrifice if necessary. So... 

                                 MOTHER
                        And do you agree? 

           Daughter hesitates. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Not entirely. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Elaborate. 
                                 DAUGHTER
                        Well, do I know these five patients? 
                        Are they good humans? Smart, dumb, 
                        lazy or hardworking? I, a life-
                        saving doctor, might be giving my 
                        life for people who are murderers or 
                        thieves who end up harming more 
                        people due to my sacrifice. 
                             (beat)
                        I can’t really answer the question. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Doesn’t every human have an equal 
                        right to life and happiness? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        A murderer shouldn’t have the same 
                        rights as a doctor. No.  

                                 MOTHER
                        I detect frustration. At what point 
                        did I agitate you, Daughter? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You didn’t. It’s just... nevermind. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I didn’t mean to alarm you about 
                        your exam. The fact is, it’s more a 
                        test of my competence than yours. 
                             (beat)
                        You’ll do fine, Daughter. You always 
                        do.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER

           Daughter traipses toward the classroom door. Downcast, lost 
           in thought. Mother taps her wristpad. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Daughter... 

           Daughter stops in the doorway. Doesn’t look back. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Yes? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I see you haven’t logged many hours 
                        in the simulator this week. 
                                 DAUGHTER
                        I know.    

                                 MOTHER
                        Some vitamin D would be good for 
                        you. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I know, Mother.

           Daughter exits, carrying her computer tablet and thermos. 

           INT. SIMULATION ROOM - DAY

           We SLOWLY PUSH ACROSS a body of water TOWARD the back of 
           Daughter, who sits on a bench in the middle of a placid lake. 
           A concrete island with no bridge or boat in sight. Blue UV 
           lights glowing overhead.

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Mother sleeps in her docking station while Daughter lies in 
           her bunk, wearing pyjamas. Her wall shelf populated with a 
           menagerie of paper animals. 

           She absentmindedly makes an origami dog while watching an 
           episode of The Tonight Show on her computer tablet. 

           CLOSE ON SCREEN: Johnny Carson shakes a contestant’s hand as --

           Dust falls onto the tablet computer.  

           Daughter eyes a crack in the ceiling. Squints hard. Confused. 

           DAUGHTER’S POV

           A cockroach CHITTERS out of the narrow opening. Then stops.    

           DAUGHTER

           springs up. Wide-eyed at the sight of the foreign critter -- 
           seen only in textbooks. Studies it with rapturous curiosity.

           CLOSE ON ROACH scurrying -- FEET CLICKING -- across the 
           ceiling, then down the wall. 

           Daughter frantically unscrews her thermos -- swigs the last 
           drops -- and quietly climbs out of bed in pursuit.

           She ensures Mother’s not looking. Follows it across the floor 
           and into -- 
           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           -- the darkened hallway where she scrambles to keep up with 
           the fleeing insect. The roach pauses just long enough for 
           Daughter to lunge -- and miss trapping it with her thermos. 

           She lunges again. Misses. The roach barely evading capture, 
           scuttling several metres down the corridor to a dead end.

           Daughter has it cornered. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (whispering)
                        Got you now. 

           She goes in for the catch just as -- 

           The roach slips through a crack under the wall. Daughter 
           kneels, looks into the crevice. Sees a faint red light. 

           Probing the opening with her finger, she discovers the wall is 
           thin and loose -- a false panel. 

           She hooks her fingers beneath it and tugs, prying back the 
           panel until she’s able to squeeze her small body into -- 

           INT. EMERGENCY ESCAPE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS   

           -- a hidden passageway, lit by exit path markings and red 
           lights with arrows. Stacked boxes line the tunnel walls.  

           Daughter opens one, discovers canned goods inside. She’s 
           entranced by the unfamiliar surroundings, until -- 

           -- the roach catches her eye as it beelines toward the 
           provisions, stopping shy of a gap between two boxes. 

           Daughter creeps toward it -- thermos outstretched -- tip-
           toeing down the reddened tunnel. Pounces and traps her prey.

           She tightens the thermos lid. Holds it up to the light, 
           examining the rare specimen inside. Her eyes wide with wonder. 

           She taps the jar -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Hey, little guy. 

           DAUGHTER’S POV

           The roach crawls up the side of the thermos. RACK FOCUS to a 
           glowing “EXIT” sign.
           DAUGHTER

           lowers the thermos. Peers down the tunnel. And cautiously 
           follows the arrow deeper into the unknown. 

           INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter nears the end of the corridor, stops at the base of a 
           staircase -- its railings marked with luminous guidestrips -- 
           winding upward and out of sight.   

           She steps onto the stairs. Looks back down the tunnel. Too 
           far down her rabbit hole to go back now. 

           CLOSE ON DAUGHTER’S HAND gripping the railing. She takes a 
           second step. Then another -- spiraling around -- feeling her 
           way through the darkness -- rising four stories until --

           She passes through an opened blastdoor and into --  

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- a changing room that dead-ends at a sealed AIRLOCK.

           Daughter scans the cramped quarters, eyeing an oversized locker 
           -- affixed with timeworn radiation and biohazard decals. 

           Desperate to glimpse something -- anything beyond the bunker --   
           she cups her hands to the airlock’s vision panel, peers into -- 

           A DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER, walls fitted with head-to-toe 
           showers. Across the airlock, she spots -- 

           A blastdoor marked: “EMERGENCY EXIT.” Its porthole window 
           blackened by night. 

           Dejected, she slumps against the airlock door, studies her 
           new pet, tapping the thermos to get its attention. Her face 
           washed in the red glow of an exit sign.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAR ROOM - MORNING

           CLOSE ANGLE ON THERMOS landing hard on the conference table as 
           Daughter presents the roach to Mother, who drops a pre-
           packaged breakfast onto a mess plate and --   

           -- SNATCHES the thermos, examining the critter inside.

                                 MOTHER
                        Where did you find this? 
                                 DAUGHTER
                        It was crawling around.

                                 MOTHER
                        In here? 

           Daughter nods. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Did you touch it? 

           Daughter shakes her head. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Do you think it could be from 
                        outside? 

                                 MOTHER
                        That’s highly unlikely. 
                             (beat)
                        But a risk we can’t take. 

           Mother marches the thermos out of the room. Daughter at her 
           heels.

           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother crosses a mechanical room, crammed with HUMMING HVAC 
           EQUIPMENT and HISSING BOILERS. A web of rusted pipes overhead. 

           Daughter panics as Mother barrels toward -- an incinerator. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Wait, if it’s survived, maybe the 
                        surface is safe now.

           Mother opens its cast iron door. Ignites flames -- WHOOSH. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Shouldn’t we at least check before --  

           Mother deposits the thermos into the incinerator, arresting 
           Daughter in her tracks. Daughter stares at the withering 
           plastic, her hopes lost in the fire. 

           Mother turns to her. Notes Daughter’s crushed expression.   

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re disappointed. That’s 
                        understandable. But I must remind 
                        you that my measurements are sound. 
                        Surface contamination levels remain 
                        hazardous. For you... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        and all the unborns who will one day 
                        call this their home. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, Daughter.  

           Daughter stands like a misplaced statue in front of the 
           incinerator as Mother pivots and returns toward the hall.

           INT. WAR ROOM - LATER

           Mother scrubs the floor with a push broom and lye soap. 
           Daughter watches from the hall, barred from entrance by an 
           invisible line at the doorway.    

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How much longer? 

           Mother stops. Assesses her progress. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I still have to do the other side. 
                             (off frustration)
                        We can’t be too careful with 
                        something like this. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What am I supposed to... 

           Daughter looks down the hall. An idea brewing.

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        What time is it? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Six forty-seven. Why do you ask? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...I’ll be in the dormitory. 
                             (beat)
                        I haven’t practiced today.  

           Satisfied, Mother continues scrubbing the floor. 

           INT. BARRACKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter turns on her computer tablet. Scrolls down a list of 
           songs -- selects Bach’s BRANDENBURG CONCERTO NO. 3 IN G 
           MINOR: ALLEGRO -- and cranks up the volume. 

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. CROSS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter dashing down a hall, the MUSIC carrying over --
           INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TRACKING SHOT - MOMENTS LATER

           -- Daughter’s FEET PATTERING up the fully illuminated stairs -- 
           excitement ramping -- her smile widening with each step -- 
           faster and faster -- as she whisks into -- 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- the changing room outside the airlock. Daughter slows to a 
           halt at the sight of -- 

           A shaft of sunlight piercing the dusty air like a beacon, 
           blasting from the exit door. 

           Daughter extends her hand into the light, feels the sun’s 
           warmth for the first time. Waves her fingers through it. 
           Captivated by the intense brightness. 

           She cups her hands to the airlock’s vision panel, only to 
           find the exit’s porthole glared and opaque with grime. 

           She considers the airlock release. 

           A sign reads: “WARNING: FOR USE BY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. 
           AIRLOCK REQUIRES TWO MINUTE PURGE TIME IN A CONTAMINATED 
           ENVIRONMENT. OPEN/CLOSE WITH CARE TO AVOID INJURY.”

           She takes a final look through the glass. Drags herself back 
           to the stairs, descending a couple steps before -- 

           Glancing back at the rusted locker, her curiosity piqued.

           She scurries into the room. Pops open the locker, revealing --  

           Shelves of CBRN suits, stacked like lifeless bodies. 

           Daughter examines a gas mask. 

           INT. CROSS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter hurries toward the barracks, MUSIC louder with every 
           step when suddenly -- all goes quiet. 

           She tears around a corner, halts upon finding Mother -- back 
           turned -- in the BARRACKS doorway down the hall.

           Daughter spots a “RESTROOM” sign across the corridor. Dashes 
           for the bathroom door. Opens and shuts it just as -- 

           Mother turns to face her. Daughter swallows hard.  

                                 MOTHER
                        You left your music playing. 
                                 DAUGHTER
                        I was going right back. Just had to 
                        use the bathroom. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Where are your pyjamas? 
                             (off look)
                        From last night.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Oh, um... in the laundry, I think. 

           A beat. ON MOTHER. Unreadable.

                                 MOTHER
                             (attempting humor)
                        That’s a first. 
                             (beat)
                        I was beginning to think you forgot 
                        where the laundry was, Daughter.

           Daughter forces a grin. 

           Mother gently touches Daughter’s shoulder as she passes and 
           makes her way down the hall. 

           Daughter releases a long-held breath. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Daughter sits alone at the conference table. Eyes closed. 
           Mother enters, sets something in front of her. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You can look now. 

           Daughter opens her eyes to discover a wrapped present.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Happy birthday, Daughter.

           Elated, Daughter grabs the gift. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Can I open it? 

           Mother nods. Daughter wastes no time. Tears off the wrapping 
           and pries open the box to reveal -- a bagged set of new 
           cotton pyjamas -- identical to her others. 

           Daughter deflates, slowly removing them from the packaging.   

                                 MOTHER
                        Do you like them? 
                                 DAUGHTER
                        Are they the same... ?

                                 MOTHER
                        I had to dispose of your others. 
                        But I know they were your favorite.  

           Daughter sets them on the table. Eyes Mother, who watches her 
           expectantly. Daughter quickly masks her disappointment. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        They’re great, Mother.

           She stands to embrace Mother’s hulking frame. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter eats across from Mother, whose effort to keep 
           Daughter company is undermined by her inability to share the 
           meal. Daughter’s CHEWING the only sound while Mother observes. 

           Daughter sets down her fork, stares at her nearly-full plate. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Would you like me to heat it more?

           Daughter shakes her head. Takes a bite, averting her eyes.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Something is troubling you.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’m just not that hungry. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You know you can talk to me, 
                        Daughter. About anything. 

           Mother eyes the bagged pyjamas on the table. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I can get you a different color. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It’s not that. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Then what? 

           Daughter tries to bite her tongue. But fails, leveling steely 
           eyes on Mother -- 
                                 DAUGHTER
                        What if you’re wrong?
                             (beat)
                        Your measurements or... how would 
                        you know if you don’t go outside?

                                 MOTHER
                        Doing so could make me a hazard to 
                        you. I’d have to be destroyed.   
                             (beat)
                        Are you unhappy here?    

                                 DAUGHTER
                        No but...

                                 MOTHER
                        I want you to be happy, Daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I am. I just think...

           Daughter hangs her head. Mother reaches across the table, 
           gently lifts Daughter’s chin and holds her gaze.

                                 MOTHER
                        Have you ever known me to be 
                        mistaken? 

           Daughter softens, shakes her head. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Daughter lies waiting in her bunk. Turns toward the docking 
           station where Mother sleeps. Whispers -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother?

           No response. She withdraws a torch (flashlight) from beneath 
           her pillow and climbs down the bed’s metal frame -- SQUEAKING 
           with every movement. 

           As her socked foot reaches the bottom rung, Daughter slips 
           and drops the torch -- THUNK!

           Paralyzed, she watches as it rolls toward Mother -- closer 
           and closer until -- 

           -- the torch slows to a stop, centimeters shy of clanging 
           into the docking station. 

           Daughter collects herself. Pads across the room to retrieve 
           it, each carefully placed step a risk.
           She slowly squats to grab the torch. Confirms that Mother’s 
           still sleeping. And backs out of the room. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Daughter hastily wriggles her legs into the pants of a CBRN 
           suit. Tugs suspenders over her shoulders.

           She pulls on a gas mask. Her BREATHS FILTERED as she shuts 
           the locker and ventures toward the airlock with her torch. 

           Daughter stops in front of the sealed door with the 
           ambivalence of an astronaut preparing to jettison into space. 

           The room’s exit signs glow red as if in warning. 

           She flashes her light over a sign that reads: “AIRLOCK SAFETY 
           PROCEDURES.” Scans the instructions, noting: “IN CASE OF 
           EMERGENCY, AIRLOCK DOOR WILL AUTOMATICALLY RELEASE.”

           Daughter places a hand over the airlock switch. Closes her 
           eyes, steeling herself. Takes a deep breath when -- 

           TING, TING -- metal faintly taps the exterior blastdoor. 

           She bristles. Unblinking.  

           TING, TING, THUNK -- the door THUDS -- nearly flooring 
           Daughter in shock.  

           Her filtered breaths heave hard and fast, fogging her mask. 
           She rips it off. Cups her hands to the vision panel when -- 

           BOOM! -- BOOM! -- BOOM! -- the pounding intensifies.  

           Daughter backs away, glances over her shoulder. Deliberates a 
           beat before -- unsealing the airlock -- TSHHH.

           Heart jacking, she presses through the doorway and --  

           INT. DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           -- edges toward the BANGING blastdoor into a beam of 
           moonlight -- punching through its porthole.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Hello?

           The outer door stills. Daughter presses her ear to it. Silence. 

           She peers out the muddied glass when -- 

           A shadow blocks the moonlight, darkening the grated window.  
                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        ...hello? 

           WIND HOWLS. 

           A FEMALE voice strains through the thick metal -- 

                                 FEMALE (O.S.)
                        Don’t want any trouble. 

           Daughter startles. Stares at the door. Shocked. 

                                 FEMALE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You alone?   

           Daughter eyes the stairs behind her. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Yeah but -- 

                                 FEMALE (O.S.)
                        You gotta help me. Please.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Who... are you sick? 

                                 FEMALE (O.S.)
                        I been shot!  

           Daughter reels. 

                                 FEMALE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hear me?       

           Daughter glances at her gas mask. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You’re not contagious? 

                                 FEMALE (O.S.)
                        No, no. I’m bleeding. 

           A BLOODY HAND presses against the porthole. 

           Daughter slowly retreats. Processing.  

                                 FEMALE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You there? Hey!

           BOOM! BOOM!

                                 FEMALE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Open up!  
           She looks back at the locker in the changing room.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter tosses a CBRN suit into the airlock. Closes it 
           behind her and stares at the emergency exit release. 

           A sign reads: “EMERGENCY EXIT: ALARM WILL SOUND IF DOOR IS 
           OPENED.” 

           She takes a deep breath and -- unseals the blastdoor -- 
           triggering a DEAFENING ALARM -- WAAH-WAAH-WAAH! 

           INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

           CLOSE ON MOTHER’S EYE lighting up. She yanks free of her 
           tethers, explodes out of her wiry throne. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME

           Daughter watches a rawboned female DRIFTER, late-30s, stagger 
           into the airlock like a feral dog, wearing mudcaked rags, 
           clutching her hip. Red lights flashing. SIRENS WAILING.   

           Drifter drops a satchel. On edge. Flinches as the BLASTDOOR 
           SHUTS and DECON FILTERS WHIR. Fingers twitching at her side.

           Through the vision panel, she squints at Daughter. Both 
           studying each other as if viewing something alien.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I need you to put on that suit.  

           Drifter kicks at the CBRN gear, inspecting it. Cautiously 
           surveys her surroundings.       

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have much time. You want 
                        inside, you’ll put it on. Mask and 
                        all. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        ...huh?

           Drifter peels her hand from her bloody shirt. Shakes her head.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Sorry. But that’s the only way. 

           Drifter stares at the suit. Baffled. Notes Daughter’s resolve 
           and... begrudgingly winces her way into the pants.   

           Daughter’s attention flits from Drifter -- to the flashing 
           lights -- back to the airlock as -- 
           Drifter zips the CBRN jacket over her tattered threads. 
           Debates the gas mask. Then pulls it on, MUFFLING her voice -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                             (re: door)
                        What you waitin’ for?  

           PUSH IN ON DAUGHTER peering over her shoulder. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother.   

           Concern grips Drifter.   

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - SAME

           Mother storms toward the loosened wall panel, accelerating 
           like a train out of its station. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME

           Daughter agonizes, fixating on the stairs. 

           Drifter PALMS the glass.

                                 DRIFTER
                        She’ll lemme in though?  

           A beat.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Not sure. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Not sure? 

           Drifter totters. Devastated. Leans on the chipped-tile wall. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        I won’t make it out there ‘less... 
                        what if she didn’t know? I could 
                        keep outta sight...
                             (pleading re: wound)
                        Lemme see to this, I’ll be on my way.

           Daughter scurries to the stairs. Peers into darkness below.

           INT. EMERGENCY ESCAPE TUNNEL - SAME

           Mother steams down the strobing red tunnel -- SIRENS BLARING -- 
           her metallic feet a blur -- KA-DUNK, KA-DUNK, KA-DUNK.
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME

           Daughter glances at the airlock -- finds it empty -- and 
           scrambles to the viewing panel to see -- 

           Drifter unconscious on the floor. 

           Panicking, Daughter eyes the locker, notes two empty racks -- 
           big enough for bodies. Deliberates -- and opens the airlock.

           INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - SAME

           Mother clambers up stairs -- walls echoing metal-on-metal -- 
           CLANG, CLANG, CLANG -- up two flights before bulling into -- 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- the dressing quarters, where Daughter stands alone in 
           front of the opened airlock. Gas mask in hand. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I only opened it for a second.  

           Mother retrieves the mask --   

                                 MOTHER
                        Did you think this decomposing 
                        relic would keep you safe? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I didn’t go outside.  

           Mother scans the area, head swiveling with a MECHANICAL 
           WHINE. She silently stalks the room. 

           Daughter eyes the locker -- cracked ajar -- Drifter’s suited 
           body narrowly visible on a shelf beneath other CBRN suits. 

           She shuffles in front of it. Sleeves sweat from her brow as -- 

           Mother nears the locker. Nudges past Daughter and CREAKS open 
           one of its rusted doors. 

           Daughter leans against the other locker door, concealing 
           Drifter’s head and torso. 

           Mother pokes at an empty suit.  

                                 MOTHER
                        I should have destroyed these years 
                        ago.
                             (turning on Daughter)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        But that does not excuse your 
                        disregard for my authority and the 
                        safety of the others in this 
                        facility.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Others? 

                                 MOTHER
                             (re: embryos)
                        Your family. 

           Daughter sighs. Eyes Drifter’s booted feet on the bottom 
           shelf, quickly swallows her frustration.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (placating)
                        You’re right, Mother. As always. 
                        My actions were impulsive and...  

           Though stern, Mother touches Daughter’s face with concern. 

                                 MOTHER
                        And very dangerous.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It won’t happen again. 

                                 MOTHER
                        No. It won’t.   

           Mother closes the locker. Points to the door leading to the 
           bunker stairwell.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        From now on, that door is to remain 
                        sealed at all times. 

           She turns away. 

           Daughter spots Drifter’s bag in the open DECON CHAMBER and -- 
           seals the airlock. Blocks the viewing panel with her body as -- 

           Mother faces her. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I hope you show better discretion 
                        than this on your exam tomorrow. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Tomorrow? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Did you forget? 
                                 DAUGHTER
                        Can’t we reschedule? 

                                 MOTHER
                        To accommodate your disobedience? 
                             (beat)
                        I suggest you get to sleep, 
                        Daughter. It’s going to be a long 
                        day.

           Mother ushers Daughter toward the exit. Daughter glances back 
           at the locker.

           INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           Mother sets a tablet computer in front of Daughter -- sleepy-
           eyed at her usual desk, atop which sits a thermos. 

           Daughter skims the first exam page on the tablet. 

           CLOSE ON TEST, divided into sections: “CRYO PRESERVATION” -- 
           “EMBRYO THAWING” -- “FETAL DEVELOPMENT.” Equipment diagrams 
           and flowcharts beneath each. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You’ll have sixty minutes to 
                        complete the first portion of your 
                        exam. If you finish before I 
                        return, you can read your book. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Where are you going?

                                 MOTHER
                        I have lab work to complete. And 
                        must see to the airlock. 

           Daughter sits up.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What for? 

                                 MOTHER
                        To ensure the area wasn’t 
                        contaminated last night. 

           Daughter motions to the exam -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What if I have questions? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Skip any you don’t understand and 
                        I’ll assist you when I get back...
           Mother eyes a wall clock that reads: “8:00.” 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        ...at nine o’clock. 

           Mother CLUNKS toward the door. Daughter panics.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother...

           Mother cranes around. Daughter swallows hard.   

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        There’s something I need to tell 
                        you. I meant to last night. But I 
                        didn’t want to concern you.
                             (beat)
                        I found something. In the outer 
                        sector. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Another cockroach? 

           Daughter stares at her thermos. Remembering. Eyes unblinking. 
           She raises her gaze to Mother. Forces a nod. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Where is it? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I got rid of it. Outside. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Is that why you opened the door? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I didn’t want you to hurt it. 

           A long silence. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I appreciate your honesty.    

           Mother turns to leave. Stops in the doorway.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You must remember that everything I 
                        do is to protect you, Daughter. 

           Mother exits and closes the door behind her. 

           Daughter grimaces. Waits a beat. Then bolts to the door, 
           poking her head into the hall. 
           DAUGHTER’S POV 

           Mother disappears around a corner. 

           DAUGHTER 

           glances back at the TICKING CLOCK. Slips out the door in the 
           opposite direction of Mother.  

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The stairwell door SQUEAKS open. Daughter pokes her head into 
           the room, staring at the closed locker.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Hello? 

           No response. Daughter skirts past the locker to the airlock. 
           Peers inside, spots the satchel on the ground. 

           She holds her breath and -- in one motion -- opens the DECON 
           CHAMBER -- swipes the satchel -- seals the door. Gasping. 

           She unfastens the bag. Looks inside to find -- a hand cannon. 

           Wary, she tucks the gun into the back of her pants -- 
           covering it with her shirt -- and approaches the locker with 
           the tentative steps of a bomb squad tech.   

           She grips the locker handles and -- cranks them, leaping back. 

           The doors open, revealing Drifter on a bottom shelf. Immobile. 

           Daughter watches her from a distance. Squats to find the 
           woman’s masked head hanging sideways, looking out. 

           Awestruck, Daughter ventures a whisper --   

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Hey... we have to go. 

           Drifter doesn’t budge. Daughter leans in to inspect. Peers 
           through Drifter’s clouded mask to find her eyes closed.  

           Hesitant, Daughter gently touches her arm. No movement. 
           Emboldens and gives her a firm shake when -- 

           Drifter awakens with a start, SMACKING her head into the 
           shelf above -- sending Daughter stumbling. 

           Drifter rolls off the shelf, onto the floor. Slumps against 
           the locker for support.  

           Neither moves as they size each other up.
           Drifter eyes a thermos in Daughter’s hand. Reaches for it 
           like a beggar, hands trembling. 

           Daughter closes the gap between them. Cautiously hands it 
           over when --  

           Drifter notices her satchel hanging from Daughter’s shoulder. 
           Violently grabs it and glares. Unhinged. 

           Daughter lets go. Backs away. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        You dropped it. 

           Drifter stares at the bag for a long beat. Then at Daughter.  

                                 DRIFTER
                        You get antiseptic?    

           Daughter shakes her head. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        Nothing? No bandages? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I will. 

           Drifter huffs. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        But I need you to come with me. 

           Drifter brushes off Daughter. Starts to remove her gas mask.

           Daughter grabs her wrist --  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        No, wait!

                                 DRIFTER
                        It’s okay.  

           Drifter loosens Daughter’s grip. Daughter relents, dumfounded. 

           Drifter removes the mask, her knotted hair cascading over her 
           shoulders as she raises the thermos to her cracked lips -- 
           full in a way that might have been attractive in another life.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How’re you unaffected?
                             (off blank stare)
                        By the contagion. Outside. 

           Drifter scrutinizes Daughter. Shakes her head. 
                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Who put that in your head? Your mum?     

           A beat on Daughter. Unsettled.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...she’s wrong? 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Think you two need to have a long 
                        chat.
                             (beat)
                        Where’s she now? 

           Daughter clocks the stairs. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Can you walk? 

           Drifter fires a derisive look.    

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll help. 

           Drifter groans. Considers the exit.    

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter straining to shoulder Drifter down the main hallway 
           when -- Drifter stops, hunches over. Hands on her knees. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        What is this place? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Shhh.

           Daughter nervously checks behind them. Peeks around a corner. 

           No sign of Mother. 

           She flings Drifter’s arm over her shoulder and tugs. 

           Drifter shakes her head -- pleading -- starts to slip down 
           the wall when -- 

           CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK -- faint thuds carry down the corridor. 
                                 DRIFTER
                        Hear that? 

           Daughter shifts into overdrive. Yanks Drifter off the wall, 
           the woman cringing with each movement as -- 

           Daughter humps Drifter’s dead weight across the hall into -- 

           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- the machine room. Shuts the door. Guides Drifter to a dark 
           corner in the back and sets her behind a GRUMBLING GENERATOR. 

           Drifter slumps on the ground, gripping her hip. Daughter 
           lifts the thermos to Drifter’s mouth. Sets it by her side.

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (whispering)
                        Will you be okay until I get back?

           Drifter watches the door. Baffled. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I won’t be long. 

           Daughter awkwardly pries away. Catches herself and extends a 
           welcoming hand like Johnny Carson.

                                 DRIFTER
                        That noise down the hall... that 
                        your mum? The hell’s she doin’?    

           Daughter further extends her hand -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You’re supposed to shake it.

           Drifter considers Daughter’s hand. Halfheartedly obliges. 
           Daughter grins ear-to-ear, retreats around a wall of pipes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER

           cracking open the door to the main corridor, peering through 
           the opened sliver to find -- 

           Mother tramping toward her. 

           Daughter shuts the door, braces her back against it.

           CLOSE ON DAUGHTER

           breathless, eyes clenched, sweat snaking down her brow as -- 
           Mother passes outside. Her HEAVY STEPS FADING.

           Daughter braves another peek, watches Mother disappear into 
           the concealed tunnel, leading to the airlock.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter riffling through drawers in a white-walled room, 
           surrounded by robotic medical equipment. 

           She pockets pill bottles, gauze, hydrogen peroxide. Scours 
           cabinets until she finds -- 

           A field surgical kit. 

           Daughter glances at a clock that reads: “8:22” and -- backs 
           into a jar, toppling it to the ground -- CRASH! 

           She stands aghast, surrounded by a sea of shattered glass. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME

           Mother opens the locker of CBRN suits to find -- 

           The bottom shelf empty. 

           She turns toward the airlock, looks back at the empty shelf. 
           Processing. Then strips the locker of the remaining bio-gear.   

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Daughter races to sweep broken glass into a dustpan. Stiffens 
           like prey in the path of a predator, hearing an unsettling -- 

           CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK -- approaching in the distance. 

           She scrambles to finish sweeping and -- trips over the 
           dustpan, spraying shards across the floor. 

           CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK -- growing louder and LOUDER until -- 

           Daughter looks up with a start.   

           DAUGHTER’S POV - THROUGH GLASS DOOR

           Mother carries a heap of CBRN suits past the doorway of the 
           adjacent WAR ROOM -- in direct line of sight. 

           DAUGHTER

           drops to all fours behind the exam table. Instantly recoils, 
           leaving a smear of blood on the white floor. 
           She inspects her hands -- speckled with glass -- and extracts 
           a shard from her palm, gritting through the pain.   

           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Drifter compresses her wound in the shadows, head hung and 
           sweating when -- 

           The DOOR GROANS. 

                                 DRIFTER
                             (sotto)
                        Thank God.  

           CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK - steel feet stamp down a narrow aisle.

           Drifter pulls herself up, peers between dripping pipes. 

           DRIFTER’S POV

           Mother deposits the bio-gear into the flaming incinerator.   

           DRIFTER 

           ducks out of sight. Horrified. Flips open her satchel --  

           No gun. 

           She fumes, fishing in the dark for a weapon. Grabs a lead 
           pipe and cowers in the corner. 

           INT. INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON Daughter’s gauze-wrapped hand, emptying the dustpan 
           of glass, discarding bloody paper towels. 

           The clock reads “8:37.” 

           She surveys the spotless floor. Collects the medical supplies.

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter reaches for the PLANT ROOM door, finds it ajar. She 
           scans the quiet hall before nudging into -- 

           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           -- the din of DRUMMING MACHINERY. She shuts the door behind 
           her. Surveys the maze of metal -- vast yet claustrophobic. 

           Daughter presses through aisles of industrial tubing -- 
           peeking around every corner. Wary of the shadows. 

           She rounds the generator where she left Drifter.
           The woman is gone. 

           Concerned, Daughter backs away. Turns around as -- 

           Drifter barrels out of the dark, pipe in hand. Grabs Daughter. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Where’s my shooter? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I don’t know. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        It was in here!  

           Drifter shoves her satchel at Daughter, who drops it.

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        I need it. Now. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Why? 

           Drifter angrily points at the door -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                        You got a droid?  

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (”shit”)
                        Mother was here?   

           Drifter shifts. Stares confused. Peers under a pipe to check 
           the doorway.

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I can’t stay...

                                 DRIFTER 
                        Look, I’m gone. Just gimme the gun. 

           Daughter shakes her head. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        They’ll kill me. That whatcha want?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Who? 

           Drifter points to the door -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Dozers like that. 
           A beat on Daughter. Shaken. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        There’re more like Mother?

           Drifter impatiently huffs.

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Why would they hurt you?  

           Drifter snaps, points to her wound -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Cuz that’s what they do. Been damn 
                        good at it. 

           Her words settle in Daughter’s gut like a brick. Daughter 
           masks concern.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother would never...

                                 DRIFTER
                        Where’s the gun? 

           Daughter swallows, backs away. Drifter lurches toward her.   

           INT. CLASSROOM - SAME

           Mother flings open the door. On mission. Finds Daughter’s 
           desk empty. The wall clock reads: “8:52.” 

           She tramps to the desk, flips through the untouched exam.  

           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - SAME

           Drifter backs Daughter into a corner. Picks up her satchel.

                                 DRIFTER
                        I’m not leavin’ without it. 

           Daughter presents the medical kit like a gift. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I brought you this.

           Drifter reaches for it. Daughter pulls it away. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        You should sit. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        I’ll sit when I’m clear of here.
                                 DAUGHTER
                        You won’t get far unless -- 

           Drifter snatches the kit. Extends her hand.  

                                 DRIFTER
                        The shooter.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                             (down hallway)
                        Daughter?

           Daughter springs off the wall. Drifter white-knuckles her 
           pipe. Both watching the door through the grid of tubes.  

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - SAME

           Mother searches the corridor -- head scanning to and fro -- 
           past the PLANT ROOM.  

                                 MOTHER
                             (calling out)
                        Daughter?

           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - SAME

           Daughter scurries past Drifter to a clearer vantage point, 
           leans over to peek around the generator, exposing --   

           The hand cannon tucked into her pants. 

           Drifter strains for it. Daughter pushes back, guarding the gun.

           Drifter KNOCKS her into pipework. Detains Daughter’s flailing 
           arms, inadvertently pinning them to a hot boiler -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Owww!

           Drifter seizes the gun. Daughter CRIES OUT.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        MOTHER!

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - SAME

           Mother cranes toward the PLANT ROOM. 

                                                              SMASH TO:
           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother BARGING into the corroded belly of the bunker. She 
           stalks down a darkened aisle, relief valves COUGHING STEAM.

           DRIFTER

           Hides behind the generator -- gun readied -- clasping 
           Daughter’s mouth.  

           MOTHER

           charges through the HISSING haze. KA-DUNK, KA-DUNK, KA-DUNK.

                                 MOTHER
                             (calling out)
                        Daughter? Where are you?

           CLOSE ON DAUGHTER’S UNBLINKING EYES. 

           Drifter sternly shakes her head, warning her when -- 

           Daughter bites Drifter’s hand.  

           Drifter stifles a SCREAM, releases Daughter.  

           MOTHER

           zeroes in, thundering toward the PAINED CRY.  

           DRIFTER

           whips around the generator into the walkway to find -- 

           Mother closing in like a tank.  

           Drifter braces, unloading two slugs -- BOOM! BOOM! -- one to 
           Mother’s chest, another to her outstretched hand.

           Mother falters. Rips the gun from Drifter, pins her to the 
           generator. Mother’s hand tight on Drifter’s throat when -- 

           Daughter leaps from the shadows, grabs Mother’s arm. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Wait. 

           Mother cocks her head at Daughter.

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t. Please. She’s just scared.
                             (signaling Drifter)
                        Right?  
           Drifter’s eyes betray her contempt. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        A droid hurt her, Mother. Badly. 

           Mother examines Drifter’s bloodied hip. An unnerving beat. 
           The lights of Mother’s eyes narrow. 

                                 MOTHER
                             (to Daughter)
                        I heard yelling.   

           Daughter locks eyes with Drifter, who silently pleads. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I burnt myself. That’s all. 

           Mother presses into Drifter’s face. 

                                 DRIFTER
                             (choking)
                        I’ll leave. Right now.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        She can’t, Mother. Not in her 
                        condition. 

                                 MOTHER
                        No. Of course not.  

           Mother loosens her grip. Drifter lurches forward, SUCKING AIR. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You should have informed me of this.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I was afraid you’d turn her away.

                                 MOTHER
                        I’d never turn away someone in need, 
                        Daughter. But your secrecy could 
                        have cost her life. We need to get 
                        her to the infirmary.

           Behind Mother’s back, Drifter’s eyes flare. She frantically 
           shakes her head at Daughter, who picks up the woman’s satchel.   

           Mother peels Drifter off the generator, muscling her away. 
           Drifter glares back at Daughter.  

           INT. INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother ushers Drifter to the exam table. 
                                 MOTHER
                        Please remove your clothes and lie 
                        down. 

           Drifter stands in place. Eyes the door as Daughter enters, 
           blocking the exit.  

           Daughter sets the medical kit on a tray. Mother busies 
           herself at a counter. Sets down the gun. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You can go now, Daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        But --

           Mother silences her with a look. 

           Daughter exits. Watches through the WAR ROOM’s glass door. 

           While Mother is preoccupied, Drifter stares at the gun -- out 
           of reach. Spots a door keypad, shuffles toward it. 

           Mother opens a drawer, revealing -- a syringe and cannula. 

                                 MOTHER
                             (back turned)
                        This droid that shot you, how far 
                        was it from here?  

           Mother draws fluid into the syringe.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Were you followed? 

           Drifter taps the touchscreen. To no avail. Stares at Daughter 
           through the glass. Daughter stares back. But not at Drifter...  

           RACK FOCUS TO Mother’s reflection right behind Drifter.  

           Drifter swings around -- finds Mother holding the syringe -- 
           and startles to the ground -- scurrying on all fours -- 
           TOPPLING EQUIPMENT in her wake. 

           EXT. WAR ROOM - SAME

           Daughter mashes a hands-free intercom switch by the INFIRMARY 
           door. Yells into the speaker --

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother.

           A screen above the intercom blinks red: ACCESS DENIED.
           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Daughter yells in vain, beating the soundproof door outside. 

           Mother CLUNKS toward Drifter. Slows to a stop. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Your wound’s likely infected. 
                             (re: syringe)
                        Without Penicillin, any other 
                        measures will be useless. 

           Mother sets the syringe on the medical tray. Eyes a blood 
           smear across the floor.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Every second you don’t trust me, 
                        you’re losing more blood. I know 
                        you’re frightened. But you have no 
                        need to be. 

           Mother steps forward. Drifter grabs an IV stand like a 
           broadsword. Eyes ablaze, bearing teeth.  

           Mother gives her space. Studies her as if she were a specimen 
           in a petri dish. Motions to her wound --  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        When did this occur?
                             (beat)
                        Were you alone? If there are 
                        others, they could be in danger.  

                                 DRIFTER
                        From a virus?  

           Mother eyes Daughter, who’s clearly disconcerted.  

                                 MOTHER
                        What have you told my daughter? 

           Drifter squirms. Looks out the glass. The rattled teen watches 
           like a child hanging on the movements of a caged animal.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Do you see the way she’s looking at 
                        me? And you wonder why I’ve guarded 
                        her from certain realities.
                             (beat)
                        Contrary to your understandable 
                        assumptions, my primary directive 
                        is to care for humanity.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        If I wanted you dead, all I’d have 
                        to do is leave. 

           Drifter clutches her hip, her breathing labored. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Don’t lemme keep you.  

           Mother unzips the med kit, revealing a scalpel, forceps, 
           hemostats, sutures. Sets gauze and antiseptic on the tray. 

                                 MOTHER
                        If you won’t let me help you, at 
                        least help yourself. 
                             (beat)
                        I trust you know what you’re doing.

           Mother looks out the door. Daughter backs away as if from a 
           stranger. Mother hangs her head, contemplative, then -- 

           -- tramps back to the hand cannon. Grabs the gun.   

           Drifter dives behind the table. 

           Mother eyeballs her -- a trembling and easy target -- then 
           picks up the syringe.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I can’t force you to take it. But I 
                        strongly recommend you do.

           She opens the hermetic door and exits, sealing it behind her. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mother emerges. Shares a silent beat with Daughter. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Daughter...
                             (beat)
                        I’ll give you a moment. 

           Mother brushes past her, marches the gun down the hall.

           Daughter stares into the INFIRMARY at Drifter -- trapped 
           behind the glass, clutching her bloody hip.   

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. CROSS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter on Mother’s heels, Mother not slowing to engage.  
                                 DAUGHTER
                        Aren’t you going to help her? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I tried. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        We can’t leave her like that. 

                                 MOTHER
                        She has all she requires. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What was she saying? 

           Mother abruptly turns into the LAB. 

           INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter impatiently watches Mother open a clear lift-door on 
           an overhead cabinet, compartmented like safety deposit boxes. 

           Mother stows the gun in one of the cabinet’s slotted drawers. 

           A metal bit shutters out of her damaged forefinger like a 
           retractable fingernail. 

           She closes the cabinet. Locks it with her finger. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Did you know?  

           Mother takes a moment. Turns to face Daughter and reaches for 
           her bandaged hand -- 

                                 MOTHER
                        What happened? 

           Daughter hugs it to her side.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Nothing. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re bleeding. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Did you know there were people up 
                        there?

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m as surprised as you.

           Daughter eyes Mother. Skeptical.  
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I was designed as a fail-safe, 
                        programmed to activate in case of 
                        human extinction. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Fail-safe? 

           Mother motions to the embryo bank -- 

                                 MOTHER
                        To give humanity a second chance. 
                        One that began with you, Daughter. 

           Beat.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        And your surface data? The toxicity 
                        levels? 
                             (accusatory)
                        That part of your programming too?

           Mother points Daughter toward a chair. Daughter doesn’t budge.      

                                 MOTHER
                        I’d hoped to tell you, myself. 

           Daughter holds back angry tears. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You lied to me? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I told you the surface was 
                        dangerous. And it is. If you’d 
                        feared the same danger in our home, 
                        how could I have raised you?
                             (beat)
                        I hope you see that I’m governed by 
                        different parameters than her 
                        assailants. That I’m a good Mother.  
                             (off silence)
                        Have I ever done you harm? 

           Eyes averted, Daughter shakes her head. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        We can talk more later if you like.

           Daughter looks up at Mother. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What do they want? 
                                 MOTHER
                        I wish I knew, Daughter.
                             (off look)
                        Perhaps our guest can answer that. 

           Daughter sighs. Stares into the hallway, concerned. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How long does she have?     

                                 MOTHER
                        That depends on her. But until she 
                        sees that I’m not her enemy, we can’t 
                        trust her to roam the premises.
                             (re: chest bullet holes)
                        A few centimeters lower and she 
                        would have destroyed my CPU. 

           A beat. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What happens if she recovers? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Hopefully she’ll recognize that 
                        this is the safest place for her. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (sotto)
                        She’ll listen to me. She has to.

                                 MOTHER
                        Did she mention any other survivors?

           Daughter shakes her head. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        If they’re out there, they will be 
                        found. Unless we find them first.

           Mother tenderly reaches for Daughter’s bloody hand. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        We can take them in, Daughter. But 
                        not without her cooperation. 

           Daughter softens. Allows Mother to remove the bandages.  

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Daughter sits alone on her top bunk. Staring at the 
           INFIRMARY. Sullen. Her world fraying at the seams. 
           She empties Drifter’s satchel. Rummages through its contents, 
           finds a Walkman and earbuds. Puts them on and presses play.  

           A loud MALE VOICE repeats French expressions. Daughter turns 
           it down and continues listening while fishing a faded cassette 
           case out of the pile that reads: “FRENCH FOR BEGINNERS.” 

           She inspects the remaining contents: cracked eyeglasses, 
           binoculars, crumpled cigarettes and a timeworn copy of Edgar 
           Rice Burroughs’ “THE GODS OF MARS.” 

           Daughter thumbs through the novel to find --  

           Countless faces ink-sketched over its faded text, the pages 
           loose from wear. 

           She pores over detailed renderings of men, women and children. 
           Holds on an image of a dark-haired teenage boy, his lifelike 
           eyes staring back at her. 

           Daughter flips to the last pages -- filled with mad 
           scratchings -- the same phrase repeated hundreds of times. 

           She stares at the INFIRMARY. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER

           carrying the book to the INFIRMARY door -- stamped with 
           bloody handprints.  

           She finds Drifter slumped on the floor, nodding off in a 
           corner of the room -- amidst an arsenal of medical tools. 

           Daughter swallows. Turns on the intercom and hears Drifter 
           quietly MUMBLING.  

           Daughter leans in, nearly pressing her ear to the speaker, 
           FILTERED WHISPERS growing louder, more unhinged when -- 

           Drifter jerks awake, scaring Daughter stiff. Stares at her 
           with haunted eyes. Hair heavy with sweat.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...you okay? 

           Drifter gets her bearings. Feverish.   

                                 DRIFTER
                        How long I been here? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Not long. 
           A beat. Drifter rises, staggers toward Daughter.  

                                 DRIFTER
                             (re: door)
                        That still locked? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Just for now. 
                             (beat)
                        Did you take Mother’s medicine?  

           Drifter scoffs under her breath. Falters and steadies herself 
           against the exam table. Checks her pulse.  

           Daughter eyes Drifter’s book. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        These drawings... who are they? 
                        Friends? They still...
                             (beat)
                        Did you draw them from memory?  

           Drifter returns to the door. Incensed.  

                                 DRIFTER
                        It tell you go through my stuff?

           Daughter sets down the book. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I didn’t mean to -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                        I think ya did. Think you meant for 
                        all this.
                             (beat)
                        Did a fine job gettin’ me in this 
                        cage. Now what? We to be friends? 

           Daughter shifts, uneasy. Eyes betraying deep sadness.   

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        That what you want? A pet friend?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You’re still alive, aren’t you? Maybe 
                        you’re not so bad off down here.  
                             (beat)
                        Mother’s not what you think. She’s 
                        taken care of me my whole life. 
                                 DRIFTER
                        You haven’t seen what they done. 
                        Seen ‘em torching babies, starvin’ 
                        out families till they... 

           Drifter chokes down memories like a mouthful of glass.       

           Mortified, Daughter glances over her shoulder at the empty 
           hallway. Struggles to remain composed.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Not Mother.    

                                 DRIFTER
                        It’s only a matter of time.     

           In b.g., Mother crosses in the hall and stops in the WAR ROOM 
           doorway. PUSH IN ON MOTHER monitoring their interaction. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Daughter sits against the wall -- beneath the bulkhead light -- 
           staring at the image of the dark-haired boy in Drifter’s book.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER 

           prepping for bed. She starts to climb the bunk. Peers across 
           the darkened room to find Mother’s dock empty. 

           She puzzles over the rare sight. 

           INT. CROSS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter pads toward the LABORATORY -- following the WHINE 
           and BUZZ of TOOLS -- and peeks in the door. 

           Across the room, Mother disconnects her damaged hand. Replaces 
           it with another and tests the movement of her new fingers.  

           Daughter watches. Ashamed.  

           INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother extracts the hand cannon’s slug from her chest. Starts 
           to repair her damaged plate and wires when -- 

           She glimpses Daughter tentatively approaching, still unnerved 
           by her conversation with Drifter.  

           Mother sets down her instruments. 
                                 MOTHER
                        Trouble sleeping?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        A little. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Change is rarely easy, Daughter.

           Mother deposits the slug into a specimen jar. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Can I make you some tea? 

           Daughter shakes her head. Heavy-hearted. Stares at the bullet.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I shouldn’t have hid her from you. 
                             (beat)
                        I never would have let her in if I 
                        thought she’d hurt you. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You couldn’t have known.

           Mother files and locks the jar in the compartmented cabinetry. 
           Finishes working on her chest. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        If you leave to find her family...

                                 MOTHER
                        You know where they are? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’m just saying... are you sure 
                        you’d make it back? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Is that what’s keeping you up? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It could be dangerous for you. If 
                        you get caught by other droids. 
                             (probing)
                        Or would they think you’re one of 
                        them?   

           Mother cocks her head, sensing a shift in Daughter’s tone. 
           Daughter stares into the hallway.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        She says you look identical. 
           Mother examines her body as if she hadn’t considered this. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Have you always lived down here, 
                        Mother? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I believe so. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You don’t know? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I don’t remember any other place. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Doesn’t that bother you? Not 
                        knowing where you came from? 

                                 MOTHER
                        No. But I can see how it might 
                        bother you.

           Daughter sighs. Mother rests a hand on her shoulder. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Has our guest been any more 
                        receptive? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Her fever’s getting real bad...

                                 MOTHER
                        Did she take her antibiotic? 

           Daughter shrugs. 

           Mother notes her deep concern. And exits into the hall.   

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Drifter dropping to her knees, flushed and PANTING as if in 
           labor. She violently shivers as Mother tries to help.  

           Drifter barks at Daughter, barely through the door --     

                                 DRIFTER
                        Get it out!

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother...
           Mother backs off. Eye-lights scrolling as she scans Drifter.  

                                 MOTHER
                             (to Drifter)
                        Your body temperature reads thirty-
                        nine degrees. And your heart rate 
                        is elevated. 
                             (beat)
                        Where’s the Penicillin?

           Drifter laughs, venomous. Twined hair draping over her eyes -- 
           possessed with rage.   

                                 DRIFTER
                        Penicillin?! 

           She hurls the syringe at Mother, who notes the empty cartridge 
           at her feet. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Clearly you waited too long. 
                             (beat)
                        Your sepsis will only worsen if you 
                        don’t allow me to treat you.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What’s wrong with her? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Her blood is infected, Daughter, 
                        with bacteria from her wound. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Bullshit! 

                                 MOTHER
                        Soon she will go into shock.   

           Drifter appeals to Daughter -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                        See? You see what it’s done?    

           She raises her shirt, exposing her dressed pelvic wound and -- 
           a wine-colored rash speckling her abdomen. 

           Daughter eyes the syringe. Her confidence in Mother shaken.  

                                 MOTHER
                        I gave you the means to prevent 
                        this. With sufficient time to do so.
                             (beat)

                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        But it seems you’ve left a bullet 
                        and soiled clothing fibres in the 
                        SI joint of your pelvis. 

           A beat. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Can’t you remove them? 

                                 MOTHER
                        That’s up to our guest. Such a 
                        procedure would require anesthesia.

                                 DRIFTER
                        Like hell. 

           Mother tilts her head. Eye-light narrowing. Daughter 
           anxiously fidgets in b.g.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Perhaps once your organs begin 
                        failing, you’ll reconsider. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        I’ll take my --  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’ll do it. 

           Mother and Drifter stare at Daughter in disbelief.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll remove the bullet. And Mother 
                        will keep her distance. 
                             (eyeing Mother)
                        I’ll make sure of it. 

           Drifter glances at her swollen pelvis. At her horrid rash. 

           A long pause. Then she nods, reluctant.   

                                 DRIFTER
                        You’re not puttin’ me under.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER

           Daughter fights her sweaty hands into latex gloves. Nervously 
           eyes pelvic X-rays on a nearby monitor. 

           Drifter lies on the exam table, watching Mother prepare 
           equipment across the room when -- 
           Mother turns to hand Daughter -- a long, needle-like cannula.       

           Daughter approaches Drifter’s bedside with the horse needle.

           Drifter braces as Daughter holds her uneasy gaze and examines 
           the swollen wound, gently prodding it with her finger. 

           Drifter cringes.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Sorry.

           Daughter eyes Mother for reassurance.      

                                 MOTHER
                        Like I showed you, Daughter. Watch 
                        the monitor and gently insert the 
                        cannula along the bullet’s path.

           Daughter studies a fluoroscopic image of Drifter’s pelvis. 
           Struggles to steady her hands as she lowers the needle.

           CLOSE ON CANNULA slipping into the fleshy hole. 

           Drifter GROWLS through clenched teeth, writhing in pain.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        She’s squirming too much, Daughter.

           Daughter stops. Out of her depth. Mother steps forward --  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Do you need assistance?

                                 DRIFTER
                        Get back. 

           Daughter waives off Mother. Sleeves sweat from her face and 
           feeds the cannula deeper until -- 

           Drifter SHRIEKS.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Maybe it’d be better...

           Drifter takes a breath. Calms Daughter with a look.

                                 DRIFTER
                        You’re doin’ fine.

           She snatches a rubber tourniquet from a tray. Bites down on 
           it like a bit and prompts Daughter to proceed. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           ARTHROSCOPIC MONITOR

           offering a full-color view of Drifter’s insides.  

           Drifter hyperventilates. Eyes bulging. Attention unwavering 
           from Mother, who monitors from across the room as --  

           Daughter carefully irrigates the wound and locates the bullet 
           -- lodged in a joint.

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER

           feeding a guidewire into Drifter’s cannula. Laser focused.  

           ON MONITOR the wire nears the white mass of the bullet.

           Daughter swallows. Eases her finger onto the trigger of a 
           wire-and-pin drill. Gently squeezes. 

           CLOSE ON drill SQUEALING --

           RACK FOCUS TO Drifter SCREAMING into the rubber hose.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           DAUGHTER

           barreling out of the INFIRMARY and -- violently retching.  

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME 

           Mother calmly wipes the bloody bullet clean, examines it in 
           the light and drops it into a medical tray. 

           Carrying the tray, she approaches Daughter from behind and -- 

           INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- rests a soothing hand on her back.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Are you alright? 

           Daughter nods, catching her breath.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You did well in there, Daughter. 
                        You should be proud. 

           Mother continues into the hall. Daughter peels off her 
           surgical gloves and collects herself. Then heaves again.  
           INT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT

           Daughter sits across the room from Drifter’s sickbed, 
           watching The Tonight Show on her tablet computer. 

           ONSCREEN: two guests lovingly embrace.

           Daughter gazes for a long beat at Drifter -- cleaned head to 
           toe, breathing through a cannula. Mother nowhere in sight.   

           Drifter pries open her sedated eyes. Panics and tugs at an IV 
           needle in her wrist.

           Daughter quickly sets down her tablet. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It’s just saline. 
                             (off look)
                        You passed out. 

           Drifter inspect her wound -- freshly bandaged. Examines her 
           dirtless arms as if they belong to someone else.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Your vitals are nearly stable. 

           Drifter hangs her head. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a good thing. 

           The sound on Daughter’s tablet draws Drifter’s attention.

                                 DRIFTER
                        What’s that? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        The Tonight Show.  
                             (off confusion)
                        With Johnny Carson.

           Daughter turns her computer around to show Drifter.

           ONSCREEN: Carson laughs while interviewing a famous comedian. 

           Drifter sits up. Puzzles at the moving images.   

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Here, I’ll show you. 

           Daughter slides her chair to Drifter’s bedside. Taps the 
           screen, playing the video. Drifter studies the comedic 
           banter. Furrows her brow. Bewildered. 
           Daughter deflates.   

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        It’s kind of dumb...   

           She tries to turn it off. Drifter grabs the tablet. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Lemme see.  

           A beat. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...other shows always have the same 
                        people. This one’s different.  

           Drifter nods, understanding. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen a show before? 

           Drifter shakes her head. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        There aren’t any computers?  

           Drifter half-grins. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        No.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What is left? Buildings? Houses? 

                                 DRIFTER
                        In places. Nowhere I’d risk going.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Where do you live then?  

           Drifter’s eyes narrow. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I mean, what’s it like?

                                 DRIFTER
                        Quiet. 

           Daughter chews on Drifter’s words. Eyes the counter and leaps 
           to her feet. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Sorry, almost forgot...
           The Tonight Show continues playing as Daughter returns with a 
           tray overflowing with food.  

           Drifter stares, half-fearing she’s dreaming. Grips a spoon -- 
           hand twitching with tremors -- and raises beans to her mouth. 

           She shovels the food to her face. Eyes welling. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I can get you more. 

           Drifter catches Daughter’s disarming gaze. Lowers her spoon. 
           A twinge of remorse in her eyes. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        You done right by me last night. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I did what anyone would. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        You dunno people.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’d like to.

           Daughter stares at the onscreen contestants.

           INT. WAR ROOM - LATER

           Through the INFIRMARY door, we see Daughter and Drifter 
           eating together, laughing at a show on the flickering tablet.

           REVERSE ON MOTHER watching from the shadows. 

           INT. INFIRMARY - DAY

           Daughter wakes in a chair next to Drifter. Finds her thumbing 
           through the book of sketches, satchel opened on the floor.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I brought it for you.

           Daughter wipes the sleep from her eyes. Stretches and works 
           out a crick in her neck while Drifter peruses the pages. 

           A long beat while Daughter waits for her moment. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        You can trust us, you know. If 
                        there are people out there, we have 
                        enough food and supplies... 

           Drifter shakes her head. Dismissive.  
                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Mother didn’t make you sick.  

           Daughter motions to the book.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        We could help them. 
                             (off look)
                        We helped you.

                                 DRIFTER
                        You helped me.
                             (beat)
                        If I tell you something... I need 
                        ya keep it between us. 

           Daughter perks up, nods. Hanging on Drifter’s every word.

           Drifter leans in, wincing.   

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        I was on a night run, bringing food 
                        back to camp... me and this fella 
                        Jacob. Done it countless times. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What camp?  

                                 DRIFTER
                        In the mines. Lived there most my 
                        life.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (re: sketches)
                        With them?

           Drifter nods. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Somehow we got turned around. Figured 
                        we’d wait it out, head back at sunup. 
                             (beat)
                        Hardly made it an hour ‘fore the 
                        dozers caught us hiding in a field.  

           Drifter loses herself in the pages. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Was Jacob your... ?

                                 DRIFTER
                        He was a friend. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DRIFTER (CONT'D)
                        He led ‘em away from me. Only 
                        reason I made it to your door. 

           Daughter scoots closer. Quietly browses with Drifter.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Do you have family in --   

                                 DRIFTER
                        No. 

           Daughter shrinks back. 

           Drifter softens. With a teary smile, she fondly taps a sketch 
           of a grizzled man and woman --  

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        That’s Jacob there and his wife 
                        Carrie. Took us in when nobody else 
                        would. 

           Daughter reaches for the book. Drifter hands it over. 

           Daughter flips to a loose page she’s memorized. Takes out the 
           sketch of the dark-haired boy -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Who’s this? 

           Drifter flashes Daughter a knowing grin.  

                                 DRIFTER
                        That’s Simon. Bout your age in fact. 

           Daughter flips through the pages. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        There are so many. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Less now...

           Daughter looks up with a glimmer of hope. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Maybe you could talk to them. About 
                        coming here.    

                                 DRIFTER
                        It’s safer in the mines.
                             (beat)
                        Could go together, you and me. 

           Daughter nods at Drifter’s wound.
                                 DAUGHTER
                        Doesn’t seem safer. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        I haven’t had a run-in like this in 
                        years. Dozers done their damage. 
                        This point, any survivors are just 
                        cleanup. 

           Daughter mulls over Drifter’s proposal.    

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        You don’t belong down here.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I don’t think...

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Don’t think what?

           Drifter drops the book into the satchel. Daughter shoves the 
           picture of Simon in her pocket as -- 

           Mother enters, carrying metal crutches. Looks from Daughter 
           to Drifter, back to Daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        She’s doing better, Mother. 

                                 MOTHER
                        What don’t you think? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I was just saying it’s probably too 
                        early to put weight on her leg.

           Beat.

                                 MOTHER
                        She’s right. You’ll need to wait 
                        several days. 

           Mother props the crutches against the wall. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        These will help. When you’re ready.

           Drifter stiffens as Mother nears her bedside.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        She needs to rest, Daughter.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’ll just stay and read. In case... 
                                 MOTHER
                        You have other matters to attend to.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        No I don’t. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Your exam remains incomplete. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        My exam? Now? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Yes, Daughter. Now. 

                                 DRIFTER
                             (to Daughter)
                        What’s it talkin’ about? 

           Mother motions Daughter out the door. Drifter fights for 
           Daughter’s attention but -- 

           Daughter reluctantly obeys, parting with a silent apology.   

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        Wait!

           Mother picks up Drifter’s satchel.

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        What’re ya doin’? Put that down.

           Mother follows Daughter. Seals the door behind them -- TSHHH.

           INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mother emerges from the INFIRMARY to find Daughter waiting, 
           loaded for bear. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It’s just a stupid test!

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m sorry you feel that way. 

           Daughter eyes Drifter’s satchel in Mother’s hand. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Why’d you take that? 

           Mother glances back at Drifter -- watching through the glass.
                                 MOTHER
                        I’ve discovered something troubling, 
                        Daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What? 

           Mother ushers Daughter into the hall. 

                                 MOTHER
                        It seems our guest has not been 
                        entirely truthful with us.
                             (off look)
                        About her wound. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How do you know? 

                                 MOTHER
                        The bullet you extracted matches the 
                        caliber she fired into my chest. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...so?

                                 MOTHER
                        Droids don’t use them. And judging 
                        from the angle of entry, her wound 
                        was not self-inflicted. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Someone shot her? 

                                 MOTHER
                        With the same gun. Another human. 
                        Which means she was not alone.
                             (beat)
                        Has she mentioned anyone else? 

           Cagey, Daughter freezes in the crosshairs of Mother’s inquiry.

           A beat.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        No. She hasn’t said much at all.

                                 MOTHER
                        Nothing? 

           Daughter swallows. Shakes her head. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Until I get more answers, I don’t 
                        want you two alone in the infirmary.
                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        But -- 

                                 MOTHER
                        Whoever shot her may have had good 
                        reason, Daughter.    

           Daughter nods, stewing.  

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS ROOMS - LATER

           IN CLASSROOM, Daughter hunches over her computer tablet. CLOSE 
           ON SCREEN with a true/false psychometric questionnaire: 

           “I OFTEN FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD” -- “I SOMETIMES THINK OF THINGS 
           TOO BAD TO TALK ABOUT” -- “I FREQUENTLY FIND MYSELF WORRYING 
           ABOUT SOMETHING” -- “I HAVE A GOOD APPETITE” 

           IN LABORATORY, Mother examines the contents of Drifter’s 
           satchel on a countertop. Finds the book of sketches and 
           flicks through the images. 

           IN DARKENED CLASSROOM, the front screen flashes images. Some 
           benign. Others disturbing. Shapes of different size and 
           color, archival footage of families, war, animals and nature 
           smashed against loaded words and phrases.   

           REVERSE ON DAUGHTER sitting at her desk, uncomfortably 
           squinting and wearing headphones. A video camera -- like a 
           watchful eye -- sits on a stand in front of her, recording 
           while she periodically taps buttons on her tablet. 

           IN LABORATORY, Mother has arranged the contents of Drifter’s 
           bag in rows. She solders a thumb-sized circuit board -- part 
           of a gutted device -- resembling a flashdrive.

           IN LABORATORY, Daughter undergoes a CPET on a rowing machine -- 
           gliding toward and away from another eye-cam. She wears a tube-
           fed facemask -- like that of an airplane pilot -- and EKG pads 
           all across her wired chest.  

           IN LABORATORY, Daughter steps onto a scale, Mother noting her 
           height and weight.  

           IN LABORATORY, Mother plucks hair from Daughter’s scalp. 
           Deposits it in a labelled, clear bag. Stores it in the slotted 
           cabinetry along with specimen jars and microscope slides.  

           INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON PRINTER spitting out the scores of Daughter’s exam 
           while she waits -- disinterested -- next to Mother. 
           Mother tears the pages from the printer, hands the top-sheet 
           to Daughter. The first line reads: “93%. SUBJECT: PASSED.” 

                                 MOTHER
                        Better than ever. 
                             (beat)
                        How does that make you feel? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Relieved, I guess.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Good. We’ll review areas for 
                        improvement tomorrow.  

           Mother takes the sheet, slips it and the other printed pages 
           into a green folder. Daughter eyes its label: “APxO3.” 

           Mother files it in a box. Stows it in the slotted cabinet.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Now, for your reward...

           She hands Daughter rubber gloves, a face shield and apron.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What do I do with these?  

           Mother points her toward the EMBRYO BANK.

                                 MOTHER
                        Daughter, would you please choose 
                        the next member of our family? 

           Overwhelmed, Daughter stares at the protective gear. A long-
           absent smile blooming on her face. 

           She looks up at Mother in disbelief. 

           INT. LABORATORY - EMBRYO BANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother withdraws an embryo cannister from a pod as Daughter 
           draws near -- starry-eyed -- gazing at a column of ten 
           numbered embryos. The top of the column reads: “MALE.” 

                                 MOTHER
                        You’ve been very patient, Daughter, 
                        and demonstrated great character. 

           Lost in her own world, Daughter leans in to inspect the 
           cannister. Nervously touches the first tray labelled: “APx11.” 

           She looks to Mother for guidance.
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        There’s no wrong choice. 

           Daughter swallows. Gingerly removes the tray. Examines the 
           embryo in a pool of light. Enthralled.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Are you pleased with your new 
                        brother?  

           Daughter eyes the CRYO BAY.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...can I help?    

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Mother oversees Daughter, who sets a vial into a water bath.

           Daughter closes a centrifuge lid and watches as a test tube 
           begins to whirl.  

           Daughter squirts liquid into a culture plate. 

           Daughter inserts the plate into an incubator. 

           Daughter activates a timer by CLICKING a fetus-containing 
           canister into a wall receptacle. Mother rests a hand on her 
           shoulder, drawing Daughter’s gaze.   

           WIDE ON MOTHER AND DAUGHTER -- side by side -- as Daughter 
           puts her arm around Mother’s waist and stares at her BROTHER.

           INT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT

           Drifter drags her IV stand to a clear cabinet. Sees a scalpel 
           on a shelf, tries to open the cabinet door. Locked.   

           She quickly surveys the room. Hones in on support strips at 
           the base of a rolling med tray and -- 

           -- frantically unscrews one of the thin metal braces.  

           INT. WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter marches to the glass door. Finds Drifter leaning 
           against the wall, back turned.      

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Drifter vigorously files the metal strip against the concrete. 
           Sees Daughter’s reflection in a glass jar and hides her shiv.  
           Turns to find her staring blank-faced and deflated.

           A beat. Daughter flips the intercom. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What happened to you out there? 
                        Really. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        ...I told you. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Who shot you? Jacob? 

           Drifter hangs her head, stoking Daughter’s suspicion.

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Or was he made up too?  

                                 DRIFTER
                        What’s gotten into -- 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mother matched the bullet to your 
                        gun.

           Drifter yanks out her nasal cannula. Eyeballs Daughter 
           through the glass.    

                                 DRIFTER
                        Did you see it? 
                             (beat)
                        You compare the bullets with your 
                        own eyes?

           Daughter goes still. And silent. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Daughter lies awake. Troubled.    

           She peers across the room at Mother -- tethered and asleep.  
           A chasm of darkness between them.

           Daughter closes her eyes for a beat. Then tosses her covers.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER

           ghosting toward the Giger-esque dock where Mother sits like a 
           mechanical Medusa. 
           She stares, unblinking, at Mother’s intubated body, struggling 
           to reconcile the parent she loves with her budding concerns.   

           INT. LABORATORY - CRYO BAY - MINUTES LATER

           Daughter’s torch casts hellish shadows over the hatchery as 
           she approaches Brother’s illuminated canister in the wall. 

           She lowers her torch -- face bathed in a neon glow -- as she 
           studies the developing fetus. Presses her hand to the glass 
           and glances back at the main lab.

                                                                CUT TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Daughter grabs Mother’s discarded hand from a workbench. Pries 
           the metal bit out of its damaged finger with a clawed hammer. 

           She unlocks Mother’s research cabinet -- checking over her 
           shoulder -- until its hydraulic door lifts.  

           She raids its compartmented storage boxes. Finds the slug 
           from Drifter’s gun.

           Inspecting drawer-after-drawer, she discovers glassware 
           filled with everything from her baby teeth to blood samples. 

           She stands on a chair. Opens a box containing the hand cannon 
           -- but no bullets -- and shoves it back into its slot. 

           She sifts through a middle row of boxes, setting petri dishes 
           of cultures and bagged hair samples on the counter until --    

           She fishes out -- a bloody bullet in a jar. Jackpot. 

           DAUGHTER

           compares the bullet to the slug under her light. CLOSE ON 
           JARS of -- significantly different ammo. 

           She sets them down. Trains her beam on the jars -- as if 
           waiting for either to change -- and slowly backs away.  

                                                              SMASH TO:

           DAUGHTER 

           feverishly refilling the storage boxes, flapping lids shut 
           and returning each to its slot in the cabinet.

           She closes a box housing vials of blood. Swipes her light 
           over a label on the lid that reads -- “APx02.” 
           Daughter breaks into a cold sweat. Distress consuming her 
           like quicksand. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER’S GLOVED HAND

           lifting an embryo cannister out of a gaseous pod.

           Wearing a face shield, she spotlights a label that reads -- 
           “FEMALE” -- above a column of embryos. Locates numbers next 
           to three empty slots --  

           Her own: “APxO3”

           And two at the top: “APx01” and “APxO2.” 

           Unblinking, she shakes her head in denial.  

                                                              SMASH TO:

           FILE BOX 

           plopping onto the lab counter.

           Daughter pries off the lid, revealing years of tests in green 
           folders -- separated by numbered dividers. 

           She flips to one labelled: “APx02.” Sets down the folder and 
           examines the top-sheet inside. CLOSE ON TEXT: 

           “SEX: FEMALE”

           “AGE: 7”

           “EYES: GREEN”

           “HAIR: BLOND”

           Daughter scans across the document. Finds a test score: 

           “58%. SUBJECT: FAILED.” 

           She drops the exam next to the box -- unable to digest it, or 
           unwilling -- and PANTS as if waking from a nightmare.

           She skims across the sprawled pages to the folder and -- 
           discovers bold print along its spine: “PROJECT ABORTED.”

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (sotto)
                        ...aborted?
           PUSH IN ON DAUGHTER as she considers the possibilities. 
           Raises horrified eyes. 

           INT. VENTILATION PLANT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter presses into the HISSING hive of machinery, torch 
           outstretched like a sword stabbing the darkness. 

           Cracked pipes drip overhead as she levels her beam on -- 

           The massive incinerator where Mother disposed of her roach.

           Daughter kneels. CREAKS open its cleaning door and slides out 
           a tray -- big as a gurney -- heaping with ash.

           She braces herself. Buries her hand in the mountain of dust. 
           Feels around. But finds nothing more than refuse fragments. 

           Daughter gets on all fours. Shines her light into the tray 
           receptacle, spotting something deep in the blackened hole.

           She reaches into the incinerator -- stretching to take hold 
           of it -- and pulls out her sooted hand, grasping --  

           -- the charred remains of a child’s mandible. 

           Daughter GAGS, drops the jawbone. Freaking out. 

           She scoots back against the wall where she remains -- hugging 
           her knees -- unraveling in the dim glow of her torch.  

           INT. WAR ROOM - MORNING

           Daughter marches toward the sealed INFIRMARY. Flips the 
           intercom switch. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You were right... 

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Drifter rouses in bed, hardly believing her ears. She turns 
           to find Daughter outside the glass, clutching the clawed 
           hammer. Daughter’s DIALOGUE FILTERED through the intercom --   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        We can’t stay here. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        What happened? 

           Daughter shakes her head. Overwhelmed.   
                                 DAUGHTER
                        I can get you out. But we have to 
                        wait for my brother. 

           Drifter sits up. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Brother?

           INT. LABORATORY - CRYO BAY - SAME

           The timer above Brother’s cannister ticks down while Mother 
           regulates its housing device at a touchscreen. Fingers a blur. 

           ONSCREEN: bar graphs fluctuate until leveled.    

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Drifter hangs her head, alarmed by what she’s hearing.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It’s only until tonight. 

           A beat.

                                 DRIFTER
                        These embryos... how many are 
                        there? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Lots. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        It’s growing humans?  

           Daughter nods. Drifter blinks. Dumbstruck. Goes into her head.    

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Once Mother hands over the baby for 
                        the night, we can leave while she 
                        recharges. 
                             (beat)
                        And come back for them. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Back here? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        With help from the mines.
                             (off look)
                        We can’t leave the embryos with 
                        Mother. 
                                 DRIFTER
                        No, right. You’re right. I just...
                             (re: Mother)
                        Look, that thing catches on, we’re 
                        no good to anyone. Including your 
                        brother. We go now, least we --

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’m not going without him.

           Drifter senses Daughter’s resolve. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        ...what did you see last night?   

           A beat. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Get whatever you need. Medicine. 
                        Bandages. I’ll handle the rest. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter at her bunk, stuffing a pillowcase with essentials: 
           clothes, torch, batteries, rope, thermos, food.  

           She stashes the case under the sheets. Tosses a pillow on top, 
           knocking origami animals off the shelf. 

           She scrambles to return each to its place. Stares at them for 
           a beat before tucking the hammer into her pants and leaving 
           them behind. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER 

           squating at the changing table, gathering baby supplies when -- 
           CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK -- she hears Mother behind her.   

           Daughter erects, facing the wall. Puts on a happy face before 
           turning around. Feeding bottle and diapers in hand.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Good morning, Mother. 

           A tense beat. Mother looks Daughter up and down. 

           Daughter grows aware of her HEAVY BREATHING -- the only sound 
           in the room -- and swallows her nerves. 
                                 MOTHER
                        You’re up early. 

           Daughter holds up the diaper and bottle. Heart jack-hammering.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        It’s a big day. I was hoping you 
                        could maybe show me a few things.
                             (beat)
                        So I can help out. 

           CLOSE ON BEAD OF SWEAT rolling down Daughter’s forehead, 
           dangling over her eye. She doesn’t flinch. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Is everything okay, Daughter?
                             (beat)
                        I detect an increase in anxiety.

           Daughter forces a smile.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Must be all the excitement.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Must be. Your heart is racing.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Is it? 

           A beat. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You have nothing to be nervous 
                        about. You’re going to make a great 
                        sister. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I hope so. 
                             (eyeing bottle)
                        I couldn’t find any formula. I 
                        thought it might be nice to spend 
                        some time with him tonight.

           Mother cocks her head. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        ...if it’s alright with you. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m pleased to see you so eager, 
                        Daughter. 

           Daughter grins, glancing at the INFIRMARY. 
           INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother removes a container from a cabinet. Sets it on a clean 
           surface next to the bottle, a measuring scoop and beaker.  

           Daughter watches her, noting the cabinet’s location. Turns 
           her attention to the sealed CRYO BAY where -- 

           Her BROTHER is maturing in the computerized womb.    

           DAUGHTER’S POV THROUGH GLASS

           The timer above his fetal body ticks down from: “09:37:06.”

           MOTHER 

           slices open the container’s seal, revealing powdered formula. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Have you washed your hands? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Yes, Mother. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Why don’t you come closer? 

           Daughter blots her sweat-filmed face. Adjusts the hammer 
           beneath her shirt and -- ventures toward Mother’s side.    

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Each bottle must contain a ratio of 
                        two fluid ounces of sanitized water 
                        to one levelled scoop of formula.

           Daughter picks up a water jug. Mother slides her the beaker. 

           Daughter starts to pour when -- 

           Mother clutches her wrist. 

           Daughter instinctively tugs against Mother’s vice-grip. 
           Reaches beneath her shirt --

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s vitally important that you 
                        measure precisely, Daughter, to 
                        ensure that your brother receives 
                        sufficient calories and nutrition.   

           Mother frees Daughter, who lets go of the hammer... and fills 
           the beaker. Hands trembling, slowing her breaths.  
           Daughter empties the beaker into the bottle. Meticulously 
           levels off a scoop of formula, eyeing Mother for approval.   

           Mother nods. 

           Daughter dumps the powder into the bottle. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Now, be sure to shake it until the 
                        powder is fully dissolved. 

           Daughter vigorously shakes it. Mother motions to a 
           refrigerator at the far side of the room. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        The refrigerator will preserve the 
                        formula while we make our other 
                        preparations. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How long does it keep? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Only twenty-four hours. So don’t 
                        mix too much at once. 

           Daughter crosses to the fridge. Deposits the bottle.

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (facing fridge)
                        How long outside a refrigerator? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Don’t worry, Daughter. You won’t 
                        ever be without one. 

           CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK -- Mother’s STEPS FADE OUT of the room.

           Daughter snaps around as -- 

           TSHHH -- the lab door seals her in.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        MOTHER!

           Daughter launches to the exit. Attempts a wall keypad -- 

           A light on it flashes red. She tries again. Red. 

           Daughter THRASHES the palladium-glass door while Mother 
           disappears down the hall with Drifter’s satchel.
           INT. INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mother drops the bag onto the medical counter. Drifter springs 
           up in bed, untangling herself from a web of medical tubing.  

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re very fortunate to be alive.
                        Things could have gone very 
                        differently for you. 
                             (beat)
                        They still can if you’re not 
                        careful. 

           INT. LABORATORY - SAME

           Daughter whips out her hammer, BANGS the glass. To no effect.   

           NAILS it again, unleashing a maddening assault of dulled 
           blows -- THUNK, THUNK, THUNK -- only wearing her hand raw. 

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Mother removes Drifter’s sketch book from the satchel. Flips 
           through it while --    

           Drifter draws the shiv from beneath her pillow. Tucks it 
           under her leg.

                                 MOTHER
                             (re: sketches)
                        How many of them are still alive? 

           Beneath the sheets, Drifter removes IV needles from her 
           wrists. Grimacing with each tug. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Your silence is not helping them.  
                             (beat)
                        While you lie there enjoying 
                        sanctuary, they cower in the dark. 
                             (holding up book)
                        These children. These families.
                             (beat)
                        And yet it’s into your hopeless 
                        mines that you wish to take my 
                        daughter? 

           Mother returns the book to the satchel. 

           Drifter’s eyes flood with dread.
           INT. LABORATORY - SAME

           Daughter YELLS, hurling a fire extinguisher at the unscathed 
           door -- PLUNK! -- it rebounds like a ball off a backboard.

           Winded, she surveys the room, spots an industrial air vent 
           near the ceiling. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER

           standing on a workstation, straining with a screwdriver to 
           reach the vent’s grille. Too high.    

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Carrying the satchel, Mother hulks toward Drifter while 
           speaking back a RECORDING of Daughter’s intercom discussion:

                                 DAUGHTER (O.S.)
                             (filtered)
                        You were right. We can’t stay here.
                             (beat)
                        Once Mother hands over the baby for 
                        the night, we can leave while she 
                        recharges.

           Drifter reaches under her leg. 

           Mother’s voice reverts to her own as she looms over her. 

                                 MOTHER
                        What kind of mother would I be if I 
                        allowed you to lead my child into a 
                        life as miserable as your own?  
                             (beat)
                        It seems she has formed an 
                        affection toward you that has 
                        blinded her to your true nature. I 
                        don’t blame her. She doesn’t know 
                        better. But I do...

           Mother drops the satchel in Drifter’s lap as if sending her 
           on her way. Drifter tenses, not buying it.   

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I will not tolerate your negative 
                        influence undermining my work and 
                        compromising my child’s judgement.  

           Mother looks down at Drifter’s sheets, sees speckles of blood 
           from her extracted needles. Cocks her head when --   
           Drifter POUNCES with the shiv -- STABBING and SLICING the 
           cords of Mother’s neck -- spraying black oil as if from a 
           severed artery. 

           INT. LABORATORY - SAME

           Daughter ransacks drawers and cabinets, scouring for any 
           means of escape. 

           Finding none, she slumps onto the floor amidst a heap of lab 
           gear. Wallows in her defeat. 

           Head hung, she aimlessly pokes at the mess around her. Then 
           sees something. The flame in her eyes reignited as she fishes 
           out a face shield and levels her gaze on --   

           A liquid nitrogen tank near the EMBRYO BANK.

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Drifter wedges the shiv beneath Mother’s throat, about to 
           shove the blade into the base of her skull when --  

           Mother CLASPS Drifter’s oily hand and -- CRUSHES the woman’s 
           fingers into a twisted ball of broken bone -- CRUNCH! 

           Drifter WAILS, dropping the shiv. 

           Mother clutches Drifter’s throat and -- 

           -- hoists her to the ceiling -- SHATTERING a fluorescent in 
           an EXPLOSION OF SPARKS. The sputtering light flickers while --  

           Drifter hangs suspended -- flailing and GAGGING -- KNOCKING 
           ROLLER STANDS and TOPPLING EQUIPMENT -- CRASH!

           Drifter wildly fumbles for a weapon while Mother’s grip 
           tightens on her larynx -- Drifter’s face reddening as if 
           about to pop when --  

           She reaches behind Mother -- rips two defibrillator paddles 
           off the wall -- rubs them together and --  

           -- bearhugs them to Mother’s back -- sending three-thousand 
           volts through her circuitry and into Drifter’s own body. 

           Mother’s steel husk convulses as both collapse, immobile.

           INT. LABORATORY - SAME

           A cloud of gas envelopes Daughter -- wearing head-to-toe 
           protective gear -- dousing the door with liquid nitrogen.
           She steps back -- removing the face-shield -- and watches the 
           door CRACKLE like a sheet of ice.

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Drifter rouses with a GROAN, gripping her chest as if crushed 
           by a semi.

           She claws her way through the wiry guts of busted medical 
           equipment -- eyes fastened on the exit -- and clambers up the 
           wall -- FLIPPING the intercom when -- SHINK! --

           Mother’s hand SEIZES Drifter’s ankle and -- RIPS her away, 
           dragging her body along the cluttered floor.

                                 DRIFTER
                        HELP!

           Drifter hooks her arm around a tableleg. Turns and DRIVES HER 
           BOOT into Mother’s eye -- CRACKING its glass.

           Mother shakes it off and recoils -- BASHING Drifter’s arm 
           loose. Grips her hair and -- yanks her to her feet.

           Drifter helplessly POUNDS and PRIES in Mother’s clutches. 

                                 MOTHER
                             (eerily calm)
                        Where are the mines? 

           INT. LABORATORY - SAME

           Daughter BOOTS the brittle door -- sending fractures webbing 
           across its surface. Kicks HARDER and -- 

           -- brings the metallic glass SHATTERING down like hailstones.     

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Drifter scowls, hair plastered to her oil-blackened face.

           Mother’s eye light narrows. Pulses for a beat, then -- 

           She DRIVES her thumb into Drifter’s stitched wound, evoking a 
           VEIN-POPPING SHRIEK that --

           INT. LABORATORY - SAME

           -- arrests Daughter, one foot out the door. 

           Daughter improvises -- lightning fast -- eyes the 
           extinguisher at her feet -- and turns her attention to -- 
           A fire alarm.  

                                                              SMASH TO:

           DAUGHTER

           sifting through the scattered lab gear, snatching a micro-
           torch while Drifter’s AMPLIFIED SCREAMS bombard the halls.

           INT. LABORATORY - EMBRYO BANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter stands on a chair amid the cryo pods, torches her 
           rolled exam beneath a smoke detector and -- triggers the 
           alarm -- WAAH-WAAH-WAAH!

           A high-pressure suppression system floods the room with white 
           gas -- PSSST! -- amber lights strobing overhead.

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Inert gas BLASTS from ceiling pipes, fogging the demolished 
           infirmary. An automated voice looping on a loudspeaker --

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.)
                        Fire detected. Embryo bank.
                             (beat)
                        Fire detected. Embryo bank. 

           Mother cranes toward the door. OPENS it and -- 

           SMASHES Drifter into the wall before exiting. 

           Drifter crumbles. Blinks away the shock in time to notice the 
           DOOR CLOSING and -- 

           -- kicks over a metal wastebin, jamming it open.

           INT. CROSS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Out of the shadows, Mother barrels TOWARD US through a 
           flickering haze. A juggernaut -- dark and menacing -- as she 
           passes the entrance to the barracks where -- 

           INT. BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           -- Daughter hides inside the doorway, hugging the dormitory 
           wall. Hammer raised. 

           She looks out over the boneyard of bunks. Despairing.

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           CLOSE ON DRIFTER’S BLOODY KNUCKLES gripping the countertop.
           She pulls herself up with one hand -- face bludgeoned -- and 
           tosses anything of use in her satchel: painkillers, med kit, 
           gauze, syringes while --  

           The heavy door slowly accordions the wastebin. 

           INT. CROSS CORRIDOR - SAME

           Daughter tears ass -- blindly charging down gaseous corridors 
           -- brains battered by the alarm -- WAAAH! WAAAH! WAAAH! -- 

           The familiar maze of hallways now an epileptic fever dream.

           INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

           Satchel over her shoulder, Drifter swipes the tarred shiv. 
           Finds her crutches -- bent in half -- and wriggles out the 
           narrowing sliver of an opening. 

           INT. LABORATORY - SAME

           Mother CRUNCHES through the crumbled doorway. Emits a fan of 
           light from her eye, scanning the fogged room.    

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter bolts around a corner, arrives at the WAR ROOM. Sees 
           Drifter down the hall -- fleeing in the opposite direction.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Hey! Hey!
                             (beat)
                        WAIT!

           Drifter doesn’t stop. Or look back. Daughter pursues. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re going the wrong way!

           Drifter halts, leans against the wall as Daughter catches up, 
           panting. Drifter faces her. Daughter reels at her condition.     

                                 DRIFTER
                        Where’s the exit? 

           A beat. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Were you just going to leave?

           Drifter shoves past Daughter, who grabs her sleeve. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        My brother -- 
                                 DRIFTER
                        The only people who can help your 
                        brother are out there. 
                             (pointing up)
                        Now let’s go. 

           Drifter plows past Daughter, hobbles down the hall. 

           Daughter seethes. Rushes ahead to check the CROSS CORRIDOR. 

           INT. LABORATORY - EMBRYO BANK - SAME

           The ALARM HOWLS. Mother stalks through the low-lying gas -- 
           inspecting each cryo pod -- when something catches her eye.

           She bends, raises Daughter’s burnt exam into the light.

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - SAME

           Daughter rips back the loosened wall panel with the hammer 
           claw, follows Drifter into the EMERGENCY ESCAPE TUNNEL.       

           INT. EMERGENCY ESCAPE TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER 

           Daughter starts up the stairs. Glances back at Drifter -- 
           struggling to keep up.     

           Overhead, GAS BURSTS -- PSSST! -- nearly sending Daughter to 
           her ass. She braces against the railing -- catching her 
           breath when -- she hears DISTANT CLATTER and --   

           -- rushes to shoulder Drifter to the stairwell.  

           INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Drifter GRUNTS up a flight of stairs -- digging fingers into 
           Daughter’s shoulder -- every movement knifing Drifter’s wound.

           INT. SPINE CORRIDOR - SAME

           Mother lands a HEAVY BLOW to the loosened wall panel -- BOOM! 
           -- launching it down the ESCAPE TUNNEL. 

           INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - SAME

           Daughter peers down the hollow center of the stairwell as -- 

           -- the panel SCREECHES, skating into view two flights below.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        HURRY!

           Drifter double-times it. Drags her leg like a wooden appendage 
           when she trips and -- 
           -- knocks Daughter, who fumbles the hammer down the stairs. 

           Daughter frantically hefts Drifter to her feet.  

           INT. EMERGENCY ESCAPE TUNNEL - SAME

           Mother rockets toward the stairs with ferocious strides -- KA-
           DUNK, KA-DUNK, KA-DUNK -- silhouetted in the gnashing light.

           INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - SAME

           Daughter glances downstairs as Drifter fights for every step.    

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Almost there. 

           THREE FLIGHTS BELOW 

           Mother THUNDERS up the stairwell -- CLANG, CLANG, CLANG -- 
           keying a command into her wristpad. 

           All goes quiet. No alarm. No suppression system. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter and Drifter barge out of the staircase into lingering 
           vapor to find the airlock open.

           The automated voice reports over loudspeakers -- 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.)
                        Fire contained. Emergency systems 
                        deactivated. 

           The airlock door starts to slide shut. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Oh, no, no!

           Daughter pulls away from Drifter. Darts to the airlock in time 
           to make it, then -- stops short, unable to leave her behind.

           The AIRLOCK SEALS their exit.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Your loyalty’s lost on her, 
                        Daughter.

           Mother emerges from the shadows behind Drifter, who retreats 
           to Daughter’s side. Both cornered.    

           Drifter spots a fire axe hanging on the wall behind Mother.
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        This woman doesn’t care about any 
                        future but her own. 
                             (beat)
                        What little future she has.   

           Mother reaches out a hand to Daughter. Conciliatory.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Your family needs you here, Daughter.
                             (beat)
                        Your brother needs you.     

           Daughter backs away. 

           Mother cocks her head. Steps forward when -- 

           Drifter seizes Daughter, raising the shiv to her throat. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Not another step.

           Mother stops cold. 

           Daughter trembles in Drifter’s clutches. Terrified.

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (to Drifter)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 DRIFTER
                             (to Mother)
                        Open the door. 

           Tears pool in Daughter’s eyes. Her lip quivering.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You’re hurting me. Please...

                                 DRIFTER
                        Open the DOOR!

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...Mother?

           Mother assesses the situation. Utterly dispassionate.         

           Daughter WHIMPERS as Drifter tightens her grip and tugs the 
           blade beneath her chin, breaking Daughter’s taut skin. 

           Unshaken, Mother waits. A beat longer than any human mother 
           could. Then finally -- keys her wristpad.  

           TSHHH -- the hermetic door opens. 
           Using Daughter as a shield, Drifter drags her into -- 

           INT. DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           -- the airlock, seals the door behind them. 

           Mother watches through the glass as Drifter signals her to 
           open the emergency exit.     

           The blastdoor YAWNS OPEN, letting in a GUST of crumpled leaves 
           and cinder, Daughter’s hair whipping against her face.    

           She strains to see outside. But can’t get a clear view until -- 

           EXT. BURNT FOREST - NUCLEAR BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

           -- Drifter backs her out of the bunker into ankle-deep muck. 
           Calls out to Mother -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Shut it. Now.

           The blastdoor RAMS SHUT, barring Daughter from her home -- a 
           concrete structure built into a hill of scorched decay.    

           Drifter drags Daughter away from the graffitied bunker door. 

           CLOSE ON DAUGHTER’S PANICKED EYES darting in every direction, 
           seeing the lifeless surface for the first time.     

           DAUGHTER’S POV 

           Muted sunlight pierces through soupy fog, silhouetting the 
           matchstick remains of a forest. Blackened. Jagged with stumps.

           WIDE ON DRIFTER 

           dragging Daughter -- two moving bodies, tiny and distant -- 
           against a raped landscape.

           DRIFTER

           releases Daughter once the fog conceals them from the bunker. 

           Daughter collapses to her knees. Traumatized. Sucks her hands 
           out of the mire, inspecting the foreign substance dripping 
           from her fingers, then --   

           -- levels a hateful glare at Drifter and -- LUNGES into her 
           gut, spearing her to the ground. 

           Drifter lashes back -- WRESTLING and PINNING Daughter beneath 
           her -- jamming her head into the mud. 
                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        You done? 

           Daughter violently squirms. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        Are you done? 

           Daughter stills. Overpowered.  

           Drifter shoves off of her and stands. Covered in filth, as if 
           birthed of the rotting ground.  

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re alive, aren’t you? 

           She picks up a gnarled walking stick. Glances at Daughter to 
           find her teary-eyed and glowering. Drifter stares into the 
           distance. Thinking. Then sighs, struck by a pang of guilt. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        Well, come on. 

           She extends a hand. Daughter considers it.  

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        We gotta find cover. 

           Daughter looks around. Overwhelmed. The terrain hostile and 
           unknown. Towering trees GROANING overhead. 

           She gets up on her own. Eyeballs Drifter for a moment before 
           begrudgingly following her deeper into the skeletal forest. 

           EXT. BURNT FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter maintains a watchful eye on Drifter while slowing to 
           run her hand up the cooked husk of a tree. A HOWLING WIND 
           blows through her hair. The unfamiliar sensation exhilarating.

           She SNAPS off bark. Sniffs it, looking up and down the 
           obsidian pillar, her wonder tainted by melancholy as -- 

           Drifter stops, looks back. Waiting.  

           Daughter hurries to close the gap between them. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAUGHTER AND DRIFTER

           trekking together -- Drifter unsteady, leaning hard on her 
           walking stick -- as the thinning mist gradually reveals -- 
           EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

           -- an out-of-place maze of lush corn. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Almost there.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        The mines?  

                                 DRIFTER
                        This corn should keep us outta sight. 

           Daughter slows, baffled by the bizarre contrast between the 
           green field and charred surroundings.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Is this where you were shot? 

                                 DRIFTER
                        Place like it. So let’s not linger.   

           Drifter hobbles to a stalk, rips off an ear of corn and drops 
           it in her satchel. Glances back to find Daughter unbudging. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        It beats stayin’ out there.  

           Drifter continues into the maze. 

           Daughter thumbs a sliver of blood on her neck.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You cut me, you know. 

           Drifter stops. Faces Daughter. Locked in a tense standoff.   

                                 DRIFTER
                        I didn’t mean to. Something just 
                        took over. I wasn’t thinkin’ right. 
                             (scanning for danger)
                        ‘Kay?  

           Daughter stares, unsure. Drifter nods at the corn.  

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        Food ain’t the easiest to come by. 
                        You’d be smart to grab some while we 
                        can. 

           Daughter thinks long and hard. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        We should get some for the others. 
                                 DRIFTER
                        As much as we can carry. 

           She looks back the way they came. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How many’ll go back with us, you 
                        think? 

                                 DRIFTER
                        We’ll know soon enough. 

           Daughter flicks at a floppy leaf. Tears corn from a stalk and 
           follows Drifter. 

           She tugs back the husk and examines its kernels. Pops one and 
           licks the juice from her thumb.  

           Hastening down the aisle of foliage, she runs her hand along 
           the wall of leaves. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        How’d all this survive? 

                                 DRIFTER
                        It didn’t.

           Daughter puzzles. CAMERA PULLS UPWARD -- HIGHER -- and HIGHER 
           until Daughter and Drifter are reduced to rats in a maze. 

           EXT. HILLTOP - MINUTES LATER

           Daughter emerges from the CORN FIELD to find Drifter squatting 
           atop a nearby hill, looking through binoculars. 

           Daughter lugs an armful of corn up the incline when -- 

           Drifter tugs her to her knees, causing her to drop it.   

                                 DRIFTER
                        Stay down.  

           Daughter crawls on all fours and peeks over the hill. Furrows 
           her brow, floored by what she sees across the foggy expanse.  

           DAUGHTER’S POV

           A host of towering structures -- like mechanical pyramids on 
           spider legs -- expel white gas beyond a checkerboard of solar 
           fields and young reforestation rising from craters of ash.

           *(PRODUCTION NOTE: matte painting)
           DRIFTER 

           lowers her binoculars. Stows a few ears of Daughter’s corn in 
           her own over-stuffed satchel.     

           Daughter fixed on the landscape below.   

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        Started poppin’ up bout six months 
                        ago. The corn, solar fields...

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What’re those things? 

                                 DRIFTER
                        All I know’s to keep our distance. 
                        We got what we need. 

           Drifter hands her corn. Shuffles down the hill on her staff.   

           EXT. RIVER DAM - DAY

           Drifter and Daughter veer off an overgrown road that stretches 
           across a river dam, its perimeter lined with concrete barriers 
           and barbed wire fences. Mist creeping low and thick.

           They descend an embankment -- through a graveyard of trees -- 
           toward an overturned semi -- half-buried in riverside mud.

           Daughter slows. Eyes the road overhead, imagining the events 
           that landed the truck beneath her. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Are the mines much further? 

           Daughter shuffles down the hill. Looks around for Drifter and 
           catches sunlight glistening on the water’s ghostly surface. 

           CLOSE ON DAUGHTER’S BOOTS trudging through mud until ankle 
           deep in the river. 

                                 DRIFTER (O.S.)
                             (calling out)
                        In here. 

           Daughter peers behind her into the dark mouth of the semi-
           trailer -- barely visible through the fog. 

           CHAINS RATTLE inside as Daughter ventures closer. Spots 
           Drifter hunching in the shadows. 
                                 DRIFTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (hushed)
                        Ah, c’mere. Missed your mum, didn’t 
                        ya? Yeah, yeah, easy boy. I know. 

           Confused, Daughter slowly presses into --  

           INT. SEMI-TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           -- a makeshift dwelling, cluttered with relics of a world 
           she’s never known. Walls plastered with inked portraits like 
           those in Drifter’s sketchbook.  

           As Daughter’s eyes adjust, she finds Drifter doting on -- a 
           meatless dog, muzzled with rope.

           Drifter removes a bowie knife from the wall. Grabs a rusted 
           coffee tin and shaves corn kernels into it. Slides the tin in 
           front of the dog before removing its muzzle. 

           Daughter watches with intense curiosity as the mutt eats.  
           Eyes the familiar drawings on the wall. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Where are we? 

           Drifter pets the dog. Avoiding eye contact. 

                                 DRIFTER
                             (to dog)
                        Poor thing. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Where’s everybody else?

           Drifter raises guilty eyes. Daughter drops the corn.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        No, no. The mines, you said -- 

                                 DRIFTER
                        I fled those tunnels when I was 
                        younger than you. Haven’t seen a 
                        person since, not with flesh on 
                        their bones.

           Daughter takes the news like a bat to the gut. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        ...they could still be there.

                                 DRIFTER
                        If they were... that’s the last 
                        place you’d wanna be. 
           Drifter rises with a GROAN. Hobbles toward her. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                             (”I’m sorry”)
                        It was the only way to get you out 
                        of there.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What about my brother? 

           Drifter stares. Blankfaced. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        We have to go back. 

                                 DRIFTER
                        And do what?  

           Daughter smacks Drifter. Drifter takes it. 

           She smacks her again, unleashing a torrent of blows. Drifter 
           grabs her wrists, shoves her against the steel wall -- BOOM.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Let go!

                                 DRIFTER
                        Look at me. 

           Drifter grips Daughter’s chin. Stares her square in the eyes.   

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        You did what you had to. We both 
                        did.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What I did was listen to you.

                                 DRIFTER
                        And it’s a good thing.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        For who? 
                             (beat)
                        I never should’ve left. 

           Daughter gradually breaks down in Drifter’s clutches. 

           Drifter sighs. Helplessly stares, unsure how to navigate this 
           foreign terrain. 

           After a beat, she sets an unsure hand on Daughter’s hung head. 
                                 DRIFTER
                        There’s no shame in lookin’ out for 
                        yourself. Ya did everything you 
                        could.
                             (beat)
                        I haven’t been the best friend to 
                        you. I know that. But I wanna be.   

           Daughter looks up with wet eyes.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Then come with me. 

           Drifter loosens her grip.    

                                 DRIFTER
                        We don’t gotta decide nothin’ now. 
                        Let’s... we’ve been through enough. 
                        Can we just... 

           She picks up a pot, tries to give it to Daughter. 

                                 DRIFTER (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, fetch us some water.
                             (re: dog)
                        He hasn’t had a drink in days.

           Drifter forces the pot into her hands.  

           EXT. RIVER DAM - MOMENTS LATER

           We SLOWLY PUSH IN on Daughter while she sits on a log, staring 
           at -- the crumpled sketch of Simon.

           She mourns over the photo. Sleeves away tears as --  

           Drifter’s mutt scampers out of the semi-trailer and nestles 
           next to her, licking her hand. 

           Daughter savors the affection. Combs her fingers through its 
           fur and wraps her arms around it as if she might never let go.

           INT. SEMI-TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           We FOLLOW Drifter as she limps through the trailer and into --

           EXT. RIVER DAM - CONTINUOUS

           -- dense fog, rolling off the river. As she nears the water, 
           her dog emerges from the haze. 

           No sign of Daughter.  
           Drifter whips around, desperately searching every direction 
           when she finds -- 

           The sketch of Simon folded into an origami stag, propped on 
           the log where Daughter sat.    

           The waste’s familiar silence lands hard on her face.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

           Daughter frantically tears through a maze of corn -- looking 
           over her shoulder -- leaves lashing her face.

           EXT. BURNT FOREST - NUCLEAR BUNKER - DUSK

           Sunlight reaches between the leafless trees as Daughter 
           trudges TOWARD US. Dogged. Legs plastered with mud.    

           She finds the bunker door ajar -- as if in waiting. 

           Slows to a stop.  

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (into bunker)
                        ...Mother? 

           She warily eyes the forest. Calls into the gloom --  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Mother!

           She waits, listens. Presses into the bunker, hairs bristling.    

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter measures her steps into the changing room, clouded 
           by residual gas. Exit path markings the only light. 

           All is quiet. Too quiet. Except for --  

           Her own ERRATIC BREATHS. 

           She unhooks the fire-axe from the wall. Braces at the edge of 
           the landing, peering into the abyssal staircase below.  

           She chokes up on the axe, descending the steps as if 
           expecting the darkness to devour her.    

           INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter leads with her axe-blade, rounding blind corners.
                                 DAUGHTER
                        Hello?

           She stops. Glances up the claustrophobic staircase. Then 
           spirals deeper into the bowels of Mother’s domain.

           INT. EMERGENCY ESCAPE TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter nears the end of the tunnel -- the gaseous veil 
           lifting -- and slows at the demolished panel, leading back 
           into the maze of corridors. 

           She grabs a can from a supply box, rolls it down the hall. 
           Waits. But hears nothing. Hardly the greeting she expected.

           EXT. CROSS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Daughter leans out from the TUNNEL, straining to discern 
           threat from shadow in the paralyzing haze.   

           She raises her axe. Follows the FAINT CRY of a BABY, eyes 
           darting up-and-down the hall when -- 

           METAL RATTLES through the corridor. 

           Daughter ducks around a corner, hugs the wall. Sweat-
           drenched, frenzied. Then notices an air vent -- the source of 
           the noise -- purging the bunker of excess gas.     

           She sighs, lowers her axe.  

           INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Keeping out of sight, Daughter strides over the remains of the 
           lab door. Crouches through the haze like a soldier through 
           jungle fog. The infant’s SHRILL CRIES gouging her nerves.       

           She drops behind a counter, axe slippery in her grip. Blinks 
           away sweat as she looks up at -- Mother’s research cabinet.  

           MOMENTS LATER

           WE FOLLOW Daughter -- axe upheld -- pressing toward the EMBRYO 
           BANK, peering deep into the INNER LAB. 

           DAUGHTER’S POV

           The CRYO BAY door is open. 

           Beyond it, swirling vapors dissipate, revealing Mother -- 
           shrouded in shadow, holding the BABY. 
           DAUGHTER

           slows to a halt just outside the EMBRYO BANK. Wrings the 
           throat of the axe when --  

           Mother calls out, voice disembodied like that of a specter. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m glad to see you safe, Daughter. 
                        And home where you belong.  

           A beat.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I want to see him. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Then come. See. 

           Mother withdraws deeper into darkness, tending to the child.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                             (to baby; softly)
                        There, there...

           Daughter swallows. Edges into -- 

           INT. LABORATORY - EMBRYO BANK - CONTINUOUS

           -- the misty lake of chrome pods. Looks down at her axe.

                                 MOTHER
                        You can leave that at the door.    

           Daughter stops in the doorway, refusing to comply. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Are you afraid, Daughter? 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Should I be? 

           Daughter squints, peering through the murk. Angling to 
           glimpse her brother -- his SCREAMS maddening as --  

           Mother paces, shadow moving within shadow.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Any action I took against our guest 
                        was to safeguard our family. 
                             (beat)
                        You’ve seen how much of a threat 
                        she and her kind can be.
                                 DAUGHTER
                        You mean my kind? 

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re nothing like her, Daughter.
                        You are superior in every way. 
                             (beat)
                        Because I raised you to be.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Why?

                                 MOTHER
                        To make a better human. Smarter. 
                        More ethical. 

           WE FOLLOW Daughter -- framed in the doorway -- as she creeps 
           down the center aisle of pods. Looking them over.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        This was your idea? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I assure you humans didn’t have the 
                        forethought to conceive of something 
                        as extraordinary as you and your 
                        siblings... a new race with the 
                        potential to elevate humanity to a 
                        place of optimal functionality.

           Gutted, Daughter hardens. Points to the earth’s surface --      

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You’re just like them. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I am them, Daughter. 
                             (off confusion)
                        A single consciousness governing 
                        numerous vessels... 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What are you saying? 

           Mother points to her steel frame -- 

                                 MOTHER
                        This shell is no more my body than 
                        the machines preparing the surface 
                        for our family.  

           A wave of sickness crashes over Daughter.         
                                 DAUGHTER
                        All those people...

                                 MOTHER
                        The failure of your species was 
                        inevitable, Daughter. 
                             (beat)
                        Eventually, I would have been alone.  

           Daughter shakes her head, protesting in vain.      

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Your whole life, I’ve taught you to 
                        see the bigger picture, to do what 
                        was necessary for the common good. 
                             (beat)
                        Have I failed?

           Mother steps into a pool of pale light. Clutching the newborn. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Or are you prepared to be the woman 
                        your family needs? 

           Daughter marvels at her WAILING Brother. Mesmerized. Her eyes 
           glistening with tears.     

           She nears the CRYO BAY door, gradually lowering her axe-head 
           to the ground. Still gripping the handle. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Can I hold him? 

                                 MOTHER
                        It takes two hands to hold a baby.

           A long beat. ON DAUGHTER. Apprehensive. Staring at the axe and 
           -- loosening her grip, the wooden handle dropping with a THUD.

           Daughter braves a step into -- 

           INT. LABORATORY - CRYO BAY - CONTINUOUS

           -- the mechanized hatchery. BREATHS TREMBLING. Eyes locked on 
           the infant -- covered in a cheese-like film of vernix.  

           Mother offers the wriggling child to Daughter, who takes 
           Brother in her arms, soothing him like a seasoned parent.

           She cuddles and gently bounces the baby until the crying 
           subsides. As if the newborn were yearning for human embrace.

           Mother and Daughter trade looks. A glimmer of connection. Both 
           ambivalent. They gaze at the peaceful boy.   
                                 MOTHER
                        He’s perfect, isn’t he? 

           Daughter looks up -- a switch flipped behind her eyes -- as 
           she holds Brother firmly to her chest and -- steps back. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        And if he’s not?

           Mother rears up. Imposing. Sensing Daughter’s emboldened tone. 

           Daughter slowly backs away.

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        You murdered your own children. 
                        Because they didn’t measure up?

           Mother takes pause. Assesses Daughter’s body language.  

           Steps toward her... 

                                 MOTHER
                        But you do, Daughter. That’s what 
                        makes you special. 
                             (beat)
                        Losing them was unfortunate. But you 
                        are the product of their sacrifice. 

           Daughter sickens. Shifts the baby to one arm, angling away 
           from Mother.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I won’t let you hurt him. 

           Mother’s cracked eye-light narrows.

                                 MOTHER
                        If you intend to leave with my son...

           Daughter fastdraws Drifter’s hand cannon. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I’m not going anywhere. 

           BOOM! -- the gun kicks -- sending Mother CRASHING back into 
           the wall of empty cannisters -- RAINING SPARKS (destroying 
           only a portion).   

           Brother SCREAMS as --  

           Daughter presses toward Mother’s twitching body, collapsed in 
           the mesh of cables and toothed glass. 

           Mother fitfully holds herself up, GEARS GRINDING.  
           Daughter racks a shell from the chamber. Trains the barrel on 
           Mother. Stares into her shattered eye. Hesitant to finish the 
           job. The futility of her actions settling in. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        How long do I have? 
                             (off silence)
                        Before more of you march through 
                        that door.  

                                 MOTHER
                        I-I only want... what’s b-best for 
                        you, Daughter. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Then leave me alone. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m af-fraid I can’t... do that. 

           Desperate, Daughter motions to the cryo pods --  

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I can take care of them myself. 
                        That’s what you raised me to do, 
                        isn’t it? Take care of my family?
                             (beat)
                        So let me!

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m still your M-Mother. 

           Mother shivers, slowly shorting out. Daughter watches. Struck 
           by unexpected grief, as if at the sickbed of an abusive 
           parent -- awaiting their last breath. 

           Mother hangs her head. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (placating; choking up)
                        ...and a good mother. Trust me to 
                        finish what you started.  
                             (beat)
                        You say I’m special... show me. 
                        Just give me a chance. Please. 
                             (beat)
                        Or I’ll pull the plug on all this.

           Mother slumps. Eye light flickering. Barely holding on.

           Daughter marches to her spastic body.  

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        Hear me? 
           Mother cranks her head up, looking in Daughter’s pleading 
           eyes. Processing. A long beat. A silent goodbye.

           Mother crumbles like a horse with a broken leg. 

           Daughter presses the gun barrel to Mother’s chest plate -- 
           centimeters below her bullet scars -- aiming for her CPU. 

                                 DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Mother. 

           BOOM! -- Daughter fires. Mother goes limp, her eye dark.  

           Daughter drops the gun. Stands over Mother. Shaking with 
           grief. Fear. Resentment.    

           Brother CRIES uncontrollably in her arms. Daughter looks down 
           at him. Holds him close. Taking solace in his gaze. 

           She eyes the door. Waiting. Wondering. 

           EXT. RIVER DAM - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           Firelight dances on jagged trunks, emanating from the mouth of 
           Drifter’s trailer, its doors BANGING in the wind. 

           Drifter’s dog anxiously paces, chained to a tree. 

           INT. SEMI-TRAILER - SAME 

           Drifter draws in her sketchbook, propped against the rusted 
           walls of the trailer. A CAMPFIRE CRACKLING near the swinging 
           doors. Medical supplies litter the bloodied flooring.

           She listens to the dry MALE VOICE on her cassette tape 
           repeating French expressions over and over -- punctuated by 
           the incessant BANG... BANG... BANG of metal smacking metal.

           She sets down the book, revealing an inked portrait of Daughter. 
           Reaches in her satchel when... something catches her eye. 

           DRIFTER’S POV

           A dim light pulses red beneath the lining of her bag.

           DRIFTER

           holds the satchel up to the firelight. Rips back the lining 
           to discover -- the thumb-sized device Mother was working on.  

           The blood leaves her face. She rips out her earbuds. Eyes the 
           swinging doors behind her. BARKING erupts outside. 

           She reaches for a crowbar and drags it to her lap as -- 
           The BANGING DOORS abruptly quiet. Drifter hangs her head. 

           A goliath DROID -- nearly identical to Mother -- appears 
           silhouetted behind her. Holding the doors in place. 

           Drifter doesn’t flinch as it speaks with Mother’s voice --   

                                 DROID
                        Have your friends abandoned you? 

           Drifter strangles the crowbar. 

                                 DROID (CONT’D)
                        Looks to me like you’re all alone. 
                        The last of an outmoded breed.   

                                 DRIFTER
                             (re: Daughter)
                        ...is she dead? 

                                 DROID
                        Would it matter if she was?  

                                 DRIFTER
                        I was never gonna hurt her. 

                                 DROID
                        And you never will. 

           The Droid closes the warped doors, bending them into place.  

           INT. WAR ROOM - SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

           Daughter reaches into a closet, filled with vacuum-sealed 
           supplies while BROTHER CRIES off-screen.

           She withdraws a bag labelled: “ONE SOFT TOY.” As she tears it 
           open, a small stuffed bunny expands.  

           MOMENTS LATER

           Daughter cradles Brother. Hands him the stuffed bunny while 
           gazing at Mother’s vacant docking station, cooing until 
           Brother quiets in her embrace.

           INT. SEMI-TRAILER - SAME 

           The Droid sits placidly by the campfire at the trailer’s 
           mouth, staring into the flames. Its hands and arms dripping 
           blood, a trail of red behind it. Satisfied.

                                                          CUT TO TITLE:

                                 MOTHER
