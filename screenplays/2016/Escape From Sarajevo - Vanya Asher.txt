                               ESCAPE FROM SARAJEVO

          GRANDVIEW
          1992. After Bosnia & Herzegovina declare independence from 
          Yugoslavia, 15,000 Serb soldiers encircle the Bosnian capital of 
          Sarajevo. 

          The siege, which lasted 1,425 days, is the longest siege in 
          modern warfare. 

          This is my father's story. 
           EXT. SARAJEVO - ACROSS TOWN - CAFE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           A packed cafe. Effortlessly stylish 90s crowd. Loud Eastern 
           euro accents yell over each other.

           Suddenly in the distance...THWACK!

           Some pigeons fly off. 

           Everyone falls silent. All heads turn in the general 
           direction of the noise. Tendrils of blue smoke rise from 
           their cigarettes. 

           Was that a GUNSHOT?

           The moment passes. Everyone goes back to their business. 

           A WIRY WAITER pushes through the crowded tables carrying a 
           tray with the works: a traditional copper pot filled with 
           "KAFA" - steaming Bosnian coffee, small ceramic cups, and a 
           dish of sugar cubes. 

           At a corner table, three friends smoke and chat. 

           MAK, 37, a Bosnian-Muslim professor with a mischievous glint 
           in his eyes. Judo fighter build. Moustache. Overly 
           optimistic if not naive. He's telling a joke. 

                                 MAK
                        So... after a night of drinking, 
                        this policeman stops Mujo.  

           DARKO, 40s, a Croatian-born surgeon with a perma-furrowed 
           brow and a short temper rolls his eyes. 

                                 DARKO
                        You already told this one, man.

           BOJAN, 30s, a happy-go-lucky Serbian-born baker with a rock 
           star smile eyes the approaching tray. A guitar case at his 
           feet.

                                 BOJAN
                        Which one? 

                                 MAK
                        See? He doesn't remember. 

           The Waiter sets the tray down in front of the guys. He 
           crosses his hands and listens.

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Cop pulls Mujo over. Wife's in the 
                        passenger seat. Mujo rolls down his 
                        window. "Can I help you?" The cop 
                        takes one whiff and says "I can 
                        smell the booze on your breath." 
                        Mujo's like "Well that's cause I've 
                        been drinking." Cop goes "Then why 
                        isn't your wife driving?". Mujo 
                        looks the cop dead in the eyes and 
                        says to him, he goes..."I'm drunk, 
                        not crazy." Haaaaa!

           Bojan laughs. Darko cracks up too. The Waiter does the so-so 
           motion with his palm. 

                                 MAK
                             (to Waiter; laughing)
                        Get out of here. 

           Mak leans over the kafa. Inhales the bitter-sweet aroma.

                                 DARKO
                        Professor. Would you like to do the 
                        honors?

           Mak squints happily and rolls up his sleeves. The familiar 
           ritual starts. He spoons the foam out of the pot and into a 
           ceramic cup. He pours kafa into the other three and then 
           divides the saved foam. 

           Bojan sips water. Darko takes a bite out of a sugar cube and 
           places it under his tongue. They take their first sip in 
           unison and lean back in their chairs. For a moment 
           everything is perfect. 

           Mak exhales in pleasure. Darko yawns. 

                                 MAK
                        Late night?

           Darko shrugs.

                                 BOJAN
                        Let me guess. Cveta? 

           Darko smirks. Mak shakes his head. Another sip of kafa.

           Bojan grimaces at the hills surrounding Sarajevo.

                                 BOJAN
                        It'd be so easy to take this 
                        goddamn city.

           He points to the hills and traces a circle through the air 
           with his index finger. All around them. 
                                 BOJAN (CONT'D)
                        We could be surrounded in a blink.

                                 DARKO
                        Don't tell your fellow Serbs.

                                 BOJAN
                        Man, my dad-

                                 MAK
                        He made it up, Bobo.

                                 DARKO
                        Huh? 

                                 MAK
                        His dad called him-

                                 BOJAN
                        He saw... I don't know-

                                 MAK
                        He says he saw soldiers in the 
                        woods. Or something. Like he knows. 
                        He's going senile. 

                                 BOJAN
                        He wouldn't lie. 

                                 MAK
                        He's a poet.

                                 BOJAN
                        Truckloads of them. His words. 

                                 DARKO
                        Well? Are they yours or ours?

                                 BOJAN
                        I was born in the same hospital up 
                        the goddamn street as you.

                                 DARKO
                        Sure. Fine. But is your loyalty 
                        with us? The fine folks that you 
                        came up with? The Croats and, yes, 
                        even the Muslims?

           Darko motions to himself then Mak. Mak throws a thumbs-up.

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        Or do you side with your 
                        motherland? The greatest Serbia. 
                        May she always be pure of blood.
                                 BOJAN
                        Well. I'm here aren't I?

                                 DARKO
                        Just checking. Cross him off the 
                        list. 

                                 MAK
                             (laughing)
                        You picked the wrong team, Bobo. 
                        Cause if your angry cousins ever 
                        decide to pay us a visit with their 
                        weapons and tanks and bullets? 
                        We're fucked. It's simple math. 

                                 DARKO
                             (to Bojan)
                        How about now? 

                                 BOJAN
                        You're the one fucking Cveta. A 
                        full on nationalist conservative 
                        Serb.

                                 DARKO
                        Well...hate fucking. She's a good 
                        lay. It's the right thing to do. 

                                 BOJAN
                        No foul. 

           Darko and Bojan high five. Another sip of kafa.

                                 MAK
                        How many of them can there be? 
                        Crazy nationalists. Seriously. Most 
                        are like us. All mixed in and just 
                        fine. Wouldn't change a thing. It's 
                        just a moment. 

                                 DARKO
                        Just a reaction to Bosnia going 
                        independent. That's all.

           Bojan doesn't look convinced.

                                 MAK
                        Would have been all over the news 
                        already. Right? 

                                 BOJAN
                        I mean, yeah. 
                             (beat)
                        Yeah. God. He's so crazy. He just 
                        freaks me out. All like 'Get your 
                        money out of the banks! Before it's 
                        too late!'

           Darko shakes his head.

           In the distance it sounds like FIRECRACKERS. SOME PEOPLE in 
           the cafe look up because it could just as easily be 
           AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE. The guys barely glance up.

                                 DARKO
                             (re: coffee)
                        Uf. Weak. 

           EXT. SARAJEVO STREET - DAY

           Regal concrete buildings lining the street suggest a long 
           and complicated history to this place. A charming tram 
           speeds through. Fashionable folks of all ages.

           Mak whistles a cheery tune as he tears off pieces of a 
           steaming pretzel and walks along a busy sidewalk. The pastry 
           is too hot to touch, let alone chew, but he just can't help 
           himself.

           A PRETTY WOMAN, 30s, pushes a FAT BABY in a stroller. The 
           Fat Baby holds a streamer which flutters in the wind.

           It distracts Mak from noticing a CONVOY OF SERBIAN ARMY 
           TRUCKS passing behind him. 

           It doesn't escape the attention of a few STUNNED BYSTANDERS. 

           INT. SARAJEVO - UNIVERSITY - CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Grungy melancholic freshmen take notes. 

           Mak scribbles equations on a giant chalkboard. In his 
           element.

                                 MAK
                        -we define a functional measuring 
                        the length of a curve between two 
                        points-

           He clears his throat when he speaks in public -a nervous 
           tick - as his hand deftly marks up the board. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        -which is to say the shortest 
                        distance between two points is, you 
                        got it, a straight line. 
           He draws a perfect vertical from one dot to another. Red 
           chalk dust swirls off the board like smoke. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        You just have to prove it. That's 
                        homework. 
                             (beat)
                        Now. Your exams.

           GROANS from the STUDENTS. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        No, I'm impressed. A few of you 
                        actually passed. 

           INT. SARAJEVO - UNIVERSITY - CLASSROOM - DAY - LATER

           The students file out of the room. Mak erases equations off 
           the board. Lost in thought.

           SEJO, 20s, a chubby and jovial student sidles up to Mak. 

                                 SEJO
                        Professor Mak.

           Mak jumps. 

                                 MAK
                        Shit. You almost gave me a heart 
                        attack.  

                                 SEJO
                        Sorry. 

                                 MAK
                        What's up? What do you need?

           Sejo waits until the last student shuffles out of the room. 
           Mak frowns.  

                                 SEJO
                        I'm only asking 'cause...you're 
                        Muslim, right? 

                                 MAK
                        If the next words out of your mouth 
                        are 'do you want to go to evening 
                        prayer with me', I will be very 
                        disappointed. 

                                 SEJO
                        No. I know you're not religious- 
                                 MAK
                        Correct. That's one more than you 
                        had on your exam.
                             (he makes a zero with his 
                             fingers)
                        Might do you some good to open your 
                        textbook every once in a while.  

                                 SEJO
                        Actually, I'm collecting donations. 

                                 MAK
                        OK... For what?

                                 SEJO
                        To buy firearms and hand them 
                        around. For our neighbourhood.

           Mak wipes the chalk dust off his hands. Not looking up.

                                 SEJO (CONT'D)
                        So we can protect ourselves. If it 
                        comes to that. I thought, since you 
                        live down the street from me, I 
                        thought-

                                 MAK
                        Sejo.

                                 SEJO
                        Yes?

                                 MAK
                        If we take up guns against each 
                        other, we all lose. 

           Sejo looks at him. Cocks his head. Confused. 

                                 SEJO
                        You can't be that blind. 

           Sejo leaves. Shaking his head.

           Mak turns back to the board. He blinks anxiously.  

           EXT. MAK'S HOUSE - DAY

           Mak pulls his black Alfa Romeo into a garage. Gets out. ACO, 
           30s, his next door neighbour, an intellectual always lugging 
           around books, is leaving his own house. They're separated by 
           a small fence. 
                                 ACO
                        Mak.

                                 MAK
                        Aco.

           Mak is about to shut the garage gate when...

                                 ACO
                        Mak. Offer still stands.

           Mak turns. There's a strange expression on Aco's face. Like 
           he's in pain.  

                                 ACO (CONT'D)
                        Just for a few days. Just until-

                                 MAK
                        No. No thanks. 
                             (beat)
                        Have a good night. 

                                 ACO
                        Yeah. You too. 

           Mak watches Aco scurry away to his car. 

           Mak looks up at the clouds. The dying light of day looks 
           almost supernatural. 

           In this private moment, Mak looks scared. 

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Pixelated lips. A hysterical LOCAL REPORTER is fired up 
           about something on the TV. 

           We see a shot of armed and bearded SERB SOLDIERS driving by 
           in an army truck throwing up THREE FINGERS and the SERB 
           FLAG. They chant "SERBIA! SERBIA!" but we can barely make it 
           out because...

           "Black Velvet" by Alannah Myles is BLASTING from the radio.

           JANA, 30s, highest highs to lowest lows in under 3.5, dances 
           and sings along in front of the TV. Not a care in the world.

           Her curly blonde hair whips around her face. Only one of her 
           eyes is heavily made up. She looks feral. 

                                 JANA
                        "Every word of every song that he 
                        sang was for you. In a flash he was 
                        gone, it happened so soon, what 
                        could you dooooo?"

           Her son IVAN, 5, a jump first think later kinda kid, dances 
           along like a boy with too much energy when he stumbles on an 
           acceptable outlet. 

           The song ends. Ivan claps. 

           Jana plops down into her chair like a diva after an 
           exhausting show and gets back to putting on eyeliner.

                                 IVAN
                        Where are you going?

                                 JANA
                        Concert. With your auntie. Wanna 
                        come?

                                 IVAN
                        No. I have plans. 

                                 JANA
                             (laughing)
                        Oh really?

           She tickles his cheeks with a make-up brush. He giggles.

           We hear a METAL GATE SQUEAL SHUT outside. Ivan peeks through 
           the window and then ricochets to the fridge. 

           He grabs a beer. Deftly POPS it open with an opener and 
           starts out.

                                 JANA
                        Nuh-uh-uh.

           Ivan runs back and pecks her on the cheek. She pretends to 
           maul him. 

                                 IVAN
                        Stop!

           He squirms out. But he loves it. 

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ivan tries to take a secret sip of the beer but it makes an 
           audible SLURP.

                                 JANA (O.S.)
                        Heard that.
           Ivan laughs his way into the next room.

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - MAK'S STUDY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           A controlled mess of 90s tech. Keyboards. Hard drives. 
           Screens. Cables. A giant PC. 

           Ivan puts the cold beer next to it an turns it on. It spits 
           out CLICKING and SCRATCHING noises foreign to kids born in 
           the 2000s. 

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Ivan bobs around impatiently in front of a frosted glass 
           door. A silhouette grows on the other side. The door swings 
           open. 

           Ivan's face lights up. It's Mak. Ivan jumps into his arms. 

                                 JANA (O.S.)
                        Hi! Just putting my face on.

                                 MAK
                        OK. 
                             (beat)
                        Battle stations? 

                                 IVAN
                        Battle stations!

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - MAK'S STUDY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ivan tries to climb into a swivel chair. Can't manage. Mak 
           pulls him up by the seat of his pants and plops him down on 
           his own lap. Ivan giggles and settles. 

           Mak clicks away on a mouse until a game appears on screen - 
           LEMMINGS. Ivan takes over the keyboard. 

           On the screen, the Lemmings take turns jumping over a spike 
           filled pit. 

           Mak looks at his son's reflection in the screen. Ivan's 
           mouth hangs open when he's concentrating.

           Mak grabs the beer. 

           He lays his forehead on the back on Ivan's head. Closes his 
           eyes. The 8bit video game soundtrack lulls us and him. 

           Jana pops into the room. She kisses the top of Mak's head. 
                                 JANA
                        You ok? 

           Mak nods.

                                 MAK
                        How was work?

                                 JANA
                        Fine. Barely anyone there. 
                        Everyone's taking time off. 

           Her words hang in the air. Mak is about to say something but 
           Jana kisses him again.

                                 JANA (CONT'D)
                        I'm late. Love you. 

           She dances away. The lights from the screen reflected on 
           Mak's face make him look a decade older. 

           EXT. MUJIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           Six inch heels and a mini skirt click their way to a 
           GRUMBLING red convertible. 

           INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

           ELECTRIC GUITARS and LONG ROCKER LOCKS, 30s, on a low key 
           stage. A full hall. The AUDIENCE screams along to a pop rock 
           tune. "A I Ti Me Iznevjeri" by Bijelo Dugme.   

           Jana dances with MIRA, 30s, her equally striking blonde 
           sister. They live for this. 

           We get swept away by their beauty and the really fucking 
           good music until...

           BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. 

           Jana strains to make out the muffled BOOMING noises from 
           somewhere outside the concert hall. 

           She looks up. The ornate chandelier trembles like Godzilla 
           is coming through.

           From Jana's POV we feel her immediate vertigo. People are 
           too close. Too fast. Too loud. But Mira is still dancing.

           Jana reaches for her wine glass and then sees the table 
           SHAKE. Then stop. Then SHAKE again. Harder. 
           Jana looks at Mira. Mira stares at the table too. 

           It's not just in Jana's head. This is happening. 

           The music stops. BAND MEMBERS look around. Confused.  

           One more BOOM! Loudest one. The chandelier shakes violently. 

           Jana stands there. Paralyzed.

           Mira grabs Jana's hand and pulls her through the crowd 
           towards the exit.

           As Mira pushes the doors open we catch a glimpse of the 
           night sky lit up by GLOWING PROJECTILES.

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - MAK'S STUDY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Mak stares out of the window. Breathing heavily. Either he 
           saw the projectiles too or some instinct is kicking in.

           He turns back to his son, still in his lap, but Ivan isn't 
           paying attention to the video game. He's looking at Mak's 
           face in the reflection of the screen. 

           Mak hugs his son a little tighter. Inhales this fleeting 
           moment of normal. 

           On the screen, the mindless Lemmings hurtle off a hill to 
           their death. One after another. 

           Huge captions read: SARAJEVO, 1992

           EXT. SARAJEVO HOLIDAY INN - DAY

           A sea of people. Marching men and women of all ages. A 
           HUNDRED THOUSAND PROTESTORS. They carry SIGNS: "Peace Now!", 
           "Free Bosnia" and the like. 

           BRUNETTE, 20s, porcelain skin and leather jacket, throws up 
           her HAND DRAWN PEACE SIGN. 

                                 BRUNETTE
                             (chants with the group)
                        Give peace a chance!

           BLONDE, 30s, crystal eyes and beat-up converse all-stars, 
           pumps her fist into the air. 

                                 BLONDE
                        We won't give up Sarajevo!
           Infectious smiles all around. More parade than protest. The 
           infamous Holiday Inn, a red and yellow monstrosity, looms 
           over the crowd like a giant misplaced Lego castle.  

           PHOTOGS scramble to get their shots. Through a CAMERA MAN's 
           lens, the crowd's rhythmic movements resemble a dance.

           An ANGRY ACTIVIST, 30s, flanked by protestors, pleads to the 
           camera.

                                 ANGRY ACTIVIST
                        Citizens of Sarajevo. Citizens of 
                        Bosnia. Get out on the streets. 
                        Help us stop this thing, this thing 
                        which can take us down in the dead 
                        of night-

           EXT. SARAJEVO HOLIDAY INN - VRBANJA BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The front row of fearless 90s bohemians start across the 
           scenic bridge towards the Inn. Among them are the Brunette 
           and the Blonde. 

                                 BRUNETTE
                        -those for peace! Muslim. Serb. 
                        Croat. If you walk with us you walk 
                        for Bosnia! Don't be afraid-

           The two women look directly into the Camera Man's lens, 
           directly at us. 

                                 BLONDE
                        -we can't let them tear down 
                        Sarajevo. Do. Not Be. Afraid. 

           CHANTS of "WE WON'T GIVE UP BOSNIA!" sync with rhythmic 
           CLAPPING.

           The two womens' magnetic gazes pull us in until-

           All sound is CUT OFF by a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. 

           The crowd ducks. Confused faces all around.  

           The women's eyes are still trained on us...

           The Brunette's pupils expand until they are pools of black. 
           The Blonde's eyes roll so far back all they leave is white. 

           Dark red blood. Streams down the Brunette's forehead. Gushes 
           out of the Blonde's chest. 

           The women fall towards each other in slow motion. Their 
           bodies hit the cement in unison with a wet THUD.

           All hell breaks loose. More GUN SHOTS. SCREAMS spread like a 
           virus. Shoes TRAMPLE discarded protest signs.

           The Camera Man's lens morphs as it zooms in. 

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - HOTEL ROOM 

           A FACELESS SNIPER with a SERB FLAG on his chest pocket 
           reloads in a window while POLICE OFFICERS return fire from 
           the ground.

           EXT. SARAJEVO - HILLS - NIGHT

           POWERFUL BLASTS. Distant GUN SHOTS.

           The glittering hills of Sarajevo are lit up by GLOWING 
           PROJECTILES arcing across the night's sky. There's so many.

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT  

           A night light in the shape of a sea shell. It bathes the 
           room in red light. Mattresses are up against the walls and 
           the glass door. Just in case.

           Mak sits on the floor, his back against a mattress, spooning 
           Jana from behind, who's spooning Ivan. Using their bodies as 
           shields. Just in case. 

           Every once in a while, MUFFLED GUNSHOTS from outside. 

           Mak and Jana stare into nothingness. Ivan is asleep.

                                 JANA
                        We have to...we have to get him 
                        out. I don't want him to-

                                 MAK
                        I know. I'm working on it. You'll 
                        go to your cousin's. Just until-

                                 JANA
                        What do you mean? What about you?

                                 MAK
                        I'll hold down the fort.
                             (beat)
                        This will stop. You'll be back home 
                        in a few days.
           Mak kisses Jana's neck as she stifles tears. Ivan's little 
           brown eyes open. He heard every word.

           EXT. MUJIC HOUSE - CRACK OF DAWN

           Morning sun shines through the leaves of a cherry tree. 

           Combat boots pace. Mak's neighbor, Aco, is antsy in a crisp 
           new uniform. The SERB FLAG on his chest pocket. 

           Aco opens the SQUEALING METAL GATE to Mak's house. He RINGS 
           the DOORBELL. 

           He wipes his boots on the doormat. He can't stop. He keeps 
           wiping the boots like the act will rip them off his feet.

           The door opens. Jana answers. Her face drops. She stares at 
           Aco's uniform.  

                                 JANA
                        What the hell, Aco?

                                 ACO
                        Mak here?

           Jana reaches for his cap. He backs away.

                                 ACO
                        ...please Jana. 

                                 JANA
                        Mak! 
                             (beat)
                        Tell that wife of yours to come 
                        over for coffee. Haven't seen her 
                        in days.

           Aco avoids eye contact. We hear MAK'S STEPS down the stairs.  
           Mak glances at Jana with a look that says "I got this". Jana 
           shakes her head as she goes upstairs. 

           Aco shoves an envelope into Mak's hand. 

                                 ACO
                        The tickets. Where's your car?

                                 MAK
                        Downtown by the university. I 
                        couldn't get it by the barricades-

                                 ACO
                        Airplane leaves in four hours. We 
                        have to go. Now.
           Mak swallows hard.

           INT. MUJIC HOUSE - IVAN'S ROOM - DAY

           We hear the adults YELLING through a door. On the door is a

           A BROWN BEAR IN A CAGE. 

                                 JANA (O.S.)
                        I can't! I'm not going without you. 
                        This is insane. 

                                 MAK (O.S.)
                        Shhhh. He'll hear you. Jana, the 
                        airport shuts down tonight.

           Ivan trembles in a baby crib he's clearly outgrown. He wears 
           'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle' pyjamas. 

           There's a LITTLE RED BACKPACK in the corner of the room.

           EXT. MUJIC HOUSE - DAY

           Aco fires up a red Renault.  

           Mak leads a raging Jana holding a crying Ivan into the 
           backseat of the car. Mak gets into the passenger seat 
           clutching the LITTLE RED BACKPACK.

           Car doors are SLAMMED shut. 

           INT. RED RENAULT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Aco speeds down a street of big stone houses.

           Through the windows, Mak and Jana watch a group of ARMED 
           SERB SOLDIERS barge into a neighbour's house. SCREAMS from 
           inside.

           Ivan digs his head into Jana's neck. Jana glares at Aco in 
           the rearview.

                                 JANA
                        Not in a million years.
                             (beat)
                        Who would have thought, Aco, that 
                        one day you'd throw me out of my 
                        home... 

           Aco blinks.
                                 MAK
                        Jana, he's helping us.

                                 JANA
                        -is this what you wanted, Aco? When 
                        you put on that uniform?

           A BMW erupts from of a driveway and almost hits Aco's car. 
           Aco swerves hard to avoid it and everyone is thrown to the 
           side.

                                 JANA
                        Oh my god.

           Ivan starts crying again. 

                                 ACO
                        Are you ok?

                                 IVAN
                        Mama, what's happening?

                                 JANA
                        Well, baby, once upon a time all 
                        kinds of people lived together in 
                        Sarajevo. Some Serbs, like Aco, 
                        others Croatians, like me, and some 
                        of them Muslims, like your dad. And 
                        we were happy. Very happy. But then 
                        some bad people made up a lie that 
                        we couldn't all live together in 
                        peace anymore. And they kept 
                        repeating this lie. And others 
                        started to believe it. And then... 
                        it became true.

           Ivan thinks hard.

                                 IVAN
                        Aco, do you believe it?

           Aco stumbles as he reaches for a walkie-talkie.

                                 ACO
                        Aco in the red Renault. Papers OK. 
                        Open her up. Over.

           As they round the corner they see a barricade. A giant 
           GLEAMING TANK blocks half the street. It's surreal. TWO SERB 
           SOLDIERS at the metal grate that blocks the other half. Not 
           budging. 

           Mak's jaw hangs open in disbelief. Jana blocks Ivan's eyes. 
           He moves her hand away to see.  
           We see the SARAJEVO UNIVERSITY BUILDING past the barricade. 

           A HUNGOVER SOLDIER sticks his hand out. Stop.

                                 ACO
                        Fuck...don't move. 

           The Hungover Soldier fists the car window. Everyone jumps. 

                                 HUNGOVER SOLDIER
                        A word. 

           Aco gets out of the car and walks the Hungover Soldier to 
           the tank. The two argue out of earshot. 

           The other SERB SOLDIERS glare at Mak. 

           Mak glares back. 

           Aco shuffles back to the car. Signals them to get out. 

           EXT. BARRICADE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mak helps Jana and Ivan out of the vehicle.

                                 ACO
                        Where's your car?

                                 MAK
                        Just down the block.

                                 ACO
                        Don't go left. You hear me? There's 
                        snipers in those buildings. Stick 
                        to the right side of the street. 
                        Go.

           With Jana out of earshot, Aco grabs Mak by the arm.

                                 ACO
                             (whispers)
                        They're making lists of Muslim 
                        names on our block... you're on it. 
                        Don't come back around 'til things 
                        settle. I won't be able to protect 
                        you.

           Mak turns to see the Hungover Soldier twist his fingers into 
           a gun and "shoot" at him. 

           Mak blinks. He turns back to Aco.
                                 MAK
                        They? You're one of them now Aco.

           Aco hangs his head and walks away.

           Mak takes Jana and Ivan by the hand. They start the long 
           walk. 

           They shuffle past the terrifyingly quiet SOLDIERS at the 
           barricade. 

           Baited breaths. Hearts beating. 

           Ivan peeks at the Soldiers. Their faces tattooed. Their eyes 
           filled with hate. Ivan hides behind Mak's arm. 

           ONE OF THE SOLDIERS loudly drags the grate along the ground. 
           Mak, Jana, and Ivan pass him. He drags the gate closed 
           behind them.

           No going back. They're out in the empty street. The car 
           suddenly feels like it's miles away. 

           The eyes of the soldiers pierce their backs. 

           Step by step the family inches closer to the other side when 
           suddenly-

           A small round object arcs across the sky and BOUNCES off a 
           nearby wall.

                                 JANA
                        What was-

           A GRENADE rolls to a stop in a bed of dandelions only steps 
           away from Ivan and Jana. Pin out. 

           Mak stares at it for a moment and then...

           In a split second, he pulls Jana and Ivan around the corner 
           of a building. 

           He drags them to the ground, covers them with his mass as a 
           DEAFENING EXPLOSION rips through concrete.

           The air is replaced by suffocating dust. 

           TINNITUS fills the soundscape but then morphs into the 
           SOLDIERS' LAUGHTER.

           A screaming Ivan escapes from Mak's grasp and runs down the 
           street, his pyjamas soiled. 

           He turns LEFT, the direction Aco told them not to go. 
                                 JANA
                        Ivan!

           Jana runs after him. 

           EXT. SARAJEVO STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           The world is in slow motion as Mak and Jana run after Ivan.

           Mak sees the cement behind Ivan's feet POPPING like it's 
           being torn up by heavy rain. BULLETS.

           Ivan throws his tiny frame into a wall and frantically tries 
           to scale it. 

           Mak snatches his son and whips around to grab Jana. 

           Running as fast as he can, he heaves them into a building 
           entrance.

           He reaches for the metal door but it's locked.

                                 JANA
                        Open the door! Someone! let us in!

           A windows in the building across the street swings open. An 
           OLD MAN emerges. 

           He BANGS together a COOKING POT and a FRYING PAN. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        You sons of bitches! What are you 
                        doing to our city you dirty sons of 
                        bitches!

           The dust starts to settle and the BANGING METAL reverberates 
           like a GONG. 

           Mak blinks. He spots his car - the black Alfa Romeo - right 
           in front of them. He blinks. Not a mirage.

           INT. MAK'S CAR - DAY

           Doors SLAM. Keys PIERCE the ignition. The tires SQUEAL as 
           the car speeds away from the cloud of dust.

           INT. MAK'S CAR - DAY - LATER

           Mak steadies his breath as he wipes the dust off his face. 
           In the passenger seat, Jana cradles Ivan in her lap. 
           Definition of shell-shocked. 
           Jana spots dark red marks on her house coat. 

           Blood.

           She frantically searches Ivan. Realizes his fingertips are 
           bleeding from clawing up the wall. 

           She holds his little palm in her hand. Looks at his guilty 
           face.

                                 IVAN
                        I peed myself. I'm sorry. 

           Jana wraps her arms around her child. She starts 
           hyperventilating. 

                                 MAK
                        Jana...

           Mak reaches for her but she pushes his hand away. 

                                 JANA (CONT'D)
                        No. No. No. No! No! NO!

           She starts wailing. Guttural. Involuntary. Rocking back and 
           forth as she sinks into a fugue state.   

           Ivan cups his ears. Jana can't help herself. Can't stop. 

           For a moment it seems like this is the 9th circle of hell 
           and then...

           Mak flips on the car radio. 

           He fiddles with the AM/FM dial until he lands on a station 
           halfway through "Moj Bijeli Labude" by Prljavo Kazaliste, a 
           bright pop tune.

           Jana's eyes pop open like she's been jerked awake from a 
           nightmare. She stops crying out. She stops rocking. She 
           listens. Her breathing calms. 

           She slowly extends a trembling hand and puts it in Mak's. He 
           grasps it. Tears stream down her face.

           Jana turns up the VOLUME dial until there are no GUNSHOTS 
           just the RASPY VOICE of the pop singer. 

           They drive.

           EXT. SARAJEVO AIRPORT - PARKING - DAY

           In slow motion, We follow, Jana, Mak, and Ivan wrapped 
           around his neck and facing us, as they run towards the 
           crowded terminal. 

           An AIRPLANE TAKES OFF in the distance. Soundless. 

           INT. SARAJEVO AIRPORT - MONTAGE - DAY

           IVAN'S DEEP BREATHS. Like they're coming from inside our 
           head. That's all we hear. 

           Ivan's tiny and bloody palm grips Mak's huge hand as they 
           trot through the terminal.

           Mak rummages through his coat for the envelope with the 
           tickets with his free hand. 

           Jana embraces a WOMAN, 40s, in a similar state of shock, 
           someone she knows from the city. 

           Desperate crowds are everywhere. Confusion. Crying WOMEN and 
           CHILDREN parting with FATHERS.

           Ivan sees everything and his grip on Mak gets a little 
           tighter. 

           An ARMED GUARD points them in the direction of their gate. 

           As they reach it they slow their pace but Ivan's BREATHS GET 
           FASTER.

           INT. SARAJEVO AIRPORT - GATE 4 - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Mak, Jana, and Ivan stare at the last of the passengers 
           disappear into the tunnel funnelling them to the army plane 
           visible just outside the building. 

           Mak finally turns to Jana. Forces a goofy smile. 

                                 MAK
                        Honey. A little underdressed don't 
                        you think? 

           She looks down at her blouse and house coat. She can't help 
           but laugh but then the laughter turns into tears.

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Everything will be ok. 

           She nods. Wanting to believe it.

                                 JANA
                        How could we not see this coming?
           Mak just shakes his head.

                                 SOLDIER 3
                        Tickets? You got tickets? You have 
                        to go through.

           Mak tries to release Ivan's grip. He won't let go. 

                                 IVAN
                        No. 

                                 MAK
                        Honey, it's ok. You're going on a 
                        big plane-

                                 IVAN
                        No. 

           Jana and Mak exchange a look. They know what they have to 
           do.  

                                 JANA
                        Mak. You have to get out. You can't 
                        stay here. Do you hear me?

           He kisses her. Quickly. Lovingly. Mak bends down and hugs 
           Ivan. Inhales the smell of his hair. 

                                 MAK
                             (he smiles; whispers)
                        Be brave. For me.  

           Ivan digs his bloody little nails into Mak's neck. He starts 
           screaming as Mak quickly peels him off and hands him to 
           Jana. It takes all her strength and the help of the SOLDIER 
           to pull Ivan away.

                                 IVAN
                        No! Mama. Tell him he has to come! 
                        Say it! Do something!

                                 MAK
                             (voice breaking)
                        I love you. I'll see you soon.

           Mak blinks. A LIGHTBULB POPS (O.S.)

           EXT. SARAJEVO AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Mak watches an airplane take off from the parking lot. 

           He exhales like he's been holding his breath for an 
           eternity.
           The airplane disappears into the clouds. 

           It suddenly hits him. Mak is alone. 

           He covers his mouth to stop himself from crying out. 

           Red scratches are visible on the back of his neck from 
           Ivan's nails. 

           The LITTLE RED BACKPACK still in his grasp.

           The SOUND of the AIRPLANE fades.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK

           SUPER: 1 YEAR LATER

           EXT. SARAJEVO - DAY

           The sun peeks over the familiar horizon. 

           We hear the sound of LOUD SNORING.

           No gunshots. No grenades. Just SNORING.

                                 MAK (V.O.)
                        Got one. Got a good one. 

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - APARTMENT - DAY 

           Sunken cheeks and hollow eyes. A rail thin man carries a 
           familiar round tray with ceramic cups, sugar cubes, and a 
           coffee pot. Takes us a moment to realize this shell of a 
           human is Mak. He's lost at least 50lbs. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Up. Up. Up. 

           Darko is passed out on the couch. He snores and cradles a 
           half empty bottle of home-made liquor. He looks like shit.

           Mak sets the tray on a table in front of him. Darko wakes 
           with a start.

                                 DARKO
                        Fuck you so peppy for? 

           Bojan comes out of another room. Still a star but visibly 
           dimmed. Mak throws him a pack of cigs. 

                                 BOJAN
                        It's Tuesday, Darko. 
                             (re: cigs)
                        Thanks professor. 

           Three skeletons huddle around. The coffee ritual hasn't 
           changed. Darko steals one of Bojan's cigs.

                                 MAK
                        So. On the frontlines, this soldier 
                        gets shot in the leg and he's 
                        screaming his head off. After a 
                        while, Mujo can't take it any 
                        longer. "Come on man, your leg gets 
                        grazed and you won't stop yelling, 
                        but that guy over there gets hit by 
                        a mortar and you don't hear a peep 
                        out of him."

           Mak flashes a toothy grin.

                                 BOJAN
                        Don't get it. 

                                 DARKO
                        The other guy is dead. 

                                 BOJAN
                             (laughing)
                        Shit.

           Bojan plops down a tiny bun on the tray. He tears it into 3 
           small pieces and gives one to each of the guys. They eat. 
           They sip.

                                 DARKO
                        Look at this mother fucking feast. 

                                 BOJAN
                        Dig in while you can. We're almost 
                        out of water. Everywhere. So no 
                        more bread in a matter of days.

                                 MAK
                        Peace is in the air. You'll see.

                                 DARKO
                             (laughs)
                        Another cease fire. Another fucking 
                        peace treaty. God, I miss cheese. 

           Another sip in unison. Bojan grabs his guitar. Starts 
           tuning.

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        There he fucking goes. If he plays 
                        the same fucking REM song again-

           Bojan plays strings from "Losing My Religion" by REM.

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        This son of a bitch will kill me 
                        before a sniper does.

                                 MAK
                        You wish.

           Darko cackles.

                                 BOJAN
                        Fuck you. They blew up the fucking 
                        cassette shop. I'm out of the loop.
                             (beat)
                        Ahhh they ruined the best years of 
                        my life man. 

                                 MAK
                        Keep strumming. Kids, I'm late.

                                 DARKO
                        Hope you got clean ones on. Slight 
                        chance of sniper rain out there. 

                                 MAK
                        Right back at you. Your turn to do 
                        a water run.

           And Mak is out the door. Bojan eyes the coffee cup in 
           Darko's hand. It trembles.

                                 DARKO
                        Another fucking peace treaty.
                             (beat)
                        Hear him talking to himself again 
                        last night?

           Bojan starts into "Losing My Religion". Darko's eyes glisten 
           as he watches the guitar strings vibrate. He taps his leg to 
           the beat. Takes another sip of the coffee. 

                                 DARKO
                        Uf. Weak. 

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Over the REM cover, we step towards a glass doorway at the 
           bottom of a staircase. Scarred by shelling but it holds.

           The scarred glass cuts the sun's rays into a brilliant 
           mosaic on the wall. We get closer and closer and...

           EXT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mak bursts out. His breaths are clouds in the crisp morning 
           air. 

           The balconies of the blue building he's staying in have 
           collapsed on top of one another. Like toppled dominoes. 

           It's so quiet.

           He looks left. He looks right. He trots away with his 
           suitcase above his head. Just in case.

           EXT. SARAJEVO - STREET - DAY

           The regal concrete buildings are pockmarked by shrapnel 
           holes. The streets are too. Vehicle carcasses litter the 
           street. Smoke rises from the charred tram. 

           But there are still people walking the streets. Hollow 
           faces. Skinny frames. But they're far from defeated.

           Mak passes the same PRETTY WOMAN he saw in town before. She 
           pushes that same stroller, but now there are two water 
           canisters in it instead of a child.

           GUNSHOTS in the distance. 

           An OLD WOMAN is too tired to quicken her pace. Mak and a few 
           others break into a run.

           Mak sneaks around with practiced stealth. He's done this 
           route countless times:

           - He pushes aside a loose board in a wooden fence and sneaks 
           through an overgrown backyard. A ROTTWEILER lunges at him 
           but gets pulled back at the last moment by the chain around 
           its neck. Mak throws him a tiny piece of bread and keeps 
           going.

           - Mak runs into a makeshift tunnel in the side of a blown 
           out building. He WHISTLES as he makes his way through the 
           pitch black darkness. CHATTER ECHOES in the distance. 

           - We're blinded by light as Mak emerges on the other side of 
           the tunnel. As his eyes adjust he sees a familiar cardboard 
           sign taped to a street lamp with "WATCH OUT FOR SNIPER" 
           written in black marker.

           - Mak waits in a cursory line-up at the corner of a 
           building. Some of the BYSTANDERS MAKE SMALLTALK. One by one 
           they take turns running across an exposed street. We hear 
           BULLETS WHIZZING BY. They casually nod and wave before their 
           turn. Then break into a run. 

           - We're with Mak as he runs across with his suitcase over 
           his head. BULLETS ZIP PAST every now and then.

           - Mak hides behind a car abandoned in the middle of the 
           street to catch his breath. 

           - Mak sprints by his old University building. Half of it 
           blown to pieces. He glances at it but he keeps going.

           - He dives into the blown out entrance of an APARTMENT 
           BUILDING and disappears into the dark basement. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - BASEMENT CLASSROOM - DAY

           Harsh halogens. A smattering of light pours in through two 
           small windows near the top of one wall. One is covered with 
           a fluttering plastic sheet. 

                                 AMELA (O.S.)
                        They said it would never happen 
                        again. After world war two. Well. 
                        It's happening.

           Mak stands in front of a cracked chalkboard. Listening. 

                                 IBRO (O.S.)
                        That's crazy. You can't compare.

           The classroom is made up of just SIX STUDENTS. As skinny and 
           pale as Mak. They listening to AMELA, 20s, outspoken but 
           overly activated, argue with IBRO, 20s, a self-proclaimed 
           realist. 

                                 AMELA
                        Sarajevo is a giant concentration 
                        camp. They're cleansing "their" 
                        land of Bosnian muslims like us. 
                        This is a genocide. 

                                 IBRO
                        Picking us off one by one from the 
                        hills isn't exactly efficient. 
                        Where are the gas chambers?

                                 AMELA
                        There are mass graves out in the 
                        villages. It's true. You can't 
                        trust what the TV tells us anymore.
                                 IBRO
                        The TV is telling the world what's 
                        happening here. It's just... 
                        complicated.

                                 AMELA
                        So the world does fuck all.

                                 MIRSADA
                        Maybe if they did something, they 
                        would have to admit it. 

           MIRSADA, 20s, an exhausted redhead, pipes in.  

                                 IBRO
                        What?

                                 MIRSADA  
                        That it's happening again. 
                        Genocide. And if it's happening 
                        again here... why couldn't it 
                        happen in one of their cities? 

                                 AMELA
                        OK. Great. Help is never coming. 
                        Why are we still here? 

           ANA, 20s, too cool for school, lights up a cigarette. 

                                 ANA
                        Said it yourself, honey. Unless you 
                        can score a Blue Card, the only way 
                        out of Sarajevo is in a body bag. 

           Amela breaks down. She hides her face on the makeshift 
           school desk like a hurt child.  

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        I was just summarizing. 

                                 AMELA 
                        Fuck you Ana...

           Mak walks over to Amela. He crouches down so he's eye level. 
           He lightly squeezes her arm.  

                                 MAK
                        Good question. Why are we still 
                        here?

           After a few moments, she looks up. She shakes her head. 

                                 AMELA
                        We don't have a choice. 
                                 MAK
                        We do. We can't leave but...we can 
                        fight. In our own way. I'd rather 
                        die than pick up a gun but getting 
                        to class in one piece and teaching? 
                        For me, that's fighting. Knowing 
                        that all of you might learn 
                        something in here despite what's 
                        happening out there? That's 
                        fighting. Not letting them get-
                             (he taps his temple)
                        That's victory. That's why I've 
                        kept coming here for the last year. 

                                 AMELA
                        I can't do this much longer. 

                                 MAK
                        Honestly? Me neither. But how much 
                        longer can this go on? 
                             (beat)
                        So, I'm gonna need you to hold on 
                        for just 55 minutes. Because 
                        today...we're learning about 
                        fractals. 

           He puts on a big smile. Amela almost cracks a smile. 

                                 ANA
                        Well aren't you a ray of sunshine 
                        today, professor. 

                                 MAK
                        Ana, cigarette out.

           She puts it out with a dramatic exhale just as a LATE 
           STUDENT, 20s, pops into class. 

                                 LATE STUDENT
                        Sorry.

           He sits in an empty desk. 

                                 MAK
                        People. Come on. Sniper get you?

                                 LATE STUDENT 
                        No, but-

                                 MAK
                        Then you don't have a very good 
                        reason to be late for my class. I'm 
                        marking you down. 
           He's dead serious. The students giggle. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Notebooks open!

           And they hop to it, forgetting for a moment to fear anything 
           but Professor Mak. 

           EXT. BAKERY - DAY

           Thirty people stand in line up at a bakery. The hot noon sun 
           is out. Some of the women fan themselves. Mak runs by and 
           waves to Bojan, who's working the till. 

                                 MAK
                        I'm calling Jana. I'll see you in a 
                        minute. 

           Bojan throws up a peace sign. Mak slips into the entrance 
           right next to Bojan's bakery. 

           INT. MIKI'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           A BUZZER.

           MIKI, 40s, a rail thin ex-rocker with polaroid sunglasses 
           answers the door. Mak is at the door. Miki bearhugs him. 

                                 MIKI
                        My man. How are you?

                                 MAK
                        Good Miki, good. How's it going?

           INT. MIKI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           In the corner of the room is a amateur radio set up.

           There's a NAKED WOMAN, 30s, in Miki's bed. Miki grabs a 
           blanket and covers her sleeping body. 

                                 MIKI
                        Sorry, I forgot it was Tuesday. 
                        S'Ok. She'll sleep through 
                        anything. Come on.

           He waves him over. They sit down in front of the ham radio 
           set up. Mak puts on headphones. Miki rubs his forehead.

                                 MAK
                        Hungover?
                                 MIKI
                        Nah. Nah. Well, yeah, I am. Lady 
                        can't drink.

           A knowing smile spreads on Miki's face. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Wait...are you... She's pregnant?

                                 MIKI
                        You're not gonna be the only proud 
                        tata around here.

                                 MAK
                        Miki, holy shit! Congratulations.

           They hug again and after a few moments go silent. Unspoken 
           words ring loud. 

                                 MIKI
                        I don't know. We'll figure it out. 
                        We always do, right? 

                                 MAK
                        And all this shit will end before 
                        the little one comes. Has to.

           Mak nods. Miki puts on his headphones and fiddles with the 
           radio controls.

           Mak's heart races. He wipes his sweaty palms against his 
           jeans. He fixes his hair like he's actually gonna see his 
           family. 

                                 MIKI
                        You look like shit. 

                                 MAK
                        Fuck you.

           Mak shoots up. 

                                 MIKI
                        We're here. Miki here. Hello from 
                        Sarajevo. Over. 

                                 HAM RADIO GUY (V.O.)
                        Hello from Zagreb. Is Mak around? 
                        There's a little guy here that's 
                        excited to speak to him.

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                             (muffled)
                        That's me!

                                 MAK
                        Yes! I'm here! I'm here. 

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        -ello tata-

           Like heroin seeping into the veins of an addict. 

                                 MAK
                        Oh my god. Hi. Hello my baby! How 
                        are you?

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        I'm fine! Guess what? Our 
                        neighbours got a dog. His name is 
                        Momo and I was playing with him.

                                 MAK
                        That's great. 

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        Can I get a dog? When I come home?

                                 MAK
                        Yes. Definitely.

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        A german shepard? He'll be a dog 
                        cop like in that movie. 

                                 MAK
                        Perfect.

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        We went shopping for school clothes 
                        yesterday. 
           A beat.

                                 MAK
                        You what? 

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        I wish you could take me on my 
                        first day. I'm a little nervous. 

           Sadness spreads across Mak's face. 

                                 MAK
                        Listen buddy...

           And in that moment an EXPLOSION rocks the apartment. 

           The window SHATTERS and sends glass FLYING.

           The ham radio set is ripped out of the wall.

           Mak is stunned.

           A moment of silence. As the rush of adrenaline slows down 
           his world, Mak watches specks of dust dance in the light.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Miki! Miki! Miki!

                                 MIKI (O.S.)
                        I'm here. Stay down!

           Miki looks over and sees Mak still sitting in his chair. In 
           shock. Cuts all over his face. 

                                 MIKI
                        Get down! They come in threes!

           Mak snaps out of it. He drops to the ground and like 
           clockwork, TWO MORE BOMBS EXPLODE outside the building 
           rocking it to its core. 

           A moment of silence and then the sounds start pouring in 
           from outside: SCREAMING and MOANING. 

           Mak stumbles to the door. 

                                 MAK
                        We have to help!

           He turns and sees Miki holding his girlfriend's stomach. 
           They stare up at him. Miki shakes his head. 
           EXT. BAKERY - DAY

           Mak erupts out of the building and into a new level of hell.

           The streets are red with rivulets of blood. 

           PEOPLE from the bakery line with their legs and arms blown 
           off. 

           Those who are able carry bodies of the wounded into awaiting 
           CARS.  

           Mak drops to his knees and holds back the vomit at the back 
           of his throat. 

           And then he sees him. 

           Bojan.

           Slouched against a wall. Surprise imprinted on his face. 
           Half of Bojan's skull is missing. The glistening pink matter 
           underneath is visible. Pulsating. Blood splattered on the 
           pock marked brick behind him. On his apron. 

                                 BOJAN
                        Mak?

           The words come so casually, like a greeting. Mak takes off 
           his shirt and wraps it around Bojan's head. 

                                 MAK
                        Holy fucking...

                                 BOJAN (CONT'D)
                        Did you talk to Ivan? 

           Mak throws Bojan's arm around around his shoulders and 
           carries him into the street. 

                                 MAK
                        Heeeeeelp! 

           A JOURNALIST with a camera appears. His lens trained on Mak 
           as he helps Bojan. 

           Mak flags down a blue Volkswagen. The DRIVER, 60s, a man 
           with kind eyes, helps put Bojan into the backseat.

                                 DRIVER
                        Ah shit. Got him good.

           You hear the CAMERA LENS SHUTTER. It's totally surreal. Mak 
           stumbles in after Bojan. The car speeds off.
           The Journalist's lens morphs as it zooms in again.

           INT. BLUE VOLKSWAGEN - DAY 

           Mak steadies Bojan's head in his lap. Bojan eyes start 
           rolling into the back of his head. Mak slaps him. 

                                 MAK
                        No! Eyes on the prize. 

           Bojan's eyes flutter open again but he can't focus. Mak's 
           hands are covered with blood. He pulls up Bojan's shirt and 
           sees the countless shrapnel holes. 

                                 MAK
                        Oh god. Oh my god. Faster! We have 
                        to go faster!

           The DRIVER steps on it. 

                                 DRIVER
                        I'm going! I'm going!

           Mak spots a LITTLE CARTOON WOLF FIGURINE bounce from the 
           rearview mirror. Big smiling snout. VUCKO THE WOLF. He holds 
           the FIVE OLYMPIC RINGS in his hands.

           Mak looks down at Bojan's grey face. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Remember that one night during the 
                        olympics? Remember? After Jure won 
                        his silver and we got so fucking 
                        drunk?

           Bojan stares up at Mak.

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, you remember. Snow was 
                        falling and we were on the hill and 
                        every single fucking person we knew 
                        was around us. Dancing. Remember 
                        what you told me?

           Bojan blinks. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        You said you're not getting off 
                        this planet until you play a show 
                        for a stadium full of people. Guess 
                        what? You can't go yet. 

           No response from Bojan. Mak looks up to see Vucko the Wolf 
           again. His smiling snout looks more sinister with every 
           bounce. 

                                 MAK
                        Faster!!!

           INT. HOSPITAL - ER - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Mak pulls Bojan through the sliding door. The Volkswagen 
           drives off in the background. 

           An EXHAUSTED NURSE, 40s, appears and grabs a MALE AIDE, 40s.

                                 EXHAUSTED NURSE
                        We got another one!

                                 MAK
                        Darko! He works here. Dr. Darko 
                        Simic? Can you please find him? He 
                        can help my friend. 

                                 EXHAUSTED NURSE
                        Patient's name?

                                 MAK
                        Bojan.

                                 MALE AIDE
                        Bojan what?

                                 MAK
                        Bojan Vucevic. 

           A beat. The Male Aide and the Exhausted Nurse exchange a 
           glance. They put Bojan on a stretcher.

                                 EXHAUSTED NURSE
                        Have you been hit? 

                                 MAK
                        I don't know. No? No, I'm fine. 

                                 EXHAUSTED NURSE
                        Through there. We need all we can 
                        get.

           The Nurse and the Aide push an unconscious Bojan into the 
           ER.

                                 MAK
                             (to Bojan)
                        I'm right here! Don't ruin my 
                        fucking Tuesday, you hear me?
           INT. HOSPITAL - BLOOD DONATION ROOM - DAY

           A needle pierces skin. 

           Blood runs through a clear tube. 

           Mak stares at the blood being drained from his vein. He's 
           pale as death. 

           The PATIENTS' MOANS mix with the SOUND OF GUNFIRE outside.

           From Mak's POV, the room is spinning. Blood is dripping into 
           the collection bag. 

           Mak hears a CHILD'S LAUGH. 

           He turns to look for the source. 

           Mak hallucinates IVAN RUN ACROSS THE HALLWAY with a LITTLE 
           RED BACKPACK on. His FEET SMACKING the floor and his arms 
           out like he's an airplane. In a flash he's out of sight. 

                                 MAK
                        Don't go...

                                 MALE NURSE
                        Alright. That's enough.

           The blood collection bag is almost full. The Male Nurse 
           pulls the needle out of Mak's arm.

           Even blinking takes effort.

                                 MAK
                        How is he?

           But the Nurse is already tending to another DONATION. 

           Mak wavers as he gets up. Between the blood loss and shock 
           he has to concentrate hard not to topple over.  

           INT. HOSPITAL - ER - WAITING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           No one in the waiting room.

                                 MAK
                        Hello...

           Mak pushes through the ER entrance. 
           INT. HOSPITAL - ER - MAIN AREA - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Countless stretchers with PATIENTS in various states of life 
           and death are lined against the peeling beige walls. 

           In a darkened corner, Mak sees Bojan slumped on his side in 
           a stretcher, looking back at him. Mak lights up. 

                                 MAK
                        Hey, Bobo.

           As Mak gets closer, he realizes that Bojan is staring past 
           him. No life in his eyes. Mak grabs Bojan's hand. Shakes 
           him. Nothing. 

           Mak drops to the floor. 

                                 DARKO (O.S.)
                        Why'd you tell them his name?

           Darko, in his white lab coat, splattered with red, appears 
           behind him. His face is soaked with tears.  

                                 MAK
                        What?

                                 DARKO
                        Serbs go to the back of the line.

           Mak turns to look at Darko. Fire in his eyes.

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        You know that. I told you what 
                        happens here. I fucking told you. 

           Darko lunges at Mak. They scuffles for a moment until Mak 
           punches Darko in the gut. Hard. Darko slides down the wall. 

                                 MAK
                        What is wrong with you? I would 
                        have never... Don't put this on me. 

           Darko hangs his head in shame. Tries to catch his breath.

                                 DARKO
                        Doesn't fucking matter. We wouldn't 
                        have been able to save him anyway.  

           Mak turns back to Bojan. His hand trembles as he closes 
           Bojan's eyes. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        I...I wasn't...I couldn't...I'm... 
                        sorry. Oh God. I'm so sorry, Bobo.
           Mak breaks down. He sobs into Bojan's shirt. After a few 
           moments Darko pulls him away. 

           EXT. SARAJEVO - MILJACKA WALKWAY - DAY 

           CRACK of THUNDER. Or a GRENADE BLAST? 

           Mak trudges down on one side of Miljacka, the thin river 
           that runs through the city. The walkway and bridges that 
           connect the two sides look almost gothic. 

           Mak is dirty. bloody. He moves like a zombie. 

           Darko, still in his lab coat, is singing and crying. Bottle 
           in hand. Drunk. 

           He bellows "Strah me da te volim" by Hari Mata Hari. 

           Darko launches the empty glass bottle. It hits the other 
           side of the embankment and SHATTERS. 

                                 DARKO
                        Peace talks. Poof. 

           Mak says nothing.  

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        We ran out of pain killers, and 
                        everything else you find in a 
                        hospital, days ago. We waited for a 
                        shipment from the UN. But no. I was 
                        walking down those hallways...just 
                        cutting off limbs. Cut. Cauterize. 
                        Next. Again and again. And...then I 
                        saw him. His eyes. 
                             (beat)
                        Killed by his own.

                                 MAK
                        He was one of us. 

           Darko trips and falls to the ground. He curls up into the 
           fetal position and just lies there. 

                                 MAK
                        Get up. 

           We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER. A bunch of NEIGHBOURHOOD KIDS 
           are "playing war" on the other side of the river. The game 
           is so precise it makes your stomach turn. Only kids that 
           have seen war first hand can make it so specific. It's like 
           they're re-enacting the massacre Mak just experienced.
           The sight makes Mak recoil.

           Another kid has a RED BACKPACK ON. He turns. For a moment 
           it's Ivan's face. He looks so scared. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        This isn't gonna end.

                                 DARKO
                        No shit.

           Mak's eyes widen as the realization lands. His hands curl 
           into fists. He nods at Ivan. Ivan smiles back. 

           A blink. He's gone. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Get up. You piss yourself?

                                 DARKO
                        No...

           He looks down. Sees the stain.

                                 DARKO
                        Yeah, I did. 

           Darko looks up at Mak. 

                                 MAK
                        Time to go. 

           In Mak's eyes we see something between resolve and madness.

           The kids keep playing war. 

           INT. SHELLED BUILDING - NIGHT

           Mak lies wide awake in his bed. The SOUND of the GRENADES 
           gets LOUDER and CLOSER but he doesn't flinch. 

           And we spin into his eyes the EXPLOSIONS transforms into 
           DRUMS. They POUND and we push into his irises until we 
           finally hear the BULL HORN.

           Mak doesn't blink.

           EXT. SARAJEVO - HILLS - NIGHT

           The glittering hills of Sarajevo are covered in twinkling 
           lights. In an EXHALE about half of them go out as different 
           parts of the city lose electricity.
           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Ten CONTESTANTS, 20s, a touch too skinny but undeniably 
           striking young women, rehearse for a beauty pageant.

           They walk the makeshift catwalk in oh-so-90s evening wear. 
           One by one. No music. Each step makes a CREAKING SOUND as 
           they walk to the edge for a turn. A fight in their eyes. 
           Chic as fuck. 

           A sign hangs on the draped velvet wall behind them - "MISS 
           SIEGE OF SARAJEVO '93"

                                 PAGEANT DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Neda, slow down. 

           Rows of plastic folding chairs. In the first row, the 
           PAGEANT DIRECTOR, 50s, a fashionista with a streak of silver 
           in her jet black mane dissects the girls with her BEAUTY 
           TEAM. 

           In the last row sits Aco. A cigarette that needs ashing 
           burns away between his fingers. A year hasn't changed him 
           much. Except he wears a different uniform now. A BLUE AND 
           YELLOW SHIELD on his jacket. A symbol of the ARMY OF BOSNIA 
           AND HERZEGOVINA.  

           Mak creeps into the auditorium. His face lights up when he 
           sees the girls. He's cleaned up but the cuts from the 
           explosion still mark his face. He sits next to Aco. Aco 
           preemptively shushes him. 

           They watch a lithe blonde, 17, her sash bears the name INELA 
           NOGIC. Walk. Kill with a look. Turn. 

                                 ACO
                        That's our winner right there. I'd 
                        put money on it. I will put money 
                        on it. 

                                 MAK
                        What's all this?

                                 ACO
                        Beauty over bullets. What's it look 
                        like? Rebellion!

                                 MAK
                        Wow...bet you're glad you switched 
                        sides. 

                                 ACO
                        I'm on the losing team and I've 
                        never been happier...Some of our 
                        girls organized it.  

           Aco flashes a pervy smirk.

                                 MAK
                        War looks good on you.

                                 ACO (CONT'D)
                        You little shit. What can I say? 
                        Thick skin. Not thick enough to be 
                        a Serb Chetnik but still. 
                             (beat)
                        You ok?

                                 MAK
                        No. 
                             (beat)
                        I want out of here. Can you get me 
                        a blue card? 

           Aco looks at him. Exhales loudly. 

                                 ACO
                             (re: pageant)
                        Why do you think I wanted you to 
                        see this?

           Mak frowns. He's clearly confused. 

                                 ACO (CONT'D)
                        Thought you should get in a preview 
                        since you won't get to enjoy the 
                        big show.

                                 MAK
                        ...no you didn't.

                                 ACO
                        I did. 
                             (beat)
                        You're blowing this joint. 

           Mak blinks. Processing. Pushing back tears. 

                                 MAK
                        I don't even know what to say. 

                                 ACO
                        Nothing. I owe you. I owe this 
                        city.

                                 MAK
                        You don't owe me shit. 
                                 ACO
                        I do. For not despising me. I've 
                        been working on getting you papers 
                        for a while. They'll be done any 
                        day now.
                             (beat)
                        I heard about Bojan.

           Mak watches the empty stage.

                                 MAK
                        You ever watch news reports about 
                        wildfires?

           Aco frowns. Confused. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        These people...they know it's 
                        coming. Right? They see it. They 
                        have time to escape. But they don't 
                        do shit until the flames are 
                        licking their doorstep. Clutching a 
                        bag of things they threw together 
                        at the last second. They run. 
                        Finally. I used to wonder the hell 
                        were they thinking? I thought I'd 
                        be smarter but...this is my home. 

           He laughs at himself. The CLICKING of HEELS cuts them off. 
           "Eve of Destruction" by  Barry McGuire comes on. 

           On the makeshift stage the Contestants saunter back out for 
           the bathing suit section of the show. One line. Single file. 
           Pageant smiles. Lean legs. Glimmering suits. 

           They carry a long banner. When the last girl is up we see it 
           reads "PLEASE DON'T KILL US".

           Mak has to turn from the sight.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - BASEMENT CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mak is back in front of the cracked chalk board once again. 
           Writing something down. 

                                 MAK
                        Who hasn't solved yet? Amela? 
                        Amela-

           Mak turns to give the chalk over to Amela but her table is 
           empty. Only 3 students today. 
                                 MAK
                        ...is not here either. Right. 
                        Anyone heard from her?

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        She ran across the runway, 
                        professor. 

           Everyone turns to Ana. 

                                 ANA
                        UN took over the airport so people 
                        are escaping on foot through the 
                        only gap in the serb noose on the 
                        city. 

                                 MAK
                        And?

           Ibro shrugs. 

                                 IBRO
                        Who knows. Snipers pick off the 
                        runners. It's Russian roulette.  

           Mak falls back in his chair like the air was knocked out of 
           him. 

           The students exchange glances. Ana reaches into her bag and 
           pulls out a pack of cigs. Pulls two out. 

           She gets up and leans on Mak's desk. She puts both cigs into 
           her mouth and lights them at once. 

           Before Mak has time to react she puts one of the lit cigs 
           between his lips. Mak frowns.

                                 ANA
                        For good luck. 

           Mak takes a drag. They smoke. 

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        Say hi to Ivan for me. 

           Mak's eyes drift to the floor. Ashamed. 

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        Don't feel bad, professor. At some 
                        point all of us have to run. To 
                        survive.  

           Mirsada hums a sad song as she stares off into the distance.  
           Ana kisses Mak on the cheek. 

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        Thank you. We couldn't have made it 
                        this far without you.

           Mak closes his eyes. 

           INT. ACO'S OFFICE - DAY

           Aco's hand, with a cigar between two fingers, slowly pushes 
           Mak's BLUE CARD across a mahogany desk. 

                                 ACO
                        Tomorrow. UNPROFOR will take you 
                        from here to the airport. You'll 
                        take one of their cargo jets out. 
                        Easy as pie. 

           Mak's hand slides the blue card off the desk. 

           INT. MIKI'S APARTMENT - DAY

           The windows are boarded up with wood planks but some 
           sunlight shines through. 

           Mak has headphones on. Miki is beside him.  

                                 JANA (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 MAK
                        Hi love. 

                                 JANA (V.O.)
                             (already crying)
                        Hi.

                                 MAK
                        It's ok. I'm ok. How are you?

                                 JANA
                        I'm alright. I guess. I don't know. 
                        Working. Watching the news when I'm 
                        not. Praying for this to end so I 
                        can get a night of sleep... I miss 
                        you.  

                                 MAK
                        How's my son?
                                 JANA
                        He's good. Always talking about 
                        you. He's grown, Mak. I didn't want 
                        to hold him back. You know, from 
                        school. Who would have thought 
                        that... It's not cheap. Not sure 
                        how we'll afford it. They're 
                        cutting my shifts at the agency. 
                        God. I don't even know what I'm 
                        talking about. I'm sorry. Your 
                        voice. 

                                 MAK
                        Jana, I wanted to ask you 
                        something. 

           Miki slaps Mak's leg in anticipation like he's about to drop 
           the punchline of a joke.

                                 JANA
                        What?

                                 MAK
                        Would you mind if I took him to 
                        school on his first day?

           A long beat. 

                                 JANA
                        Wait...what? Are...Are you-

                                 MAK
                        I'm getting out, Jana. 

           Another beat followed by a SCREAM OF JOY from Jana that's so 
           loud Mak has to take his headphones off for a moment.

           Miki jumps up. 

                                 MIKI
                        Goooooooooaaaaal!

           Mak and Miki laugh. Miki slaps Mak on the back. 

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - NIGHT

           A red ember in the dark flickers like a firefly. Mak and 
           Darko sit together in the dark. The light from Darko's 
           cigarette is the only light in the room.

           Darko gets up. Rummages around and comes back with a plastic 
           bag. He hands it to Mak. 
           Mak pulls out a clean pair of underwear. Laughs.

                                 DARKO
                        Mujo and Haso are coming home from 
                        work and Mujo goes: "I can't wait 
                        to get home and rip off my wife's 
                        panties." Haso rolls his eyes at 
                        him "You can't be that horny." Mujo 
                        goes "No, they're pinching the shit 
                        outta my balls."

           Mak grins. Darko stares at the wall.

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        Uf, wish I could hear that REM song 
                        now. 

                                 MAK
                        You sure you don't wanna come with 
                        me? We could talk to Aco-

                                 DARKO  
                        Nah. you know how my boss gets. 
                        Fucking muslims. 

           Mak smiles. Shakes his head.

                                 MAK
                        Fucking croat.

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        Don't know what I'm more scared of. 
                        Leaving or staying. You know I get 
                        more anxious now when I don't hear 
                        shelling. Fucked up. 
                             (beat)
                        We need to celebrate your escape! 
                        Can't stay in this fucking 
                        apartment tonight. Too depressing. 
                        You know, heard there was a little 
                        get-together happening, a party in 
                        the building over. They got 
                        electricity. 

                                 MAK
                        You serious?

                                 DARKO
                        Yes, I'm serious. I'm a serious 
                        person. Let's get drunk. 

           Off Mak. Thinking about the offer.
           EXT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - NIGHT

           We see a silhouette of two men run across the street like 
           teenagers sneaking out. 

           INT. BUILDING BASEMENT - STAIRS - NIGHT 

           Mak and Darko brush past a COUPLE, 30s, making out in the 
           staircase. A MUFFLED ROCK SONG reverberates through the 
           concrete walls.

           INT. BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           A MAN'S HAND picks the strings on a guitar. A makeshift 
           spotlight shines on the SINGER, 20s, his long hair covering 
           his face. Ray bans and tattered flannel. 90s grunge. 

           The crowd is bigger than you'd expect. More hip than you'd 
           expect. At least here the nihilism is more than an affect. 
           It's all surprisingly normal.   

           Mak, clearly a little drunk, turns to see Bojan with a drink 
           in his hand chatting up a SOMBER REDHEAD, 30s. 

           The SINGER leans into the mike. His hair covers his face. 
           All we see are his lips. He starts in on "Ima Nesto od Srca 
           do Srca" by Crvena Jabuka.

           He sounds almost like Bojan.

           Mak is enthralled. He glances over to Darko. Darko raises 
           his glass to Mak. 

           Mak turns back to the Singer. He starts tapping his foot to 
           the rhythm. He smiles.

           The Singer's lips curl into a grin. 

           Mak raises his glass to him. 

           The song continues but we're out of time as...

           INT. BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT - LATER

           We see a drunk Mak and Darko at the peak of the night, 
           jumping up and down with the crowd. Crazed. 

           EXT. SARAJEVO - DAY

           Silence. A few gun shots. The sun rears over the familiar 
           Sarajevo hills. 

           SNORING

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - DAY 

           Mak peeks out of the slits in the boarded-up window.

           Darko is passed out on the couch. Hugging the Redhead he met 
           last night. They're both SNORING. 

           Mak finishes packing some PHOTO ALBUMS and the LITTLE RED 
           BACKPACK into a suitcase. Zips it up. 

           He stands and watches the sleeping couple. Rubs his temples. 
           Overdid it last night.

           He turns to leave. He kisses the door frame.

           EXT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - DAY

           An ARMORED UNPROFOR TRANSPORTER, almost futuristic looking 
           if it wasn't for the matte beige paint job, idles outside of 
           the entrance to Mak's building. 

           CHRISTOPHE, 30s, a french soldier, patrols the outside of 
           the van, an AK-47 slung on his shoulder, while ANOTHER 
           SOLDIER, 20s, yawns away in the driver's seat.

           Mak runs out of the building entrance. 

           Christophe instinctively points his weapon at him. Mak's 
           hands shoot up.

                                 MAK
                        Whoa!

                                 CHRISTOPHE
                        Mak Mujic?

                                 MAK
                        That's me. Yes. 

                                 CHRISTOPHE
                        Ah oui? Sorry. OK, let's go now. 

           Christophe opens the door to the Transporter. A smile on his 
           rosy cheeks. Mak slowly puts his hands down. 

                                 CHRISTOPHE (CONT'D)
                        Ah, blue card?
           Mak produces the blue card from his jacket and hands it to 
           Christophe. Christophe quickly checks it and pockets it. All 
           good.  

           Mak climbs inside. Christophe shuts the heavy metal door.   

           INT. UNPROFOR TRANSPORTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Mak comes face to face with AMIR, 60s, a clean cut 
           politician in an expensive navy suit with wire framed 
           glasses that hang too low on his nose.  

                                 AMIR
                        Hey. 

           Mak holds for moment, surprised to see another passenger.

           The inside of the transporter looks like a metal waiting 
           room. Small windows, rusted compartments, weird netting, 
           metal benches. The divider to the driver's section is shut.

           Mak sits down on the adjacent bench at the back of the 
           transporter. He puts his suitcase down.

                                 MAK
                        Hey.

                                 AMIR
                        Business trip?

                                 MAK
                        Not really.

                                 AMIR
                             (with a smile)
                        A vacation then? 

           Mak smiles and nods. Unsure. The transporter lurches 
           forward. Mak grabs onto a ledge beside him. Amir is not 
           thrown off-balance.

                                 AMIR
                        I've done this route plenty of 
                        times. You have nothing to worry 
                        about. Kick back.  

           Amir throws Mak a smile you'd vote for. Mak takes off his 
           jacket. Settles in.

                                 AMIR (CONT'D)
                        You don't look like a politician. 
                                 MAK
                        I'm not. I'm a professor. Math. 

                                 AMIR
                        Wait. Mak. Mujic?

                                 MAK
                        That's right. Your son-

                                 AMIR
                        Oh! My son was in your class a few 
                        years back.  

           A beat. 

                                 AMIR (CONT'D)
                        Was never very good at math. 

                                 MAK
                        No, he wasn't.

                                 AMIR
                        But he was a very funny young man. 
                        Light of my life. He...

           For a moment all we hear is the vibration of the passing 
           road beneath. 

                                 MAK
                        I'm sorry.

                                 AMIR
                        Right at the beginning. Almost a 
                        year ago. 

           Amir nods his thank you and goes back to his paperwork. Mak 
           watches him for a few moments then looks through the 
           rectangular window.

           The world outside somehow looks beautiful even though every 
           once in a while we glimpse apocalyptic destruction.

           We stay on the speeding landscape for a few moments. 

                                 MAK
                        Where are you heading?

           Amir pulls a map out of his suitcase. Slides it towards Mak. 
           The top corner says Owen-Stoltenberg Plan. It shows a map of 
           Bosnia divided into three colours. 

                                 AMIR
                        The new Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
                        Bosniak-Serbs forces would be given 
                        fifty two percent of the territory. 
                        Muslims would have thirty percent 
                        and Croats eighteen. A possibility 
                        of peace.

                                 MAK
                        Is it gonna happen?

           Amir thinks.

                                 AMIR
                        It has to. You know, I couldn't 
                        stop my son from fighting. He 
                        wanted to. Always a very physical 
                        boy. I owe it to him. But there's 
                        only so much one politican can do. 

           The transporter starts slowing down. The metal creaks. Amir 
           starts packing up his papers. Mak fidgets. Clearly getting 
           anxious. 

                                 AMIR (CONT'D)
                        Roadblock. Probably. Don't get 
                        spooked. The Serb Chetniks like to 
                        cause a stir sometimes. They won't 
                        do shit with the UN around. 

           Somehow that only makes Mak more anxious. We can hear the 
           FRENCH SOLDIERS slam the doors of the transporter. 

           For a few tense moments there's silence.

           And then we hear VOICES. YELLING. 

           Something that sounds like a GUNSHOT. Silence. More YELLING. 

           Mak turns to Amir, who looks more worried than he should. He 
           catches Mak's gaze. 

                                 AMIR
                        Chest thumping. For show.

           In that moment the door of the transporter opens. 

           The sun bathes Amir who sits directly in front of the door. 
           He raises his hand to shield his eyes. 

           Before he even has time to gasp a LOUD SHOT rings out and 
           pierces his throat. 

                                 MAK
                        Fuck!

           Amir lets out a sickening GURGLE before he covers the 
           sputtering wound with his hands.

           Amir reaches his hand out to Mak. Mak goes to grab it but 
           SEVEN MORE SHOTS rip through Amir's body at a burst only an 
           AK-47 can dish out. Amir's blood sprays all over the inside 
           of the transporter and Mak. 

           YELLING. The door suddenly shuts. A moment later so do the 
           doors up front. 

           The transporter quickly spins into a turn and Amir's body is 
           thrown at Mak, knocking them both to the floor. Amir's 
           suitcase flies open and the papers inside fly everywhere. 

           A few more GUNSHOTS hit the side of the transporter but soon 
           it's speeding away from the attackers. 

           We can hear the FRENCH SOLDIERS hysterically arguing up 
           front. 

           Mak pushes himself out from under Amir's body.

                                 MAK
                        Hey! Hey!

           The soldiers stop talking for a moment. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Heeeeey!

           The divider opens and Christophe's eyes bulge through. 

                                 CHRISTOPHE
                        Mon...the other one is alive!

           We can hear the Other Soldier sobbing as he drives. 

                                 OTHER SOLDIER
                        What the fuck! What the fuck was 
                        that!

                                 CHRISTOPHE
                             (to Mak)
                        Are you hit?

                                 MAK
                        No.

                                 CHRISTOPHE
                        Ok. Ok. Now what? What do we do 
                        now?

                                 OTHER SOLDIER
                        I don't fucking know! Fuck!
                                 CHRISTOPHE
                        Calm down!

                                 OTHER SOLDIER
                        I can't do this! I didn't sign up 
                        for this shit!

           The two soldiers keep yelling at each other as Mak leans 
           back against the cold vibrating metal. The sound of their 
           arguing fades. He closes his eyes. Tries to steady his 
           breath. But he can't. 

           He opens his eyes. He sees the contorted bleeding body 
           slumped in the corner. Beside Amir's body is the map of new 
           Bosnia-Herzegovina that Amir showed him. 

           Amir's blood slowly swallows the whole map. 

           Mak screams at the top of his lungs but we don't hear a 
           thing.

           EXT. UNPROFOR TRANSPORTER - DAY

           The Transporter tires SCREECH to a halt and kick up dust. 

           Christophe opens the door to the transporter and Mak shoots 
           out like a drowning man out of water. Bloody suitcase in 
           hand.

           He drops to his knees. Inhaling fresh air. The Other Soldier 
           looks inside the vehicle. When the stench of the carnage 
           hits him he blows chunks. 

                                 OTHER SOLDIER
                        Fuck this shit. Fuck Sarajevo.

           Mak lunges at the soldier. Grabs him by the collar. 

                                 MAK 
                        Give me my blue card! 

                                 CHRISTOPHE
                        They took it! We don't have it. 

                                 MAK
                        You have to help me...you have to 
                        get me out of this place. 

           Christophe shakes his head. Other Soldier looks away from 
           Mak's desperate eyes.

           Mak lets go of the Other Soldier's collar. Panic overtakes 
           him. He stars backing away. Then he breaks into a run. 
           We're in a close up of Mak's bloody face. Getting more and 
           more deformed as he picks up speed. 

           EXT. SARAJEVO - PIONIRSKA DOLINA - ZOO - DAY

           Greenery. Lightly swaying reeds. Mak zooms past. He passes a 
           large cage. Empty. Then another. We realize he's going 
           through the zoo. But there are no animals anywhere. 

           Winded. He sits down on a bench in front of the largest 
           cage. 

           Inside the cage is a fake cave. Unkempt. From the darkness 
           within we hear BREATHS.

           A low growl. Mak stares at the cave in the cage. 

           After a few moments a giant BLACK BEAR, fur badly matted, 
           one eye sealed shut and ribs showing, slumps out of the 
           cage. He has trouble walking.

           The Black bear stomps to the bars of the cage. Some of them 
           missing. He can walk right through them and walk out of the 
           cage but he doesn't. He sits down and GROWLS at Mak. As 
           surreal as it gets. 

           Mak blinks a few times. Rubs his eyes. Tries to make the 
           hallucination disappear. It doesn't. Because it's real. 

           A JOLLY WHISTLE gets louder in the distance. A GREY MAN, 80, 
           walking with a cane in one hand and a plastic bag in the 
           other, whistles as he shuffles slowly towards the cage. 

           He glances in Mak's direction. Hard to know if his cataract 
           covered eyes, milky white, actually register him. 

           The Grey Man walks up to the cage. Within reach of the bear.

           The Grey Man pulls some scraps out of the bag and throws 
           them to the bear. The bear gobbles them up in a breath. He 
           looks up at the Grey Man and growls softly.  

           The Grey Man turns to Mak. Very slowly. He TAPS HIS TEMPLE 
           with his withered hand. 

           Mak relaxes for a moment. The adrenaline finally wearing 
           off. 

           It starts raining. Mak looks up into the sky.

           The rain starts washing the blood off Mak's face. 
           EXT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY

           Buckets. Different shapes and sizes. Laid out on the 
           rooftop. Filling up with rainwater. 

           Mak strips naked. He grabs one and dumps it on his head.

           He uses a rag to wipe the crusted blood off his shockingly 
           skinny body.  

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mak's suitcase is open. The little red backpack inside. A 
           photo album opened to a page where a baby Ivan crawls 
           between tables after a cat. 

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           We see the silhouette of Mak's back lying on his side. The 
           rain still pour outside.

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        Tata...
                             (beat)
                        Tata?

           Mak doesn't move a muscle. 

                                 MAK
                        Yes. 

                                 IVAN (V.O.)
                        That it? Are you giving up?

           A long beat. 

                                 MAK
                        No. 

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Darko smokes a cigarette in the dark. Trying to catch what 
           Mak is saying to himself. Clearly worried. 

           INT. ACO'S OFFICE - DAY

           Mak's weathered boot taps out a nervous rhythm on gleaming 
           tile.

           He sits in a leather chair in a surprisingly luxurious 
           office. Taxidermy game on the walls. He stares straight 
           ahead.

           A gold cigar cutter tears through a fat cuban with the CLIP 
           of a GUILLOTINE.

                                 ACO
                        Disaster. 

           Aco brings the cigar to his lips and lights it. He takes a 
           puff.

                                 ACO (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry Mak. I can't believe 
                        it.

                                 MAK
                        Can you get me another one? Another 
                        shot?

                                 ACO
                        I...No...Don't you get it? No more 
                        blue cards. This sets the whole 
                        peace process back months... a 
                        year? Longer.

                                 MAK
                        A year? A fucking year?

           Mak gets up and starts pacing around.

                                 ACO
                        Calm down. Ok? You gotta look at 
                        the big picture.

                                 MAK
                        What's the big picture here?

           Aco taps the side of his temple. Mak stares back at him. 

                                 ACO
                        War is a game of attrition. Out of 
                        this city's ashes, a new guard will 
                        rise. It has to. We can be part of 
                        it. Just wait out the fire. 

           Mak eyes him like he's a stranger. 

                                 ACO (CONT'D)
                        Or you can try your luck on the 
                        runway. 

           ACO'S SECRETARY, 30s, a curvy bottle blonde, brings out 
           meza, a selection of meats and cheeses. 
           As she pours wine her chest threatens to escape her top. 

                                 ACO
                        Well, don't just stare at it. 

           Mak turns and leaves without a word. 

                                 ACO (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry Mak. I really am. 

           EXT. SARAJEVO STREETS - DAY 

           The same GUNSHOTS and GRENADE BLASTS that we have heard 
           before sound LOUDER than ever. 

           Mak runs down the street. Furious and terrified. We see his 
           tattered adidas runners. The flat pavement under his feet 
           becomes increasingly difficult to traverse as it turns into 
           sloping rubble. Mak wheezes as the dust from the detritus 
           starts filling his lungs. The detritus starts falling back 
           down towards him. For a moment it seems like he's moments 
           away from being buried alive.  

           INT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cold kafa. Darko eyes Mak like he's a mental patient. And 
           right now he looks like one. 

                                 MAK
                        More and more people are doing it.

                                 DARKO
                        Are you insane?

                                 MAK
                        There's this government service. 
                        This guy. He can get us to the 
                        airport. 

                                 DARKO
                        Are you fucking kidding me? You 
                        won't even survive the drive over. 
                        Fucking government service.

                                 MAK
                        If people are doing it, it means 
                        that it's possible.

                                 DARKO
                        Wait for the tunnel. Rumours are 
                        it's just a few months away!
                                 MAK
                        I can't, Darko.

                                 DARKO
                        I already lost a fucking friend 
                        this week, man. Don't do this. And 
                        who fucking cares about me? Fuck 
                        me. Your son will grow up without a 
                        father, man.

                                 MAK
                        If I stay here... worst case 
                        scenario? Get drafted and killed. 
                        Get sniped walking to class. Best 
                        case scenario? I lose my fucking 
                        mind. I'm halfway there. Either 
                        way, my son grows up without a 
                        father. 
                             (beat)
                        I want my life back. 

           Darko averts his gaze from Mak because he knows it's true. 
           They sit in silence.

                                 DARKO
                        You're not the only one, Mak. 

           We hear rhythmic SNARE DRUMS. Mak does spirit hands.

           EXT. SARAJEVO - DAY

           Another sunrise over the ruins of Sarajevo. 

           Throughout the scene the snare drums keep getting slowly 
           louder.  

                                 MAK (V.O.)
                        Jana?

                                 JANA (V.O.)
                        Mak? What...what happened? 

                                 MAK (V.O.)
                        I'm sorry babe. I didn't...It 
                        didn't work. 

           Jana can't stop herself from sobbing. 

                                 MAK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Don't cry. Please don't cry. I'm 
                        gonna try again. I just...I just 
                        wanted to hear your voice. One more 
                        time. For good luck.
           EXT. SHELLED BLUE BUILDING - DAY

           The SNARE DRUMS speed up like a circus act is about to 
           start. Because it is. 

           Mak walks out and sees MUJO, 40s, a short stout man with a 
           moustache befitting a ringmaster is mid bow. 

           FATA, 40s, his heavy-set wife smokes a cigarette and acts as 
           his Vanna White. 

                                 MUJO 
                        Ladies aaaaaand gentlemen!
                             (hiccup)
                        I present to you the pride and joy 
                        of our crumbling Yugoslavian union. 
                        The one. The only. The lonely four-
                        wheel two-door comrade transport 
                        machine made in our very own 
                        junkyard.
                             (hiccup)
                        I mean backyard. 

           Fata reveals a little red Yugo car with a lazy wave of her 
           cigarette. 

           The odd vehicle is shoddily retrofitted with metal slats 
           that already bear hundreds of little dimples from deflected 
           bullets. Even the windshield is armored except for two 
           laughably tiny slits for the driver and passenger to look 
           through. 

                                 MUJO (CONT'D)
                        Cobbled together from the blood, 
                        sweat, and tears of well-meaning 
                        fellow Bosnians. All inclusive. The 
                        incredible Yugo!

           Fata tries to open the passenger-side door but it won't 
           budge.

                                 MUJO (CONT'D)
                        Sarajevo '92 Special Edition. You 
                        break it you buy it, you hear? 

           Fata kicks the door with all her might. It pops open.

           Mak, ready to go with his suitcase in hand, stares at this 
           death trap. 

           He swallows hard. He hands Fata his watch. She appraises it 
           like she's evaluating a diamond. She winks at him. He sits 
           inside. 
                                 FATA
                             (to Mujo)
                        Get your ass in the back. 

                                 MUJO
                        What's the problem? I had just a 
                        very little tiny drink. Tiny!

           Fata opens the driver's side door and pushes the driver's 
           seat towards the wheel. 

                                 FATA
                        Get in that fucking car! "What's 
                        the problem". Almost kills me on 
                        the way over and then "what's the 
                        problem". 

           She raises her hand like she's about to backhand him across 
           the face. He flinches but then immediately starts into the 
           car. 

                                 MUJO
                        Oooooh, look at her. All important 
                        big boss queen.

           Fata is about to get in the driver's seat when-

                                 DARKO (O.S.)
                        Wait!

           Darko trots out of the building with a small bag on his 
           shoulder. 

           Darko runs to Fata and places a vintage ring in her palm as 
           he dives into the backseat.

           She turns it to see the glimmer in the sun. She bites the 
           rock. Content, she gets in the car. 

           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           There's an exposed hanging bulb beside Darko's head. The 
           only other light comes through the slits in the windshield. 

                                 MAK
                        What's this now?

                                 DARKO
                        Making sure your ass gets out of 
                        this shithole alive. 

                                 MAK
                        Yea fucking right. 
                                 MUJO
                        Aw, now that's a good friend. Used 
                        to be so many good friends in 
                        Sarajevo. 

           Fata moves her seat back hard and fast, slamming into 
           Darko's knees. 

                                 DARKO (CONT'D)
                        Ow. Fucking hell. 

                                 MAK
                        What about the redhead?

                                 DARKO
                        Non-smoker. Wouldn't work.   

                                 FATA
                        You.

                                 MAK
                        Me?

                                 FATA
                        Yes. You. You're gonna be my co-
                        pilot. If you see something that I 
                        don't, tell me but don't yell. You 
                        don't want to scare the driver. 
                        Understand? 

                                 MAK
                        Yes?

           Fata gives him a look. 

                                 MAK 
                        Yes. 

           She adjusts the rearview angle but she can't see behind the 
           car anyway because it's metal. 

           She wrestles with the manual transmission and steps on it. 
           The car stutters but doesn't start. 

                                 FATA
                        Give me some gas, Mujo. 

                                 DARKO
                        Hold on. Mujo? That's his name? 
                        Like in the jokes? You gotta be 
                        kidding me. 

                                 MAK
                        Nope. Good omen, right? 
                                 DARKO
                        Oh, I'm dying laughing.

           Mujo doesn't stir. He's passed out. 

           A few more turns of the key. A few more whimpers from the 
           engine. 

                                 FATA
                        Wake up!

           She hits Mujo. He wakes with a start. 

                                 MUJO
                        The Chetniks are coming!

                                 FATA
                        Muzika!

                                 MUJO
                        Opa!

           Mujo takes a harmonica out of his pocket. He puts it to his 
           lips and starts BLOWING a crazed tune.

           The car finally roars to life.

           EXT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Yugo blasts off. We follow the car as it tears down the 
           streets of Sarajevo. Mujo's harmonica keeps the pace.

           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

                                 DARKO
                        The fuck is happening?

                                 MAK 
                        Wha? I can't hear-

                                 DARKO 
                        Who are these people? 

                                 MAK
                             (to Fata)
                        Watch it!

           EXT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Yugo swerves to avoid a charred bus skeleton. 
           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

                                 FATA 
                        You scared me!

                                 MAK 
                        You said to- 

                                 FATA 
                        We are the official sarajevo 
                        underground exit strategy. At your 
                        service.

           A few BULLETS HIT the side of the car. Mak and Darko scream 
           but Fata keeps the car speeding ahead.

                                 FATA 
                        Ha! It's gonna take a lot more to 
                        stop the Yugo you pieces of shit!

                                 DARKO
                        We're going to die. What the fuck 
                        did you get us into. 

                                 MAK 
                        We're gonna be fine.

                                 FATA 
                        Buckle up kids.

                                 DARKO 
                        There's no...there are no 
                        seatbelts.

                                 FATA
                        Well then you better hold on 
                        because we're about to reach the 
                        strike zone. 

                                 MAK
                        Oh god. 

           EXT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The car swerves to the left and suddenly it's covered in 
           sparks as hundreds of bullets bounce off the metal plating.

           The harmonica joins with Mak and Darko's SCREAMS as the Yugo 
           flies through the deserted streets like a burning roman 
           candle. 

           Swerving left then right then left. 
           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Fata's cigarette still hangs from her frown, a bead of sweat 
           making its way down her forehead but she has got this. 

           Darko and Mak hold on for dear life.

           Mujo, on another planet, keeps playing the harmonica.

                                 FATA
                        Don't worry, we are home free as 
                        long as they don't start in with 
                        the tank artillery. 

           EXT. HILL - DAY 

           Of course, this is the moment when A HAND loads an anti-tank 
           rifle with artillery. The rifle aims at us and...FIRES.

           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           The anti-tank bullet ROARS through the car. It whizzes past 
           Mak's head and burns the side of Fata's hand. 

                                 FATA 
                        Son of a bitch burn in hell!

           She lets go of the steering wheel and the car swerves right.

           EXT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Yugo swerves off the road and comes dangerously close to 
           diving into a deep ditch but then it swerves back.

           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mak is leaning over and steering the Yugo while Fata blows 
           on her hand. 

                                 MAK
                        I can't see where I'm going! I 
                        can't see!

           Fata finally looks up just in time to-

                                 FATA
                        Leeeeeeeeeeeft!
           EXT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Yugo swerves just in time to avoid slamming head first 
           into a wall. 

           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Fata grabs the wheel again. 

                                 FATA
                        Move it!

                                 DARKO
                        Oh my god, I'm gonna vomit. 

                                 FATA
                        I just cleaned. Don't you dare! 

           EXT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           The Yugo zooms past the Grey Man, from the zoo. 

           The Grey Man waves at the passing Yugo. 

           EXT. DOBRINJA - BUILDING - DAY 

           The Yugo pulls up to a building entrance with a screech. 

           INT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Mujo plays his last drawn out note on the harmonica.

           Mak and Darko are frozen. Both their jaws hang open.

           Fata presses the side of her timex watch. 

                                 FATA
                        Fuck! 

           Darko and Mak jump. 

                                 FATA
                        10:12. This close to beating my 
                        personal record. Fuck their

                             (beat)
                        We're here.

           She pops open the glove compartment and pulls out some 
           papers. She pushes the door open. 
                                 FATA (O.S.)
                        Mujo, look what they did to our 
                        poor Yugo, Mujo. 

                                 MUJO
                        I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

           Fata pushes the driver's seat forward. 

           EXT. YUGO - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Mak pushes his plated door open. Darko gets out too. They're 
           both shaking. 

                                 MAK
                        Is your hand ok?

                                 FATA
                        Nothin' a bandaid won't fix. I 
                        don't cry about everything like you 
                        whiny hippies. Here are your 
                        crossing papers. 

           She hands them papers. 

                                 FATA (CONT'D)
                        Apartment 15a. Ask for Big Ben. 
                        When you get out there make sure 
                        you tell them. Tell them what's 
                        happening to us. Sajonara. 

           She gets back in the car. Won't start again. After a few 
           tries it does. And Mujo and Fata are off into the unknown. 

           Mak and Darko just stand there. 

           EXT. APARTMENT 15A - HALLWAY - DAY

           Mak's hand KNOCKS on a door marked 15A. 

           EXT. APARTMENT 15A - BALCONY - DAY 

           Blistering asphalt stretches across the horizon. The hot air 
           above the airport runway ripples like an invisible veil. 
           Just beyond it lies Butmir - a block of houses untouched by 
           war raging less than half a mile away.   

           In front of the runway, a Control Tower juts out of a single 
           terminal. Two UN planes parked in the apron spit out 
           international aid packages onto awaiting transport trucks.
           The airport is fenced in. Tall grass and wild weeds 
           everywhere. GUNSHOTS echo. 

           Mak leans on the balcony railing. A hop, a skip, and a jump 
           to freedom. Or so it seems.

           A WHISTLE from inside the apartment.

           Mak unglues his eyes from the runway. 

           INT. APARTMENT 15A - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           A spare living room with two ragged leather couches. Tito's 
           portrait on one of the walls. The others are covered with 
           large oil paintings of nude women running through fields of 
           grass.

           BIG BEN, 60s, a very tall lanky man with a lazy eye and hair 
           that would make Einstein jealous, holds court. 

           Darko is splayed across one of the couches. Cig in hand. 
           NATASHA, 30s, and MARKO, 30s, clearly a couple, exhausted 
           and dirty. ISAK, 20s, a Bosnian jew sits beside them. 

           Mak leans on the wall next to Big Ben. 

           Big Ben sits cross legged on the floor where a coffee table 
           should go. He pours Bosnian kafa. If God had a voice it 
           would be Big Ben's. 

                                 BIG BEN
                        Meliha, my dear, we're gonna 
                        need...one, two...two more. Please. 

           MELIHA, 50s, painter and Big Ben's longtime lover, brings in  
           two more cups. Her blue jean overalls are stained with 
           paint. She perches on the side of a couch. 

           Big Ben looks up with a giant smile on his face. He throws 
           his hands up.

                                 BIG BEN
                        Welcome. You're so close!

           Meliha laughs. The spontaneous act breaks the somber mood. 
           The runners exchange unsure glances.

           Big Ben points out the window.

                        It's a ten minute jog to peace. To 
                        Butmir. Of course, might take you a 
                        few tries. You'll have a guide from 
                        the Sarajevo Police to take you 
                        over the bosnian front line. From 
                        there you will have until sunrise 
                        to cross. If you don't make it, and 
                        you're still kicking, come back 
                        here. The only rule of the 
                        runway...If at first you don't 
                        succeed-

                                 MARKO
                        -drink the milk and try again.

           Big Ben smiles. Mak and Darko frown at each other. Confused.

                                 MELIHA
                        It's an obstacle course out there. 
                        You have three things to worry 
                        about: ditches, snipers, and the 
                        UN.

                                 BIG BEN
                        The ditches can fit 3 to 4. 
                        Randomly placed. Slide in feet 
                        first cause some got barbed wire in 
                        em.

                                 MELIHA
                        UN transporters patrol the runway 
                        all night. They shine lights on 
                        runners. -

                                 BIG BEN
                        Which makes it really easy for the 
                        Serb snipers to pick you off. 

                                 MAK
                        Why would the UN do that?

                                 BIG BEN
                        They want to dissuade people from 
                        escaping Sarajevo until they have a 
                        better grasp of the situation. 

                                 DARKO
                        A year in? That's insane.

                                 BIG BEN
                        It is what it is.

                                 MELIHA
                        If you see the transporter or you 
                        get hit by its light drop face down 
                        into a ditch. Dig a hole in the 
                        ground and breathe into it. 
                                 BIG BEN
                        Otherwise your breath acts like an 
                        arrow pointing to your location in 
                        the light. 

                                 MELIHA
                        You wait. A minute. Fifteen. 
                        Thirty. They will either grab you 
                        or give up.

                                 BIG BEN
                        Don't run if they come for you. Use 
                        them as shields when they funnel 
                        you into the transporters.

                                 MELIHA
                        Because the snipers are always 
                        watching. 

                                 BIG BEN
                        Do your best not to get shot.  

           Meliha lays out stacks of old magazines, black duct tape, 
           small metal plates, sharpened spoons, and black balaclavas. 

                                 MELIHA
                        Made them myself.   

           Mak and Darko exchange glances. 

           INT. APARTMENT 15A - LIVNG ROOM - DAY - LATER

           The runners prep. DUCT TAPE TEARING is the only sound. 

           Darko tapes magazines around his shins. Natasha helps Marko 
           tape a small metal plate to each of his palms. Mak tapes 
           magazines around his forearms. 

           Isak prays over a book in the corner. Mak cranes his neck to 
           get a closer look. 

                                 ISAK
                        It's the Sarajevo Haggadah.  

                                 MAK
                        Sorry, I didn't mean to-

                                 ISAK
                        S'ok, man. Here. It's a sacred 
                        jewish text.

           He hands it to Mak. Mak leafs through it. Medieval paintings 
           and hebrew writing. 
                                 MAK
                        I've heard of it. Never seen it in 
                        person.

                                 ISAK (CONT'D)
                        Tells the story of the exodus of 
                        jews from spain. The original 
                        survived two wars, saved by muslims 
                        both times, actually. If it doesn't 
                        survive this time around I want to 
                        make sure at least a copy does. 

                                 MAK
                        Our very own exodus. 

           Isak laughs. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Caring for the culture of your 
                        neighbour...that used to be the 
                        soul of Sarajevo. It's beautiful.

                                 ISAK
                        Hey. What's the difference between 
                        Sarajevo and Auschwitz? 

                                 MAK
                        What?

                                 ISAK
                        They never turned off the gas in 
                        Auschwitz.

                                 MAK
                        Holy shit.

           Mak cringe laughs. A beat. 

           He holds up the duct tape. Isak nods. 

           Mak helps Isak suit up for the run.  

           INT. APARTMENT 15A - BATHROOM - DAY

           A man in a balaclava stares at his reflection in the mirror. 

           If it wasn't for the blue eyes we'd have no idea it's Mak. 

           He takes the balaclava off. He looks at himself like he's 
           trying to figure out if he's scared. 
           INT. APARTMENT 15A - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Mak leaves the bathroom and interrupts a private moment 
           between Natasha and Marko. They look at him. Suspicious. 

           Mak scoots by them. Apologetic but kind of weirded out.

           INT. APARTMENT 15A - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mak walks by Meliha. She's grinding brick. Turning it into 
           red paint. 

                                 MAK
                        There was a girl that crossed last 
                        week. Amela. 

           Meliha thinks for a moment. Grinds more brick into her 
           palette. She looks at Mak's face. 

                                 MELIHA
                        I remember her. What a shame. Such 
                        a beautiful girl.

           Mak's face drops. 

                                 MAK
                        She...she was my student. 

                                 MELIHA
                        Beautiful girl.  

           Off Mak's shocked face.

                                 MELIHA (CONT'D)
                        Don't forget your spoon. 

           She hands him a spoon sharpened into a point. He grabs it. 

           EXT. RUNWAY - MAGIC HOUR

           The sun sets over Butmir.

           INT. APARTMENT 15A - LIVIN ROOM - NIGHT

           The runners sit around with Big Ben and Meliha. Waiting in 
           silence. 

           A KNOCK on the door. 

                                 BIG BEN
                        Finally. 
           He opens it. CIRO, 40s, a short little tank in a leather 
           jacket, stomps into the apartment. Like the best undercover 
           cops he looks just like a criminal.

           Ciro surveys the runners. He's already geared up. 

                                 CIRO
                        Ok. Follow me.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           We follow the gang as they silently jog by the side of a 
           building. They follow Ciro. Heads down. Mak carries his 
           ridiculous little suitcase in his hand while everyone else 
           has backpacks. GUNSHOTS RATTLE in the distance. 

           EXT. AIRPORT - BOSNIAN FRONTLINE - NIGHT

           Ciro hands everyone's paper work to HAMO, 30s, a Bosnian 
           soldier. 

           Darko eyes the AK-47 slung across his shoulder. 

                                 DARKO
                        You scared?

                                 MAK
                        No. You?

                                 DARKO
                        Pffft. No. 

           EXT. AIRPORT - WIRE FENCE - NIGHT

           The silhouettes of the five runners crouching up against the 
           10 ft fence. Ciro searches for something along its base. 

           He sees a RED ROCK.

           Ciro picks the fence up at the rock's base and lifts it. The 
           others slide under. 

           Ciro signals everyone to stay low. 

           EXT. AIRPORT FIELD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone is huddled together. Crouching. You can hear the 
           BULLETS WHIZZING through the air.
                                 CIRO
                        The snipers are east. So you favor 
                        west. Don't crowd each other. Good 
                        luck. 

           Suddenly Ciro makes a dash for it. He crouches but moves 
           surprisingly fast. Strangely enough he moves east. Almost 
           towards the Serb front lines. 

                                 DARKO
                        Wait? What the fuck! What the fuck 
                        is he doing?

                                 MAK
                        I don't know.

                                 ISAK
                        He's leaving us.

           They watch Ciro disappear into the darkness. GUNSHOTS ring 
           out in the distance.  

                                 NATASHA
                        Son of a bitch.  

           The group doesn't move. Darko starts breathing heavily. 

                                 NATASHA (CONT'D)
                        Fuck this. Let's go. Gentlemen, 
                        hope to see you on the other side.  

           Marko and Natasha start moving. Isak and Mak watch Darko 
           spiral. 

                                 DARKO
                        The fuck are we gonna do? We can't 
                        do this without him. I can't do 
                        this.

                                 MAK
                        Darko. Darko man. Hey. Breathe. 
                        Just breathe. 

           Darko's breathing calms. 

                                 DARKO
                        I want my money back!

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        There we go. We can do this. Ok? 

           Isak puts his hand on Darko's shoulder. 

           The cloud cover moves to reveal an almost full moon.
           Mak turns to survey the path ahead. It's more visible than 
           before. In the distance we see Natasha and Marko jump out of 
           a ditch and make it into another.  

           Mak scans for the nearest ditch. 

                                 MAK
                        Ok. Ready? 

           Isak nods. Darko nods. 

                                 DARKO
                        Why wouldn't I be? 

           Mak crouch runs a few steps. The guys follow him. 

           Mak slides into the first ditch gritting his teeth. 
           Expecting barbed wire. Empty. The other two follow. 

                                 MAK
                        Ok. One down. 

           Mak peeks out over the ditch. His breaths hang in the cold 
           night air. 

           Further west two other RUNNERS jump out of one ditch and 
           make a break for it. They slide into another ditch. Mak 
           gives it a beat to put some distance between them.

           The WHIZZING BULLETS are terrifying.

           Mak signals the guys. They crouch-run and slide into another 
           ditch a few feet away.

           Mak peeks his head out again. The first runway lane is a 
           little bit closer. 

           Mak jumps out again and goes for another ditch. 

           As he slides in his feet connect with looped barbed wire. 
           One of loops rips the side of his jeans. 

                                 MAK
                        Fuck. 

           He uses his metal plated palms and his magazine covered 
           forearms to push the barbed wire away as Isak jumps in legs 
           first. He helps Mak. Darko is in last. 

           We hear the GRUMBLE of a TRUCK ENGINE.

           A HUGE BEAM OF LIGHT crosses above them. They freeze. 

           They scramble to get out of the ditch. They run to another 
           one. Slide in. Just as the light beam shines across.  

           They lie face down in the ditch. All three of them start 
           digging small holes in the ground as fast as they can. They 
           put their mouths into the holes and breathe into them. 

           The UNPROFOR beam illuminates the ditch they just jumped 
           into. 

           From the POV of the beam we see that they can't see inside 
           the ditch the guys are in. 

           The UNPROFOR transporter holds its position. The beam 
           doesn't move. 

           In that moment we hear rustling in the ditch ahead of them. 
           The light beam moves to track it. 

                                 NATASHA (O.S.)
                        Shit!

           We're on Mak's face breathing into the dirt but we hear 
           bullets whiz by dangerously close. The transporter moves 
           closer too. We hear Natasha and Marko whispering to each 
           other but we can't hear what they're saying.

           The transporter settles next to the ditch Natasha and Marko 
           are hiding in. The door unlatches and swings open.

           AMERICAN SOLDIER 1, 30s, ken doll jaw, pops out. 

           The American soldier walks up to Marko, who's lying face 
           down on the ground. He stands up and hugs the soldier, 
           making sure that his head is directly in front of the 
           soldier's. The American is expecting it. They shuffle 
           sideways and backwards towards the transporter. It looks 
           like a dance. Their feet move in unison until they're inside 
           the vehicle. 

           The American re-appears. He goes over to Natasha. Her face 
           is at his boots. Her hand reaches into her jacket and she 
           takes something out. She closes her eyes. She swiftly stands 
           up and hugs the soldier.

           They walk together and when she's sure that the transporter 
           is obscuring the snipers' view she pushes the American away 
           and holds out her hand. 

           A grenade. Her finger through the pin. Ready to pull. 

           A standoff. She looks into his wide eyes. Calm. She speaks 
           in a loud and clear voice. 
                                 NATASHA
                        Take us to the other side.

                                 AMERICAN SOLDIER 1 
                        Wh...what?

                                 NATASHA
                        Take us to the other side or I'm 
                        pulling the pin. 

           Mak's eyes widen. He looks to Darko and Isak. They both 
           heard it too. 

                                 AMERICAN SOLDIER 1
                        Ok...Ok...just don't...

                                 NATASHA
                        Hand your gun to my boyfriend and 
                        tell your driver. 

           Mak slowly lifts his head out of the ditch. He sees Natasha 
           standing there still. 

           The American nods.

                                 AMERICAN SOLDIER 1
                        Mike?

                                 AMERICAN SOLDIER 2 (O.S.)
                        Yea?

                                 AMERICAN SOLDIER 1
                        You heard her?

                                 AMERICAN SOLDIER 2 (O.S.)
                        Yep.

           The American hands his gun to Marko. He goes into the 
           transporter with his hands up. Natasha carefully follows him 
           in. The door closes. The transporter idles for a few moments 
           and then it starts moving. Slowly. Towards Butmir. 

                                 MAK
                        Holy shit.

                                 DARKO 
                        That crazy bitch. 

                                 ISAK
                        We need to move. Now.  

                                 MAK
                        No. No. Not yet!
           But Isak and Darko are already on their feet and running. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        Fuck!

           Mak jumps up too and follows them. 

           The BULLETS are WHIZZING past. The guys run as fast as they 
           can. They're steps away from another ditch when Isak lets 
           out a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. 

           He drops into an empty ditch with Darko and Mak at his side. 

                                 ISAK
                        My leg. My fucking leg. 

           Mak looks down and sees Isak clutching his bleeding leg. 

                                 DARKO
                        Damn it! 

           Mak pops open his little suitcase and grabs a shirt. He 
           tries to tie it around Isak's leg but he's screaming bloody 
           murder. 

           All three of the guys are on their backs trying to catch 
           their breath when another BEAM OF LIGHT shines on them. 

           Mak looks up into the starry sky and his breath travels into 
           the air. When it hits the beam of light it becomes even more 
           visible. 

           Within moments the second Transporter moves to the ditch 
           they're lying in and parks beside them. 

           It looks like the stars are falling out of the sky. Then a 
           snow flake hits Mak's face.

           INT. UNPROFOR TRANSPORTER - NIGHT - LATER

           Mak is the first into the vehicle. Another metal waiting 
           room. He leans against the wall. Panting. Filthy from the 
           run. 

           Darko is next. Somehow even dirtier. He waits at the door to 
           help the ITALIAN SOLDIER, 20s, bring in a very pale Isak.

           They sit Isak down on the metal bench. 

           The Italian Soldier rummages through a compartment and pulls 
           out three cartons of milk. He hands one to each of the guys. 

           Mak opens Isak's and helps him drink. Darko downs his. 
                                 ISAK
                        Milk.

           Isak starts laughing. Delirious.

           Mak opens his own carton and looks at the liquid sloshing 
           inside as Isak's laughter turns into groans and the 
           Transporter starts moving. 

                                 DARKO
                        You're going the wrong way. We came 
                        from over there. We came from 
                        Butmir. I mean, ok, if you wanna do 
                        us a favor and drop us into 
                        Sarajevo. That's fine by me. 

           Isak laughs again. 

           The baby faced Italian Soldier looks at the floor.

           EXT. WIRE FENCE - NIGHT

           The Transporter spits out the three guys outside of the wire 
           fence. Darko and Mak carry off a hobbling Isak.

           EXT. BOSNIAN FRONTLINE - NIGHT

           Darko and Mak pass off an almost unconscious Isak to Hamo, 
           the Bosnian soldier. 

                                 ISAK
                        Wait. Wait!

           He rummages through his backpack and grabs the copy of the 
           Sarajevo Haggadah. He shoves it into Mak's chest. Mak eyes 
           the red streaks Isak's fingers leave behind on the book. A 
           bloody history made even bloodier. He nods at Isak. Isak 
           smiles back as the soldier takes him away. 

                                 DARKO
                        One down. 

                                 MAK
                        You're an idiot.

           Mak moves off. It snows ever harder than before. 

           EXT. APARTMENT 15A - HALLWAY - DAY

           Mak's dirty hand KNOCKS on a door marked 15A. 
           INT. APARTMENT 15A - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Mak lies on the couch. Cleaned up as much as he can be 
           without water. 

           In front of the couch are Mak's milk cartons. Two empty and 
           three more unopened. Remnants of failed attempts. 

           Darko sleep up against the wall. 

           Big Ben gives instructions to a new GROUP OF RUNNERS but we 
           don't hear it. In fact there are no sounds. 

           Until we hear some RUSTLING. Like leaves. Or grass. Then 
           FOOTSTEPS. Picking up pace. Running. 

           Mak looks at the painting above him. And then he notices it 
           for the first time. The PAINTED NAKED WOMAN running through 
           the grass has the smiling face of his student Amela.

           He closes his eyes and drifts off into sleep. 

           EXT. AIRPORT FIELD - NIGHT

           TWO GHOSTS in a sea of white.

           In the light of the full moon, the snow-covered field looks 
           like alien terrain but the familiar silhouette of Butmir 
           looms in the distance. BULLETS whizz past. 

           As our eyes adjust we see that the two ghosts are FIGURES 
           with WHITE SHEETS fashioned into capes to camouflage them in 
           the snow.

           The snow is deep enough to slow down the runners down and 
           make sliding into the ditches that much more terrifying. 

           Only when they break in a ditch to catch their breath do we 
           realize it's Mak and Darko and this is no dream.

                                 MAK
                        It's so fucking bright.

                                 DARKO
                        I know. 

                                 MAK
                        Should we turn back?

           Darko looks out of the ditch for a moment. 

                                 DARKO
                        Mak.
                                 MAK
                        What?

                                 DARKO
                        This is the furthest we've fucking 
                        made it yet, man. 

           Mak peeks out. 

                                 MAK
                        Shit. 

                                 DARKO
                        It's just a straight run from here. 

           They look at each other. A moment of mental prep. And 
           they're off. 

           We follow them in slow motion as they run the final stretch.  

           We're in a closeup of their faces. They bear the expressions 
           of marathon runners during their final mile. 

           Suddenly Darko drops out of frame. Mak runs a few more feet 
           until he realizes he can't hear Darko's steps beside him. 

           Mak jumps into a ditch and then spins to see Darko lying on 
           the ground. 

                                 MAK
                        No...Darko!

           Darko doesn't respond. A few more BULLETS WHIZ BY. 

           Mak ducks to the ground. Shaking from the cold. 

                                 MAK
                        Darko!

           He jumps out of the ditch and crawls back towards him. When 
           he gets closer he sees the blood stain growing on Darko's 
           sheet. 

           He pulls Darko into the nearest ditch. Darko wheezes as his 
           lungs fill with blood.

                                 DARKO
                        Mak...

           He coughs. Some blood spurts out. 

                                 MAK
                        FUUUUUUUCK!
           Mak holds Darko in his arms. 

                                 MAK
                        Hold on. Hold on man. They'll grab 
                        us any minute. 

                                 DARKO
                        Don't stop. You're almost there. 
                        Just keep going. 

                                 MAK
                        Shut the fuck up. 

           We hold on them for a long time as Darko's wheezing gets 
           louder. 

           Mak turns towards Butmir. It's so fucking close.

           A LOUD SCHOOL BELL RINGS. 

           Mak turns to see Ivan staring down at them in the ditch. 
           Ivan turns and keeps running towards Butmir with the little 
           red backpack bouncing on his back. 

           Mak blinks. Ivan is gone. It's just Mak with his dying best 
           friend in his arms on this desolate white field. 

           The pool of blood grows. 

                                 DARKO
                        Tell me a good one. 

                                 MAK
                        I don't...I can't think of...

                                 DARKO
                        You're killing me, man.  

           Mak thinks. 

                                 MAK
                        Mujo runs into the bar all freaked 
                        out. Yelling. Haso! Haso! 
                        Someone...someone stole our car 
                        man! Haso goes "did you see who it 
                        was?" Mujo goes "No, but I wrote 
                        down the license plate."

           Darko smiles. 

                                 DARKO
                        That was always my favorite. 
                                 MAK
                        I know.

           Darko gathers the energy to speak.

                                 DARKO
                        Mak. It was my fault. 

                                 MAK
                        What was?

                                 DARKO
                        Bojan. The nurse came and she said 
                        we got another Serb and I 
                        said...you know where to put him. I 
                        don't know what came over me. I 
                        never did that before. I was tired 
                        and angry. I had enough. But 
                        then... I saw his name. And I ran 
                        over here. It was too late. I'm 
                        sorry.

           Mak tries to calm him down. 

                                 MAK
                        Stop. It wasn't your fault.

                                 DARKO
                        You think he'll forgive me?

                                 MAK
                        Yes. 

                                 DARKO
                        Will you?

           A beat. 

                                 MAK
                        Of course. 

                                 DARKO
                        Ok. Good. Thank you.
                             (beat)
                        Fuck man, I can't believe I'm 
                        really not gonna taste cheese 
                        again. 

           Off Darko's pained smile. 

           EXT. AIRPORT FIELD - NIGHT - LATER

           We travel with the Transporter from the terminal apron to 
           the two men at the end of the field, now covered with snow. 

           INT. TRANSPORTER - NIGHT

           Mak sits in the Transporter with Darko's wrapped body beside 
           him and the baby faced Italian Soldier looking away. 

           In his shaking hands is another carton of milk. 

                                 MAK
                        Where's his? 

           The SOLDIER looks him in the eyes. 

                                 ITALIAN SOLDIER
                        Do you want his? I can give it to 
                        you?

           Mak nods yes. As the Italian Soldier hands it to him Mak 
           slaps it out of his hands. Hard. It explodes all over the 
           floor. 

                                 MAK
                        Why are you doing this? Why won't 
                        you let us pass?

           The Italian Soldier shakes his head. 

                                 ITALIAN SOLDIER
                        I don't know. 

           EXT. BOSNIAN FRONTLINE - NIGHT

           Mak slumps his way towards HAMO, 30s, the BOSNIAN SOLDIER 
           that processed Mak's papers the night before. Mak looks like 
           a walking corpse. Hamo smokes a cigarette and leans on the 
           side of a car. 

                                 HAMO
                        Sun's not up yet. 

                                 MAK
                        No.

           As Mak gets closer Hamo sees the blood on Mak's white sheet. 

                                 HAMO
                        Your friend make it across?

           Mak can't bring himself to speak or move and somehow that's 
           all the answer Hamo needs. Hamo stomps out his cigarette. He 
           looks behind him and nods at another SOLDIER. 
                                 HAMO
                        You have half an hour left. Why 
                        don't you come with me.

           Mak looks at him. 

                                 MAK
                        I can't. 

                                 HAMO
                        Wasn't asking.

           Halo grabs him by the hand and pulls him.

                                 HAMO (CONT'D)
                        Don't make a sound or we're both 
                        fucked. 

           EXT. BOSNIAN TRENCH - NIGHT

           Mak follows Hamo through a 7 ft tall trench. They move fast. 

           The trench stops directly in front of the Control Tower. 
           There's a fence in front of it.  

                                 MAK
                        Where are you going?

                                 HAMO
                        You're gonna go right under their 
                        noses. 

           Hamo goes to the fence and pulls up a loose end.

                                 HAMO
                        30 steps forward, 10 to the right 
                        and then straight to avoid the 
                        snowed in ditches. You'll figure it 
                        out from there. I'm gonna nap in 
                        that trench but hopefully I never 
                        see you again. 

           Mak crawls under the fence. When Mak is on the other side 
           Hamo lets it drop. Hamo dusts himself off and turns away. 
           Lights another cigarette and disappears into the trench. 

           Mak turns towards the Control Tower. 

           He walks forward. Counting out steps in his head. Turns 
           right. 10 more and then straight until he hits the side of 
           the barracks. 

           From inside the barracks Mak hears ROSEANNE BARR ARGUING 
           WITH JOHN GOODMAN (O.S.). Somehow it only makes the moment 
           more terrifying. Mak drops to his hands and knees and crawls 
           directly under the window. 

           Through the window TWO SOLDIERS bask in the glow of the TV 
           and chuckle to themselves.

           Mak crawls to the other end of the barracks. As he stands 
           the sheet strapped to his back catches on a loose piece of 
           wood. RIIIIP.

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        You hear something?

           CANNED LAUGHTER. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        What? No. Argh. I missed that joke. 

           Mak rips the bloody and dirty sheet off like it's trying to 
           choke him. 

           EXT. AIRPORT APRON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           A crazed Mak flattens himself against a wall and peeks 
           around the corner. 

           Nobody there. Just stacks of containers. UN Aid shipments. 

           He moves around them carefully when suddenly he bumps into 
           NEDA, 20, a young girl in an army jacket and blue jeans. 

           Mak has a look in his eyes like he's ready to kill. Neda 
           steps back in horror. Ready to scream. He puts his finger to 
           his lips. 

                                 MAK
                        Shhhhhh.

                                 NEDA
                        I... I got lost.

                                 MAK
                        What are you going?

                                 NEDA
                        To the bosnian frontline. 

                                 MAK
                        You're going into sarajevo?

                                 NEDA
                        Yea. Medicine for my kid brother.
           Mak is awed. He points back to the front line. 

                                 MAK
                        Crawl under the window. You'll see 
                        my footsteps leading to the fence. 
                        Follow them. There's a soldier in 
                        the trench. He's a good man. 

                                 NEDA
                        Ok. Thank you. Neda.

                                 MAK
                        Mak.

                                 NEDA
                        Thank you, Mak.

           She hugs him and whispers something in his ear that we can't 
           hear. 

           And they split off in opposite directions. Mak passes by a 
           few more rows of containers until he reaches the open field 
           again. 

           Neda's footsteps in the snow are the only markings on the 
           snow cover. They zig zag all over the place. 

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. SARAJEVO - UNIVERSITY - CLASSROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Mak's hand pulls a red line from one point to another. The 
           dust off the red chalk swirls off the board in slow motion 
           and hyper definition

                                 MAK (V.O.)
                        The shortest distance between two 
                        points is, you got it, a straight 
                        line. 
                             (beat)
                        Now you just have to prove it. 

           EXT. AIRPORT APRON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Mak breaks into a mad dash. Not bothering to stay low he 
           just runs as fast as he can. His suitcase still in his 
           fucking hands. 

           We're in an extreme close up of his face. All we can hear 
           are his breaths and the BULLETS FLYING around him.

           Mak starts singing "Plima" by Indexi under his breath. We 
           hear a full verse. 

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

           The song continues as others sing a word here and there. 
           Jana. Ivan. Darko. Bojan. Amela. We only see their lips. 

           EXT. AIRPORT FIELD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Back on Mak out of breath but pushing forward. Just a little 
           bit longer. He can see the windows of the houses in Butmir! 
           Some of them have lights!

           Suddenly he throws his hands up and drops out of frame. 

           Oh shit. 

           Silence. The line of his footsteps are already getting 
           erased by new snow. 

           Mak COUGHS. 

           INT. FINAL TRENCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 

           We find Mak in a an eight foot deep trench.

           His boots are mired in looped barbed wire but the wrapped 
           magazines around his shins did their trick. He catches his 
           breath. He looks up.

           The Butmir side of the trench is closer to nine feet with 
           the shovelled out dirt on top. 

           He carefully extricates himself from the barbed wire. Pushes 
           it down and steps over it. He throws his suitcase down and 
           starts digging through the contents.  

                                 MAK
                        The spoon. Come on. Where the fuck 
                        are you? 

           Uh oh. Mak starts to panic. He can't find he fucking spoon. 
           He keeps rummaging but pretty soon it's clear that the spoon 
           is nowhere to be found.

           He desperately tries to kick into the dirt. Nothing. It's 
           completely frozen. 

           He undoes one of the metal plates on his palms and tries to 
           dig with it. It bends under the pressure. Useless. He throws 
           it away. 
                                 MAK
                        No, no, no, no!

           Mak paces up and down the side of the trench, mumbling to 
           himself. He tries jumping and grabbing on but it's too tall. 

           The sky is turning the color of morning.   

                                 MALE VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                        I don't know man, I'm getting 
                        fucking worried. 

           A voice from the Butmir side of the trench.

                                 MALE VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        I'm telling you, she made it. I can 
                        feel it.

                                 MAK
                        Wh...hello? Hey!

           The voices fall silent. 

                                 MAK (CONT'D)
                        I know you're there. I heard you. 
                             (beat)
                        I have a message from Neda.

                                 MALE VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                        Bullshit. 

                                 MAK
                        I'm not fucking kidding. We crossed 
                        paths. 

                                 MALE VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        What was she wearing?

                                 MAK
                        An army jacket and blue jeans. And 
                        she had long brown hair. 

           A beat. 

                                 MALE VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        What do you want?

                                 MAK
                        I need you to pull me up.

                                 MALE VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                        What was the message?
                                 MAK
                        Pull me up first!

           The two Men whisper on the other side and then we see KRESO, 
           20s, a curly haired nerd, lie down over the hump on the 
           trench and stick his hands out. 

           Mak first hands him the suitcase. Kreso grabs it and throws 
           it over. 

                                 MAK
                        Careful. 

                                 KRESO
                        Give me your fucking hands.

           Mak locks hands with Kreso. Kreso's legs are pulled by 
           NIKISA, 20s, his chubby friend. They huff and they puff they 
           and pull Mak out of the trench. 

           EXT. BUTMIR - NIGHT

           Mak crashes to the ground. Spread eagle. 

           The sun rises over the quaint houses of Butmir but we see it 
           upside down from Mak's POV.

                                 MAK
                         I'll see you in Sarajevo. 

           EXT. AIRPORT FIELD - DAY 

           Neda looks directly at us and smiles shyly. 

                                 KRESO (V.O.)
                        Thank you...

           EXT. BUTMIR - NIGHT

           Mak is sitting up. Kreso and Nikisa kneel on the ground with 
           him. 

                                 MAK
                        Hey. You guys going that way by any 
                        chance?

           He points away from the airport. They nod. Relieved smiles 
           all around. 
           INT. RED VOLVO - DAY

           Kreso drives. Nikisa is in the back.

           Mak sits in the passenger seat. He stares at the reflection 
           of the airport field getting further away. Sarajevo getting 
           further away. 

           Finally.

           Mak starts to cry. 

           MONTAGE - SCENERY

           Over the sounds of a TRAIN we see images of the Bosnian and 
           Croatian countryside. 

           EXT. CROATIA - ZAGREB - BUS STATION - DAY 

           The wheels of a bus roll to a stop. 

           PASSENGERS start pouring out. 

           Jana, dressed up to the nines, can't stop fidgeting with her 
           hair. She checks her reflection in a window. She looks 
           perfect but she decides to throw on another layer of 
           lipstick. Her hand is shaking. She exhales deeply. 

           She turns back and starts making her way through the people 
           flooding the platform. 

           She scans each and every face. 

           We see a flash of Mak's face. His hair combed back. Cleaned 
           up. He stands in place. 

           Jana keeps walking. She doesn't immediately recognize him. 

           She suddenly gasps and stops walking. Realization like 
           thunder after lightning. 

           ECHOING FOOTSTEPS sound like rain. Everyone on the platform 
           keeps moving but Mak and Jana stand a few feet apart facing 
           away from each other. 

           Mak has a giant smile on his face. The battered suitcase in 
           his hand. 

                                 MAK
                        Love, hasn't been that long has it?

           He turns to face her. 
           She slowly turns. Already hyperventilating.

           Their eyes meet. She opens her mouth to speak but nothing 
           comes out. 

           She runs and leaps into his arms. 

           Their hands wrap around each other like they're never 
           letting go again. 

           Mak kisses Jana. 

           INT. APARTMENT - KID'S ROOM - DAY

           The door swings open, letting light into the bedroom. 

           Ivan lies on his side. His eyes open. He looks a little 
           older. 

           Mak is in the doorway. Jana stands in the doorway behind 
           him, her makeup now a runny mess. 

                                 MAK
                        Up. Up. Up.  

           Ivan doesn't move. His eyes widen. 

                                 IVAN 
                             (whispers)
                        Tata...

           INT. ROOM - DAY

           Mak's hands unpack the suitcase.

           Photo albums.

           The Sarajevo Haggadah. 

           The little red backpack. 

           EXT. ZAGREB - STREET - DAY

           Mak holds Ivan's hand as they walk down the street. Sun is 
           out. Cars drive by. Birds sing. 

           Ivan wears the little red back pack as he hops down the 
           street.  

                                 IVAN
                        I'm nervous...
                                 MAK
                        Why?

                                 IVAN
                        I don't know. 

                                 MAK
                        You're gonna love it. Your teacher 
                        is smart and nice and you're gonna 
                        make all kind of friends...

           Ivan picks a dandelion. He blows the petals off. They fly 
           everywhere.  

                                 IVAN
                        What kind of a button won't 
                        unbutton?

                                 MAK
                        I don't know. 

                                 IVAN
                        A belly button!

           Ivan bursts out laughing at his own joke. He hugs his dad. A 
           dash of fear crosses his face. He doesn't let go. 

                                 IVAN (CONT'D)
                        And you're gonna pick me up?

                                 MAK
                        Of course. 

                                 IVAN
                        And when we get home we will play 
                        Street Fighter?

                                 MAK
                        You got it. 

                                 IVAN
                        And everything's gonna be ok?

           Mak shuts his eyes to stop himself from tearing up. 

                                 MAK
                        Everything's gonna be ok. 

                                 IVAN
                        Tata?

                                 MAK
                        Yea.
                                 IVAN
                        Thanks for taking me to school.

                                 MAK
                        Hey no problem kid.
                             (beat)
                        I'm sorry that I took so long to-

                                 IVAN
                        I'm just glad you're back. 

           Mak hugs him a little tighter. 

                                 IVAN (CONT'D)
                        You're squishing me.

           Mak lets go. Ivan takes a deep inhale. 

                                 IVAN
                        Ok. I can do this. 

                                 MAK
                        You can do this.

                                 IVAN
                        I can do this! Ahhhhh!

           He gives his dad a high five and runs off. Mak watches him 
           go into the school. 

           Mak turns away from us and whistles as he goes. "Bjezi Kiso 
           S Prozora" by Crvena Jabuka takes us out. 

                                                                 END
