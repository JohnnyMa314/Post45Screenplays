          Note: tonally, think a cross between My Best Friend's Wedding and 
          Into the Woods. Real, everyday people, who just happen to live in 
                              a Fairy Tale world.

           The time period is vaguely medieval; the setting, “fairy 
           tale.” 

           INT. A TEEN BEDROOM IN A PALACE

           The room is fairly baroque - there’s a vanity, a wardrobe, 
           and, in the center of the room, a huge canopy bed swathed 
           with pink airy drapes. 

           Other visuals clue us in to the fact that this is the bedroom 
           of a teen girl: maybe a little collage on the wall of various 
           teen-idol Princes; some gowns strewn on the floor in a moment 
           of angst; a teddy bear somewhere in the room.

           Into this setting storms JADE, 16, a young maiden in a poofy 
           ball gown. Her hair is done up in what we’d now call classic 
           “prom hair” -- elaborate updo with twin ringlets hanging down 
           on either side of her head.

           Jade SLAMS the door shut and throws herself onto the bed, 
           sobbing. Outside the door we hearing POUNDING, and the voices 
           of her harried, exasperated parents.

                                 FATHER O.C.
                        Sweetie?? Come on, open up.

                                 MOTHER O.C. 
                        Let’s just discuss this rationally!

                                 JADE
                        NO!!! There’s no POINT. I’m never 
                        leaving my room again.

           She takes her pillow and covers her head.

           Suddenly, though Jade doesn’t notice it through her pillow, 
           the room starts to get a bit hazy -- then the haze is 
           replaced with a burst of twinkling lights, and in that burst 
           appears:

           FAYE, a fairy godmother. Faye is around forty (ish.) though 
           it’s hard to tell from the billowy blue robes she’s wearing. 
           Through her hood, we can just see her face. 

           Her expression: Proficient in customer-service, and ready for 
           battle.

                                 FAYE
                        Ok. There, there.

           Jade looks up from her pillow, and startles. 
                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to count to three and 
                        take a big, deep breath.

                                 JADE
                        Who are you??

                                 FAYE
                        I’m your fairy godmother. 
                        Obviously. And we’re gonna get 
                        whatever you’re upset about all 
                        sorted out.

           Jade stops crying and perks up a bit.

                                 JADE
                        I didn’t even know I had a fairy 
                        godmother! 

                                 FAYE
                        Well, of course you do --
                           (she peers at the wall, 
                           where medieval-looking 
                           wooden letter cut-outs 
                           are arranged to spell 
                           “JADE’S ROOM”)
                        ...Jade!

                                 JADE
                        Did you do Cinderella?

                                 FAYE
                        No, but I work with the people who 
                        did! Now, why don’t you tell me 
                        what’s got you so upset.

                                 JADE
                        Well,

                                 FAYE
                        Let me guess: world hunger.

                                 JADE
                        There’s this ball tonight.

                                 FAYE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 JADE
                        And at first I didn’t even want to 
                        go because some of these things can 
                        be so lame, and like, who cares. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JADE (CONT'D)
                        But then Troy of Tundria -- do you 
                        know him? Blue castle at the edge 
                        of the forest?

                                 FAYE
                        With the four turrets?

                                 JADE
                        Six, but yes. He was like, “Hey, 
                        are you going?” And I was like “I 
                        dunno, are you?” And he was like, 
                        “I dunno, I was thinking about it.” 
                        WHICH I took to be a sign of a 
                        PRETTY CLEAR COMMITMENT!

           Faye raises her eyebrows.

                                 FAYE
                        Oh boy.

                                 JADE
                        So I make plans to go, but THEN I 
                        find out he’s actually going IN A 
                        GROUP (???!) that includes HILLARY 
                        von ESSEN -- she lives in that pink 
                        castle, next to the --

                                 FAYE
                        Sure, they just put in a new moat.

                                 JADE
                        And she’s wearing this like, SLINKY 
                        gossamer gown and I’m in this 
                        embarrassing PUFF PIECE that my MOM 
                        thought “LOOKED CUTE” which is 
                        never a good sign. And so you can 
                        understand how I cannot POSSIBLY go 
                        to the ball or actually ever leave 
                        my room again.

           Faye sits on the edge of Jade’s bed. First step is making the 
           client feel heard.

                                 FAYE
                        I get it. This has been a 
                        nightmare. 

                                 JADE
                           (nodding)
                        A total nightmare, thank you.

                                 FAYE
                        But we’re gonna fix it, ok? 
           Jade nods, feeling relieved. Faye knows she’s got this.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Ok. So first thing’s first. Do you 
                        have any pumpkins you’re not using 
                        right now?

           Jade frowns, and thinks.

                                 JADE
                        I’ve got an avocado?

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           In the driveway, Faye helps Jade get into a sleek, avocado-
           colored horse-drawn carriage. (Think: the Fiat 500 of 
           carriages.) 

           Jade is now wearing a chic, pale pink dress (that looks 
           vaguely Jenny Packham), and her hair is down in soft, loose 
           waves. She looks older, sophisticated, and thrilled.

                                 FAYE
                        Jade, what’s your curfew, usually?

                                 JADE
                        Daddy likes me to be home by 
                        twelve, but with mom I can 
                        sometimes get away with twelve-
                        thirty?

                                 FAYE
                        Ok, since this is a very special 
                        occasion, let’s go ahead and extend 
                        that curfew to one am, how’s that? 

                                 JADE
                        Really?! 

                                 FAYE
                        You just gotta keep an ear out for 
                        that bell-chime, cause at 1:01, 
                        this is guacamole, ok?

           Faye gestures over to MEATBALL, a ridiculously hot guy in a 
           driver’s uniform. Jade’s eyes boggle.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Meatball, you ready?

           Meatball climbs into the driver’s seat and takes the reigns.
                                 JADE
                        I can’t believe my hamster is so 
                        hot!

                                 FAYE
                        We’re gonna give Prince Troy an eye-
                        full.

           He winks at Jade.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, you good? You look good. Go 
                        have an amazing time!

           Faye gives Meatball a nod, and the carriage pulls away, with 
           Jade waving happily.

                                 JADE
                        Thank you, Fairy Godmother! Thank 
                        you so, so, much!!! 

                                 FAYE
                           (waving as the carriage 
                           recedes away)
                        You’re welcome!! Enjoy your youth 
                        because it ends!!!

           She stops waving.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        It all ends, kid.

           The doors to the house open, and Jade’s PARENTS, a middle-
           aged couple, step out.

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh. My. God???

                                 FATHER
                        You are a miracle worker!

                                 MOTHER
                        I haven’t seen her look happy since 
                        before she turned 12!!

           Faye takes a scroll out of her billowy robes and hands it to 
           the father.

                                 FAYE
                        Here’s my invoice. Any questions or 
                        issues, you can contact my office 
                        directly.
                                 FATHER
                           (looking at the scroll)
                        “Carriage rental, 2 days?” But it’s 
                        only one night.

                                 FAYE
                        She’s returning it after midnight, 
                        so I’m gonna have to charge for a 
                        second full day.

                                 FATHER
                        But --

                                 FAYE
                        Happily-ever-after doesn’t grow on 
                        trees. You can pay the office. 
                        Enjoy your night!! 

           INT. FAIRY GODMOTHER HEADQUARTERS - THE NEXT DAY

           The fairy godmother HQ is a fun, colorful place, that looks 
           very much like a normal office except for the bluebirds 
           flying around, the scribes instead of printers, the wands, 
           and fabrics and fairy tale touches everywhere. 

           Faye arrives, dressed in more casual, work-friendly attire. 
           She hangs her blue robe on a peg, next to ten or so identical 
           blue robs. The fairy godmother uniform. 

           In one part of the office is a large mirror. Faye checks her 
           appearance in the mirror, but then it starts to distort and 
           turns into an image of a TEEN GIRL, sobbing in a haystack. 
           Begonia looks up.

                                 BEGONIA
                        Oh, that’s one of mine.

           She heaves herself up, grabs a blue cloak, and with her wand, 
           pops herself out of the office.

           Faye’s assistant, Tilly (20s, enthusiastic, worships Faye) 
           rushes up to her as they make their way to Faye’s office.

                                 TILLY
                        Good morning!

                                 FAYE
                        It is a good morning, Tilly!

                                 TILLY
                        Seriously. The commission for Jade 
                        Fraprie’s already come in, my eyes 
                        actually watered at the amount.
                                 FAYE
                           (shrugging)
                        Girl’s got expensive taste.

           At that moment, a LEADER BOARD that says “Eligible Bachelors” 
           in the front of the office starts to flip -- think of an old-
           school train station arrivals, but instead of destinations, 
           we see actual faces and names.

           PRINCE TROY OF TUNDRIA -- who was in fourth position -- 
           disappears from the board. Everyone below him moves up. 

           The number one spot is occupied by PRINCE CARL of CARBONDALE - 
           impishly handsome, in a Harry Styles type way. 

                                 TILLY
                           (watching the board)
                        Wow, good for Jade.

                                 FAYE
                           (frowning)
                        Why is Prince Carl even on here? 
                        Seriously. 
                           (louder, to the office 
                           around her)
                        Can we get IT on this?

                                 TILLY
                        We can’t take Prince Carl off the 
                        list!!!

                                 FAYE
                        He’s just bringing down our 
                        average! Trust me, that guy is not 
                        settling down anytime soon.

                                 TILLY
                        Good! Means there’s hope for me.

                                 FAYE
                        Tilly. You are a lovely, smart, 
                        professional woman, please tell me 
                        you aren’t also under the sway of 
                        that walking waft of hairspray.

                                 TILLY
                        Once I saw him jump in a lake.

           Faye waits for her to continue.

                                 TILLY (CONT’D)
                        That’s it, that’s the end of the 
                        story.
           Faye rolls her eyes and starts walking towards her office. 
           Tilly hurries to keep up with her.

                                 TILLY (CONT’D)
                        Just because you’re married to your 
                        work doesn’t mean the rest of us 
                        need to be.

           Faye stops in her tracks, offended.

                                 FAYE
                        I’m not married to my work! I’m 
                        married to my --

                                 TILLY
                        Couch, yes, I know, I know.

                                 FAYE
                        I’m in a deeply committed 
                        relationship with my couch. We’ve 
                        got a great thing going. 

                                 TILLY
                        Not everyone is so lucky in their 
                        choice of furniture. Some of us 
                        would still like a Prince. Some of 
                        us would honestly settle for a 
                        candlestick maker, if he was nice, 
                        and single.

                                 FAYE
                        Fulfilment doesn’t come from 
                        relationships, Tilly. The sooner 
                        you learn that, the better.

           Faye continues towards her office.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        What else’ve we got today?

                                 TILLY
                        Upcoming events; Two balls coming 
                        up, a county fair, and a wedding.

                                 FAYE
                        Great, great.

                                 TILLY
                        AND, look what arrived from the 
                        Reynard’s....!

           Tilly opens the door to Faye’s office (cute, comfy 
           upholstered furniture everywhere) to reveal a huge, 
           overflowing BOUQUET of the most gorgeous flowers ever seen.
                                 FAYE
                           (delighted)
                        An edible arrangement!!!

           She plucks a dahlia out of the bouquet and takes a bite.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Salted caramel, but it’s got a 
                        little something...

                                 TILLY
                        Cardamom.

                                 FAYE
                        Wow, maybe.

                                 TILLY
                        Also, the boss would like to see 
                        you.

           Faye raises her eyebrows.

                                 FAYE
                        Do we know about what?

                                 TILLY
                        I was just told ASAP.

                                 FAYE
                        Then I’d better hi-ho.

           She heads out.

                                 TILLY
                        Can I eat the licorice ones if you 
                        don’t like them?

                                 FAYE
                        All yours, Tilly, you earned it!

           INT. THE MAKE-A-WISH OFFICE

           Faye makes her way through the office, stopping at various 
           stations, saying hi to coworkers, etc. She’s in a great mood.

           She walks by a SEWING STATION where a SEAMSTRESS is holding 
           bolts of beautiful, princess-y fabrics.

                                 FAYE
                        She looked beautiful last night.
                                 SEAMSTRESS
                           (happily)
                        Oh! I’ll be sure to let the mice 
                        know!

           She walks by a part of the office that looks like a GARAGE or 
           CAR SHOP, where a butch-ish fairy named FERN (let’s imagine 
           what that looks like...) is working on a carriage. She calls 
           out to Faye:

                                 FERN
                        Hey, Faye -- was it a guinea pig?

                                 FAYE
                        Hamster. You owe me $5! 

           She’s now made it to the other side of the office, where she 
           pauses outside glass-doors. A sleek-looking YOUNG 
           RECEPTIONIST greets her.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Congratulations on another great 
                        night, Faye.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, it went pretty well, I think!

           The Receptionist smiles and opens the door to:

           INT. TOM’S OFFICE - SAME

           A sort of man-cave in what is otherwise a very feminine 
           office environment. Leather couches, a sheepskin rug, bar 
           cart.

           Everywhere in the office are pictures depicting TOM, the CEO, 
           (50s, playboy, think Hugh Grant or Idris Elba), posing with 
           various celebrities recognizable within the fairy tale world. 
           (For instance, maybe a photo of him at a concert with BEAST 
           from Beauty and the Beast), or in a t-shirt that says 
           “HONORARY EIGHTH DWARF”.) 

                                 TOM
                        Faye!

                                 FAYE
                        Hi!

                                 TOM
                        My star! 
                                 FAYE
                           (falsely modest)
                        Oh, gosh --

                                 TOM
                        You are! You are! The 1 am curfew? 
                        Nice touch.

                                 FAYE
                        I wasn’t planning on that, that was 
                        an in-the-moment ad-lib.

           Tom heads to the bar cart.

                                 TOM
                        Chambord?

                                 FAYE
                        I’m good.

                                 TOM
                        We’ve just gotten in a new client 
                        request. This one’s gonna require a 
                        bit of panache.

                                 FAYE
                        I’ve got panache!

           Tom hands Faye a case file.

                                 TOM
                        Kenzie James. Heard of her?

                                 FAYE
                        No.

                                 TOM
                        Heard of her father? 

                                 FAYE
                        The...sorcerer? 

                                 TOM
                        That’s right.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, isn’t he supposed to be kind 
                        of evil?

           She opens the case file and starts flipping through it.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know, is he? He’s 
                        definitely kind of rich.
           Faye pulls out a photo of KENZIE (18, gorgeous, looks like a 
           Neutrogena model) and shows it to Tom.

                                 FAYE
                        Why does she need a fairy 
                        godmother? I want her hair.

                                 TOM
                        Well, an order has come in, so she 
                        must want something.

                                 FAYE
                        Someone needs to tell her, “You’ve 
                        got everything! You’re fine!” 

                                 TOM
                        You and I both have jobs all 
                        because Cinderella wanted 
                        something.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah but Cinderella was hardly in 
                        the same position as Kenzie James. 
                        And anyway, I wish I could go to 
                        Cinderella and say, “Look, I know 
                        you think you want to go to the 
                        ball, but what you really want are 
                        some life-skills that will give you 
                        a sense of self and meaning for the 
                        forty to fifty years you spend on 
                        this earth not being a boy-crazy 18 
                        year-old.

                                 TOM
                        Well, you’re a lot of fun. 

                                 FAYE
                        No, but I’m self-sufficient! Which 
                        is better!

                                 TOM
                        It doesn’t seem like the best day 
                        to question the entire premise of 
                        our company, I was about to offer 
                        you a raise! 

                                 FAYE
                        Really? How much?

                                 TOM
                        Well, you just focus on Kenzie 
                        James, and then we’ll talk numbers 
                        and self-reliance. 
           Faye gives a little nod, takes the case-file. 

                                 FAYE
                        Your mom, I think would have wanted 
                        us to be looking out for the 
                        Cinderellas of the world, not the 
                        Kenzie Jameses. 

                                 TOM
                        Nail this account, and we’ll talk.

           She nods and exits.

           INT. FAYE’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Faye’s one-bedroom bungalow is cozy and tasteful -- the kind 
           of place where you want to spend a rainy day.

           Faye, super dressed down (what’s the fairy tale version of 
           sweats?) opens her icebox. Empty. She peers in the bread box. 
           Nothing there, either. Finally, in the back of a cupboard, 
           she finds a jar of, let’s say, “the grey stuff,” from Beauty 
           and the Beast. It’s delicious! She grabs it, a spoon, and 
           plops down on the couch.

           She takes out Kenzie’s fact file.

                                 FAYE
                        “Kenzie.” With an “i-e.” Hmmm.

           She takes out various photos, and, for the first time, we 
           really see KENZIE. (Think Selena Gomez.) Kenzie’s got the 
           kind of sexy, entitled face that makes you want to slap her 
           if you’re over thirty, and be her if you’re under twenty-
           nine.

           Faye pulls out a Fact File.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                           (reading)
                        Likes: Balls, horseback riding. 
                        Collects: tiaras. Hates: drama. 
                        Previously connected to...

           She unfurls the scroll to reveal a comically huge list of 
           men.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. So what’s your deepest wish, 
                        Kenzie? World peace? Or. Something 
                        else?

           Faye’s cat jumps onto the couch and meows, unhappily.
                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, my money’s on that, too. 

           INT. KENZIE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Kenzie’s bedroom, like Jade’s, is recognizably teen. But this 
           one is cool teen. There’s no pink anywhere, nothing cutesy 
           about it. Dark purple, leather. Bad ass. The walls are 
           decorated with various portraits of...Kenzie. Kenzie looking 
           pout-y. Kenzie looking pout-y while holding a weasel (a la Da 
           Vinci portrait). Think selfies, but painted.

           Kenzie herself is sitting at her vanity, staring intensely at 
           her reflection in the mirror. She’s so concentrated that 
           she’s almost shaking. Another tear runs down her face.

           In the background, we see a familiar discoloration, and then 
           twinkle. FAYE pops into the room, back in her blue robes.

                                 FAYE
                        There, there, child. Don’t despair. 
                        I am your --

           Kenzie whirls around and stares at Faye.

                                 KENZIE
                        My fairy godmother! Right? Oh my 
                        god, I’ve been waiting forever! 

           Faye is thrown.

                                 FAYE
                        Oh. Well, we godmothers tend to 
                        appear only in your hour of most 
                        need...

           Kenzie pops up from her vanity and sits on the bed, patting 
           for Faye to sit down next to her. She seems to be in great 
           spirits actually.

                                 KENZIE
                        Totally. That makes sense. Well, 
                        sit down. Can I get you anything? 
                        Water? Wine? My dad’s mead? 

                                 FAYE
                        No, I’m fine...

                                 KENZIE
                        So how does this work, is this 
                        like, an intro session, like kind 
                        of a get to know you thing? What’s 
                        your name, by the way.
           Faye is totally off her game. This is SO weird. She’s not 
           used to not being in control.

                                 FAYE
                        I am your Fairy Godmother --

                                 KENZIE
                        No, I know, I mean what’s your name 
                        name, like what do other people 
                        call you?

                                 FAYE
                        ...Faye.

                                 KENZIE
                        Cute! So how long have you been 
                        doing this, Faye?

                                 FAYE
                        Uhm, I started as an apprentice 
                        under the Blue Fairy --

                                 KENZIE
                        Love her work.

                                 FAYE
                        Thank -- you know, usually with 
                        clients, I like to hear what you 
                        want, so then I can get started 
                        on...your wish. 

                                 KENZIE
                        Cool! Ok. So I’m really low-
                        maintenance, my wish is pretty 
                        simple.

                                 FAYE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 KENZIE
                        I want Prince Carl.

                                 FAYE
                        Offff course.

                                 KENZIE
                        I know. It’s like. A cliche. 

           Faye stands up. Maybe standing taller will make her feel in 
           control?

                                 FAYE
                        Kenzie, I gotta be honest...
                                 KENZIE
                        Yes! Please. 

                                 FAYE
                        I don’t get great vibes from Prince 
                        Carl. He’s just not the type of guy 
                        you wanna be with long-term. 

                                 KENZIE
                        You don’t think you can make it 
                        happen?

                                 FAYE
                        Oh, I can make it happen. For like. 
                        A night. 

                                 KENZIE
                        Great!! 

                                 FAYE
                        Just to re-iterate, I am your fairy 
                        godmother, I can make all your 
                        dreams come true, and you just want 
                        a one-night stand?

                                 KENZIE
                        See? I’m so easy.

                                 FAYE
                           (uncertainly)
                        Ok, if that’s your deepest -

                                 KENZIE
                           (happily)
                        That is my deepest wish!

           Faye nods.

                                 FAYE
                        There’s a black and white ball 
                        tonight. Prince Carl is hosting. 
                        We’ll get you in, and looking 
                        amazing. Prince Carl’s a sitting 
                        duck.

                                 KENZIE
                        Oh my god, thank you! We’re gonna 
                        love working together, I can 
                        already tell. Oh, one more request: 

                                 FAYE
                        Yes?
                                 KENZIE
                        Can you make me like. Funny?

           OFF Faye’s look.

           EXT. KENZIE’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Faye stands Kenzie on a patch of grass and walks about three 
           feet away from her, wand out.

                                 FAYE
                        Ok, let’s see, maybe something a 
                        little like....

           She taps her wand, and Kenzie is wearing a beautiful, 
           shimmery white gown.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        This.

           Kenzie peers down at herself, skeptically.

                                 KENZIE
                        Can I say something?

                                 FAYE
                        ...yes?

                                 KENZIE
                        I feel like white is not the right 
                        direction. It’s like, too bridal.

           Faye taps her wand.

                                 FAYE
                        Black?

           Kenzie’s dress turns black.

                                 KENZIE
                        What about red?

                                 FAYE
                        It’s the black and white ball?

                                 KENZIE
                        I don’t like the sparkles.

           Faye taps.

                                 FAYE
                        We can lose the sparkles.
                                 KENZIE
                        Can we lower the back? Like a low 
                        cut-out

                                 FAYE
                        Maybe a little....

           She taps.

                                 KENZIE
                        Even lower.

                                 FAYE
                        This is a very adult look on you.

           With her wand, Faye raises the neckline.

           Kenzie might not be convinced, but in truth, she looks like a 
           super model. Her dress looks like Sargent’s Madame X.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, you look amazing. Like, 
                        you may be peaking. I hope to god 
                        you’re peaking right now. 

           She pushes Kenzie into the waiting (Rolls Royce-ish?) 
           carriage.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Now remember. He’ll make his grand 
                        entrance, you curtsy, you’ll be 
                        introduced, you banter a little 
                        bit, maybe a dance. All goes well, 
                        he’ll ask you to “take a turn in 
                        the garden,” and then you’ll be 
                        home free.

                                 KENZIE
                        What does “take a turn in the 
                        garden” mean?

                                 FAYE
                        Let’s just say, all my clients who 
                        have “taken a turn in the garden,” 
                        have been very happy customers. And 
                        remember, you’ve got til midnight. 
                        Chime of twelve, the magic runs 
                        out. Now go, or you’ll be late!!

           She closes the door to the carriage.

                                 KENZIE
                        Wait, you aren’t coming with me?
                                 FAYE
                        No. What? I got you set up, you’re 
                        on your own now.

                                 KENZIE
                        No, no, no, no, you have to come!

                                 FAYE
                        That’s...not how it works, I’m your 
                        fairy godmother, not your plus one!

                                 KENZIE
                        But I’m not going to know anyone 
                        else there! 

                                 FAYE
                        That’s ok, you’ll meet people! Look 
                        at me, I can’t go to a ball right 
                        now, I’m not dressed.

                                 KENZIE
                        Oh my god literally no one is going 
                        to be looking at you. Get in the 
                        carriage!

           INT/EXT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT

           Faye is grumpily sitting up front with the driver. Inside the 
           carriage, Kenzie is sitting primly. 

                                 FAYE
                        I feel like this sort of ruins the 
                        effect. Besides, no one’s supposed 
                        to see the fairy godmother. We’re 
                        the “behind-the-scenes” people.

           The carriage lurches, some.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa! Easy on the curbs there, 
                        buddy. 

           Pan out to reveal the winding road approaching PRINCE CARL’S 
           PALACE.

           INT. THE GRAND FOYER - NIGHT

           Kenzie and a sheepish-looking Faye enter the foyer. An 
           ATTENDANT takes Kenzie’s wraps. He then tries to take Faye’s 
           robe.
                                 FAYE
                        Nope, no, I’m just going to hang on 
                        to this. Thank you.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You have to check your wand, ma’am.

                                 FAYE
                        I am only going to be here for 
                        like, a minute, just until my -- 

           She catches sight of Kenzie, down the hall, who gestures her 
           to hurry up.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Fine. Here you go.

           Faye hands the attendant her wand and runs to catch up to 
           Kenzie, who is with the major duomo, CHAUNCEY, at the 
           entrance of the Grand Ballroom.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Name?

                                 KENZIE
                        Kenzie Elizabeth James.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                           (announcing loudly to the 
                           ballroom)
                        The honorable KENZIE ELIZABETH 
                        JAMES, and --
                           (to Faye, quietly)
                        Name?

                                 FAYE
                        I’m actually just saying goodbye --

           Kenzie grabs her and pulls her into the ballroom.

                                 KENZIE
                        No, you’re coming in!

                                 CHAUNCEY
                           (announcing)
                        And guest! 

           INT. THE GRAND BALLROOM

           A black-and-white feast for the eyes. Ladies with feathers in 
           their hair and men in dashing suits waltzing around the room. 
                                 FAYE
                        Wow. It’s been a while since I’ve 
                        been to one of these.
                           (craning her neck)
                        Do you see any appetizer trays 
                        being passed around? I vowed to 
                        stop attending parties without food 
                        when I turned 30.

           Suddenly, Kenzie WHIRLS around and faces the other direction.

                                 KENZIE
                           (whispering frantically)
                        THERE HE IS.

           Sure enough, an excited murmur runs through the ballroom and 
           Prince Carl (too handsome to possibly have other redeeming 
           qualities) enters the ballroom. Everyone is staring, craning 
           their necks to catch a glimpse. As he makes his way through 
           the ballroom, girls are losing their cool - and Kenzie is no 
           exception.

           Kenzie takes a drink from a passing waiter, and starts 
           chugging.

                                 FAYE
                        Whoa, Kenzie.

                                 KENZIE
                        Do you see him? Don’t look.

                                 FAYE
                        You are acting, not cool as a 
                        cucumber. 

                                 KENZIE
                        DON’T LOOK.

                                 FAYE
                        Literally everyone is looking!! 

                                 KENZIE
                        What is he doing?

                                 FAYE
                        He’s...greeting people, I dunno. 

           Kenzie sneaks a peek.

                                 KENZIE
                        Oh my god, he looks INSANE.

                                 FAYE
                        Is that...good, I don’t --
                                 KENZIE
                        YES.

                                 FAYE
                        Ok! Well. Go talk to him!

                                 KENZIE
                        I can’t!!

           She grabs another glass off a passing WAITER.

                                 WAITER
                        Oh, these are actually the --

           Kenzie drains her cup.

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        -- used ones that I’m collecting, 
                        but.

           A receiving line has formed, and Prince Carl is making his 
           way towards them.

                                 FAYE
                        You have got to get a grip! Look, 
                        he’s coming over. Just, smile at 
                        him!

                                 KENZIE
                        I can’t.

                                 FAYE
                        Kenzie! You can’t let a guy shake 
                        you like this. Especially not this 
                        guy. He would be lucky to talk to 
                        you. I mean, what does he have 
                        going for him, an inherited title? 
                        Know what else he’s inheriting? 
                        Male pattern baldness. Look at his 
                        brother! In five year’s he’s going 
                        to bald as a --

           From behind, Faye hears a loud THROAT CLEAR. She turns. It’s 
           Chauncey, getting ready to introduce Prince Carl. Kenzie has 
           managed to slip away, and is no where to be seen.

           INT. THE BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Faye is rushing around, trying to find Kenzie, but it’s not 
           easy when everyone is wearing black and white.

           Finally, she catches a glimpse of her at the other end of the 
           ballroom, and starts making her way across the dance floor.
           Suddenly, the crowd parts like the red sea, forming a center 
           aisle with Faye in the middle. It’s a reel. Everyone claps 
           gamely to the music and looks at Faye, expectantly.

           This is her worst nightmare. This is everyone’s worst 
           nightmare. But it’s the fastest way to Kenzie on the other 
           side of the room.

           So Faye does a little dance across the floor. Whatever it is, 
           it is not cool. Think Ashlee Simpson on SNL levels of 
           embarrassing.

           Prince Carl, in mid-conversation, catches a glimpse of her 
           out of the corner of his eye. Who is this woman? 

           INT. THE OTHER END OF THE BALLROOM

           Faye finally catches up to Kenzie, who is standing faux-
           casually in a corner. [What is the fairy tale version of 
           texting because of social anxiety? That’s what she’s doing.]

                                 KENZIE
                        Hey Faye, what’s up?

                                 FAYE
                        Not much, just hanging out at this 
                        BALL that I don’t want to be at. 
                        Kenzie, why am I here?

                                 KENZIE
                           (whiney)
                        Isn’t the whole deal that the 
                        Prince is supposed to notice me?

                                 FAYE
                        How can he when you keep avoiding 
                        him?

                                 KENZIE
                        I can’t go up to him when he’s 
                        surrounded by other people --

                                 FAYE
                        IT’S A BALL.

                                 KENZIE
                        Can’t you just. Get me alone with 
                        him?
                                 FAYE
                        What you need is a wing woman. You 
                        really don’t have any friends here 
                        who you can pair up with? You know, 
                        someone your age?

                                 KENZIE
                        No way, girls are so much drama. 

                                 FAYE
                           (shaking her head)
                        Oh, no. Wrong attitude to have 
                        about fellow women, these are your 
                        sisters, you need to rely on each 
                        other to survive in a patriarchal --

                                 KENZIE
                        Listen, Faye, I know you’re wigging 
                        out right now --

                                 FAYE
                        YOU ARE!

                                 KENZIE
                        Here’s what we’re gonna do. I’m 
                        going to wait in that antechamber. 
                        And you get the Prince to come meet 
                        me. And then I’ll handle the rest.

                                 FAYE
                        How am I supposed to get the Prince 
                        to leave his own ball to come meet 
                        you?

           Kenzie shrugs.

                                 KENZIE
                        Magic?

           Faye grimly drains her cup.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. THE GRAND BALLROOM

           Prince Carl is entertaining a small group of courtiers, mid-
           story.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        And it’s just surrounded by the 
                        THICKEST briar you’ve ever seen. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT'D)
                        And my horse just gives me this 
                        look, like, “I’m not going in 
                        there!”

           The group laughs. Faye fake-laughs harder than everyone, 
           which makes everyone stare at her. 

                                 FAYE
                        Hi.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Hello...?

                                 FAYE
                        Your majesty, there’s been 
                        a....kertuffle. In the antechamber.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Uhm.

                                 FAYE
                           (improvising)
                        Your horse might be in trouble. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Why is Stefan in the antechamber?

                                 FAYE
                        I don’t know, but we better go see!

           The crowd begins to move towards the door.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        ....alone!

           The crowd stops. Prince Carl reluctantly follows Faye. 
           Everyone is weirded out by this exchange.

           INT. THE ANTECHAMBER

           Kenzie is pacing nervously around. Behind the curtain, she 
           hears FAYE.

                                 FAYE
                           (off-camera)
                        You go in! I’m too scared!

           The Prince peeks in. Before he can really register her, 
           Kenzie runs out through another door.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        There’s nothing in here.
                                 FAYE
                        What are you talking about? What 
                        about the beautiful young --

           She enters.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Looks like we’re alone in here. 

           Over the Prince’s shoulder, Faye sees through the window 
           Kenzie run down the palace steps.

                                 FAYE
                        I hate balls!!!!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Did you take me away from my party 
                        so you could tell me how much you 
                        hate my party?

                                 FAYE
                        Honestly, no, but while I’ve got 
                        you here: There are not enough 
                        chairs in there. Where are people 
                        supposed to sit? Not everyone likes 
                        dancing!!!

           Carl laughs, half-shocked, half-amused.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        For your information, I don’t 
                        really like balls either, I like 
                        after-balls.

                                 FAYE
                        Is that when you get to eat?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Among other things. 

                                 FAYE
                        Well, I hope you have a very good 
                        after-ball tonight.

           She heads towards the door.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Would you like to take a turn in 
                        the garden?

           Faye looks at him, stunned.

                                 FAYE
                        What?
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Would you like to take a turn in 
                        the garden?

                                 FAYE
                        No, I heard you.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok. You said “what”, so --

                                 FAYE
                        Me? You want to take a turn in the 
                        garden with me? 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Isn’t that why you called me in 
                        here?

                                 FAYE
                        No. Oh my god, no, you sweet little 
                        child.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok, I must have misunderstood.

                                 FAYE
                        You completely misunderstood I am. 
                        Older than you.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh, I know! But I’m down.

           She blushes.

                                 FAYE
                        Wow, I am...flattered, actually. 
                        But no. Thank you. No. That is! I 
                        will say, that is good for the ol’ 
                        self-esteem, though!

           She claps him on his bicep in what she hopes is a fraternal 
           way. 

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                           (re his arm, which she is 
                           now feeling)
                        Wow, that is. You are rippley! It 
                        has been a while. Since I’ve felt. 
                        Young flesh. Or any. Flesh.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Sounds like you’ve gone too long 
                        without flesh.
           Faye’s eyelids flutter involuntarily, but she recovers. 

                                 FAYE
                        Wow. Ok. You are...those are some 
                        pretty expert moves! I can see...I 
                        can see the appeal! For. Younger 
                        women. But I can’t. It wouldn’t be 
                        professional.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Professional?

           Faye catches herself. Needs to improvise.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes. I’m a. Carriage driver.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        No way! A female carriage driver? 

                                 FAYE
                        Yes. What glass ceiling??? 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well I definitely want to go for a 
                        walk with a female carriage driver.

           She moves even further away from him.

                                 FAYE
                        I bet the food-to-alcohol ratio at 
                        your balls works in your favor when 
                        you ask people this. Would it kill 
                        you to pass around some mini-
                        sliders?

           She makes for the exit again.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Wait, where are you going?

                                 FAYE
                        Home to EAT.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Are you seriously that hungry?

                                 FAYE
                        In general, or right this second? 
                        Cause the answer to both is yes.

                                                           CUT TO:
           INT. THE ROYAL KITCHENS

           The Prince leads Faye into the busy, bustling Royal Kitchens. 

           Everyone stops when The Prince enters and bows, but he waves 
           them up.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        No need to stop! Just grabbing a 
                        bite.

           He brings Faye to a Chef’s station, where a comically Fairy 
           Tale-esque CHEF (think: Les Poisson from Little Mermaid) has 
           just finished cleaning up for the night and is hanging up his 
           apron.

                                 CHEF
                        Your majesty.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Hey, Jean-Claude. Hoping we could 
                        trouble you for a snack -- just 
                        something really easy, I don’t want 
                        to trouble you.

                                 CHEF
                        Certainly. What will it be?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                           (to Faye)
                        What’s your fancy?

                                 FAYE
                        What do you... recommend?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Welllllll, the palace specialty is 
                        gingerbread, it’s the absolute best 
                        you’ll ever taste. But if you’re 
                        more in the mood for savory we 
                        could do a cheese plate, maybe a 
                        little grouse pate’? There are some 
                        pickled apricots from the garden. 
                        Or if you’re really hungry, I know 
                        there’s lots of pheasant leftover 
                        from dinner, we could do that in 
                        some bread? Sorry, I’m sort of a 
                        foodie. Does any of that sound 
                        good?

                                 FAYE
                        Yes, please. 
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        To which?

                                 FAYE
                        All of it?

           The Prince grins. The Chef grimly puts on his apron. 

           INT. THE GRAND BANQUET ROOM - LATER

           Faye and The Prince are seated at an insanely large banquet 
           table with a feast laid out in front of them. They’re gorging 
           themselves, Faye talks with her mouth full:

                                 FAYE
                        By the way, this table? Bigger than 
                        my entire apartment. How many 
                        people live here?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well, including staff, we’ve 
                        actually got around --

                                 FAYE
                        No, how many people who eat at this 
                        table live here?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh. Just me, my brother, and my 
                        sister-in-law.

                                 FAYE
                        Wow.

           Faye takes her wine and pads over to the wall, where she 
           examines a FORMAL PORTRAIT of PRINCE ALISTAIR and PRINCESS 
           GRISELDA on their wedding day.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                           (gazing at the picture)
                        Ah. Your brother’s Royal Wedding. 
                        You know, we’re desperate for 
                        another one.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yes, so I’m told. Continuously. 

                                 FAYE
                        So what’s the hold up?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What’s the rush? Are you married?
                                 FAYE
                           (shaking her head)
                        Mmm-mm.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What’s the hold-up on your end?

           Faye wrinkles her nose. Goes back to looking at the 
           portraits, without looking at The Prince.

                                 FAYE
                        I know a good girl for you. One 
                        you’d like.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh yeah?

           Without looking at him, Faye strolls along the wall of 
           portraits.

                                 FAYE
                        She’s young. Effervescent. And 
                        confident in a way that 
                        is...inspiring. Once you get used 
                        to it. And... 

           She stops in front of a portrait of a chubby, unfortunate-
           looking little boy.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Who’s this one? Do you keep him in 
                        the basement? 

           The Prince reddens, embarrassed.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh. That’s me.

                                 FAYE
                        WHAT?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yeah. When I was 13.

                                 FAYE
                        That looks nothing like you!!!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I know. I mean a little is puberty 
                        but I also genuinely don’t think 
                        that was a good artist. 

                                 FAYE
                        I can’t get over it.
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’m very handsome now!

                                 FAYE
                        Are you wearing a dress?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        No, that’s -- it’s a family 
                        tradition for the second-born 
                        Prince to be drawn in our Great-
                        Grandfather’s peignoir.

                                 FAYE
                        In his what?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Food’s getting cold! We better eat! 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - LATER

           The feast is decimated. They’re into their second bottle of 
           wine. Faye, a little tipsy at this point, has kicked off both 
           her shoes, and is barefoot.

           Prince Carl leans way back in his chair. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok, question.

                                 FAYE
                        Okay.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        It’s a rude one...

                                 FAYE
                        What? Don’t ask a rude question!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        How old are you?

           Faye swats at him.

                                 FAYE
                        RUDE! You’re rude!

           He giggles.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Was that totally the rudest 
                        question?
                                 FAYE
                        No, technically there’s one that’s 
                        ruder, but PRETTY CLOSE!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’m just curious!

                                 FAYE
                        I am too old to answer that 
                        question, how about that?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Were we born in the same decade?

                                 FAYE
                        NO. Happy?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yeah, kind of.

                                 FAYE
                        I am old enough to be your --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Mother?

                                 FAYE
                        I was going to say babysitter, you 
                        monster!

           She starts swatting at him again. Laughing, he tries to hide 
           under his napkin. (?) Idk, they’re both pretty tipsy.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I meant babysitter! 

                                 FAYE
                        God, kids these days!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I meant babysitter!

           They’re both laughing. Suddenly, Prince Carl leans over and 
           kisses her. She pulls back.

                                 FAYE
                        Whoa. Whoa.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Is that ok?

                                 FAYE
                        No! It’s not ok! 
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        You are married.

                                 FAYE
                        I’m not married. I’m just. 
                        Unavailable.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What does that mean?

                                 FAYE
                        It means I’m not available for...

           She makes a vague gesture with her hands.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        For this type of thing.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I mean, I’m not particularly 
                        available either, I just thought -- 

           He leans in close again.

                                 FAYE
                        “Not particularly available” used 
                        to be my type. Luckily, I am now a 
                        mature woman. I haven’t been that 
                        easy for a long, long time.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. PRINCE CARL’S ROYAL BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Very masculine and man-cave-y. Bearskin rug on the floor. Re-
           purposed wood. But like. Royal-looking.

           In bed, Prince Carl is shirtless and fast asleep. Next to 
           him, is...Faye. She sits up in bed, covers herself with her 
           blue robe. She’s otherwise completely naked. Her hair is 
           messed up.

                                 FAYE
                        Ohhhhh, no, no, no.

           Prince Carl stirs.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        You ok?

                                 FAYE
                        No?!?!?!?!
                                 PRINCE CARL
                           (sitting up)
                        What’s wrong? Should I send for 
                        someone?

           He moves over to a bell on the night stand. Faye practically 
           jumps on him to keep him from ringing.

                                 FAYE
                        NO, don’t SEND for anyone. No one 
                        can see us together!!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well, Chauncey can --

                                 FAYE
                        Who is “Chauncey” ?!?!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        He’s my right-hand-man --

                                 FAYE
                        No, no, no, no one in this castle, 
                        or in this town, or in this kingdom 
                        can know about this. PLEASE, no one 
                        can know.

           Faye gets out of bed, starts getting dressed. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                           (hurt)
                        Well, why are you so worried about 
                        it? You hooked up with a Prince. I 
                        just hooked up with a female 
                        carriage driver.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes, I’m sure adding yet another 
                        notch to your belt is going to be 
                        ruinous for you.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        You know, maybe it’s best if you 
                        leave.

                                 FAYE
                        ...YA THINK???

                                 PRINCE CARL
                           (reaching for the bell)
                        I’ll have Chauncey show you out.

                                 FAYE
                        NO! No need. 
           She looks under the bed.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen my other shoe?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Let me just walk you out.

                                 FAYE
                        I can find the way out myself. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        It’s a pretty big castle.

                                 FAYE
                        I’ve been in bigger. 

           Prince Carl forces himself to laugh, in what he hopes is a 
           rueful way, as Faye continues to desperately look for her 
           shoe.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh, I highly doubt that. Who’s? 
                        Who’s is bigger?

           Faye gives up on the shoe search, and turns to face the 
           Prince. 

                                 FAYE
                        Thank you for the lovely evening. 
                        It was a lovely ball. Goodbye.

           She hops out the window.

           Prince Carl huffily rolls over and tries to go back to sleep. 
           But it’s no use. After a moment, he huffily reaches over and 
           starts ringing the bell persistently.

           INT. THE BANQUET - LATER THAT MORNING

           Prince Carl is seated, eating breakfast. The only other two 
           occupants are his balding, but affable older brother, PRINCE 
           ALISTAIR, and his new(-ish) wife, PRINCESS GRISELDA. 

           Chauncey is coming around, serving coffee.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        Good ball last night?

                                 PRINCE CARL 
                           (non-committal)
                        Mmm.
                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Sorry for missing it! Though I’m 
                        sure you had fun without us. We 
                        would have just cramped your style.

           She winks at Prince Alistair, who squeezes her hand.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        I don’t know how you keep it up. 
                        Talk to different people all night, 
                        make small talk, wake up the next 
                        morning with a hangover. So 
                        exhausting!
                           (to Chauncey)
                        Thank you, Chauncey.

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        We are so old.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        We are so old, it’s like -

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Pathetic -

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        Really pathetic.

           They beam at each other. Prince Carl glowers. He is not 
           enjoying this.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR (CONT’D)
                           (to Carl)
                        I honestly don’t know how you 
                        manage it.

           While pouring coffee for Prince Carl, Chauncey catches a 
           glimpse of something under the table. He quickly bends down 
           and retrieves FAYE’S SHOE from the night before. It’s not a 
           sexy shoe -- but rather a sensible shoe. Maybe there are some 
           Dr. Scholl’s inserts in there. 

           Chauncey and Prince Carl make eye-contact. Chauncey quickly 
           and silently slips the shoe into his pocket. Carl smiles at 
           him, gratefully.

           INT. FAIRYGODMOTHER HQ - LATER THAT MORNING

           Faye, showered and changed, strides into the office.

           Yes, last night did not go according to plan. But she’s a 
           professional. She can deal.
           Tilly approaches her, nervously.

                                 FAYE
                           (quickly)
                        Good morning, Tilly! Sorry I’m late 
                        --

                                 TILLY
                        What hap --

                                 FAYE
                        Crazy morning, I’ll explain 
                        everything later, but for right 
                        now, quick question, have we heard 
                        from Kenzie James this morning, yes 
                        or no?

                                 TILLY
                        ...yes.

                                 FAYE
                        Ok, ok, that’s fine, I will.....pay 
                        her a call...in a bit! After I do 
                        some. Other work. Other paper work. 
                        And some thinking! But mostly 
                        paperwork.

                                 TILLY
                        She’s here.

                                 FAYE
                        What do you mean, here?

                                 TILLY
                        Like, in your office.

           Faye blanches.

                                 FAYE
                        How....does she know about...the 
                        office?

                                 TILLY
                        I don’t know. I feel like she knows 
                        everything. I’m very intimidated by 
                        her. Is that her real hair?

           Faye gestures to her closed office door.

                                 FAYE
                        She’s in here right now?
                                 TILLY
                           (nods)
                        Mmm-hmm.

                                 FAYE
                        Ok.

           She puts her hand on the door knob.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Tilly, while I’m in there, can you 
                        bring me an enormous cannister of 
                        water and some sort of fried 
                        poultry leg?

                                 TILLY
                        Hungover, eh?

                                 FAYE
                        What? No! What?

                                 TILLY
                        ...just kidding! Obviously!

           Faye is about to open the door, when Tom pops up behind her, 
           startling both her and Tilly.

                                 TOM
                        Hey!

                                 FAYE
                        Yes! Hey. Hey hey. 

           She immediately drops her hand from the door and leans 
           against it.

                                 TOM
                        How’d it go last night?

                                 FAYE
                        So great.

           He cups his hands to his ear.

                                 TOM
                        What’s that I hear?

                                 FAYE
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Wedding bells chiming? 
                                 FAYE
                        Oh, yes!

                                 TOM
                        Another bachelor bites the dust!

                                 FAYE
                        Yes indeed-y. I just have. A little 
                        follow-up work to do with her. Just 
                        to seal the deal.

                                 TOM
                        Well, just make sure he puts a ring 
                        on it. I hear that Prince will 
                        sleep with anyone. 

           Faye laughs. Tom slaps her on the back and walks away.

                                 FAYE
                        Listen to me, Tilly.

           Tilly leans in, listening.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to take care of 
                        everything. Everything is going to 
                        be alright. 

           Tilly, now extremely worried, gives an uncertain nod. 

           Faye swings open the door to her office.

           INT. FAYE’S OFFICE -SAME 

           Kenzie is in there, waiting.

                                 FAYE
                        Hi--

                                 KENZIE
                        I came in person because we really 
                        need to talk.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah. Listen, Kenzie --

                                 KENZIE
                        I am so sorry about last night. I 
                        just like, lost my cool in a a way 
                        that I really did not expect to. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENZIE (CONT'D)
                        I mean I’ve had boyfriends before, 
                        obviously, but Prince Carl is like 
                        a whole new level, I mean he’s a 
                        Prince! He’s been with literally 
                        the most beautiful women in the 
                        world! So I freaked. I’m not 
                        perfect!! And I totally left you 
                        hanging at a ball you didn’t even 
                        want to be at. I swear I’m not 
                        usually like this. I just really 
                        hope you can give me another shot. 
                        Oh my god, was it so awkward with 
                        the Prince in the antechamber?

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah. It was..pretty awkward.

                                 KENZIE
                        Oh my god I’m DYING. I am so sorry, 
                        Faye. I promise I’ll never make you 
                        talk to him ever again.

                                 FAYE
                        How about we strike last night from 
                        the record.

                                 KENZIE
                        Yes. Please. 

                                 FAYE
                        Anyway, it was totally the wrong 
                        tack. A ball is so crowded, there’s 
                        no time to talk. I think Prince 
                        Carl is the type of guy who does 
                        better one-on-one. He actually 
                        doesn’t even like balls that much! 
                        He’s more of a “let’s get to know 
                        each other over a glass of wine,” 
                        type of guy. And he loves books! We 
                        need to show him you’re a reader.

                                 KENZIE
                        Wow, how do you know all this?

           Faye laughs.

                                 FAYE
                        Kenzie. I’m a professional. The 
                        best in the business. 

                                 KENZIE
                        No, I know! You totally are.
                                 FAYE
                        Let’s orchestrate a one-on-one. 
                        Somewhere...pastoral. 

                                 KENZIE
                        Yes. Great.

                                 FAYE
                        It can’t seem pre-meditated. And no 
                        sultry outfits. We’re going to make 
                        you look young. Fresh. Virginal.

           At this, Kenzie looks worried.

                                 KENZIE
                        Oh, I’m not a --

                                 FAYE
                        I said virginal. 

                                 KENZIE
                        Ok. Yes! Whatever you think it’ll 
                        take.

           Faye smiles. 

           INT. THE FAIRY GODMOTHER HQ - LATER

           Faye, newly invigorated, strides through the office with 
           Tilly struggling to keep up.

                                 FAYE
                           (to Tilly)
                        Last night never happened. It was 
                        just a blip, Tilly. Sometimes, 
                        there are blips. A true 
                        professional doesn’t let it throw 
                        her. 

                                 TILLY
                        Totally agree. 

                                 FAYE
                        Kenzie’s gotta seem different from 
                        the women he’s used to. 
                        Approachable. Fresh.

                                 TILLY
                        How are you going to manage that? 
                        Kenzie’s not approachable. 
                                 FAYE
                        Well, it looks like she’s going to 
                        need a fairy godmother to transform 
                        her, doesn’t it?

           INT. FG HQ - SEAMSTRESS CORNER

           Faye and Tilly are talking to the seamstress, looking at 
           different fabrics. 

                                 FAYE
                        Something light, fresh, even 
                        gamine, you know? Something that’ll 
                        really showcase her innocence.

           The seamstress raises her eyebrows.

                                 SEAMSTRESS
                        This is for Kenzie James?

                                 FAYE
                        Mmhmm.

                                 SEAMSTRESS
                        What was wrong with the dress from 
                        last night?

                                 FAYE
                        Oh, it was great! You guys did a 
                        great job. I think that it was just 
                        a little too too, if that makes 
                        sense?

                                 SEAMSTRESS
                        Not particularly.

                                 FAYE
                        I think we’re just gonna wanna go a 
                        bit more simple, this time around.

                                 SEAMSTRESS
                        Ok. I’ll talk to the mice. They’re 
                        not gonna be happy with the quick 
                        turn-around.

                                 FAYE
                        I know I know I know, just tell 
                        them it’s for me. The mice love me.

                                 SEAMSTRESS
                        No, they don’t.
                                 FAYE
                        Maybe something “milkmaid-y?” I 
                        dunno, I’m just throwing adjectives 
                        out there, you’re the expert, I 
                        trust your taste. Maybe a linen? I 
                        dunno, I dunno, leaving it up to 
                        you!!!!

           INT. THE CARRIAGE SHOP

           Fern is working on the undercarriage of...a carriage. Faye 
           and Tilly approach.

                                 FERN
                        What can I do for you?

                                 FAYE
                        Something a little different this 
                        time.

                                 FERN
                        Ok...

                                 FAYE
                        I need something that will pop a 
                        wheel off.

                                 FERN
                        Like, break the carriage?

                                 FAYE
                        But make it look totally normal. 
                        Nothing that would cause serious 
                        damage, just something to...delay.

                                 FERN
                        Uh --

                                 FAYE
                        Just enough to theoretically stall 
                        for a bit til someone can come with 
                        a new tire. Or four. 

                                 FERN
                        I’m reallllllly not supposed to do 
                        stuff like that -- it’s an 
                        insurance nightmare.
                                 FAYE
                        Oh, I know, I know, but. I’ve 
                        cleared this with Tom.

           Tilly’s eyes raise, in surprise.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a very special client, and 
                        he’s given us carte blanche. To 
                        pull out all the stops.

                           (uncertainly)
                        Ok...if Tom’s cleared it --

           INT. THE PROPS WAREHOUSE - ENTRANCE

           Faye and Tilly are walking in the bowels of the office, a 
           section we haven’t seen before. 

                                 TILLY
                        So what is she like to work with? 
                        Is she like. Bitchy?

                                 FAYE
                        No, actually. Maybe a little high-
                        strung, but not bitchy. But I 
                        thought she would be, too. Why is 
                        that?

           Tilly shrugs.

                                 TILLY
                        She just seems a little bitchy! She 
                        gives off bitchy vibes.

                                 FAYE
                           (nods)
                        She gives off bitchy vibes. 

                                 TILLY
                        Something about her.

           Faye approaches a woman at a desk outside the door.

                                 FAYE
                        Hi, there.
           Faye smiles at the woman and signs in.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Just make sure to sign for anything 
                        you take, ok?

                                 FAYE
                        Yep, will do.

           The receptionist taps her wand, and Faye and Tilly enter 
           the...

           INT. PROPS WAREHOUSE

           It kind of looks like a Costco, but for fairy tales: rows 
           upon rows of shelves stacked with various recognizable fairy 
           tale props, sort of dusty, almost boringly displayed. 

           Tiaras...poison bottles...glass slippers in all 
           sizes...enchanted roses...robes, hoods, crowns, potions, 
           apples, sewing needles, diadems, petticoats, etc.

           Tilly grabs a huge, Ikea-esque cart.

                                 FAYE
                        Ok, we’re looking for “woodsy, 
                        rustic.”

                                 TILLY
                        Got it.

           The two begin “shopping” down the aisles, heading first to a 
           section that contains all sorts of baskets. Faye starts 
           examining a few.

                                 TILLY (CONT’D)
                        So Prince Carl didn’t even see her 
                        last night?

                                 FAYE
                        Yes! Of course he did!

                                 TILLY
                        Then I don’t get it. I don’t get 
                        how he could have seen her and not 
                        fallen in love with her. I mean, is 
                        he blind?

           Faye, ignoring her, picks up a wicker basket.

                                 FAYE
                        I think this one.
           INT.  ANOTHER AISLE - LATER

           Tilly is continuing to push the cart, which now has the 
           basket, other props in it.

                                 TILLY
                        At one point in the office, she 
                        took her hair out of her ponytail 
                        and I actually gasped. Like, I 
                        gasped at how beautiful she is.

           Faye selects some books from a nearby display, puts them into 
           the cart.

           INT. THE SHOE AISLE

           Faye is investigating some black and brown ballerina 
           slippers.

                                 TILLY
                        What do you think she eats on any 
                        given day? Like on a normal day, 
                        what does she eat?

                                 FAYE
                        It didn’t come up.

                                 TILLY
                        I want to know everything she eats 
                        on any given day, and copy it.

                                 FAYE
                           (re: shoes)
                        Maybe she should just go barefoot? 
                        Or is that slutty?

           Tilly wrinkles her nose.

                                 TILLY
                        Slutty.

           INT. THE SHRUBBERY AISLE

           Faye is choosing between different tree stumps, testing them 
           out by sitting on them.

                                 TILLY
                        I bet they’re going to have the 
                        most amazing-looking children. 
                        Like, those are two people that you 
                        just want to procreate. His height, 
                        and her --
                                 FAYE
                        TILLY!

                                 TILLY
                        What?

                                 FAYE
                        I get it. She’s very beautiful. 
                        He’s very beautiful. They are going 
                        to live attractively ever after. 
                        Now just. Help me. Pick a tree 
                        stump. 

           Tilly nods, chastened. After a beat, she points to the tree 
           stump on the right.

                                 TILLY
                        That one.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah?

                                 TILLY
                           (nodding)
                        I think it’s good. 

           INT. FAYE’S BUNGALOW - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Faye arrives home, exhausted. Her cat comes over. Meows. 

                                 FAYE
                        Hey there, Cat! Did you miss me?

           She picks up the cat and tries to snuggle it for a moment. 
           The cat reacts wildly, scrambling to get out of her arms.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, ok, ok, ok!

           She sets the cat down. It sprints out of the room.

           Faye sighs. Takes off her robes. Looks on the mirror. Pulls 
           aside her collar to reveal a HICKEY on her collarbone. She 
           stares at it, guiltily. 

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who’s 
                        the skankiest of them all?

           The mirror - which, of course, is a MAGIC MIRROR -- starts to 
           glow.
                                 MIRROR
                        That would be Beth Swansdale of 
                        Little Gribbling.  

           Faye exhales, relieved.

                                 FAYE
                        So we’re good! We’re good.

           She blows out the candle, walks into her room.

           EXT. THE WOODS - THE NEXT DAY

           A beautiful clearing overlooking a pristine, alpine-looking 
           river. Faye is buzzing around, arranging the PROPS we saw her 
           pick out earlier: the tree stump, etc.

           Kenzie appears, dressed in a Renaissance-y, maiden-y type 
           outfit. Maybe even milkmaid braids. No makeup. It’s hard to 
           believe, but she looks even better than we’ve ever seen her.

                                 KENZIE
                        I feel ridiculous, I would never 
                        leave the house like this.

                                 FAYE
                        You should, because you look 
                        incredible.

                                 KENZIE
                        Can I give you a makeover? That 
                        would be so fun --

                                 FAYE
                        No.

                                 KENZIE
                        Can I at least get something to 
                        kind of lift --

           She tugs at her boobs a bit.

                                 FAYE
                        No, remember the goal is virginal.

                                 KENZIE
                        Uhm, can I just say something?

                                 FAYE
                        ....yes. 
                                 KENZIE
                        It’s pretty effed up that I have to 
                        pretend to be a virgin and he 
                        doesn’t.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes, that’s...actually pretty 
                        astute, but. Take that up with 
                        society. Let me show you the 
                        staging area.

           Faye leads Kenzie into the middle of the clearing, and hands 
           her the BASKET.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Ok! So to review, you’ve been 
                        spending the day -

                                 KENZIE
                        Berry picking.

                                 FAYE
                        Because you’re making a

                                 KENZIE
                        Pie

                                 FAYE
                        Because you love

                                 KENZIE
                        Food

                                 FAYE
                        And?

                                 KENZIE
                        Nature

                                 FAYE
                        And you are firmly?

                                 KENZIE
                        Committed to the preservation of 
                        the Kingdom’s woodlands.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes! And you’ve just stopped on 
                        this tree stump to read --

                                 KENZIE
                        A book.
                                 FAYE
                        What book?

           Kenzie fishes out her prop book from the basket.

                                 KENZIE
                        This book.

                                 FAYE
                        ....which is called?

           She reads the spine.

                                 KENZIE
                        “Humbly to The Woods Came I: A 
                        Shepherd Reminisces” WOW. 

                                 FAYE
                        Trust me, he’ll be impressed. If he 
                        asks you how you like it, say you 
                        just started but so far it’s really 
                        compelling.

                                 KENZIE
                        If you say so...

                                 FAYE
                        Oh, I almost forgot.

           She walks over to some ANIMAL CAGES that have been tucked out 
           of sight.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got two gophers and a 
                        bluebird, just for ambiance.

           Faye lets the gophers out. They run around, cutely.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        This one’s Christabel, and this 
                        one’s Fauntleroy. Not that you need 
                        to know their names.

                                 KENZIE
                        Awww!

                                 FAYE
                        And here’s the bluebird...

           She picks up a bird cage, somewhat gingerly.

                                 KENZIE
                        Ok, here’s the thing, I’m not great 
                        with birds.
                                 FAYE
                        That’s ok, no one is. They’re the 
                        pests of the sky. But it’s just for 
                        ambiance.

           Faye releases the birds. She and Kenzie cough, spit a bit 
           from the dust, feathers, etc.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so I think that’s it! Do you 
                        have any questions for me?

                                 KENZIE
                        I guess just, how do you know he’s 
                        going to stop through the woods?

                                 FAYE
                        Don’t worry. It’s been taking care 
                        of.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. THE ROAD THROUGH THE WOODS

           A carriage is speeding by. Inside, PRINCE CARL and CHAUNCEY. 

           SUDDENLY, all four of the carriage wheels just simultaneously 
           pop off. The carriage bumpily tears along on the ground for a 
           few feet until the drivers stop the horses.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What the f--

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. THE ROAD IN THE WOODS

           The Prince, Chauncey, and the mystified drivers are all 
           standing around the carriage.

                                 DRIVER
                           (to Chauncey)
                        I have no idea, I don’t even see 
                        any bumps in the road, it was just 
                        re-cobbled --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok, I’m just going to hike ahead. 

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Shall I come with you, sire?
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        No, you stay here and wait with the 
                        carriage. I’ll send help.

           EXT. THE WOODS

           Prince Carl hikes through the woods, when he gets to THE 
           CLEARING and sees Kenzie, sitting demurely on the stump.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Hey, there.

                                 KENZIE
                           (painfully casually)
                        Oh, hey.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Are you lost?

                                 KENZIE
                        No, I was just berry picking 
                        because I love nature and food and 
                        am really committed to the 
                        preservation of the kingdom 
                        woodlands, but I am taking a break 
                        on this tree stump to read my book.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Looks like you’ve found a good 
                        spot.
                           (he peers closer)
                        Is that an oak? I didn’t think the 
                        forest had oak trees.

                                 KENZIE
                        The woods are full of surprises! 
                        That’s part of the reason I’m 
                        really committed to the 
                        preservation of the kingdom 
                        woodlands.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        So you said. 

                                 KENZIE
                        I’m Kenzie James.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’m --

                                 KENZIE
                        I know.
           She smiles at him.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           Faye watching attentively through some trees like a mom 
           watching her kid in a school play. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        So what are you reading?

                                 KENZIE
                        Oh, just a book.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        “Just a book.”

                                 KENZIE
                        “Humbly to the Woods Came I,” --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        “...A Shepherd Reminisces?” Wow.

                                 KENZIE
                        Have you read it? 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yeah, actually. How do you like it?

                                 KENZIE
                        I just started, but so far I find 
                        it extremely compelling.

           He smiles at her. She smiles back.

                                 FAYE
                           (under her breath)
                        Good job, Kenzie.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well, Kenzie. I’ll leave you to 
                        your reading.

                                 KENZIE
                        You’re going?? Already??

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        My carriage broke down and I’ve got 
                        to get help from the castle. It was 
                        nice to meet you! I hope you enjoy 
                        the woods.

                                 FAYE
                           (under her breath)
                        Oh, come on!
                                 KENZIE
                           (a little disappointed)
                        Bye....

           The Prince tips his hat and hikes onward.

                                 FAYE
                           (under her breath)
                        Ok, Kenzie. Hope you can swim.

           With a flick of her wand, Faye sends the BLUE BIRD from 
           earlier squawking shakily towards Kenzie. Kenzie screams and 
           backs away from it.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Whoa!

           The Prince tries to bat at it, but the bird is singularly 
           focused on Kenzie, dive bombing towards her until SPLASH! 
           She’s fallen into the river.

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        Oh god! Ok, hold on! I’m coming! 

           Quickly, the Prince starts removing his boots. Kenzie bobs up 
           for air.

                                 KENZIE
                        Help me!!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’m coming!!! Keep moving your arms 
                        and legs!

           The prince dives into the water. Faye comes out of her hiding 
           spot and watches them apprehensively.

           The Prince comes up for air. Takes a huge gasp of air. 
           Accidentally swallows some water. Coughs.

           Meanwhile, Kenzie is getting carried farther downstream.

                                 KENZIE
                        Help!

           Faye watches, horrified as the Prince sputters water.

                                 FAYE
                           (under her breath)
                        Help her???

           Finally, the Prince has gotten his bearings again. He spots 
           Kenzie.
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok, I’m coming!!

                                 FAYE
                        Atta boy.

           The Prince starts sort of swimming to Kenzie, but the 
           current’s doing most of the work. 

           Faye follows them from the river’s edge, discreetly. She is 
           frowning. This is not going as well as she’d hoped. With 
           another flick of her wand, she gently sends a LARGE TREE 
           BRANCH floating down into the river, where Kenzie can grab 
           hold.

           Prince Carl slowly, and clumsily, makes his way over to her.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’m coming! I’m coming! Just try to 
                        keep your head above the water!

                                 KENZIE
                           (from the log)
                        Yeah, it is!

           Finally, the Prince reaches the log, but the current is 
           strong.

                                 KENZIE (CONT’D)
                        Grab my hand!! 

           He grabs onto her and clambers over to the log, momentarily 
           pushing her under water. She comes up gasping.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I got you! I got you! You ok?

                                 KENZIE
                           (catching her breath)
                        How are we going to get to shore??

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Uhm, ok, well, let’s see.

           FAYE’s POV

           She watches the two figures scrambling to each hold onto the 
           log, Titanic-style. But it’s not big enough for the both of 
           them. Someone is going to have to let go.

                                 KENZIE
                        You’re pushing me --

           She bobs under.
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Sorry! Sorry!

           She comes up for air, holding onto him, and pushing him 
           under.

                                 KENZIE
                        Just, let me grab hold --

           From the shore, Faye can tell they’re going to both drown if 
           she doesn’t intervene. 

                                 FAYE
                           (under her breath)
                        Alright, I’m going in.

           With her wand, she makes some rope appear.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                           (calling out to them)
                        AHOY THERE!

           The Prince looks towards the voice, confusedly. 

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Grab hold of the rope!

           She throws it out to them. They grab hold of the rope, and 
           with a lot of effort, she hauls them both to shore. They 
           collapse in a pile on the river bank. 

           As Kenzie wrings out her hair, the Prince sees Faye is the 
           one who saved them.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Whoa --

           Faye jumps in before he can say anything incriminating.

                                 FAYE
                           (curtsying)
                        Your majesty! What an honor to meet 
                        you! And under these circumstances! 
                        I happened to be passing through 
                        when I heard your cries!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yes...thank goodness you were here.

                                 KENZIE
                           (pissed)
                        Yeah, thank goodness.
                                 FAYE
                        So happy to have been of service to 
                        you and this beautiful, young lady. 

           She reaches into her robes and pulls out the book.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Oh! I found this book on the 
                        riverbank! At first, I thought it 
                        must have belonged to a passing 
                        scholar, for I know only the most 
                        intelligent people in the kingdom 
                        read “Humbly Into the Woods Came I: 
                        A Shepherd Reminisces!”

           Kenzie takes the book.

                                 KENZIE
                        Yeah, thanks.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Are you ok? That was so scary!

           Kenzie nods.

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        That was crazy! I’ve never seen a 
                        bird do that. It was like it hated 
                        you!

                                 KENZIE
                           (glaring at Faye)
                        Yeah. It was really weird.

           Chauncey, other footmen arrive on horses.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        We heard cries! Is everyone 
                        alright?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        A close call, but everyone’s fine. 
                        Chauncey, will you take Miss --

                                 KENZIE
                        James.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Right right, will you escort Miss 
                        James back to the palace and have 
                        them see that she get some dry 
                        clothes? 
                                 KENZIE
                           (brightening a bit)
                        The palace?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’ll follow you shortly. 

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Certainly, sir.

           The footmen help Kenzie onto the horse, and ride away. 
           Without anyone seeing, Kenzie gives Faye a big THUMBS UP to 
           Faye.

           Once they ride out of sight... the Prince turns to Faye.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well, hello again.

                                 FAYE
                           (embarrassed)
                        Hi.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                         Care to take a turn with me?

           She raises her eyebrows.

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        Not a euphemism. I promise.

           EXT. THE WOODS - LATER 

           Faye and The Prince walk the forest road together, at a 
           respectful distance. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        So, uh, thank you for helping me 
                        out back there. With the river.

                                 FAYE
                        Oh, you mean when I literally saved 
                        your life?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok, I wasn’t drowning.

                                 FAYE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yeah, it wasn’t....great.
                                 FAYE
                        What happened out there? I was 
                        genuinely humiliated for you.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I don’t know why everyone thinks 
                        that being a prince automatically 
                        means we’re like. Action heroes. 
                        That’s Knights! Knights go through 
                        rigorous training. Princes just 
                        live in castles and attend 
                        banquets.

                                 FAYE
                        That is, I guess, a misconception 
                        about princes...

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        My brother and his friends used to 
                        play knights when we were little. 
                        They’d always make me be the town-
                        crier. 

                                 FAYE
                        Oh noooo.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Because I was loud and, according 
                        to my brother, “a crier.”

                                 FAYE
                        Nooooooo!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What I really wanted to be though, 
                        was a chef. 

                                 FAYE
                        Why?? You’re a Prince!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yeah but that’s not exactly 
                        like...I mean how many little boys 
                        want to be Princes when they grow 
                        up? 

                                 FAYE
                        Lots of girls want to be 
                        princesses.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Did you?
                                 FAYE
                        God, no! I love my job!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yeah, it’s a pretty cool gig. What 
                        made you decide to want to be a 
                        carriage driver, anyway?

                                 FAYE
                        Oh. Uhm. A desire to help people.

           He looks at her funny.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                         Get to their destinations.

           Carl nods. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Makes sense. Anyway. It’s a good 
                        thing you “happened” to be walking 
                        by.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, seriously. Wait. Why did you 
                        say it like that. “Happened?”

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I mean, let’s face it. You’re not 
                        here for work.

                                 FAYE
                        ...I’m not here for work, that is 
                        correct. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        You’re not the first woman to. You 
                        know.

           Faye shakes her head, uncomprehending.

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        To sort of...follow me around.

                                 FAYE
                        I was not. I was NOT!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Not in a bad way!

                                 FAYE
                        You’re so wrong, that’s not it at 
                        all!
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        You just “happened” to be taking a 
                        riverside stroll?

                                 FAYE
                        ...kind of! 

           He looks at her, eyebrows raised.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You are really, seriously 
                        flattering yourself if you think 
                        that I would have come all the way 
                        out here to the woods just for you. 
                        I’m not some insecure twenty-
                        something. I am a mature, sexually 
                        confident woman, who can walk away 
                        from a night like last night with 
                        my dignity and my self-esteem 
                        intact!

           The Prince looks at her. Smiles. Raises an eyebrow It’s 
           devastatingly cute.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        So no round two?

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. THE WOODS - SAME

           Carl and Faye are making out, clawing at each other like 
           teenagers. Pan out to reveal the woods. The bluebird from 
           earlier squawks. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. THE WOODS - LATER

           Now they’re lying, slightly dazed, slightly undressed, side-
           by-side on the ground, Faye’s robe spread over them. 

                                 FAYE
                        ...sex is wasted on the young.

                                 CARL
                        What??

                                 FAYE
                        It is, it’s a pastime totally 
                        wasted on the young. 
                                 CARL
                        I really enjoyed that...

                                 FAYE
                        You think you did! But you don’t 
                        know! You don’t have the range of 
                        experience to really appreciate 
                        what just happened there. I mean, 
                        wait until sex isn’t a given any 
                        time you so much as look at a 
                        woman, then you’ll understand.

           She glances sideways at the shirtless, Adonis-like Carl, and 
           winces.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Ok that may never happen to you, 
                        but. Take my word for it.

                                 CARL
                        You think you have better sex than 
                        I do?

                                 FAYE
                        I am saying I am more capable of 
                        getting 100% from that experience. 
                        Sex must just be like toast to you.

           He shakes his head.

                                 CARL
                        You are over-estimating toast.

                                 FAYE
                        That thing you did? When you 
                        reached around and...?

                                 CARL
                        Oh. Yes --

                                 FAYE
                        That’s a new development. They 
                        weren’t doing that when I was a 
                        young maiden.

           Carl turns over and props his head on his elbow.

                                 CARL
                        What were you like as a young 
                        maiden? I mean. Younger maiden.

                                 FAYE
                        I dunno! Much the same, probably. 
                        Big on talking. Lukewarm on balls.
                                 CARL
                        Cold on marriage?

                                 FAYE
                        No, I just. I don’t really know. I 
                        always thought I’d get married, and 
                        then time went on and one day I 
                        realized my prince had failed to 
                        show up. Or maybe I failed to show 
                        up, I don’t know. Maybe I didn’t 
                        try the way you’re supposed to try. 
                        But I’ve never really minded 
                        because I’ve been happy! I mean, 
                        there are worse things in the world 
                        than not marrying.

                                 CARL
                        Hey, you don’t have to tell me.

                                 FAYE
                           (remembering herself a 
                           bit)
                        Oh, but, it’s different for you. 
                        You should marry someone ASAP. In 
                        fact, I think you should just. 
                        Marry the next girl you see. 

                                 CARL
                        If you saw my brother and sister-in-
                        law you would understand why I’m 
                        not exactly racing towards the 
                        altar.

                                 FAYE
                        Don’t let that dissuade you. 
                        Marriage is nice! 

                                 CARL
                        This is nice.

                                 FAYE
                        This is unsustainable. Very fun. I 
                        enjoyed myself. But. Now I’ve got 
                        to go.

           She starts to get up, but he holds her back.

                                 CARL
                        Can we maybe just. Sustain it for 
                        five more minutes, though? Please? 

           She hesitates.
                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Five more minutes. And then we’ll 
                        both go back to our lives and be 
                        more responsible than we planned to 
                        be this morning. But for five more 
                        minutes. This isn’t so bad, is it? 

           Faye settles back down in the crook of his arm. He closes his 
           eyes, and smiles.

                                 FAYE
                        No. It’s not so bad.

           She closes her eyes, too.

           INT.  FAYE’S BUNGALOW - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Faye, looking completely disheveled, with twigs and leaves in 
           her hair, stares at her MAGIC MIRROR, afraid to ask:

                                 FAYE
                        Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who’s 
                        the skankiest of them all?

                                 MIRROR
                           (hesitantly)
                        Well...still Beth Swansdale of 
                        Little Gribling, but --

                                 FAYE
                        THANK YOU!

           She races away before the mirror can say anything more.

           INT. THE CASTLE ENTRYWAY

           The Prince, whistling, arrives back to the castle. Chauncey 
           is waiting there to greet him.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Evening sire. Good walk?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Great walk. Excellent walk. Best 
                        walk I’ve ever taken.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        I always find an evening tramp is 
                        good for the spirits.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What??
                                 CHAUNCEY
                        A tramp? Through the woods? 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh. Right. 

           The Prince smiles, and hands him his riding cloak. In the 
           distance, there’s the sound of laughter. Carl looks at 
           Chauncey, puzzled.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Your guest is in the Great Hall.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Guest?
                           (remembering)
                        Oh! God. 

           Prince Carl dashes towards the laughter as Chauncey hangs the 
           cloak, discreetly brushing off the twigs and leaves.

           INT. THE GREAT HALL

           There’s a roaring fire going. Kenzie, looking radiant with 
           her wet hair drying, in a borrowed robe and nightgown, is 
           sitting with the Crown Prince and Princess. They are talking 
           inaudibly, laughing at something. They look up when they see 
           Prince Carl has entered.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        Oh, there you are!

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        The man of the hour! Kenzie told us 
                        all about your little river 
                        adventure today.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        Gotta say, I was impressed. When 
                        did you become such a swimmer?

                                 KENZIE
                        He was totally heroic. It was 
                        amazing.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I really didn’t --

                                 KENZIE
                        He’s so modest he won’t take 
                        credit, but the truth is he totally 
                        saved me.
                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        And they say chivalry is dead!

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        Gotta say, I’m genuinely impressed. 

           Carl looks at Kenzie. She smiles at him. The Princess 
           notices.

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Darling, should we totter off?

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        I guess we should leave the young 
                        ones be.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR (CONT’D)
                        I hope we’ll be seeing more of you. 

           Kenzie smiles at them. As they exit, Princess Griselda mouths 
           to Prince Carl, “I LIKE HER.” 

           Off Prince Carl’s surprise...

           INT. FAYE’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           In her office, Faye is recapping the previous evening’s 
           adventures to a rapt Tilly.

                                 FAYE
                        I thought he’d jump in, rescue her, 
                        get a hero moment --

                                 TILLY
                        And a chance to see her up close. I 
                        think that’s smart.

                                 FAYE
                        ...right. Guys love a hero moment! 
                        But. He was such a disaster that I 
                        had to intervene 
                           (Tilly Gasps)
                        And rescue both of them, so.

                                 TILLY
                           (horrified)
                        He SAW you?

                                 FAYE
                        Well, yeah. I literally pulled him 
                        out of the water.
                                 TILLY
                        Oh my god, that’s terrible.

                                 FAYE
                        The terrible part is that after 
                        that, he sent Kenzie off on a horse 
                        to dry off. No match. So, I 
                        honestly don’t know if this one’s 
                        gonna work out, because whatever 
                        Kenzie’s selling, Prince Carl ain’t 
                        buying.

                                 TILLY
                        What did he say?

                                 FAYE
                        About what?

                                 TILLY
                        When he saw you?

                                 FAYE
                           (sarcastic)
                        He blanched in disgust.

                                 TILLY
                           (sympathetic)
                        Ugh, what a jerk.

                                 FAYE
                        No. Tilly. I was joking. He said, I 
                        dunno, thank you for saving me from 
                        this river. 

                                 TILLY
                        But Princes are never supposed to 
                        see Fairy Godmothers! 

                                 FAYE
                        Well, he didn’t know I was a fairy 
                        godmother. 

                                 TILLY
                        So he just thought you were a nice 
                        middle-aged woman, out for a stroll 
                        when he happened to --

                                 FAYE
                        TILLY, please bring me the files of 
                        eligibles.

                                 TILLY
                        Sure. Right away.
           Tilly exits. Just then, a MESSENGER appears.

                                 MESSENGER
                        This just in, ma’am.

           He hands Faye a large scroll.

                                 FAYE
                        Thank you.

                                 MESSENGER
                           (conspiratorially)
                        It’s from The Palace.

           Faye grabs the scroll and quickly unfurls it. In girlish 
           handwriting, she reads:

                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        Dear Faye, GUESS where I am right 
                        now....

           The ellipses continue. Faye, annoyed, unscrolls a few feet of 
           scroll, until:

                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        ....THE PALACE.

                                 FAYE
                        What?

           INT. THE WOODS- YESTERDAY

           Kenzie, Chauncey’s horse, unhappily and choppily rides to the 
           palace.

                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        At first when he put me on the 
                        horse, I was upset, but then I 
                        realized this is actually, like, 
                        the perfect opportunity....

           INT. THE PALACE - FOYER

           Chauncey leads a shivering Kenzie into the foyer, where 
           Princess Griselda greets them. Kenzie gives a winning smile.

           INT. THE PRINCESS’S DRESSING ROOM

           Maids help Kenzie take off her dripping wet dress, and put on 
           a fresh nightgown. 
                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        Everyone was so nice.

           Two of the maids start gesturing at Kenzie’s waist, 
           exclaiming over how small it is. Kenzie beams.

                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        Like. Soooo so nice. 

           INT. THE GREAT HALL

           Kenzie is led into the room, where Prince Alistair and 
           Princess Griselda stand to greet her.

                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        I hung out with the Prince and 
                        Princess for like, hours cause it 
                        weirdly took forever for Prince 
                        Carl to come home...

           INT. THE GREAT HALL - LATER

           Kenzie and Prince Carl sit by the fire and chat.

                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        But then he did come home and, 
                        let’s just say it was worth the 
                        wait!! 

           OFF Prince Carl, looking at her. Cut to:

           INT. THE PALACE - GUEST BEDROOM

           Kenzie, with a huge pink quill, writes the scroll.

                                 KENZIE (V.O.)
                        I’ve been asked to stay here the 
                        weekend, which I think is a pretty 
                        good sign! Please come as soon as 
                        you get this. I need something to 
                        wear to dinner tonight! 

           INT. FAYE’S OFFICE - SAME

           Faye finishes reading the letter.

                                 FAYE
                        “Xoxo, Kenzie.”
           There’s a perfunctory knock on the door, it flings open, and 
           Tom enters.

                                 TOM
                        Faye!

           She looks up from her scroll, startled.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes!

           He pulls out a bottle of champagne from behind his back.

                                 TOM
                        Well, you’ve done it again. I’ve 
                        had it from a very reliable source 
                        that Kenzie James did not go home 
                        last night.

           Tilly returns with a huge stack of files: the ELIGIBLE 
           BACHELOR files.

                                 FAYE
                        Just because she’s spending the 
                        weekend at the palace doesn’t mean 
                        they’re --

                                 TOM
                        SHE’S SPENDING THE WEEKEND AT THE 
                        PALACE? I hadn’t heard that part!

                                 TILLY
                        Oh my god! Amazing!

           Tom takes Faye by the arm and drags her out to the main 
           office space. He clinks the bottle of champagne. Everyone 
           turns to look.

                                 TOM
                        Attention, attention please. I just 
                        wanted to take a moment to publicly 
                        recognize our dear old Faye, who, 
                        I’ve just been told, has managed to 
                        nail down the kingdom’s second most 
                        eligible bachelor -- the most 
                        eligible being me, of course.

           A few people laugh. Faye looks pained. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        She’s had an excellent track record 
                        during her 15 years here -- yes, 
                        15! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, Faye, I’ve just dated you -- 
                        and I know my mother would be very 
                        proud of her. Which is why I’m 
                        happy to announce that Faye has 
                        been promoted to HEAD Godmother.

           Applause. Faye gasps.

                                 FAYE
                        Oh my god!

           Tom gives her a congratulatory hug.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        But it’s not even a done deal yet!!

                                 TOM
                        Oh, come on. Girl like Kenzie, 
                        spending the weekend in the castle? 
                        He may be a Prince but he’s also 
                        mortal. 

           Tilly and Fern rush up to Faye.

                                 FERN
                        Congratulations, Faye!

                                 TILLY
                        I’m so happy!!! I’m crying. Look! 
                        I’m literally crying. Are you so 
                        happy?

           Faye forces a smile.

                                 FAYE
                        I’m so happy!

                                 TOM
                        Now all you’ve got to do is hie 
                        thee to the palace and make sure 
                        everything goes to plan.

                                 FAYE
                        But you just said it was 
                        practically a done deal so maybe I 
                        should just stay out of it--

                                 TOM
                        Yes, practically done deal. But 
                        let’s not take any undue risks.

                                 FAYE
                        It’s just that I have other 
                        clients.
                                 TOM
                        Not anymore. Until there’s a royal 
                        wedding this is your only priority. 

           Tom pops the champagne and everyone cheers. Faye glances up 
           at the ELIGIBLE BOARD as Prince Carl’s face disappears, tile 
           by tile.

           INT. THE PALACE - GUEST BEDROOM

           A puff. A flash. Faye pops into the Palace Guest Room. 

           There’s a pink canopy bed, a breakfast tray, a big white 
           wardrobe. 

           Kenzie is wearing a luxurious-looking white robe. She pops up 
           excitedly when she sees Faye. 

                                 KENZIE
                        WELCOME to the PALACE!!!

                                 FAYE
                        Wow!

                                 KENZIE
                        How sick is this room?

                                 FAYE
                        I dunno, I think it’s nice!!

           She leads Faye through the room.

                                 KENZIE
                        Come in, sit down. Do you want 
                        anything? They sent up a breakfast 
                        tray.

                                 FAYE
                        They just sent you food? For free?

           She goes over to the breakfast tray and grabs a slice of 
           toast.

                                 KENZIE
                           (nodding)
                        Help yourself, I couldn’t possibly 
                        eat. Not after last night.

           Faye swallows a bite of egg.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, what...happened?
                                 KENZIE
                        We talked. For hours. 

                                 FAYE
                        Wow.

                                 KENZIE
                        Maybe it wasn’t hours, but it 
                        seemed like hours. 

                                 FAYE
                        What did you talk about?

                                 KENZIE
                        Everything! The woods. That 
                        shepherd book. Did you know that 
                        when he was little he wanted to be 
                        a chef? 

                                 FAYE
                           (over-compensating)
                        Cute!

           Faye takes a huge bite of sausage.

                                 KENZIE
                        SO CUTE. I feel like I got a sense 
                        of what he’s actually looking for 
                        in a woman, which is maturity. He 
                        has this playboy reputation, but I 
                        think deep down he’s just yearning 
                        for a real connection. 

                                 FAYE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 KENZIE
                        Like he’s tired of all these fake 
                        girls just throwing themselves at 
                        him.
                           (she looks at the nearly 
                           empty breakfast plate)
                        Wow, you were hungry! 

                                 FAYE
                        So, has he made any sort 
                        of...official declaration? 

                                 KENZIE
                        No, not yet!!!! I think he must be 
                        waiting for that magic moment. OH 
                        I’m so relieved you’re here!!! I 
                        don’t think I could get through the 
                        next twenty-four hours without you.
                                 FAYE
                        You’re so focused on impressing 
                        Prince Carl, but...has he impressed 
                        you?

           Kenzie blinks at her.

                                 KENZIE
                        I don’t get it, of course he’s 
                        impressed me. He’s a Prince, that’s 
                        like, really impressive.  

                                 FAYE
                        I know, but it’s not just about 
                        Prince Carl liking you. You have to 
                        also like him.

                                 KENZIE
                        I do like him!

                                 FAYE

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Would you like him if he wasn’t a 
                        handsome prince.

                                 KENZIE
                        But he is a prince, and he is 
                        handsome. So how do I just forget 
                        that?

                                 FAYE
                        Do you feel like you can be your 
                        truest self around him? And does he 
                        make you laugh?

           Kenzie is unsettled for a moment, then laughs it off.

                                 KENZIE
                        Faye. There’s going to be plenty of 
                        time for jokes and getting to know 
                        each other once we’re married. 

                                 FAYE
                        Fine. 

                                 KENZIE
                        Maybe I want to land a prince so 
                        that I can take over the world, did 
                        you ever think of that? Now. We’re 
                        scheduled to go riding in the 
                        afternoon. What’s an outfit that 
                        says, “Horsey -- but not in a weird 
                        way?”
           INT. FAIRYGODMOTHER HQ

           Tom, in his office.

           There’s a knock at the door, and Tilly enters.

                                 TOM
                        Ah! T.....ilda!

                                 TILLY
                        Tilly.

                                 TOM
                        Tilly. Right! What can I do you 
                        for?

                                 TILLY
                        I was wondering what you wanted me 
                        to do in regards to Faye’s clients 
                        this weekend? Seeing as she’s held 
                        up at the palace.

                                 TOM
                        Right. Well, let’s have Flora cover 
                        for her.

                                 TILLY
                        She’s on a job.

                        Retired.

                                 TOM
                        Oh.

                                 TILLY
                        Two years ago.

                                 TOM
                        Right. Rosie?

                                 TILLY
                        Personal day.

                                 TOM
                        What? That’s not a thing at this 
                        company.

                                 TILLY
                        The liberal policy on personal days 
                        is what I love about this company. 
                                 TOM
                        But it’s not a real policy!  

                                 TILLY
                        So, should I refund the clients? 
                        Cause there’s literally no one 
                        else.

           FAIRY GOD-MOTHERING MONTAGE

           INT. A TWEEN GIRL’S ROOM

           A TWEEN GIRL’s room. This girl is younger than the other 
           girls we’ve seen, goth. Posters of aspirational witches hang 
           on the walls. The girl is sitting on her bed, glowering.

           A puff of smoke. Tom appears. 

                                 TOM
                           (awkwardly)
                        There, there. Dry your tears, for I 
                        am your fairy god....father.

           The girl SCREAMS.

           EXT. PALACE STABLES 

           Faye, covered in her blue robe, is surreptitiously giving 
           Kenzie sugar cubes. Kenzie fills her pockets. She then 
           hurries into...

           INT. STABLES

           Prince Carl is waiting for her with a docile-looking pony. 
           Kenzie instead walks over to a huge, wild-looking stallion. 
           Prince Carl starts to warn her, but Kenzie has already 
           befriended the horse. Carl’s impressed. 

           EXT. PALACE STABLES - MOMENTS LATER

           Faye watches as Kenzie confidently rides away on the 
           stallion, with Prince Carl and Stefan (his horse) closely at 
           her heels. 
           INT. ANOTHER TEEN BEDROOM

           A different GIRL, AWKWARD, with braces, is going on and on 
           and on to Tom. We don’t hear the dialogue but it’s clearly 
           dramatic, and very detailed. Tom’s eyes glaze over. 

           INT. FAIRYGODMOTHER HQ - SEAMSTRESS QUARTERS

           Tom is talking to Tilly and the Seamstress. They show him a 
           dress. He nods. Yep! Looks good.

           Tilly holds up a finger to wait, and shows him a different 
           dress. Tom nods again. That one’s good, too! 

           They show him another. His smile freezes a bit. ...still 
           good!

           They pull out another dress. Off Tom’s realization that there 
           are going to be dozens of identical dresses to look at...

           EXT. A BEAUTIFUL SPOT ON THE PALACE GROUNDS

           Prince Carl and Kenzie have let their horses graze, and are 
           walking under a willow tree. Unseen by them, Faye creeps 
           behind. With her wand, she sways the branches so that 
           blossoms fall gently around them.

           Prince Carl looks at Kenzie. She’s dazzling.

           Faye looks at Kenzie. I mean, yeah, she looks good. 

           Carl moves his hand to brush a blossom out of her hair, and 
           before she can even think, Faye flicks her wand and turns the 
           blossom into a SPIDER. 

           Carl WHACKS it out of Kenzie’s hair, knocking her head in the 
           process. He apologizes, embarrassed.

           Faye can’t help but give a satisfied little grin.

           INT. FAIRY GODMOTHER HQ - CARRIAGE SHOP

           Tom looks on excitedly as Fern shows him the specs on what 
           could be the Caddillac of carriages. He motions for her to 
           make the wheels even bigger. 

           EXT. A COTTAGE 

           Tom stands outside with a GIRLY-GIRL ready for a ball, in a 
           super sparkly pink dress.
           He takes an eggplant, and with his wand, proudly turns it 
           into a sleek, dark carriage with monster truck wheels. 

           Tom beams at it. The girl looks uncertain. 

           EXT. BACK AT THE PALACE

           Prince Carl and Kenzie, on horseback, arrive back at the 
           palace. Carl hops off his horse. Faye can’t stop, won’t stop. 
           She waves her wand, and his pants split. He looks up at 
           Kenzie, in horror. Kenzie looks away, embarrassed for him. 

           EXT. ANOTHER GIRL’S HOUSE

           Tom flicks his wand, and a THIRD GIRL spins around in one of 
           the dresses from earlier. She wrinkles her nose.  

           Tom flicks his wand again, and now she’s in a different 
           dress. She sticks out her tongue. 

           He tries again. In this one, she looks undeniably pretty. Tom 
           is pretty chuffed with his efforts. She’s clearly unhappy. 
           She then gestures to his suit. Tom looks down at himself, in 
           surprise. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           A moment later. The girl is looking dashing and BEAMING in 
           Tom’s outfit. She can’t stop grinning at herself in the 
           mirror. She turns and gives Tom a big THUMBS UP.

           Tom, naked but standing behind a barrel, gives her a thumbs 
           up in return. Genuinely pleased with himself.

           INT. THE PALACE - THE SALON

           The ROYAL FAMILY is gathered around a pianoforte, where 
           Kenzie, aided by an unseen Faye, is playing beautifully. Faye 
           fixes her attention onto the Prince. Flicks her wand. 

           He hiccups. 

           He hiccups again. The Princess glances at him. He puts his 
           hand up, like, “I’m ok.”

           He hiccups again. And again. Chauncey tries to discreetly 
           give him some water. 

           More hiccups. Fast and furious now. Kenzie stops her playing, 
           concerned/weirded out. Prince Carl tries to gesture again 
           that he’s fine, but his brother slaps him hard on the back. 
           Faye smiles and discreetly leaves, as everyone gathers 
           around, giving instructions to a miserable, hiccuping Carl. 
           (We can’t hear what they’re saying, but probably something 
           like “Hold your breath!” “Try putting your arms in the air!” 
           “More water!” etc.)

           EXT. THE GARDEN BEHIND A COTTAGE

           Tom is looking on, boredly, as the Goth Tween and THE BAKER’S 
           SON, equally goth, are sitting on a bench, giggling together.

           Tom yawns, and looks at a nearby clock tower. 11:55. He yawns 
           again, and looks back to see that the young couple is now 
           engulfed an a raging make-out session. Like, this is not an 
           innocent goodnight kiss.

           Tom instantly raises his wand in the air. Thunderclap. Rain. 
           The couple is soaked, but undeterred. He’s somehow just made 
           it sexier. 

           Tom raises his wand again. Lightning. The couple is jolted 
           apart. 

           INT. TOM’S OFFICE

           Tom, in his office, exhausted, feet up, massaging his wand 
           wrist.

           INT. PALACE GUEST BEDROOM

           Faye, in a chair, feet up, massaging her wand wrist.

           INT. PALACE GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           Faye is helping Kenzie change out of her previous outfit. 

                                 KENZIE
                        It stopped eventually, but super 
                        weird. Maybe it was nerves? Some 
                        kind of tic? I dunno, I’ve never 
                        really seen anyone get the hiccups 
                        that bad.

           Faye pulls out a dress.

                                 FAYE
                        I think this, for dinner.

            Kenzie gasps.
                                 KENZIE
                        Oh, Faye. It’s so so so beautiful. 

                                 FAYE
                        Glad you like it. It’s very 

                     FAYE (CONT’D)
                                                     KENZIE
           “regal, yet approachable”
                                          “regal yet approachable”, 
                                          yes!

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, exactly. 

           Kenzie grabs the dress, and starts putting it on. Faye tries 
           hard not to stare at her young, incredibly perfect body. 

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        So you’ve got til midnight. And 
                        you’re doing everything right. So 
                        an offer of engagement shouldn’t be 
                        a problem.

                                 KENZIE
                        But do you think he likes me?

                                 FAYE
                        Why wouldn’t he? 

                                 KENZIE
                        I just don’t get a real sense. He’s 
                        playing his cards close to his 
                        chest, is all.

                                 FAYE
                        I’m sure he likes you fine. But 
                        just to seal the deal, give him 
                        this.

           She hands Kenzie a wrapped package.

                                 KENZIE
                        That’s big. What is it?

                                 FAYE
                        Just something that I know he’ll 
                        like.

                                 KENZIE
                        Faye. Can I say something?

                                 FAYE
                        You can always say something, 
                        Kenzie, yes. 
                                 KENZIE
                        For some reason, people in my life -
                        - women -- are not always that nice 
                        to me. Like you’d be surprised.

                                 FAYE
                        Ok...

                                 KENZIE
                        Which is just to say that I’m 
                        really appreciative of everything 
                        you’ve done for me. 

                                 FAYE
                        Oh!

                                 KENZIE
                        I mean honestly, people aren’t 
                        always that nice to me. Like you’d 
                        be surprised. But you’ve been 
                        beyond what I could have wished 
                        for.

           Faye shrugs, uncomfortably.

                                 FAYE
                        Well, what are fairy godmothers 
                        for!

                                 KENZIE
                        Yeah, but you’ve been more than a 
                        fairy godmother to me. You’ve been 
                        a real friend.

           Kenzie hugs Faye. A genuine, warm hug. Then, Kenzie gasps.

                                 KENZIE (CONT’D)
                        I forgot my fan! In the Grand 
                        Salon!

                                 FAYE
                        That’s ok, you can get it later --

                                 KENZIE
                        No, I can’t, I’ve written all our 
                        inside jokes on there so I can 
                        refer to it discreetly and bring 
                        them up at dinner. 

                                 FAYE
                        How many inside jokes do you have?
                                 KENZIE
                        Just one, and now I can’t remember 
                        it. Please can you go get it, Faye, 
                        please? 

           Faye sighs.

           INT. THE PALACE - HALLWAY

           Prince Carl, in full Princely regalia, and Chauncey.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        I would just stay away from acidic 
                        foods --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yes.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Just to be safe. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        That’s smart. I will.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Regarding that other thing you had 
                        me look into...

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh, yes?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        No luck, sire.

           The Prince lets out a disappointed sigh.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Alright. Well, it was worth a shot.

           Chauncey nods, and hands him FAYE’S SHOE from the ball. 

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I don’t particularly need 
                        to hold on to it --

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Oh, right. Shall I just --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Maybe one of the maids would --

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        It’s just the left, though --
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Right, right --

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        I’ll just --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yes -

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Throw it out.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I can do that.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        You’re sure?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yes. Thank you, Chauncey.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Very well, sire. 

           INT. THE HALLWAY 

           Prince Carl, still holding the shoe, turns the corner and 
           runs straight into FAYE, holding Kenzie’s fan.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What??

           Faye freezes.

                                 FAYE
                        ....Hi.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What.....are you doing here????

                                 FAYE
                        Yes. Guilty. I’m a weirdo!!! 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        How did you even get in?

                                 FAYE
                        Here, can we --

           Faye grabs the Prince, opens the nearest door, and pulls him 
           into it.
           INT. A BROOM CLOSET - PALACE

                                 FAYE
                           (looking around)
                        Huh. This is actually about the 
                        size of my broom closet.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        It’s a broom closet, what did you 
                        expect?

                                 FAYE
                        I dunno, everything else has been 
                        like, ten times the size of the 
                        equivalent in my house. The pantry 
                        is like the size of my entire 
                        cottage.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok I’m just trying to kind of wrap 
                        my head around the fact that you’re 
                        suddenly in my home --

           Faye notices the shoe in his hand.

                                 FAYE
                        That’s my shoe.

           Now it’s his turn to freeze.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Hmm?

                                 FAYE
                        That shoe in your hand, that’s my 
                        shoe.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh, this is your shoe?

                                 FAYE
                        Yes, that is my shoe, what are you 
                        doing with it?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I was just taking it to the lost-
                        and-found.

                                 FAYE
                        Really? There’s a lost and found?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yes.
                                 FAYE
                        The Royal lost and found?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        The Royal lost and found.

                                 FAYE
                        So funny, cause when I realized I 
                        was missing my shoe, I asked if 
                        there was a Lost and Found and they 
                        said no. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well, I am going to fire that 
                        servant because there is a lost and 
                        found --

                                 FAYE
                        Oh, ok.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I am just glad that you are saving 
                        me a trip.

           She snatches her shoe back.

                                 FAYE
                        Well, so glad I was here to save 
                        you that trip.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Speaking of being here, why are you 
                        here again?

                                 FAYE
                        I’m her carriage driver.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Who’s?

                                 FAYE
                        Kenzie’s! 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh....! 

                                 FAYE
                        So, what’s the deal, you gonna 
                        marry her?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What?
                                 FAYE
                        Just, curious what the dealio is.

           The door opens. It’s Chauncey, holding a broom.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Oh, I beg your pardon, sire.

           Chauncey closes the door.

                                 FAYE
                        So what’s the deal? You gonna pop 
                        the big q?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I dunno.

                                 FAYE
                        She’s so pretty.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well, sure, she’s very pretty --

                                 FAYE
                        Of course, beauty fades. But still! 
                        I think you should. Just my two 
                        cents. Not that I care either way. 
                        I’m just here for my shoe. Which 
                        I’ve found, so now I can go.

           From outside the closet, they hear a dinner gong chime.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Dinner.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I want to talk to you, will you 
                        wait?

                                 FAYE
                        In the broom closet?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        In the antechamber. 

                                 FAYE
                        No. Why?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Please, I just. Want to talk to 
                        you. Please?? 
                                 FAYE
                        Fine. If you bring me a plate of 
                        food from dinner.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Well, how am I going to manage to 
                        do that discreetly?

                                 FAYE
                        You’re a prince! Like they’re going 
                        to question you!

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’ve never met someone hungrier 
                        than you --

                                 FAYE
                        I don’t keep groceries, I’m never 
                        home --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Fine! I will meet you in the 
                        antechamber. With a plate of food.

                                 FAYE
                        Very well.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I’ll have Chauncey show you where 
                        it is.

                                 FAYE
                        I can find it on my --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        It’s a big palace --

                                 FAYE
                        It’s not that big!!!!!

           He frowns at her, and opens the door to the broom closet. But 
           right as he does, he sees his sister-in-law and Kenzie coming 
           down the hall on their way to dinner. 

           Carl quickly slams the door, leaving Faye trapped inside with 
           the palace brooms. She overhears:

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Were you just in the broom closet?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Oh. Yeah, just helping Chauncey 
                        with a. Thing. 
                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        How INCREDIBLE does Kenzie look 
                        tonight?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Very lovely --

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        STUNNING. I’d kill for that itty-
                        bitty waist. Who does your dresses, 
                        Kenz?

           In the dark, Faye listens to the voices get farther away as 
           the group leaves heads in to dinner.

                                 KENZIE
                        Oh, I have a woman who does them! 
                        This kind of quirky older woman...

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        I’ll have to get her name...

           Off Faye, humiliated, in the closet.

           INT. THE GREAT HALL - AFTER DINNER

           Kenzie and Prince Carl are sitting in front of the fire, post-
           dinner.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        The potatoes were really good --

                                 KENZIE
                        Yeah they were like, light --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Yeah! I thought they’d be heavier 
                        but they were... 

                                 KENZIE
                        ...Light.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Right.

           Beat. Prince Carl searches for something else to say.

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know where my brother has 
                        run off to, but I think I’m going 
                        to turn in, actually --
                                 KENZIE
                        But it’s so early --

                                 PRINCE CARL
                           (yawning)
                        It’s just been a long -- weirdly 
                        humiliating -- day. 

                                 KENZIE
                        Can you just wait one moment 
                        though? I want to give you 
                        something.

           Kenzie smiles at him.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. THE ANTECHAMBER

           Faye, alone, paces the antechamber. 

           The palace clock strikes 11:30. Faye catches a glimpse of her 
           reflection in the mirror, and smooths her hair.

           INT. THE GREAT HALL

           Kenzie hands Carl the wrapped package.

                                 KENZIE
                        I just thought it was something you 
                        should have. To replace your old 
                        one.

           He smiles and unwraps it. It’s a portrait. Of him. And it’s 
           cool, less stuffy than the other portraits we’ve seen 
           previously -- more color, more casual. Most importantly -- 
           Prince Carl looks hot. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I can’t believe it!

                                 KENZIE
                        Wow, that’s really cool!
                           (catching herself)
                        I mean, now that I see it again. In 
                        this light.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I keep meaning to sit for another 
                        but -- who even did this??
                                 KENZIE
                        A friend! Painter friend. That I 
                        know.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Thank you, so much. That was 
                        really, really thoughtful. 

           Kenzie smiles. Maybe a little uneasily. 

           INT. THE ANTECHAMBER 

           Faye’s still psyching herself up.

                                 FAYE
                        It’s inappropriate. It’s 
                        inappropriate. “We can’t continue 
                        like this. It would be 
                        inappropriate.” 

           From behind her, she hears the door to the Antechamber open. 
           Faye whirls around.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Listen, we can’t keep doing this, 
                        it’s inappropriate.

           But when Faye turns around, it’s not Prince Carl standing 
           there, but rather...Griselda.

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        I knew it! At first, it was just a 
                        hunch, but once I started putting 
                        the pieces together, it was so 
                        obvious. I’d recognize your 
                        handiwork anywhere, FAYE, oh my 
                        GOD!!! 

                                 FAYE
                           (reluctantly)
                        Hi, Grizzy.

           The Princess hugs Faye.

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        She’s been amazing. You should feel 
                        so proud. So pretty! Is she your 
                        prettiest client ever?

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, I don’t know.
                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Trick question, I’m your prettiest 
                        client ever! Obviously. Anyway 
                        you’ll be happy to know that 
                           (her voice drops to a 
                           stage whisper)
                        I think he’s doing it RIGHT NOW.

                                 FAYE
                        Doing what?

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        You know...

           With her finger, she mimics sliding a ring onto a ring 
           finger. It looks weirdly gross and crude.

                                 FAYE
                        Oh. Really? 

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Ali gave him the ring after dinner.  
                        Do you want me to send her in, 
                        after?

                                 FAYE
                        Sorry -- who?

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Kenzie! Isn’t that who you’re 
                        waiting for? You wanna see that 
                        ring!

           Just then, Prince Carl enters. He looks at Faye and Griselda 
           in surprise.

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god, Carl. You don’t even 
                        KNOW how important this woman is in 
                        your life. Let’s just say, your 
                        future happiness depends entirely 
                        on her.

                      PRINCE CARL
           How do you two know each 
           other?
                                                      FAYE
                                          I was actually just leaving, 
                                          so.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What do you mean, my future 
                        happiness?
                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        If you get married this year, it 
                        will be all thanks to Faye! She’s 
                        the best FG in the business. 

                         FAYE
                                                   PRINCE CARL
                                          FG?
           Ok, Griselda, let’s quit 
           while we’re ahead...

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA (CONT’D)
                        Rhymes with “Berry Dogmother.”

           Prince Carl has no idea.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What?

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        God, it is amazing what men don’t 
                        have to worry about! A fairy 
                        godmother is like a special little 
                        helper that parents hire to get 
                        their girls ready for ball season. 
                        Dresses, hair, shoes.

                                 FAYE
                        Moral support, mostly.

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Conversation topics, fact files.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        What’s a fact file?

                         FAYE
           Nothing.
                                                PRINCESS GRISELDA
                                          It’s just a little dossier. 
                                          What to say, what not to say, 
                                          favorite books, etc. Faye’s 
                                          the one who told me your 
                                          brother loves hunting. She’s 
                                          so good. 

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        And how does a fairy godmother get 
                        her information? By going 
                        undercover and consorting with the 
                        Prince?

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        What? No. Don’t be gross. 

                                 FAYE
                        No. Listen. That was all on 
                        accident. A happy accident! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FAYE (CONT'D)
                        An unprofessional accident. But 
                        everything I said to you was real.

           At that moment, Kenzie walks in.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        She seduced me!!

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Who are you talking about???????

                                 PRINCE CARL
                           (pointing)
                        FAYE. 

                                 KENZIE
                        What?

                                 FAYE
                        Kenzie. I’m really sorry.

                                 KENZIE
                        I paid you to help me get the 
                        Prince and you just...hook up with 
                        him instead?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        She paid you? You were paid?

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Uh, she’s a fairy godmother? Not a 
                        free godmother.

           The princess laughs at her own joke.

                                 FAYE
                        Technically, your father paid me.

                                 KENZIE
                        No, he didn’t!

                                 FAYE
                        Yes, he did. 

                                 KENZIE
                        No, he didn’t. I asked for a fairy 
                        godmother and he said no, so I 
                        saved up and paid for you myself.

                                 FAYE
                        Really? Everyone at the firm’s been 
                        up in arms about this case because 
                        of your dad!
                                 KENZIE
                        Wow, no, but cool that you guys 
                        care so much about the young women 
                        you purport to help. 

                                 FAYE
                        I do care about the young women I 
                        purport to -- that I actually help. 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        So, sorry, just catching up here...
                           (he points to Kenzie)
                        you paid someone to make me like 
                        you?

                                 FAYE
                        Oh, please. You think women 
                        naturally have coiffed hair, 
                        polished nails, the perfect 
                        wardrobe, and an encyclopedic 
                        knowledge of your interests? So 
                        some girls pay to live up to your 
                        standards, big deal.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        But I don’t want some fake --

                                 KENZIE
                        Yeah, the day a Prince goes for an 
                        actual housemaid, pre-makeover and 
                        brow wax, we can talk, but for now, 
                        this is how the cookie crumbles.

                                 FAYE
                        Well-said!

                                 KENZIE
                        I hate you.

                                 FAYE
                        This was the stupidest mistake. My 
                        job -- working with you, is the 
                        most important thing in the world 
                        to me. This happened cause it was 
                        just like, a thing, it was 
                        validating! 

                                 KENZIE
                        Is that supposed to make me feel 
                        better? That it was good for your 
                        self-esteem?
                                 FAYE
                        No! I’m just saying. It was a 
                        mistake. And if I could take it 
                        back, I would. All of it.

           The prince hears all this. Hurt.

           Kenzie shakes her head at Faye. Walks away.

           EXT. THE STEPS OF THE PALACE - SAME

           Faye is hurriedly, dejectedly walking down the steps. Prince 
           Carl appears, comes after her.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Faye, wait.

           She stops.

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        Can we like. Can we talk about 
                        this?

                                 FAYE
                        No. What? 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Is that it, you’re just leaving?

                                 FAYE
                        ...were you absent for the part 
                        where I’m Kenzie’s Fairy Godmother, 
                        and my job, my literal paying job 
                        is to hook you up with her?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        No, I heard that, it’s messed up, 
                        but. Are you just going to leave?

                                 FAYE
                        ...Yes??

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        But we could --!

                                 FAYE
                        Could what??

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Talk about it, I dont know.

                                 FAYE
                        And then what?? 
                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I don’t know! I just know I don’t 
                        want tonight to be the last time I 
                        ever see you. 

                                 FAYE
                        Hey. Kid. I am not available.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Ok --

                                 FAYE
                        And take it from someone who knows:  
                        chasing after someone who is 
                        unavailable never works out. 

           Carl stares at her. It’s his first rejection, and it’s 
           hitting hard.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Can I give you some advice?

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        More advice, you mean --

                                 FAYE
                        Can I give you more advice? Go find 
                        Kenzie. Don’t let her leave. She’s 
                        a good person. Don’t let her get 
                        away because of one silly 
                        indiscretion.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        That’s what you want. Me to end up 
                        with Kenzie and you just. Continue 
                        to find other people their happily 
                        ever afters?

                                 FAYE
                        That is exactly what I want.

           He nods, pissed, and wordlessly turns back to the palace. She 
           watches him go for a second, then continues to head home.

           INT. FAYE’S BUNGALOW - LATER THAT EVENING

           Faye walks in, completely dejected. Heads to the mirror.

                                 MIRROR
                        ...anything you want to ask me?

           Faye shakes her head, sadly.
                                 FAYE
                        I think I know the answer, anyway.

           INT. FAIRYGODMOTHER HQ - THE NEXT DAY

           Faye is in Tom’s office. He’s wearing an ace bandage around 
           his wrist, and doesn’t look happy.

                                 TOM
                        Obviously this is a huge breach of 
                        protocol.

                                 FAYE
                        I know.

                                 TOM
                        Truly never would have suspected it 
                        of you.

                                 FAYE
                        Well, why the hell not? 

           Tom looks at her in surprise.

                                 TOM
                        Excuse me?

                                 FAYE
                        Why wouldn’t you suspect it of me? 
                        I’m a woman, I’m single, you’re 
                        putting me in a situation with a an 
                        international playboy. 

                                 TOM
                        Well I just never really thought of 
                        you that way --

                                 FAYE
                        Well the Prince didn’t seem to have 
                        an issue thinking of me that way!

                                 TOM
                        No, he certainly didn’t, I just had 
                        pegged you for someone a bit more --

                                 FAYE
                        Past her prime?

                                 TOM
                        Professional. 

           Faye slumps down again, defeated.
                                 FAYE
                        Well, there is that.

           Tom sits down next to her. His tone is gentler now.

                                 TOM
                        When I had you sign a Non-Compete 
                        Agreements, I didn’t think I needed 
                        to specify not to compete with the 
                        clients.

                                 FAYE
                        I actually helped. It was like 
                        comparison shopping. Gotta shop 
                        around a bit so you know what you 
                        want. And now he wants her! She’s 
                        still at the palace!
                           (she looks at him)
                        Am I fired?

                                 TOM
                        No...I think we’re gonna put that 
                        promotion on ice for a little.

                                 FAYE
                        I understand. 

                                 TOM
                        Get you started back on some easy 
                        clients. Easier anyway. 

           He rubs his wrist. Faye winces.

                                 FAYE
                        Wand sprain?

                                 TOM
                        So painful!

                                 FAYE
                        It’s bad. It’s the worst.

           INT. FAIRYGODMOTHER HQ - END OF DAY

           The office is quiet. Everyone’s gone home for the day. The 
           bluebirds sleep in their cages.

           Only Faye and Tilly are left, going over their end-of-day 
           checklist.

                                 TILLY
                        The seamstress is working on the 
                        derby dress.
                                 FAYE
                        Great.

                                 TILLY
                        And here’s the scroll for the new 
                        eligible. He’s a Duke. 

           She hands Faye a scroll.

                                 TILLY (CONT’D)
                        Do you need anything else today?

                                 FAYE
                        You’re good to go, Tilly, thanks. 

                                 TILLY
                        See you tomorrow, then. 

           Tilly leaves. Faye takes the file and unscrolls it.

                                 FAYE
                           (reading)
                        Prince Rob of Michaelberg. He likes 
                        “polo” and “to laugh.” Oh, boy.

           Suddenly, Faye hears the sound of CRYING. 

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                           (not looking up from her 
                           scroll)
                        Tilly, you wanna get that? 

           No response. The crying sound continues. Faye heaves herself 
           up and walks into the empty office. It’s dark and empty, 
           except for the MAGIC MIRROR, which is aglow. 

           In the mirror there’s a close-up of Kenzie, sobbing.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Kenzie?

           EXT. THE PALACE GARDENS - SAME

           Kenzie, in a glittering ball gown, flees down the palace 
           steps and into the garden. There, she stops at a bench and 
           begins to weep, weep, weep uncontrollably.

           A flash of light. A pop of smoke. And Faye appears.

                                 FAYE
                        Kenzie, what’s wrong, what 
                        happened?
           Kenzie looks up sharply at the sound of Faye’s voice, but 
           crumples again when she sees who it is.

                                 KENZIE
                        Noooo! No! Not you! Why are you 
                        here?

                                 FAYE
                        Because I’m your Fairy Godmother.

                                 KENZIE
                        Well, I want a different one!

                                 FAYE
                        It doesn’t work that way!

                                 KENZIE
                        Can’t they just reassign me?

                                 FAYE
                        Not without a lot of paperwork. 
                        What happened?

                                 KENZIE
                        What do you care? You don’t care 
                        about me, you just care about THE 
                        PRINCE.

                                 FAYE
                        That is not true.

           Faye hands her a tissue.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You have a little....coming out of 
                        your. Here. 

           Kenzie takes the tissue, glaring.

                                 KENZIE
                           (blowing her nose)
                        All those hours in the makeup 
                        chair. I don’t even want to know 
                        what I look like.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, you look rough.

                                 KENZIE
                        Is there like, training they have 
                        you do to be a fairy godmother, or 
                        are you just winging it here?
                                 FAYE
                        I mean you look rough but you’re 
                        still setting an impossibly high 
                        standard of beauty. Like, if this 
                        is your worst, the rest of us are 
                        literally doomed.

                                 KENZIE
                        Why. Are you even. Here.

                                 FAYE
                        Because I saw you sobbing in the 
                        palace garden!

                                 KENZIE
                        Creepy! You’re really weird and 
                        CREEPY.

                                 FAYE
                        Weird and creepy with access to 
                        like, a lot of magic that could fix 
                        whatever your situation is. Look, 
                        Kenzie, I wanna do right by you. 
                        Because despite my legitimately 
                        crazy behavior, I do recognize that 
                        you’re a nice girl, you’re 
                        outgoing, and people love to watch 
                        you take your hair out of your 
                        ponytail -

                                 KENZIE
                        What?

                                 FAYE
                        - and you’re going to make a great 
                        princess. The perfect princess, 
                        actually. So whatever it is that 
                        you’re upset about tonight, let me 
                        help fix it. Please.

           Kenzie looks at Faye for a second, then breaks out into a 
           wail.

                                 KENZIE
                           (sobbing, unintelligble)
                        He. Doesn’t. Make me. LAUGH!!!!!

                                 FAYE
                        What?

                                 KENZIE
                        The prince! He’s never made me 
                        laugh. Not once! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENZIE (CONT'D)
                        And you said that’s how you know if 
                        a guy is right. You said that’s how 
                        you know!

                                 FAYE
                        Well, maybe I was wrong about that. 
                        Maybe it’s in his kiss.

                                 KENZIE
                           (shakes her head)
                        And it’s really hard because I have 
                        a really good sense of humor, you 
                        know?

                                 FAYE
                           (no)
                        Sure.

                                 KENZIE
                        Sometimes he’ll say something, and 
                        I know he’s trying to be funny but 
                        it’s not actually funny, it’s just 
                        sort of sarcastic and mean. And 
                        other times something that I know 
                        is funny will happen - like the 
                        court jester will try to juggle 
                        knives or something -- and I’ll 
                        look over and The Prince isn’t even 
                        laughing. And when we’re alone, we 
                        don’t really even have 
                        conversations, it’s more like we 
                        just take turns talking. Like I’ll 
                        talk about something to him, and 
                        he’ll talk back to me about plants, 
                        or, I don’t even know. But he’s 
                        nice, and a Prince, and handsome, 
                        so I don’t know if I’m just being 
                        crazy and picky and having pre-
                        wedding jitters or what. What do 
                        you think I should do, Faye?

                                 FAYE
                        I can’t tell you what to do --

                                 KENZIE
                        THEN WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT OF YOU!

                                 FAYE
                        You don’t need me to tell you what 
                        to do. That’s not what a fairy 
                        godmother is. We just help fulfil 
                        what you actually want. 
                                 KENZIE
                        I don’t know what I want.

                                 FAYE
                        You do, you just gotta trust 
                        yourself. Close your eyes.

                                 KENZIE
                        Why?

                                 FAYE
                        Just. Try. 

           Reluctantly, Kenzie closes her eyes.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Now, picture the happiest version 
                        of yourself. You look amazing, the 
                        best you’ve ever looked. You’re 
                        wearing a beautiful gown, of 
                        course, but mostly you look 
                        beautiful because you’re just 
                        radiating happiness. And you’re 
                        laughing, and laughing, and 
                        laughing. Can you picture yourself?

           Kenzie nods.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Ok. Now. Who’s standing next to 
                        you?

           Kenzie squints harder, as if trying to see. Then, after a 
           moment:

                                 KENZIE
                        No one. 

           She opens her eyes.

                                 KENZIE (CONT’D)
                        I can see myself, and I’m so happy. 
                        But I’m by myself.

                                 FAYE
                        Well. I think you have your answer.

                                 KENZIE
                        Can you help me?

           Faye nods.
                                 FAYE
                        Sure. I’ll take care of everything.

                                 KENZIE
                        But don’t tell Carl. I think that’d 
                        be weird. And I need to tell him 
                        myself.

                                 FAYE
                        Of course. Whatever you want. But 
                        maybe. An outfit change.

           Faye raises her wand, and gives Kenzie a questioning look. 
           Kenzie nods.

           With a tap of her wand, Kenzie’s gown unravels. The make-up 
           washes off from her face, and we’re left with Kenzie at her 
           simplest in a straight forward gown.

                                 KENZIE
                        The ball tonight --

                                 FAYE
                        Don’t worry. I’ve got it covered. 
                        You just go take care of the 
                        prince.

           Kenzie nods. 

           Fade Out. 

           INT. FAYE’S BUNGALOW - A MONTH LATER

           Faye is having the kind of night you can only have when 
           you’re single. She’s wearing huge sweatpants. She’s eating 
           something out of a jar. She’s got a bleach strip on her upper 
           lip. She’s happily bopping around the apartment, when she 
           turns, and

           GAH!! 

           Tilly is standing there. In her apartment. While she’s got a 
           moustache strip on. Surrounded by everyone from her office: 
           Fern, Begonia, The Seamstress, the Mice. 

                                 FAYE
                        Oh my god, did something happen? 
                        Did Tom die?

                                 TOM
                           (from behind)
                        What? No.
           Faye puts her hand on her chest.

                                 FAYE
                        Oh my god. Then why are you all 
                        here, what happened?

                                 TILLY
                        We’re here because....we’re your 
                        fairy godfamily.

                                 FAYE
                           (not comprehending)
                        Okay...

                                 TOM
                        We’re here because you are clearly 
                        in distress --

                                 FAYE
                        No I’m --

                                 TOM
                           (interrupting her)
                        Yes, you are.

                                 TILLY
                        And we’re going to fix you!

                                 FAYE
                        Very sweet, guys. Gesture 
                        appreciated, message received. I’ll 
                        perk up a bit by Monday, I promise.

                                 TILLY
                        What is your deepest wish?

                                 FAYE
                        I dunno! I don’t have one. 

                                 TOM
                        Oh, everyone has a wish, please, 
                        you’re making this take so much 
                        longer than it needs to.

                                 FAYE
                        I really don’t!

           They look at her, unmoved.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                           (reluctantly)
                        Ok, ok. Uhm. A new oven.
                                 TOM
                        That’s your deepest wish.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes, this one gets all smoky when I 
                        try to broil. A new one would be 
                        just the thing to perk me up.

                                 TOM
                        WEAK. Everyone knows you can’t 
                        cook.

           She gestures to the oven, but Tilly walks right past her, 
           directly to the mirror on the wall.

                                 TILLY
                        Mirror?

           The mirror begins to glow.

                                 FAYE
                        Oh, that’s actually - I’m not sure 
                        the mirror is working right now, 
                        it’s been kind of acting up --

           The mirror shows Prince Carl, hard at work in the garden. 

                                 TOM
                        Well, well, well.

           Prince Carl stops work, wipes the sweat off his brow. He 
           takes off his shirt. 

           In a panic, Faye knocks it with her hand until it turns off.

                                 FAYE
                        Weird! Like I said, it’s been 
                        really acting up lately. So! How 
                        about that oven?

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT.  FAIRYGODMOTHER HQ - THE SEAMSTRESS STATION

           Faye, still with her moustache bleach, is standing on a 
           little pedestal as the seamstress drapes her in fabric. 

           Tilly and Tom watch.

                                 TILLY
                        It would be fun to see her in 
                        something kind of sexy.
                                 TOM
                        But like, guy-sexy, not woman-sexy.

                                 TILLY
                        Something that says, “good things 
                        come in all different packages.”

                                 TOM
                        With some cleavage.

                                 TILLY
                        It can’t be in pink cause that’s 
                        really not her color.

                                 TOM
                        Washes her out.

                                 TILLY
                        Possibly black?

                                 TOM
                        Too on-the-nose, you know, older 
                        vampy woman.

                                 TILLY
                        Blue?

                                 TOM
                           (wrinkling his nose)
                        Like her robes?

                                 TILLY
                        Worked for him in the past.

                                 TOM
                        Fair point.

                                 FAYE
                        Do I have any say in this 
                        whatsoever?

                                 TOM
                        No.

           Tilly walks over to the seamstress, whispers something in her 
           ear. 

                                 SEAMSTRESS
                           (nodding)
                        Oh, yes, for sure, we can 
                        definitely put her in some 
                        shapewear.

           Faye’s jaw drops, offended.
           INT. THE PROP WAREHOUSE

           Tilly, Tom, and Faye, with a cart, are going down the aisles.

                                 TILLY
                        We’re looking for something that 
                        reads, “I’ve seen the error of my 
                        ways.

                                 TOM
                        “Penitent...and willing.”

                                 FAYE
                        Guys. I appreciate this? But I 
                        don’t feel comfortable with any of 
                        what is happening here --

           Tilly holds up a pair of perfect, beautiful glass slippers.

                                 TILLY
                        How about these?

           Tom considers.

                                 TOM
                        Could be fun, in a sort of wink-
                        wink kind of way. 

           Faye eyes them, tempted, but dubious.

                                 FAYE
                        I dunno. The fairy godmother 
                        showing up in glass slippers that 
                        she got from the prop room -- don’t 
                        you think it’s a little pat?

                                 TILLY
                        Maybe just try them on?

           With a beleaguered, embarrassed sigh, Faye kicks off her shoe 
           and tries on one of the slippers.

                                 TOM
                        Well, what do you know. Perfect 
                        fit.

           INT. THE PALACE BREAKFAST ROOM

           Prince Alistair, Prince Carl, and Princess Griselda are at 
           breakfast. Alistair and Griselda chatter away, but Carl picks 
           at his food, listlessly. 

           Chauncey discreetly whispers in Carl’s ear.
                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Pardon the interruption sire, but. 
                        There’s been...a bit of a 
                        kertuffle. In the antechamber.

           Prince Carl looks at him.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        A kertuffle? What does that mean?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        I don’t rightly know, but from what 
                        I understand it has something to do 
                        with...Stefan.

                                 PRINCE ALISTAIR
                        Stefan, Stefan your horse?

                                 PRINCESS GRISELDA
                        Why is your horse in the 
                        antechamber??

           Carl grins.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Thank you, Chauncey. I had better 
                        go check it out.

           He bounds out of the room.

           INT. THE ANTECHAMBER

           The Prince screeches into the antechamber, flinging open the 
           door. He beams when he sees Faye.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        A kertuffle. Just what I was hoping 
                        for.

           Faye laughs. She lifts up her skirt a little to show her 
           glass slippers.

                                 PRINCE CARL (CONT’D)
                        Nice shoes.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, well, I had to replace my 
                        other pair. No thanks to the 
                        deplorable Royal Lost and Found.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I like these replacements very 
                        much.
                                 FAYE
                        My fairy godmothers chose them for 
                        me.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        You have fairy godmothers? Like, 
                        plural?

                                 FAYE
                        And a Godfather.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        Wow. You’re very lucky. I don’t 
                        have any fairy godparents at all.

                                 FAYE
                        Yeah, well. You’re a prince, so. 
                        Not everyone can have everything.

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        I know that. 

                                 FAYE
                        What would you wish for? 

                                 PRINCE CARL
                        A fairy godmother. But like. This 
                        one. In particular.

           She smiles. They kiss.

           EPILOGUE

           EXT. MARKET PLACE

           Tilly, now dressed as a Fairy Godmother, is anxiously peering 
           behind a market stall as her YOUNG CLIENT walks up to a fruit 
           stall. As the Young Client picks an apple from a stand, Tilly 
           flicks her wand, sending the whole pile to the ground. A CUTE 
           MARKET BOY helps her pick them all up. There’s clearly a 
           spark between them.

           EXT. MARKET PLACE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Young Client, trying to retain her composure but 
           practically shaking from excitement, walks back to Tilly. 
           Once hidden from view, they instantly start squealing and 
           jumping up and down. It’s hard to tell who’s more excited.
           INT. A TEEN BOY’S BEDROOM

           Tom, now outfitted in a cool version of the blue robes, pops 
           into the room of a geeky TEEN BOY (braces, acne), who’s mouth 
           gapes in surprise.

           INT. TEEN BOY’S BEDROOM - LATER

           The boy has now changed clothing (he looks suspiciously like 
           Tom). Tom uses his wand to have him stand up straighter. 

           INT. A BALL 

           Tom watches as the Geeky Boy approaches a Young Maiden and 
           asks her to dance. She says yes, and he surreptitiously beams 
           at Tom, who smiles back. The couple starts dancing 
           beautifully, elegantly across the ballroom. We then see that 
           it is Tom who, with his wand, is guiding the young boy’s 
           feet.

           INT. THAT SAME BALL - ELSEWHERE

           Kenzie, looking resplendent (of course.), is surrounded by 
           male admirerers. They’re fawning over her, but she’s 
           distracted. Something has caught her attention at the other 
           end of the ballroom. She excuses herself and makes her way 
           over to...

           ...a GROUP OF GIRLS, all around her age, laughing together, 
           having a good time.

           We see Kenzie’s face as she approaches them -- vulnerable, a 
           little unsure of herself, but determined. She smiles at them.

           INT. THE ROYAL PALACE

           Prince Alistair, now holding a BABY BOY, and Princess 
           Griselda are posing for a royal portrait. A PAINTER is 
           painstakingly at work. After a few moments, they pop around 
           the canvass to see how he’s progressing. Obviously, they have 
           notes. 

           EXT. A SMALL COTTAGE

           Faye, in her blue robes, is outside with a YOUNG GIRL, who 
           shyly brings her a walnut.

           Faye taps the walnut with her wand, and it turns into a 
           modest, functional-looking carriage. The girl’s eyes boggle.
           Next, Faye finds two crickets, and turns them into horses. 

           Now, for the girl:

           With her wand, Faye turns the girl round and round, until 
           she’s wearing a CARRIAGE DRIVER UNIFORM. The girl 
           ecstatically hops onto the carriage and grabs the reins.

           INT./EXT THE CARRIAGE

           Whooping with glee, the young girl is driving the carriage at 
           breakneck speed.

           Inside, Faye, indulgent, but a little queasy. Outside, she 
           catches a glimpse of the clock tower. Almost midnight..

           INT. FAYE’S BUNGALOW - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Faye arrives home, exhausted. Her cat comes over. 

                                 FAYE
                        Hey there, Cat! Did you miss me?

           She picks up the cat and tries to snuggle it, but the cat 
           reacts wildly, scrambling to get out of her arms.

                                 FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, ok, ok, ok!

           She sets the cat down. It sprints out of the room. She 
           follows him into the bungalow, where she’s greeted by...

           PRINCE CARL! Wearing an apron, and putting the finishing 
           touches on an enormous spread of food. 

           Faye puts her hands over her heart. As in, “be still my 
           beating.” 

           With a huge grin, Prince Carl leads her to the couch, setting  
           the enormous spread of food before her. He plops down next to 
           her. Grabs her hand. Squeezes it. 

           And they hold hands and eat. 

           Happily ever after.
