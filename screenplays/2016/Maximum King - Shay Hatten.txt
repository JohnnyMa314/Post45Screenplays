           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON a line of cocaine. A crazy long line of cocaine, 
           long enough to kill a man, to kill an elephant.

           A NOSE DESCENDS INTO FRAME. A ROLLED UP 100 DOLLAR BILL.

           SSSSSSSSSNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

           THE COCAINE DISAPPEARS INSIDE THIS GUY. We still don’t see 
           his face.

           FROM BEHIND -- This dude jumps up and down three times, pumps 
           a fist in the air, AND SPRINTS OUT OF THE BATHROOM.

           SUPER: 1985

           INT. OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           EXTREME CLOSE UP on the face of a big, lanky, slightly puffy-
           faced dude. 

           An unflattering bowl haircut that you can’t look away from. 
           Obnoxiously wide 1980s glasses -- the kind of glasses your 
           dad is always wearing in old photographs. Brimming with 
           nerves and energy, this has to be the guy who just did all 
           that cocaine.

           It also happens to be the preeminent STEPHEN KING (36).

           LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN THE BARREL OF THE CAMERA, he opens his 
           mouth. 

           Everything he says spills out in a SLIGHTLY NASAL VOICE -- at 
           the speed you would expect from the prior coke intake.

                                 STEPHEN KING
                        Okay. Okay, so, get this. How do

                        what I’m thinking, that’s what I’m 
                        thinking, you get an idea about a 
                        haunted hotel and then BAM you

                        everywhere, BAM another hit, they 
                        keep coming, they keep coming.

                        THE FUCKING STAND, are you kidding, 
                        got three hundred pages of that 
                        thing still sitting in a drawer 
                        hasn’t ever seen the light of day.

                        Little girl fuckin’ BAM ZING BOOM 
                        blowing shit up with her mind, WITH 
                        HER MIND! What’s next, what’s after 
                        that, the dog, right, I wrote the 
                        one with the dog, oh, people liked 
                        that, people fucking LOVED that, 
                        it’s insidious, it speaks to the 
                        minds of, of people’s- what? Right, 
                        this is what I’m saying, we got a 
                        car, not a normal car, it’s fucking 
                        killing people, all over the place, 
                        over here, over there, a little 
                        kid’s cat comes back to life, no, 
                        that’s not enough, is it, HE comes 
                        back to life, you remember that 
                        one, Dan, you remember the reviews, 
                        the critics weren’t so on board for 
                        that, called me “twisted,” well, 
                        maybe I am, ha ha ha, don’t even 
                        get me started about, okay, you 
                        know the one with the Gunslinger, 
                        oh, there’s a sequel to that coming 
                        down the pipes, maybe two, maybe 
                        SEVEN, you’re not gonna believe 
                        where that shit’s gonna go, so, 
                        here’s what I’m saying. What I’m 
                        saying is, a decade ago I lived in 
                        a trailer, but look at me now, 
                        bing, bang, boom, here I am, and 
                        the question is how do you follow 
                        it up? Well, here’s what I’m saying 
                        is, I got it, I know how you follow 
                        it up. How you follow it up is...

           A brief pause. A slight reprieve from this coked-out rant. 
           Then--

                                 STEPHEN KING (CONT’D)
                        Picture it, Dan, picture it. 
                        There’s a guy, right, a normal man, 
                        well, mostly, he’s got a wife, a 
                        daughter, but he’s a fat fucking 
                        pig of a man, oinky oink, takes his 
                        body for granted, takes everything 
                        for granted, then one day he’s 
                        driving down the street with his 
                        wife and his wife is fuckin’, 
                        fucking and sucking, sucking him 
                        off, right? So where’s his mind at, 
                        it’s not on the road, that’s for 
                        sure, and then BAM! Hits a gypsy. 
                        He hits. A gypsy. With his car. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPHEN KING (CONT’D)
                        Then this other fucking gypsy, she 
                        looks at him, she’s like, 
                        “Thinner.” She whispers it, 
                        whispers a curse, so he starts 
                        losing weight, right, starts losing 
                        it real slow at first. And at first 
                        he’s like, great, drop some pounds, 
                        please the wife, but it keeps 
                        happening, skinnier and skinnier, 
                        oh no, what does he do, finds a 
                        friend, tracks this bitch down, 
                        right, BOOM, friend gets shot! Shot 
                        through the hand! And how does it 
                        end, how does it all end, that’s 
                        what you’re asking, right, that’s 
                        what you’re wondering? Three words. 
                        Magic. Fucking. Pie. A murder pie, 
                        if you will, and why wouldn’t you? 
                        But the wrong people eat it, his 
                        wife, his daughter, they eat it by 
                        accident, this man, this skinny 
                        fucker, he crumbles into despair 
                        and THAT. IS HOW. YOU WRITE. AN 
                        ENDING. Boom fuck you very much 
                        whaddya think?

           Sitting dumbfounded at a desk across from Steve is the guy 
           who’s been privy to all this -- DAN JANSEN (40). 

           A plaque on his desk bears his name and the title “Literary 
           Agent.” Dan takes a moment to collect himself.

                                 DAN
                        How are things, Steve? Wife, kids 
                        okay?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, yeah, the wife’s great, both -
                        - no, all three of the kids, doing 
                        great, but the idea, Dan, the idea, 
                        what do you think?

                                 DAN
                        You want to write a book... about a 
                        gypsy who curses a fat guy to lose 
                        weight?

                                 STEVE
                        No, no, well, yeah, but not, I 
                        don’t want to write it, I WROTE it.

                                 DAN
                        You already--
           Steve produces a thick manuscript -- seemingly from nowhere -- 
           and slams it down onto Dan’s desk.

                                 STEVE
                        There it is, signed, sealed, 
                        delivered.

           As Dan picks it up, flips through it wearily--

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        But this one, the thing is, this 
                        one’s a little darker than true 
                        blue Steve, so I think this one’s 
                        gonna be a Bachman Book, you hear 
                        that, Dan, put it out under 
                        Bachman’s name.

                                 DAN
                        You don’t just wanna ship it out 
                        under your name and sell a hundred 
                        times more copies? Because people 
                        are gonna find out about the 
                        Bachman thing eventually--

                                 STEVE
                        Nope, Bachman, it’s a Bachman, are 
                        we in this for the money or are we 
                        in this for the art?

           Dan is visibly not 100% sure how to answer.

                                 DAN
                        I... yeah, okay, I’ll give it to 
                        Suzy for proofing.

                                 STEVE
                        Right, Suzy, I forgot about Suzy, I 
                        forgot about proofing, isn’t that 
                        funny, how the mind lets go of 
                        things sometimes?

                                 DAN
                        Yeah, listen, Steve, the reason I 
                        wanted to talk to you--

                                 STEVE
                        About the book, right?

                                 DAN
                        What?

                                 STEVE
                        I came in to talk about the book, 
                        remember? Thinner?
                                 DAN
                        Steve, I called you in here, I 
                        didn’t know about the book until 
                        forty seconds ago.

                                 STEVE
                        Right, yeah, that’s right. Sure. So 
                        what can I do for you?

                                 DAN
                        It’s... Okay, it’s an offer. A new 
                        opportunity.

                                 STEVE
                        Lay it on me.

                                 DAN
                        Before I do, just promise me you’ll 
                        think it through. I relocated to 
                        Maine to manage you specifically, 
                        and we’ve got a good thing going 
                        here, I just want to make sure we 
                        don’t jump into anything over our 
                        heads.

                                 STEVE
                        Lay it the fuck on me, brotha’.

                                 DAN
                        Dino de Laurentiis’s people reached 
                        out.

                                 STEVE
                        How is Dino, what’s up with Dino, 
                        the residuals on Cat’s Eye rolling 
                        in yet?

                                 DAN
                        Not so much. Look, they want you to 
                        direct a movie. Based on one of 
                        your own books. I mean it’s no 
                        secret that some of the adaptations 
                        of your work have been a little, 
                        well--

                                 STEVE
                        Shitty, Dan, the word you’re 
                        looking for is shitty.

                                 DAN
                        Right, so Dino’s idea was that you 
                        might want to do it yourself. Make 
                        sure it’s done right, I guess.
                                 STEVE
                        Shit, I’d be lying if I said I 
                        wasn’t intrigued. If I did it 
                        myself...

                                 DAN
                        Do you know anything about 
                        directing?

                                 STEVE
                        No but how hard can it be, I mean--

           Steve glances at his giant dorky watch.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck. I gotta run. Walk with me.

           Steve stands and leaves with no warning. Dan SIGHS, gets up, 
           and follows him out.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Steve and Dan exit the building. Steve walks to his car, a 
           shitbox old Honda. He’s past due for an upgrade.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s an intriguing idea, that’s for 
                        sure. Tell Dino I’ll think about 
                        it. And give me your thoughts on 
                        Thinner, I think people are gonna 
                        really dig this one.

           Steve waves goodbye to Dan, walks to his car, gets in. 
           Seconds later AC/DC music BEGINS TO BLARE FROM THE CAR. 

           The car JERKS FORWARDS and zooms recklessly out of the 
           parking lot. 

           A car driving down the street swerves to avoid hitting him. 
           HORNS BLARE.

           SUZY (40s), Dan’s co-worker, exits the building and stands 
           next to Dan.

                                 SUZY
                        How’s our guy doing?

                                 DAN
                        He just turned in a book about a 
                        gypsy who curses a fat guy to lose 
                        weight. How do you think he’s 
                        doing?
           INT. STEVE’S SHITBOX CAR - SAME TIME

           Steve drives down the street. He looks to his right and JOLTS 
           in his seat.

           A TALL, BLACK-ROBED, MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY LOOKING-DUDE sits in 
           the passenger seat. Handsome face-- but evil lurks behind the 
           eyes. As his clothes would suggest, this is THE MAN IN BLACK.

           Astute readers will recognize him as King’s ultimate 
           villainous creation -- Big Bad from THE STAND, THE DARK 
           TOWER, etc. That’s right -- King is literally having 
           hallucinations of his fictional characters.

           The Man in Black glares at Steve for a long, cold moment -- 
           gazing into his soul.

           INT. STEVE’S SHITBOX CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Steve does a bump of coke off of the back of his own hand.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Steve’s shitbox car ZOOMS BACK INTO DAN’S PARKING LOT from 
           the other direction -- he’s circled the block.

           The window rolls down. Steve sticks his head out and YELLS AT 
           DAN AND SUZY as the car passes back through the parking lot 
           without stopping.

                                 STEVE
                        I circled around because I had a 
                        thought! I want to do it! I want to 
                        do the movie! Tell Dino I’m 
                        onboard, but only if I write the 
                        script myself! The whole thing! 
                        Tell him I’ll have him the script 
                        in two weeks! No, three months! No, 
                        fifteen days! No, three weeks! I’m 
                        gonna do it, Dan! I’m gonna make 
                        the greatest fucking movie the 
                        world has ever seen!

           Steve ZOOMS back into the street. ANOTHER CAR swerves to 
           avoid hitting him. Dan and Suzy watch him go.

                                 SUZY
                        Didn’t his wife give him an 
                        intervention five years ago?
                                 DAN
                        Yeah. But you know Steve. He’s 
                        never been a quitter.

           Suzy looks at Dan, who looks hopelessly out at the street. 
           Steve’s car disappears in the distance.

           EXT. BANGOR, MAINE - SAME TIME

           Steve’s car cruises through the streets of Bangor, Maine. 

           Steve glances over at the passenger seat. The Man in Black 
           continues to glare at Steve -- then the glare vanishes. He 
           gives Steve an approving nod.

           Steve smiles back at him, then turns and looks at the street 
           again. He grins, WHOOPS, and drives off down the road.

           SUPER: “This is a sort of true and sort of made up story. I 
           mean it’s true but it’s sort of embellished. For, you know, 
           dramatic effect.”

           SUPER: “Sorry, Stephen King.”

           EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

           Steve’s car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a high school.

           INT. SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

           Steve walks down the hall of a middle school. Kids WHISPER TO 
           EACH OTHER and move to the sides of the hall as he walks. 
           Steve stops and looks at a KID (13) who’s staring at him.

                                 STEVE
                        BOO!

                                 KID
                        Ah!

           The kid cowers. Steve LAUGHS and keeps walking. JOE KING (12) 
           sees Steve and runs up to him.

                                 JOE
                        Dad! I’ve told you a billion times 
                        to wait in the car outside until I 
                        come out.

                                 STEVE
                        Why? Do I creep people out?
                                 JOE
                        Yes, one hundred percent, you creep 
                        people out.

           STEVE LAUGHS. NAOMI KING (14) runs up to Joe and Steve.

                                 NAOMI
                        Dad, you’re supposed to just wait-

                                 STEVE
                        Outside, I know, I know, I know.

           Steve looks around, spots one of Naomi’s friends, AND MAKES A 
           SCARY FACE. Naomi begins to push Steve towards the door.

           EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

           Steve and the kids get back into the shitty Honda.

           SECONDS LATER -- THE AC/DC BEGINS TO BLARE AGAIN.

           EXT. BANGOR, MAINE - MINUTES LATER

           The car cruises through the streets of Bangor.

           INT. STEVE’S SHITBOX CAR - SAME TIME

           Steve looks to Naomi, who rides shotgun.

                                 STEVE
                        Hey Naomi, take the wheel a second. 
                        I think I dropped a quarter.

           Apprehensive, Naomi takes the wheel.

           Steve bends down into the well between the seat and the door. 
           Out of sight from his children, he uncaps a little vile, taps 
           a BUMP OF COKE onto his wrist, AND SNORTS IT.

           STILL SNORTING he sits back up.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        WOOO found it!

           Joe and Naomi share a wary look.

           EXT. KING HOME - LATER

           The car cruises through a gate and screeches to a stop in 
           front of the large King house.
           INT. KING HOME / KITCHEN - LATER

           CLOSE ON the face of a screaming child, OWEN KING (4). Owen 
           sits in a booster seat in the kitchen. Steve looks into 
           Owen’s eyes trying to comfort him.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s okay, Owen, daddy’s here. 
                        Papa’s here.

           OWEN’S PERSPECTIVE -- Steve’s face, looming in front of him, 
           is horrifying.

           OWEN CRIES LOUDER.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Make way for the airplane, open up 
                        for the airplane!

           Steve AIRPLANES Owen’s binky into his mouth. Owen finally 
           stops crying. 

           TABITHA KING (35) stands over the stove preparing dinner.

                                 TABITHA KING
                        You’re really gonna do it?

                                 STEVE
                        Sure, but I’m not sure which book I 
                        want to adapt. The best ones, or, 
                        the most popular ones, have already 
                        gotten the movie treatment, and 
                        shittily. Maybe I could make 
                        Thinner and put out the book and 
                        the movie at the same time.

                                 TABBY
                        Yeah, about Thinner-

                                 STEVE
                        Or I could do The Shining again, 
                        give it a proper go. You know, 
                        considering what a heap of shit 
                        that movie was.

                                 TABBY
                        People liked The Shining, Kubrick 
                        is--

                  TABBY
           --a genius.
                                        STEVE
                                An idiot who made a terrible 
                                movie, I know, that’s what 
                                I’ve been saying for years. 
                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        That’s not what I was gonna say. I 
                        liked the movie.

           Steve goes to Tabby. Kisses her.

                                 STEVE
                        I know. Thank you for never lying 
                        to me. But I didn’t.

           Steve turns and grabs a beer from the fridge. He cracks it 
           open. 

           Tabby looks at the beer and opens her mouth to say 
           something... But seems to hesitate.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

                                 TABBY
                        It’s just... Are you really sure 
                        you want to do this?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, I mean... What do you mean?

                                 TABBY
                        How long have we been married?

                                 STEVE
                        Naomi’s twelve so...

               STEVE (CONT’D)
                                        TABBY
           Thirteen years.
                                She’s fourteen, we’ve been 
                                married fourteen years.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Right, yeah.

                                 TABBY
                        I mean... Don’t act like I haven’t 
                        been around. In fourteen years, 
                        I’ve never once heard you mention a 
                        desire to direct a movie so--

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah yeah yeah, but--

           Tabby grabs him by the shoulders.

                                 TABBY
                        Steve. Listen to me for two 
                        minutes. Why do you feel like this 
                        is something you have to do?
           Steve actually does look at her, however far afield his mind 
           may be, and when he talks it feels like an honest answer.

                                 STEVE
                        Look around you and tell me what 
                        you see.

           Tabby humors him, looks around.

                  TABBY
           I don’t know, I guess--
                                        STEVE
                                That’s right, Tabby, you see 
                                our house.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        And you know where we weren’t, not 
                        that long ago? In this house. You 
                        remember where we were?

                                 TABBY
                        Yes, I remember where we--

                                 STEVE
                        A trailer. We lived in a trailer 
                        and now we don’t, because that’s 
                        what we do, we move up. And 
                        directing a movie, a big Hollywood 
                        movie? That’s another chance to 
                        move up, why wouldn’t I take it? I 
                        don’t think I’m tooting my own horn 
                        to say that I’m a great writer. Why 
                        can’t I be a great director, too?

           Tabby looks at him for a long, careful moment.

                                 TABBY
                        I just don’t want things to get out 
                        of control again. Because I meant 
                        it during the intervention five 
                        years ago when I said that it had 
                        better not happen again. So... you 
                        sure you’re up to it?

           Steve looks down at the beer in his hand, then looks at Tabby 
           and smiles.

                                 STEVE
                        Everything’s under control.

                                 TABBY
                    (forcing a smile)
                        If you say so, honey. Help me set 
                        the table?
           INT. KING HOME / DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           The King family sits around the dinner table. Steve picks at 
           his meatloaf, lost in thought, while Naomi blathers on about 
           something in the background.

                                 NAOMI
                        I just... I just don’t know what to 
                        do, Mom. It’s hard. The dance is 
                        two weeks away and at this point I 
                        don’t know if anybody’s even gonna 
                        ask me. And I don’t know if it’s 
                        because they think I’m ugly, or 
                        short, but--

           Steve’s head shoots up.

                                 STEVE
                        What did you say? Did you say 
                        ‘short’?

           STEVE JUMPS TO HIS FEET, bumping the table and sending food 
           dishes scattering.

                                 NAOMI
                        What?

                                 STEVE
                        That’s it! Short! Sweetie, you’re a 
                        genius!

           Steve runs out of the room, jostling Naomi’s hair as he 
           passes her. Naomi turns and shouts after him.

                                 NAOMI
                        No, I’m sad!

           She buries her face in her hands. Tabby puts a comforting 
           hand on her shoulder.

           INT. KING HOME / STEVE’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Steve’s head is buried in a closet. He digs through boxes, 
           searching for something.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        What are you looking for, Steve?

           Steve stands, MASSIVE CARDBOARD BOX in his hands. He plops it 
           on his desk and looks up to see... 

           JACK TORRANCE (30s), classic Shining anti-hero and another 
           King hallucination, standing before him. 
           It’s the Nicholson version of Jack. Or, you know, a guy who 
           looks pretty similar to a young Nicholson.

                                 STEVE
                        Short stories, Jack! Maybe the 
                        answer isn’t a book, maybe it’s a 
                        short story, a kernel of an idea 
                        that could launch a full film. And 
                        every time I get a story published 
                        in a magazine I keep one copy for 
                        myself and they all go in the 
                        closet. Look.

           With one hand he grabs a copy of the short story collection 
           Night Shift from the box. With the other hand, a number of 
           sci-fi fantasy magazines.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Wow, and you only got one giant box 
                        of short stories in there?

           Steve isn’t listening. He’s turned away, digging in the 
           closet for-- 

           ANOTHER HUGE BOX. He plops this on the desk next to the 
           first.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        Gee wiz there, that’s a lot of 
                        writing. Don’t forget what I always 
                        say, “All work and no play makes--”

                                 STEVE
                        No, you only say that in the 
                        fucking movie. If you’re gonna 
                        quote me at least be accurate.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Yeah, on second thought, fuck 
                        taking it easy. Like I ever 
                        listened to my wife, am I right? I 
                        mean sure, Tabby thinks you’re 
                        going a little hard, but what does 
                        she know? If you stop who knows 
                        what’ll happen, for all you know 
                        you’ll slide back down, end up 
                        living back in a trailer with no 
                        family, everyone you love dead and 
                        forgotten like dear old mom... Say, 
                        what do you say we do a little coke 
                        and brainstorm about this script?

           As Jack talks, Steve produces a vile of coke and taps out a 
           line to rival the one from earlier.
                                 STEVE
                        Way ahead of you.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           -- The line of coke. Steve’s nose. A dollar bill. 
           SSSSSNNNNNNNOOOOOORRRRRRRRRTTTTT.

           -- A cap spins off a bottle of whiskey. The whiskey is poured 
           into a huge pint glass. Like, really huge. Steve’s hand 
           swipes it off the desk.

           -- Steve SPINS AROUND in his spinning office chair.

           END SERIES OF SHOTS

           INT. KING HOME / STEVE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Steve flips through a fantasy magazine.

                                 STEVE
                        I’ve got it! “The Raft!” With the 
                        kids on the raft! They die, one by 
                        one, then-

           ACROSS FROM STEVE sits a plump, Kathy Bates looking lady.  
           It’s ANNIE WILKES, from Misery, here in the flesh. Well, in 
           hallucination.

                                 ANNIE
                        Well gosh darn, Steve, are you 
                        losin’ your gourd? George Romero 
                        just phoned last week, he’s using 
                        that as a segment in Creepshow 2.

                                 STEVE
                        Right. Shit. Hold on, who are you?

                                 ANNIE
                        You know who I cockadoodie am.

                                 STEVE
                        The crazy broad who’s gonna cut off 
                        the writer fella’s foot?

                                 ANNIE
                        Or smash ‘em with a sledgehammer -- 
                        haven’t decided yet.

                                 STEVE
                        Pretty sure you’re gonna cut one 
                        off. But I haven’t even written you 
                        yet.
                                 ANNIE
                        No but I’m still in here.

           She taps her head. Steve picks up another story collection.

                                 STEVE
                        The Mist! That’s it!

                                 ANNIE
                        Doesn’t have an ending.

                                 STEVE
                        What if I just fuckin’ kill them 
                        all?

                                 ANNIE
                        Even the kid?

                                 STEVE
                        No, yeah, that won’t fucking work.

           Steve tosses back another gulp of his whisky pint glass. Then 
           grabs a record from his record collection and slides it into 
           his record player. The needle drops.

           INT. KING HOME / HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Tabby walks past the door to Steve’s office, Baby Owen 
           sleeping in her arms.

           AC/DC MUSIC BEGINS TO BLARE, SHAKING THE OFFICE DOOR.

           Baby Owen wakes up and BEGINS TO CRY. Tabby glares at the 
           office door, then continues on, shushing Baby Owen.

           INT. KING HOME / STEVE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Cigarette in one hand, Steve flips through another magazine. 
           Suddenly, HE JUMPS TO HIS FEET.

                                 STEVE
                        GOT IT, FUCK YES, AYUH, YES SIR!

           He tosses the magazine onto the desk.

           INSERT -- The magazine is open to the first page of a story 
           titled “TRUCKS.”

           PAN UP FROM THE COVER TO REVEAL--
           INT. KING HOME / LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Tabby looks down at the cover of the magazine.

                                 TABBY
                        Trucks?

                                 STEVE
                        TRUCKS! This is my movie! It’s 
                        about trucks that come to life and 
                        try to kill people!

                                 TABBY
                        Okay, I think I remember this 
                        story. Why do they come to life?

                                 STEVE
                        Because of, I don’t know, shit, 
                        what if there’s like an asteroid 
                        that passes over Earth.

                                 TABBY
                        Why would that make them come to--

                                 STEVE
                        Alien technology, I think, although 
                        I’m not really sure yet. All I know 
                        is that I’m kind of wedded to this 
                        asteroid idea.

                                 TABBY
                        And how’s the script coming along?

                                 STEVE
                        Right! The script!

           Steve turns and runs out of the room.

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           INT. KING HOME / STEVE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Steve POUNDS AWAY at his typewriter like a mad motherfucker. 
           DING! He pulls a page free and slams it onto the desk. DING! 
           He pulls another page free and slams it onto a small pile of 
           pages. DING! Another page. Onto the pile.

           LATER

           FLAME licks out of a lighter. Steve lights a joint, slumps 
           against the wall of his office and INHALES until the whole 
           joint crumbles to ash. 
           HE WAITS -- then exhales an insane, inhuman stream of 
           continuous weed smoke.

           SECONDS LATER

           Steve, as high as any person has ever been, lies slumped on 
           the carpet of his office. 

           He looks up. The typewriter sits on the edge of the desk 
           above him. Steve crawls across the carpet, reaches up, hooks 
           two fingers onto the frame of the typewriter, and PULLS.

           The typewriter topples off the desk, spins end over end and 
           SLAMS into the ground, right side up, inches from Steve’s 
           head. A little further over, it would have smashed his brain 
           into the carpet.

           The “m” key pops off the typewriter. Unfazed, Steve picks up 
           the key, looks at it, and tosses it away (That’s a reference 
           to something. If you don’t know to what, you’re not cool 
           enough to know).

           Steve reaches out with one hand and begins to FINGER PECK on 
           the typewriter.

                                 STEVE
                        And then... the one mother fucker 
                        says... to the other mother 
                        fucker... Dixie Boy... Trapped at a 
                        gas station... Mighty Ducks... 
                        Something asshole...

           HOURS LATER 

           Steve is asleep on the floor in the exact same position we 
           last saw him.

           HE JOLTS AWAKE, looks around wildly-- then goes back to his 
           desk.

           Steve shotguns a beer, types like a madman, pops a few Xanax 
           tablets, continues to type like a madman.

           The stack of pages grows larger.

           IN THE BACKGROUND -- Bowling For Soup’s ‘1985’ plays 
           loudly.Steve SINGS ALONG to the song.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                    (singing)
                        Her two kids in high school--
                        They tell her that she’s uncool--
                        ‘Cause she’s still preoccupied--
                        With 19, 19, 1985!
                                 JACK TORRANCE (O.S.)
                        How the fuck are you singing along 
                        to this song? 

           Steve looks up. Jack Torrance sits across from him.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        This song isn’t gonna be written 
                        for another 20 years.

                                 STEVE
                        Who are you to talk, you’re not 
                        real either.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Harsh but fair, amigo. Here, have 
                        another beer.

           He hands Steve another beer. Steve SHOTGUNS it, then 
           continues to SING and TYPE MADLY.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Steve RUNS through the door of Dan’s office. Dan sits at his 
           desk. Across from Dan, SOME DUDE who’s probably a client.

                                 STEVE
                        DAN!

                                 DAN
                        Steve, I’m with a client.

                                 SOME DUDE
                        Fuck me, is that Stephen King? I 
                        can come back.

                                 DAN
                        No, it’s okay--

                                 STEVE
                        Sure, come back. Send a book, I’ll 
                        sign it. See ya later, buddy.

           The dude exits. Steve produces the script for Maximum 
           Overdrive and SLAMS IT ONTO DAN’S DESK.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        There it is!

                                 DAN
                        There... There what is?
                                 STEVE
                        The script! The script, for the 
                        movie I’m directing! I’m gonna call 
                        it Maximum Overdrive!

                                 DAN
                        This is it? It’s done?! I told you 
                        this was a possibility three days 
                        ago and you finished the script? 
                        How long even is this thing?

                                 STEVE
                        250 pages. But I’m making cuts.

                                 DAN
                        Steve...

                                 STEVE
                        What, what is it?

                                 DAN
                        I don’t know. How do you feel? Do 
                        you feel like you maybe need to 
                        step back and take a breath? Think 
                        about how you can really be your 
                        best self when making this film, 
                        instead of rushing head long into 
                        something you’re not prepared for?

                                 STEVE
                        Actually, there is something I’ve 
                        been thinking about.

                                 DAN
                        What is it? I’m sure it’s a problem 
                        we can work through. Challenges are 
                        how we--

                                 STEVE
                        AC/DC.

                                 DAN
                        What?

                                 STEVE
                        They’re my favorite band.

                                 DAN
                        ...Yeah, I know, I read your books.

                                 STEVE
                        I don’t want to do this movie 
                        unless they write an original 
                        soundtrack for it.
                                 DAN
                        Seriously?

                                 STEVE
                        Sure, yeah, why not?

                                 DAN
                        That might not be possible.

                                 STEVE
                        Get me in a room with Angus Young 
                        and let’s find out.

                                 DAN
                        That might not be as easy as-

                                 STEVE
                        I’m pretty sure he’ll take a 
                        meeting with me, I wrote Pet 
                        Sematary.

           Steve gets to his feet and walks to the door.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Get me a meeting with Angus Young. 
                        And get me back in a room with Dino 
                        de Laurentiis, I should probably 
                        confirm that this is really 
                        happening! Oh, and read the script, 
                        I think you’ll like it!

           Steve exits. Slams the door. 

           Dan picks up the script and begins to flip through it with 
           what can only be described as moderate disinterest.

           INT. KING HOME / LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Steve strolls through the living room, heading towards the 
           front door. Naomi looks up from the couch.

                                 NAOMI
                        Hey dad. Where are you off to?

                                 STEVE
                        I’m, uh, I know this is a little 
                        crazy but I’m about to go meet with 
                        AC/DC.

                                 NAOMI
                        They’re in Bangor?
                                 STEVE
                        They’re actually playing a show in 
                        Portland, I’m driving down there 
                        for the day.

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh. Does mom know?

                                 STEVE
                        No, good point, can you tell her?

                                 NAOMI
                        Um...

           Steve EXITS, slamming the door.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Sure, dad.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Stephen King sits across from AC/DC’s ANGUS YOUNG and BRIAN 
           JOHNSON in a diner booth.

                                 ANGUS
                        So you want us to-

                                 STEVE
                        Write an original soundtrack for 
                        the movie, back to front, yes.

                                 ANGUS
                        And the movie is about--

                                 STEVE
                        Right, trucks-- no, well, not just 
                        trucks but all machines, because a 
                        comet passes over Earth and causes 
                        all the machines to--

                                 BRIAN
                        Sure, come to life.

                                 STEVE
                        Exactly.

                                 ANGUS
                        Well shit, I guess I’m the fuck on 
                        board. I love your writing, and 
                        Brian is a huge fan of Carrie, so.

                                 BRIAN
                        That’s true.
                                 STEVE
                        Great.

                                 ANGUS
                        Great. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Great. Say, I think I’m gonna go to 
                        the bathroom and--

                                 STEVE
                        Wait, for what reason? To take a 
                        piss, or to “powder your nose?”

                                 BRIAN
                        If by powder my nose you mean snort 
                        a shitload of coke, then yeah, I’m 
                        gonna go snort a shitload of coke.

                                 STEVE
                        Great.

                                 BRIAN
                        Great.

                                 STEVE
                        I’ll come with you.

           INT. DINER / BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Steve snorts a line of coke off the counter.

           Brian snorts a line of coke off the counter.

                                 BRIAN
                        No, wait, stay still.

           Brian taps a bump onto King’s wrist, then snorts it off.

                                 STEVE
                        Alight, hold on, look up at the 
                        ceiling.

           Brian does. Steve does a bump of coke off his forehead.

                                 BRIAN
                        Okay, now get your dick out.

                                 STEVE
                        What?
           EXT. DINER / PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Steve exits the diner, waves goodbye to Angus and Brian, and 
           gets into his car.

           INT. STEVE’S SHITBOX CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Steve shuts the door and sits in the driver’s seat.

           A DROP OF BLOOD splashes down onto Steve’s leg. He looks in 
           the rearview mirror. A trickle of blood runs from his nose.

           Unconcerned, Steve opens his glove compartment. We see that 
           it’s full of Kleenex. This has happened before. Steve grabs 
           one and starts to staunch the nosebleed.

           EXT. DINER / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Steve’s car pulls out of the parking lot.

           INT. BAR / LATER

           Steve and DINO DO LAURENTIIS sit across from one another in 
           some bar.

           Dino speaks with what can only be described as A CRAZY HEAVY 
           ITALIAN ACCENT. He stirs a Bloody Mary as he talks.

                                 DINO
                        I will be honest. I am not one 
                        hundred percent sure you have... 
                        how do I say this? Script directing 
                        capabilities.

                                 STEVE
                        Dino, to be honest, neither am I. 
                        But I’ve been able to pick 
                        everything else up along the way, 
                        right?

                                 DINO
                        This is what I think as well. And 
                        to be honest, what does it matter? 
                        You make good movie, you make bad 
                        movie, this is not huge risk, I 
                        wish for you to make movie you want 
                        to make, and I think it will make 
                        money on your good name alone.

                                 STEVE
                        Even if it’s a heap of shit?
                                 DINO
                        Hey, we made money on Firestarter, 
                        didn’t we?

                                 STEVE
                        I guess we did.

                                 DINO
                        Good! Now we need to start thinking 
                        about a script.

           Steve pulls out a copy of the script and drops it onto the 
           table in front of Dino.

                                 STEVE
                        Here it is, hot off the presses.

                                 DINO
                        You work fast, my friend!

                                 STEVE
                        Shit yeah.

           Dino picks up the script and flips through it.

                                 DINO
                        Trucks? It’s trucks trying to kill 
                        people?

                                 STEVE
                        Well, all machines really, because 
                        a comet passes over the Earth--

                                 DINO
                        Great.

                                 STEVE
                        And the tail of the comet brings 
                        all the machines to life and makes 
                        them evil, so they try to kill a 
                        group of people who take shelter at 
                        a truck stop--

                                 DINO
                        Cool.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s based on a short story--

                                 DINO
                        I love it. Who you want to star?

                                 STEVE
                        I was thinking Redford....
           Dino CHOKES on his Bloody Mary. Some of it comes out his 
           nose.

                                 DINO
                        You were thinking Redford? You were 
                        thinking Robert Redford for our 
                        little movie where trucks kill 
                        people?

                                 STEVE
                        What, is that not a realistic plan?

                                 DINO
                        I can call him, but I suspect he 
                        will tell us to, eh, to fuck you, 
                        plus, this man, he will consume 
                        half our budget on day one.

                                 STEVE
                        Well shit, Dino. What are you 
                        thinking, then?

                                 DINO
                        I tell you. I have a strong working 
                        relationship with Emilio Estevez.

                                 STEVE
                        Emilio Estevez?

                                 DINO
                        The kid! The sexy kid! From 
                        Outsiders, from Repo Men. Martin 
                        Sheen’s son, so practically already 
                        in the King family. I tell you, the 
                        kid has chops. And besides, the 
                        ladies love him. We’ll make back 
                        our money just from the pussies 
                        that flood the theater.

                                 STEVE
                        Is that really true? He’ll draw a 
                        female crowd?

                                 DINO
                        With arms like that kid has, he’s 
                        probably fucking his way through 
                        half of Manhattan right now.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           Cliche establishing shots of Manhattan set to some song about 
           New York.
           INT. EMILIO ESTEVEZ’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Two people having sex on a couch -- a young EMILIO ESTEVEZ 
           (20s) and an equally young DEMI MOORE (20s). At this point in 
           Hollywood’s illustrious history, the two of them are dating. 

           WITH EVERY THRUST--

                                 EMILIO
                        Oh, Demi! Oh, Demi Moore! You’re so 
                        famous and we’re fucking! We’re 
                        both so fucking famous! If we taped 
                        this we could sell it for forty 
                        million dollars! Huhhh! HUUUHHH!

                                 DEMI
                        Shut up, Emilio.

           Emilio’s phone RINGS. A consummate professional, he stops mid-
           thrust and answers.

                                 EMILIO
                        Yeah. What? Wait, what the fuck is 
                        the movie about? No, wait, what is 
                        it really about?
                    (beat)
                        Are you serious? But it’s-- you 
                        said King’s involved? Wow, no shit? 
                        Directing? How much is the offer 
                        for? Yeah, yeah, thanks Bernie. 
                        Yeah, send over the script.

           Emilio hangs up and looks down at Demi.

                                 EMILIO (CONT’D)
                        They want me to read for the lead 
                        in a Stephen King movie. Do you 
                        think I should do it?

                                 DEMI
                        Can we talk about this later 
                        please?

                                 EMILIO
                        Yeah, right, sorry.

           They get back down to business.

           INT. KING HOME / KITCHEN - DAY

           The family, minus Steve, eats breakfast. Steve sticks his 
           head into the room.
                                 STEVE
                        Everyone be on your best behavior, 
                        I’m flying potential cast in to 
                        read for me today.

                                 TABBY
                        Is that... Is that the normal 
                        procedure, for something like this, 
                        honey?

                                 STEVE
                        When has normal ever helped 
                        anybody?

           INT. KING HOME / BATHROOM - DAY

           Steve looks into the mirror. THE MAN IN BLACK stands over his 
           shoulder. He nods at Steve -- a faint smile on his lips. 

           Steve looks down at his palm.

           SEVERAL MUSHROOMS, and not the kind you cook for dinner, sit 
           in his palm. Enough to fuck up more than a few people. Steve 
           thinks -- then pops them all into his mouth.

           INT. CASTING ROOM - HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES SHROOMS TO KICK IN 
           LATER

           We find ourselves in a room with garish bright red walls.

           The interior of this casting room should be as nightmare-ish 
           as the interior of the store from ‘Needful Things.’ This is, 
           after all, Steve’s shroom trip.

           Steve and Emilio sit across from one another on vintage bar 
           stools.

                                 EMILIO
                        Listen man, I just want to say, I’m 
                        a huge fan. This is a little 
                        embarrassing but Christine was 
                        actually one of the first books I 
                        ever really read, it’s--

                                 STEVE
                        Answer me one question.

                                 EMILIO
                        Um... Sure.

                                 STEVE
                        You’re not Robert Redford.
                                 EMILIO
                        That’s... accurate.

           Steve gets up and paces around the small red room.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, well, I wanted Redford to be 
                        in my movie.

                                 EMILIO
                        I’m sorry I’m not him?

                                 STEVE
                        Don’t beat yourself up too bad -- 
                        your dad was in one of my movies, 
                        did you know that?

                                 EMILIO
                        I did.

                                 STEVE
                        And you know Dino.

                                 EMILIO
                        Yeah, a little.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay, well, I don’t know, do you 
                        want to do it? You can act, right?

                                 EMILIO
                        Do you want me to read sides or 
                        something?

                                 STEVE
                        Huh?

                                 EMILIO
                        To make sure I’m... right for the 
                        part?

                                 STEVE
                        Oh. I don’t know, do you want to do 
                        improv or something?

                                 EMILIO
                        Sure?

           Steve raises his arms and runs across the room towards 
           Emilio.

                                 STEVE
                        WOOOOO WOOOO I’M A TRUCK I’M GONNA 
                        KILL YOU!
                                 EMILIO
                    (halfhearted)
                        Ahh!

                                 STEVE
                        Great. You’ll do. We shoot in North 
                        Carolina in the summer. That work 
                        for you?

                                 EMILIO
                        I’ll have to talk to my agents--

                                 STEVE
                        Cool, see you then. 

           Steve holds out his hand. Emilio shakes it.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna make history together.

           INT. CASTING ROOM - LATER

           Steve stares directly INTO CAMERA -- an image we should be 
           used to by now. Pupils still dilated. He’s still tripping.

           REVERSE -- To see the person Steve is staring at. The young, 
           kind-faced YEARDLEY SMITH. Pre-Simpsons.

                                 YEARDLEY
                        May I just say, Mr. King, I really 
                        love you. On one of my first dates 
                        ever we went to see Carrie, it’s 
                        just delightful.

                                 STEVE
                        Have you prepared your sides?

           Yeardley looks down at a piece of paper.

                                 YEARDLEY
                        There’s only one line on this piece 
                        of paper.

                                 STEVE
                        So read it. And by fuck, read it 
                        well.

           Yeardley CLEARS HER THROAT and looks down at the sheet.

                                 YEARDLEY
                    (flat)
                        Don’t make me a widow on my wedding 
                        day, Curtis.
                                 STEVE
                        Louder.

                                 YEARDLEY
                        Don’t make me a widow on my wedding 
                        day, Curtis!

                                 STEVE
                        WITH PASSION!

                                 YEARDLEY
                        DON’T MAKE ME A WIDOW ON MY WEDDING 
                        DAY, CURTIS!

                                 STEVE
                        You’re hired.

           EXT. KING HOME / DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Standing next to her car in the King driveway is LAURA 
           HARRINGTON (28) -- movie star cute, big 1980s hair, emanates 
           confidence, intelligence and sexiness. Laura talks into a 
           GIANT, BOXY 1980s CELL PHONE.

                                 LAURA
                    (into phone)
                        Yes, Mark, I’m here. But I’m not 
                        happy about it. You know I finally 
                        got a change to read the script on 
                        the flight over? Jesus--
                    (listens)
                        I know! I know it’s King! But I’ve 
                        said it a million times, I wanna be 
                        a fucking movie star, not a drive-
                        in queen! I want fame, damn it! 
                        Starring roles, tabloid scandals, 
                        all of it! What good is it gonna do 
                        me to be in a shitty car movie--

           She glances up casually-- and see EMILIO walking towards his 
           car.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                    (whispers into phone)
                        Holy shit, is Emilio Estevez 
                        auditioning for this movie?
                    (listens)
                        He’s practically a lock?! Well 
                        hell, let me paint you a picture-- 
                        photos of me and him, kissing on 
                        set. You think that scandal would 
                        finally get my name out there? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        I mean shit-- what if I could break 
                        them up and steal him from Demi 
                        fuckin’ Moore? 

           ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY -- Emilio reaches his car.

                                 LAURA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Emilio? Emilio Estevez?

           Emilio glances up to see Laura walking towards him. She 
           shines a great big pearly white smile his way.

                                 EMILIO
                        The one and only.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi. I’m Laura.

                                 EMILIO
                        Pleasure to meet you.

                                 LAURA
                        Man, I’ve-- not to freak out here, 
                        but I’m a huge fan, dude, The 
                        Outsiders-- wait, are you-- are you 
                        gonna be in this movie?

                                 EMILIO
                        Startin’ to sound that way. You?

                                 LAURA
                        Guess I’m about to find out.

                                 EMILIO
                        Best of luck then, Laura. Hope to 
                        see you on set.

           He flashes a smile. She BLUSHES-- whether it’s real or an 
           act, it’s a bit hard to tell. Emilio gets in his car. Drives 
           off. She watches him go. 

                                 LAURA
                        Oh. You’re gonna see me on set.

           INT. CASTING ROOM - LATER

           Pupils still dilated as fuck, Steve stares at the door of the 
           casting room.

           The door opens. LAURA comes sauntering in. Possessed with 
           sultry determination, Laura walks across the room and sits in 
           the chair. She looks at Steve for a full three seductive 
           seconds before talking.
                                 LAURA
                        I’m a fan of your work. Cujo, and 
                        all that. Spooky shit.

                                 STEVE
                        Thank you. You’re here to read for--

                                 LAURA
                        Brett. Weird name for a character. 
                        A boy’s name.

                                 STEVE
                        My apologies.

           Laura scans her sheet of sides.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re having me read from the sex 
                        scene. Of course.

                                 STEVE
                        Sorry about that. Make the most of 
                        it?

                                 LAURA
                        Why of course.

           Laura looks down. When she looks back up she’s donned a 
           sulty, sexy guise. She stands. Unbuttons her shirt a few 
           buttons. And saunters up to Steve. Her cleavage and general 
           aura all up in his grill.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        You're looking quite a bit cuter, I 
                        must admit. I’ll tell you one 
                        thing, hero.

                                 STEVE
                    (reading dialogue)
                        What’s that?

                                 LAURA
                        You make love like Dangerous Dan 
                        McGrew.

                    (reading action)
                        She throws herself into his arms 
                        and hugs him hard. Kisses him. And 
                        he picks her up and carries her 
                        back to the cot for Round Two.

           They lower their sides. Laura fixes him with a sultry gaze.
                                 LAURA
                        What’d you think?

                                 STEVE
                        You’re hired.

                                 LAURA
                        Great. See you in North Carolina.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura exits the casting room and rebuttons her shirt, the 
           sultry guise she was putting on IMMEDIATELY dropping away. 
           She walks off down the hall.

           INT. KING HOME / JOE’S ROOM - DAY

           Joe sits hunched over the desk in his room, scribbling 
           something onto a sheet of paper. Tabby knocks on the door.

                                 TABBY
                        Sweetie, come out to the driveway, 
                        we’re gonna say goodbye to your 
                        father.

                                 JOE
                        Coming!

           Joe continues scribbling as Tabby leaves.

           EXT. KING HOME / DRIVEWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Steve loads a suitcase into the trunk of his car and slams 
           the trunk. He turns towards Tabby and Naomi.

                                 TABBY
                        We’re gonna miss you around the 
                        house.

                                 STEVE
                        You’re gonna come visit the set at 
                        some point, right?

                                 TABBY
                        Sure, once the kids are out of 
                        school in a couple weeks I’ll load 
                        them onto an airplane, we’ll come 
                        see what you’re working on. What is 
                        it, thirty days of filming?
                                 STEVE
                        Thirty-one, I think.

                                 TABBY
                        And you’re gonna... You know... 
                        Take it easy?

           Steve brushes past this comment.

                                 STEVE
                        I’ll be fine, Tabby. Like always.

           Joe runs out of the house and jogs up to them, small stack of 
           paper in his hand.

                                 JOE
                        Hey dad!

                                 STEVE
                        What is it, buddy?

                                 JOE
                        I, uh... I wrote something. I was 
                        wondering if you’d take a look at 
                        it.

           Steve takes the pages and looks at them.

           INSERT: The first page. “Black Cloud, by Joe Hill.”

                                 STEVE
                        What, like a story?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, something like that.

                                 STEVE
                        You sure I’m not too uncool to read 
                        it?

                                 JOE
                        I mean, you’re pretty uncool, 
                        but... I’d appreciate it.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, sure, buddy. I’m gonna be 
                        pretty busy over the next few 
                        months but I’ll try to take a look.

           Steve crams the story into his pocket. Joe looks uncertain.

                                 NAOMI
                        So, dad? You excited? Your first 
                        movie?
                                 STEVE
                        You know? I really am. I just... I 
                        really think I can do it.

                                 TABBY
                        Do what?

                                 STEVE
                        Make the greatest movie of all 
                        time.

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           EXT. AIRPORT / NORTH CAROLINA - DAY

           Emilio Estevez gets off an airplane, cool guy sunglasses on 
           his face.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Steve cruises across the country in his charmingly shitty 
           car, cool guy sunglasses on his face.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Laura Harrington cruises down a dirt road on a motorcycle, 
           cool guy sunglasses on her face. She passes a sign that says 
           “WELCOME TO NORTH CAROLINA.”

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. DIXIE BOY - DAY

           WIDE ON a full scale set recreation of a truck stop. A sign 
           displays the name “DIXIE BOY TRUCK STOP.”

           Gas pumps, convenience store, none of it yet finished so 
           workers are scurrying back and forth.

           In the parking lot sits a massive toy truck with a giant 
           recreation of the Green Goblin’s face mounted to its front. 
           On the side, the words “Happy Toyz.”

           STEVE AND DINO stand side by side, admiring the facade.

                                 DINO
                        Steve. This my masterpiece. What 
                        you think?
                                 STEVE
                        It looks straight out of a 
                        unicorn’s pussy snortin’ dream.

                                 DINO
                        What does this mean?

                                 STEVE
                        It looks incredible. The truck, 
                        especially. Remind me, Deenies, why 
                        are you in town?

                                 DINO
                        Another production of mine is 
                        shooting here, this is why we shoot 
                        you movie in North Carolina, I tell 
                        you this two hundred times.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh yeah, right. What’s the other 
                        movie?

                                 DINO
                        It is called Blue Velvet.

                                 STEVE
                        Interesting title. Not to my taste 
                        but it’s undeniably evocative.

                                 DINO
                        I am inclined to agree. But, that 
                        Kyle McLaughlin. Biggest dick I 
                        have ever seen on a man.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, he shows his dick in the movie?

                                 DINO
                        No, why?

           Steve looks quizzically at Dino.

           INT. DIXIE BOY / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Steve, Dino and ALL THE CAST MEMBERS OF MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE 
           take their seats in a circle of folding chairs set up in the 
           main room of the full-scale Dixie Boy Truck Stop set.

           Laura and Emilio sit next to one another.

                                 EMILIO
                        Hey! Laura, right? Great to see you 
                        again!
                                 LAURA
                    (flirty)
                        You too.

           Steve looks around the room, locking eyes with Emilio, 
           Yeardley, Laura, all the others.

                                 STEVE
                        Can I just say, so fucking glad to 
                        have all of you here. The purpose 
                        of this table read--

                                 DINO
                        Like all table reads, the purpose 
                        is to get the script on its feet, 
                        give notes on performances...

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah yeah yeah, but in this case... 
                        I wrote the script very fast. I 
                        just want to make sure everything 
                        makes logical sense. So if anything 
                        stands out as illogical, feel free 
                        to speak up. Alright. I’ll be 
                        reading action. Fade in...

           INT. DIXIE BOY / MAIN ROOM - LATER

           Many pages have been turned. Emilio and an older actor, PAT 
           HINGLE (60s), are the stars of the scene being read.

                                 PAT
                        You’re messin’ where you hadn't 
                        ought to be messin' again, boy. I 
                        guess sometimes even college boys 
                        don't learn their lessons until 
                        they've had their chops busted a 
                        few times, do they? 

                                 EMILIO
                        Do you know whats going on outside, 
                        you happy asshole? You blind?

                                 STEVE
                        Great! I think that scene holds up, 
                        right?

                                 EMILIO
                        Well sure, I’m just wondering what 
                        exactly it means to call someone a 
                        happy asshole--
                                 STEVE
                    (cutting him off)
                        It’s perfect! Moving on.

                        I just don’t know exactly what a 
                        ‘road twitch’ is, but--

                                 STEVE
                        Figure it out from context, Laura, 
                        it’s a common expression in Maine.

           SERIES OF SHOTS of actors reading lines:

                        aliens looking for a new place to 
                        live... say you're looking for a 
                        new planet like you or me might 
                        look for a new house. Only it's 
                        like a big old house no one ever 
                        took care of. So they send in their 
                        interstellar housecleaners... send 
                        in their broom... and sweep it

           Steve turns the last page of his script.

                                 STEVE
                        The end. Great! That’s a wrap. Is 
                        there anything logically that 
                        doesn’t make sense?

                                 DINO
                        I believe some of the lines--

                                 STEVE
                        No, the lines are great. We’re 
                        talking logic. Logic. Anyone?

           Yeardley raises a nervous hand. Steve nods at her.

                                 YEARDLEY
                        In the script, all cars come to 
                        life, right? But why don’t the cars 
                        we’re driving come to life? Like, 
                        we’re in a car, driving away from 
                        evil cars... Is our car not evil? 
                        Why wouldn’t our car crash itself 
                        into another car to blow us up?

                                 STEVE
                        Hmm. Interesting. A legitimate 
                        point, Yeardley. Thank you. I’ll 
                        fix it before the day.

                        Committing to memory... Committing 
                        to memory... Got it!

           Steve stands and turns to leave.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Anyone else have logic issues?

           Four separate hands go up. Steve’s back is already to the 
           table. He doesn’t see them.
                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Cool. We’re gonna make ART, people.

           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL ROOM - 4 AM

           It’s 4 AM. Steve lies awake in bed. Staring straight at the 
           ceiling.

           He reaches over, grabs his phone, and dials.

           Ring. Ring. Ringadingdingding.

                                 TABBY - PHONE
                    (groggy)
                        Hello.

                                 STEVE
                        Tabby. Tabitha.

                                 TABBY - PHONE
                        Steve... What time is it?

                                 STEVE
                        Tabby. It’s the first day. It’s the 
                        first day of shooting.

                                 TABBY - PHONE
                        Well tomorrow is. It’s not day yet.

                                 STEVE
                        Tabby.

                                 TABBY - PHONE
                        You’re nervous?

                                 STEVE
                        No. Never.
                    (beat)
                        A little.

                                 TABBY - PHONE
                    (falling asleep)
                        Just... remember... you’re gonna... 
                        do... great...

           Tabby falls asleep on the other end. 

           Uncertain, Steve sets down the phone, then looks up to see--

           ANNIE WILKES, appeared from nowhere, standing at the foot of 
           the bed. She holds a sledgehammer in her hand. Steve JUMPS.
                                 ANNIE WILKES
                        Sure, that wife of yours says 
                        you’re gonna do great, but what the 
                        cockadoodie heck does that dirty 
                        bird know? I’m your number one fan, 
                        Stevie, and I’m worried you just 
                        won’t have the energy.

                                 THE MAN IN BLACK (O.S.)
                        She’s not wrong.

           Steve JUMPS again, looks over to see--

           THE MAN IN BLACK, leaning coolly against the wall.

                                 ANNIE WILKES
                        Who the heck are you?

                                 THE MAN IN BLACK
                        I go by many names. Randall Flagg, 
                        Walter o’Dim--

                                 STEVE
                        The Man in Black.

                                 THE MAN IN BLACK
                        I may not be of this world, but I 
                        have seen and seen again the 
                        consequences of failure. Remember 
                        where you came from. Remember how 
                        easily you could return there.

           He points across the room. Steve looks over to see--

           A GRIMY TRAILER impossibly nestled against one wall of the 
           hotel room.

           The color drains out of Steve’s face as he looks at it.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m never going back there.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (O.S.)
                        You sure about that?

           Steve jolts. JACK TORRANCE stands next to the bed.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        Because he’s not wrong. You had 
                        better do whatever you can to 
                        ensure you’re at your peak 
                        performing capacity -- hadn’t you?

           Steve thinks about this. Then--
           TITLE OVER BLACK -- DAY 1

           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL / BATHROOM - 5 AM

           Coke. All the coke. All the coke goes into Steve’s nose.

           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL - 6 AM

           Steve jogs back in forth, chugging a beer.

           EXT. BANK - 7 AM

           A full production day -- on a fairly low budget movie. But, 
           you know, we’ve still got crew guys and cameramen and boom 
           mics and all that good stuff. Everyone setting up.

           Eyes dilated, Steve strolls to the middle of the set dressed 
           in A LUDICROUS WHITE SUIT. A can of beer clutched in his 
           hand.

                                 STEVE
                        Hello! Hello crew! Attention!

           People stop what they’re doing, look up reverently. We hear 
           MURMURS OF--

                                 VARIOUS CREW MEMBERS
                        Look! / It’s really him. / That’s 
                        Stephen fucking King.

                                 STEVE
                        I just want to say that I think 
                        we’re gonna make something really 
                        special here. And what better way 
                        to start than with the most special 
                        of all -- my cameo. Let’s all do 
                        our best work today! And... break!

           The crew goes back to work.

                                 ARMANDO (O.S.)
                        Inspiring speech.

           Steve turns to see ARMANDO NANNUZZI (61), an intimidating, 
           gaunt, deadly serious Italian man with a THICK ACCENT.

                                 ARMANDO (CONT’D)
                        Not every day do I see a director 
                        extol his own brilliance to crew, 
                        then say “break.” Armando Nannuzzi. 
                        Director of Photography.
                                 STEVE
                        Steve King, put her there, friend.

           Steve holds out his hand to shake. Armando just stares at it 
           and does a little half smile to himself.

                                 ARMANDO
                        You know we’ve met before?

                                 STEVE
                        We have?

                                 ARMANDO
                        Yes, on Silver Bullet. I was DP on 
                        that picture, too. We interact many 
                        times. But this, you forget.

                                 STEVE
                        Well, friend, I apologize, it’s 
                        been a hectic couple of years, but 
                        I’ve got a good feeling you and I 
                        are gonna get along real well now.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Yes. Maybe we will.

           Armando surveys the set.

                                 ARMANDO (CONT’D)
                        Steve, may I ask, what happens in 
                        this scene?

                                 STEVE
                        Today? Big scene. First scene of 
                        the movie. The Earth has just 
                        passed into the tail of the comet--

                                 ARMANDO
                        No, specifically, what happens in 
                        this scene.

                                 STEVE
                        I walk up to an ATM machine. And it 
                        calls me an asshole.

           Armando stares at Steve for a long moment.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Art is a difficult thing to create. 
                        Sometimes the creation of smut is 
                        an art in itself.
                    (beat)
                        You might want to get your costume 
                        on.
           Armando walks off. Steve looks after him quizzically. Then 
           puts on a bowler hat, and dorky glasses with clip on sunglass 
           lenses that flip up.

           Steve walks over to the ATM. THE PROP MASTER tinkers with the 
           display screen.

                                 STEVE
                        Show me what we’re working with.

           Prop Master hits a couple buttons. The display comes on.

           INSERT: The screen reads “YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.”

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Great. Next one?

           Prop Master hits another button.

           INSERT: The screen reads “ASSHOLE ASSHOLE ASSHOLE ASSHOLE...” 
           and on and on and on.

           Dino approaches.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        We ready to go?

                                 DINO
                        Ready.

                                 STEVE
                        Great! Thanks again for being here 
                        for the first day.

                                 DINO
                        I’ll show up for you when I can, my 
                        friend.

           Steve looks around and rubs his hands together.

                                 STEVE
                        Let’s get this in one take.

           EXT. BANK - MINUTES LATER

           ARMANDO stands next to a cameraman who shoots a wide shot.

           FROM ARMANDO’S POV -- We see Steve walk across the parking 
           lot and stand in front of the ATM (a recreation of the 
           opening scene from Maximum Overdrive).

                                 STEVE
                        Honey!
           Steve flips up the sunglass lenses on his glasses and looks 
           to an EXTRA standing over his shoulder.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Come over here, sugar buns! I think 
                        this machine just called me an 
                        asshole.

           Steve walks away from the ATM.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Cut!

           Steve jogs over to Armando, removing his hat and sunglasses.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, need some quick movie tips, 
                        who’s the person I ask whether we 
                        got everything or not?

                                 ARMANDO
                        Excuse me?

                                 STEVE
                        Like, all the shots, how do I know 
                        if we got all the shots.

                                 ARMANDO
                        You should know, you’re the 
                        director. You check as you move, 
                        you keep track of everything, are 
                        the eye lines matching, are the 
                        actors acting, have you captured 
                        the art, the beauty, the heart of 
                        the--

                                 STEVE
                        Well I think we got it, we shot the 
                        thing and the other thing and the 
                        cameras were...

                                 ARMANDO
                        Rolling?

                                 STEVE
                        Moving, yeah.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Yeah, sounds like you got it.

                                 STEVE
                        Great. Pack it up everyone. Great 
                        first morning.
           Steve walks away from Armando. A BEER CAN falls out of 
           Steve’s pocket and clatters onto the ground. Armando looks at 
           it with visible distaste. He looks to CAMERAMAN #1.

                                 ARMANDO
                        A man who lives his life this way 
                        has only misery in his future.

           Cameraman #1 looks to Armando.

                                 CAMERAMAN #1
                        What?

           EXT. LUXURY’S LAP MOTEL - NIGHT

           A flickering sign reads “Luxury’s Lap Motel -- The Lap of 
           Luxury.”

           EXT. LUXURY’S LAP MOTEL / EMILIO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Emilio walks to a motel room door and KNOCKS.

           After a few seconds -- the door opens, revealing Laura. She 
           wears a tank top, no bra and chews gum. She smiles, leans 
           against the door frame.

                                 LAURA
                        What’s up, Mighty Ducks? Wondering 
                        when you were gonna swing by.

                                 EMILIO
                        That movie’s actually not gonna 
                        come out for like another six 
                        years.

                                 LAURA
                        So I can see the future. Suck my 
                        dick.

                                 EMILIO
                        I’ll pass, thanks.

                                 LAURA
                        Suit yourself. Come on in.

           INT. LUXURY’S LAP MOTEL / LAURA’S ROOM

           Laura reclines on her bed. Emilio stands at the foot.

                                 LAURA
                        So what’s on your mind?
                                 EMILIO
                        I don’t know. Do you think... Do 
                        you think this was a mistake? I 
                        mean. It’s Stephen King. Stephen 
                        King. Nobody loves the man more 
                        than me. But does Stephen King seem 
                        a little bit--

                                 LAURA
                        Coked out of his fucking mind? I 
                        don’t know. Maybe? But who cares? 

                                 EMILIO
                        Who cares? If Steve doesn’t slow 
                        down, he’s gonna have an aneurism 
                        and die in the middle of our 
                        shooting schedule!

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah, well. If anything, it’s 
                        worked to my advantage so far.

                                 EMILIO
                        What do you mean? Did you... You 
                        didn’t fuck him, did you?

                                 LAURA
                        What? No. He’s a married man. I mean 
                        I might have... flirted a little.

                                 EMILIO
                        Well that’s gross.

                                 LAURA
                        Why? It’s a studio movie, it’s 
                        Stephen King, we’re young and hot, 
                        and you know what happens to young 
                        hot people in Hollywood. They 
                        become not young. And not hot. So 
                        excuse me if I use what’s at my 
                        disposal to keep riding this wave. 
                        You know what I mean?

           Laura plays with the string of her tank top.

                                 EMILIO
                        It sounds like you mean you think 
                        I’m hot.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh, come on. Fuckin’ Repo Man? 
                        Don’t act like you don’t know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAURA (CONT'D)
                        I mean we’re gonna be neighbors for 
                        the next month, so... you think you 
                        might wanna... have some fun?

           She extends her foot out and rests it on his thigh. He looks 
           down. Waits probably a beat too long before backing away.

                                 EMILIO
                        I... No, I’m dating Demi Moore.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh, come on, I’m cuter than she is, 
                        aren’t I?

                                 EMILIO
                        That’s-- irrelevant. No.

                                 LAURA
                        I mean we could make a pretty 
                        powerful couple. Stars of the 
                        movie, falling in love? It’d be a 
                        cool story, right?

                                 EMILIO
                        I-- I should really get going. 
                        Goodnight, Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        You sure? Because there’s a little 
                        mini-bar over there, you sure you 
                        don’t wanna, I don’t know, pour 
                        champagne on my boobs or something?

           Emilio exits, shutting the door behind him. Laura watches as 
           he walks past the window, heading back towards his room.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Damn it.

           TITLE OVER BLACK -- DAY 2

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - MORNING

           EXTREMELY CLOSE on two hyper-dilated pupils. PULL BACK to 
           reveal--

           Steve WHISTLES as he walks across a baseball field. 

           Bright and early. TWENTY KIDS in baseball uniforms. And the 
           actor playing their COACH. Off to the side of the baseball 
           field, a utilities shack with a vending machine.
           Steve, Coach and STUNT COORDINATOR gather in front of the 
           vending machine.

                                 STEVE
                    (to Coach)
                        You understand what’s gonna happen 
                        in this scene, right?

                                 COACH
                        Yeah, a can flies out this machine 
                        and hits me in the dick, right?

                                 STEVE
                        Right. And it’s a big ha ha, all 
                        the kids think it’s real funny. 
                        Until another can hits you in the 
                        forehead and then BAM you die, the 
                        kids freak out. 

                                 COACH
                        That’s all great -- listen, is this 
                        gonna hurt my dick? When the can 
                        flies out, is it gonna hurt my 
                        dick?

           Stunt Coordinator holds up a cardboard can.

                                 STUNT COORDINATOR
                        Shouldn’t. See. It’s thin 
                        cardboard. But considering the 
                        velocity it might still be wise to 
                        wear a protective--

                                 STEVE
                        Ah, I’m sure he’ll be fine, look at 
                        him, big strong man, let’s get this 
                        thing on its feet.

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - MINUTES LATER

           Coach stands tentatively in front of the vending machine.

                                 STEVE
                        And... ACTION!

           OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE, Stunt Coordinator activates a 
           pressurized pump. A cardboard can SHOOTS out of the vending 
           machine and slams into Coach’s cock area. Coach doubles over.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        CUT!
                                 COACH
                        That hurt, man! That still fucking 
                        hurt my dick!

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATER

           Steve and CREW MEMBERS stand over a dummy body modeled after 
           an eight-year-old boy.

                                 STEVE
                        This thing is chalk full of corn 
                        syrup, right? Like, full to the 
                        brim?

           Prop Master nods.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Great. Let’s do this.

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - MINUTES LATER

           Everyone in their places.

                                 STEVE
                        ACTION!

           An industrial street cleaner ROARS TO LIFE and rolls towards 
           the dummy of the boy.

           The street cleaner graphically crushes the dummy boy’s body. 
           Red corn syrup SPRAYS VIOLENTLY from the dummy.

           Steve and the crew ROAR WITH LAUGHTER. Armando watches 
           proceedings with typical distaste.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           The crew sets up on a closed-off stretch of highway. Off to 
           one side, Steve chats with Armando, planning out shots. As 
           they talk, A CAR sits still on the empty stretch of road.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Yeardley Smith and JOHN SHORT, the actor playing her husband, 
           sit in the car, waiting for filming to begin.
                                 YEARDLEY
                        I don’t get it. During the table 
                        read, he said he would fix the 
                        issue of the cars we’re driving not 
                        coming to life. But far as I can 
                        tell, he didn’t! There’s no reason 
                        this car we’re in doesn’t crash 
                        itself into a wall to kill us.

                                 JOHN
                        I think he’s got other things on 
                        his mind.

                                 YEARDLEY
                        Like what?

                                 JOHN
                        Coke? Listen, Yeardley. We’re at 
                        the start of long exciting careers, 
                        let’s just enjoy it.

                                 YEARDLEY
                        Fair enough. There is one thing I’m 
                        pretty excited about. In a few 
                        weeks I’m starting voice work on 
                        these cartoon shorts called “The 
                        Simpsons.”

                                 JOHN
                        What’s that about?

                                 YEARDLEY
                        A family of yellow people having 
                        adventures.

                                 JOHN
                        Really? Well hell, my motto is, 
                        take the work you can get-- you 
                        never know what’s gonna take off.

                                 YEARDLEY
                        You know Laura actually has a fun 
                        line of dialogue in this movie -- 
                        “Eat my shorts.” I like the sound 
                        of that. Eat my shorts. Maybe I can 
                        take it, use it in something.

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Action!

           John starts the car. It rolls out of frame.
           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Steve dials a number and holds the phone to his ear. The 
           phone rings... rings... rings... Then--

                                 TABBY (MESSAGE)
                        You’ve reached the King residence, 
                        please leave a message--

           Steve hangs up.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (O.S.)
                        Why do you think she didn’t answer?

           Steve looks up to see Jack standing at the foot of the bed.

                                 STEVE
                        Probably just busy.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Sure there’s not a chance she’s 
                        getting a little tired of you? 
                        Falling out of love? Because it 
                        happens more than you’d think, I 
                        should know.

                                 STEVE
                        What-- What are you talking about?

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Oh, I’m sure it’s not worth 
                        worrying about. What say we take a 
                        ride and forget our troubles?

           Jack hands Steve a tab of acid. Steve puts it on his tongue.

           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Steve lies on his bed flipping through TV channels.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, shit. Twilight Zone.

           INSERT: The TV screen. Rod Serling addresses the camera.

                                 ROD SERLING
                        You are entering... The Twilight 
                        Zone. You, Stephen King, are 
                        entering The Twilight Zone. Check 
                        this shit out.

           The TV cuts to static -- then reappears on an image of JACK 
           TORRANCE.
                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Steve! Hey, Steve! I’m in your TV!

                                 STEVE
                        The fuck are you doing in there?

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        That’s a good question. Matter of 
                        fact, it is a little lonely in 
                        here. I’m coming back out.

           Jack grips the sides of the TV and begins to CLIMB THROUGH 
           into the real world.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        Check it out, I’m climbing out of 
                        your TV, Steve, just like that girl 
                        in The Ring!

                                 STEVE
                        What in God’s name is The Ring?

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Don’t know, doesn’t exist yet. 
                        Point is, here’s Johnny.

                                 STEVE
                        I didn’t write that line, that line 
                        was in the shitty movie! If you’re 
                        gonna quote Kubrick to me you can 
                        go back in that fucking TV!

           Jack emerges fully into the room and walks up to Steve’s bed.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Alright, alright, I’ll lay off. 
                        Point is-- how’s your trip?

                                 STEVE
                        Not great, I’m still seeing you.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Say, that’s true, maybe you should 
                        take it up a level.

           Jack produces a bottle of Jack Daniels.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, this is kind of funny. I’m 
                        Jack Torrance and this is Jack 
                        Daniels. Drink us both in, you son 
                        of a bitch.

           Steve takes the bottle, then looks around the room.
                                 STEVE
                        This is a fantasy. So is this... 
                        fantasy booze?

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Tell you what, Steve, why don’t you 
                        drink it and find out.

           Steve unscrews the cap and begins to drink.

           SERIES OF NIGHTMARISH IMAGES -- As the acid kicks in, as the 
           effects intermingle with the scotch.

           This is the very definition of a bad trip.

           -- The room shifts and tilts around Steve. ANNIE WILKES and 
           THE MAN IN BLACK dance in front of the melting wallpaper.

           -- The trailer that Steve used to call home is back against 
           the far wall of the room, a hellish glow around it.

           -- STEVE’S P.O.V. -- JACK TORRANCE leers into Steve’s face, 
           his creepy grin twisted out of proportion.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        ...dead like dear old mom and no 
                        one to love you, why do you think 
                        your old man left, why...

           -- Blood pours from Steve’s nose. He clutches his hands to 
           his face trying to hold it in. Is any of this real?

                                        CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Sun shines in through the window. Steve is sprawled on his 
           bed, fully clothed and fully unconscious. His bedside phone 
           RINGS INCESSANTLY. Finally, Steve’s eyes peek open. He emits 
           a LONG GROAN.

           Uh-oh. Hangover city.

           Steve reaches over and smacks the phone. It falls off its 
           cradle. He feebly drags it towards his face.

                                 STEVE
                        Heellllooooo?

                                 DINO - PHONE
                        Steve! Where in God’s name are you?
                                 STEVE
                        Hell’s asshole.

                                 DINO - PHONE
                        I didn’t catch that, but if the 
                        answer was anything besides “on 
                        set, filming the fucking ice cream 
                        truck scene, and I’ve been there 
                        for an hour but you just didn’t see 
                        me because you’re an idiot, Dino, 
                        you’re an idiot,” then so help me-- 

           Steve’s eyes shoot wide open.

                                 STEVE
                        Fuck!
                    (into phone)
                        Coming!

           Steve hangs up and shoots upright in bed. Annie stands at the 
           foot of the bed.

                                 ANNIE WILKES
                        Now look at that, you’ve gone and 
                        disappointed him, him and everyone 
                        else. How could you let something 
                        like that happen. How--

           MOMENTS LATER -- Steve rails a line of coke off the bedside 
           table.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATE MORNING

           The whole crew has assembled on a closed-off stretch of 
           highway that stretches in front of the Dixie Boy.

           An ice cream truck is parked on the highway. The back of the 
           truck is open. A length of telephone poll has been shunted 
           in, spanning from front to back.

           Steve stands with Dino, Armando, Stunt Coordinator and a 
           young STUNT DRIVER.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay, so, explain this to me. 

                                 STUNT COORDINATOR
                        The stunt is, the ice cream truck 
                        careens into frame, crashes, and 
                        flips end over end.

                                 STEVE
                        Won’t it just roll sideways?
                                 STUNT COORDINATOR
                        No, that’s why we have the phone 
                        poll, and the cannonless turnover 
                        system inside the truck, so the 
                        pneumatic lever will extend and the 
                        truck will go up--

                                 STUNT DRIVER
                        And crash down on its ass, front 
                        over end. All the while I’ll be 
                        inside in an enforced cage at a 
                        controlled skid.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Sliding past a carefully placed 
                        cameraman, far enough back to 
                        capture it safely and with thrill.

                                 STEVE
                        Right, right...

                                 DINO
                        Steve. It’s a complicated stunt, 
                        but it’s all set up. I know you’ve 
                        had a... rough morning. All you 
                        have to do is call action. You 
                        barely even have to direct.

           This hits Steve HARD and WRONG.

                                 STEVE
                        I barely even have to direct? I’m 
                        the fucking director-- shouldn’t I 
                        direct?

                                 ARMANDO
                        Stephen--

           Steve SHUSHES Armando.

                                 STEVE
                        Stunt driver guy.

                                 STUNT DRIVER
                        My name’s Dan.

                                 STEVE
                        How fast you driving?

                                 STUNT DRIVER
                        Around forty. It’ll look faster on--

                                 STEVE
                        Fuck that. Can you go fifty?
                                 ARMANDO
                        You do not know what you are doing, 
                        that sends everything out of the 
                        realm of controllability--

                                 STEVE
                    (to Stunt Driver)
                        Kid. Can you do it or not?

                                 STUNT DRIVER 
                    (grins)
                        For you? Shit yeah, Mr. King.

                                 STEVE
                        Great. Let’s go.

                                 ARMANDO
                        This is insane! And dangerous! And 
                        not just for him, either, what if 
                        he slides into a cameraman? I won’t 
                        stand by and let you put my crew at 
                        risk like this.

                                 STEVE
                        Well shit, somebody’s gotta shoot 
                        it.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Fine. Fine! If none of you see how 
                        crazy this man is, I will take the 
                        risk. I will run the camera.

                                 STEVE
                        Whatever you need to feel 
                        comfortable, buddy.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Armando, in position, personally mans the camera. 

           Steve and Dino stand back with the rest of the crew at a safe 
           distance.

           IN THE TRUCK, Stunt Driver grins and revs his gas.

                                 STEVE
                        ACTION!

           Stunt Driver SLAMS ON THE GAS. 

           The truck takes off.

           The odometer creeps up to 50.
           IN THE TRUCK -- The pneumatic tube system fires. A metal 
           lever shoots out, slamming the ground.

           The truck’s wheels leave the ground. IT FLIPS--

           SIDEWAYS, not end over end as it was supposed to. SPARKS FLY 
           as it slams down onto its side and skids sideways across the 
           ground--

           SCREECHING straight towards Armando. Armando’s eyes go wide. 
           He grabs his camera, LEAPS--

           And lands with a THUD on the ground as the ice cream truck 
           SCREECHES past him, tearing through the place where he stood 
           just moments before. 

           He would have been dead.

           The truck comes to a stop.

           A moment of stunned silence. Armando cowers on the ground, 
           his arms over his head. Slowly, he looks up. Realizes he’s 
           alive. Then--

                                 STUNT DRIVER
                        I think I’m okay! Did we get it?!

           The crew breaks their trance and RUNS towards the accident. 
           Crew members pull Stunt Driver from the car. He appears 
           uninjured.

           Armando gets to his feet -- physically unharmed but shaken. 

           The realization sinks in that nobody is harmed. Slowly, the 
           mood shifts back towards conviviality. Lots of nervous joking 
           and laughing. 

           But not from Armando.

                                 STEVE
                        Well, that clearly went a little 
                        off the rails, but I think it’ll be 
                        fine when all’s said and done, 
                        assuming the film survived.

                                 STUNT COORDINATOR
                        Man, exciting morning!

           More hand shaking and laughing from the crew. The mood 
           grating on Armando more and more until--

                                 ARMANDO
                    (loud as shit)
                        THAT’S ENOUGH!
           Everyone shuts up. Armando strides towards Steve.

                                 STEVE
                        Calm down there, partner.

                                 ARMANDO
                        You nearly killed me! YOU NEARLY! 
                        KILLED ME! AND YOUR STUNT DRIVER! 
                        And you would have killed my 
                        cameraman had I not had the 
                        foresight to replace him! Because 
                        you are drunk, and high!

                                 STEVE
                        You don’t know that! Maybe my 
                        pupils just dilate in the sunlight!

                                 ARMANDO
                        You are a foolish lug of a man!

           Armando turns to address the whole crew.

                                 ARMANDO (CONT’D)
                        How do none of you see what is 
                        happening?! We got lucky today! 
                        Tomorrow, maybe not! If we continue 
                        like this, somebody gets hurt!

           Stunt Driver approaches Steve and Armando.

                                 STUNT DRIVER
                        Honestly, Armando, I feel fine.

                                 STEVE
                        That’s the spirit! Come on, chill 
                        out, Armando, we’re all friends 
                        here. RIGHT?

           Laughter and approval from the crew.

           Armando gives Steve a death stare -- then walks off. Steve 
           turns cheerily back to the crew.

           INT. DIXIE BOY / MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Emilio sits at the counter and talks on the phone. He watches  
           through the window as the crew preps a shot

                                 EMILIO
                        It’s going pretty well. Tensions 
                        are a little high, but I’m getting 
                        along with the cast just great.
           Demi’s voice comes through from the other end of the phone.

                                 DEMI - PHONE
                        And how, uh, how’s the love 
                        interest? Those sex scenes aren’t 
                        bleeding over to real life, I hope.

                                 EMILIO
                    (hesitating)
                        Well--

           Emilio glances out the window-- sees STEVE beckoning to him.

                                 DEMI - PHONE
                        Well?! Well what? Did something 
                        happen between you two?

                                 EMILIO
                    (flustered)
                        What? No, I-- I don’t even think 
                        she’s hot. Dem, I gotta run, they 
                        need me on set.

                                 DEMI - PHONE
                        I didn’t ask if you thought she was 
                        hot. Why would you bring that up?

           OUTSIDE, Steve walks towards the window. He presses his face 
           to the glass and peers through at Emilio.

                                 STEVE
                        Emilio! We need you out here, pal!

                                 DEMI - PHONE
                    (worried)
                        Hey, I was thinking maybe I might 
                        come out and visit you next week.

                                 EMILIO
                        I’d love to see you but there’s 
                        really nothing to worry about--

                                 DEMI - PHONE
                        Maybe I’ll... Remind you why we’re 
                        so good for each other.

                                 EMILIO
                        Fine, that’d be great. I really 
                        gotta run, Dem. Bye!

           The song “HIGHWAY TO HELL” by AC/DC kicks in, and carries us 
           through this montage--

           Each shot in this montage is formatted the exact same way -- 
           something is being filmed in the background, while in the 
           foreground Steve is drinking a beer.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           1) BACKGROUND: Emilio Estevez and Laura Harrington film a 
           love scene. FOREGROUND: Steve drinks a beer.

           2) BACKGROUND: A drawbridge lifts, in an iconic (at least as 
           iconic as a movie this nutty can have) scene from the movie 
           where a drawbridge lifts up while cars are all still on it. 
           FOREGROUND: Steve drinks a beer.

           3) BACKGROUND: Emilio runs from a truck. FOREGROUND: Steve 
           drinks a beer.

           a beer.

           6) A screen divided into nine squares, Brady Bunch style. In 
           all the outside squares, Steve drinks beers. In the center 
           square, he looks to camera, crosses his arms and smiles.

           EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

           The King family, Steve, Tabby, Joe, Naomi, and baby Owen in a 
           stroller, walk through a sparsely populated North Carolina 
           amusement park.

                                 NAOMI
                        Mom, can we take Owen to see the 
                        duck pond?

                                 TABBY
                        Sure, just... 

           Naomi and Joe grab Baby Owen and run off.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        ...don’t drop him.

           She looks at Steve and smiles. They kiss.

                                 STEVE
                        So how was the flight in?
                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        As far as a flight with a baby can 
                        go, pretty good. He only cried 
                        seven times, so I consider that a 
                        victory.

           She takes Steve’s hand.

                                 TABBY
                        How’s the production going?

                                 STEVE
                        Pretty well. I think.

                                 TABBY
                        Yeah?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. The stuff we’ve got looks 
                        great. Leading kids are gonna 
                        sizzle on screen. It’s what we 
                        don’t have yet that scares me. Some 
                        of the stunts... When I’m writing, 
                        it’s me in a room. But there are 
                        people now. People depending on me 
                        to tell them, oh, you know, where 
                        to go, what to do. And fuck if I 
                        know all the time. But I think if I 
                        just stay the course... it’ll be 
                        something really special.

                                 TABBY
                        I’m sure it already is.

           She smiles at him.

                                 STEVE
                        You know, this bladder of mine is a 
                        real bastard, I’m just gonna run to 
                        the little boys’ room for a second.

           Steve lets go of Tabby and heads towards a Port-a-Potty. 
           Tabby watches him go. She’s not stupid.

                                 TABBY
                        Steve.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah?

                                 TABBY
                        Are you sure you have to... Go to 
                        the bathroom? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TABBY (CONT'D)
                        Sure you don’t just want to enjoy a 
                        day at the fair with your family?

                                 STEVE
                    (hesitates)
                        Well gee, Tabby, it’s just... I 
                        really gotta let the hog loose, or 
                        else I’ll be squirming the rest of 
                        the day, you wouldn’t want that, 
                        would you?

                                 TABBY
                        No. I suppose I wouldn’t.

                                 STEVE
                        I... I’ll be back in a second.

           INT. PORT-A-POTTY - NINE SECONDS LATER

           Steve RAILS a line of coke. He leans back, waiting for it to 
           hit him--

           Then suddenly GRIMACES in pain. He clutches both hands to the 
           side of his head, struck by a violent migraine. 

           He doubles over, and stays like that for a few moments before 
           straightening up.

           EXT. ROLLER COASTER - MINUTES LATER

           Steve sits in the front seat of a roller coaster, hands still 
           on his head. Joe and Naomi sit in the back. They wait for it 
           to take off. Joe leans forwards.

                                 JOE
                        Hey dad, did you get a chance  to 
                        read my story?

           FROM STEVE’S P.O.V. -- The sun in blinding, blistering, 
           boring in on him.

                                 STEVE
                        What?

           The roller coaster takes off.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The roller coaster whirls through the air and SPINS upside 
           down. Steve looks wildly from side to side to side to side, 
           clutching the sides of the ride in mortal terror.
           Joe sits in the back, dejected, sullen faced.

           ON THE GROUND

           Tabby holds Owen. And watches. Sad disapproval on her face.

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           The King family walks through the airport -- the kids up 
           ahead, Steve and Tabby trailing behind.

                                 STEVE
                        Jesus, they’re growing up quickly. 
                        I know that’s a cliche, and as a 
                        writer I should be able to come up 
                        with something better, but... 
                        Christ, it’s true.

                                 TABBY
                        We’re all getting older. How’s your 
                        head?

           Steve stops and looks at her.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not stupid.

                                 STEVE
                        I know you’re not--

                                 TABBY
                        And I was worried to let you come 
                        out here, but you promised you’d 
                        keep things under control.

                                 STEVE
                        I know, and I--

           She kisses him. It lasts a beat longer than it should. Then 
           she takes his face in her hands and really looks into his 
           eyes -- a warning in the look.

                                 TABBY
                        Just promise me you’ll try. I don’t 
                        want to have to keep having this 
                        conversation.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay. I’ll try.

           Tabby walks after the kids towards their gate.
           WALKING THE OTHER DIRECTION is Demi Moore, looking as 
           gorgeous as the day young Ashton Kutcher jerked off to her 
           while watching Striptease.

           Demi approaches EMILIO, also at the airport, who holds a sign 
           reading “Demi! <3 <3 <3”.

           Demi sees him and smiles, he smiles back, he throws his sign 
           aside,  runs  towards  her,  she  leaps  at  him,  he  wraps  his  arms 
           around her, she wraps her legs around his waist, he kisses her, she 
           kisses him back, they begin making out passionately right there in the middle of the 
           airport, he takes her shirt off, her tits bounce in the cold airport air, her  nipples 
           are hard, he takes them in his hands, then in his mouth, she climbs off of his and pushes him backwards 
           onto  the  luggage  carousel,  now  he’s  lying  down,  she  pulls  off  his  pants  and  then  pulls  off  his  underwear  and 
           his hard movie star cock sticks up in the air and she jerks it off, then sticks it in her mouth and goes up and down on it, then she strips off 
           her  pants  and  her  panties  and  fingers  herself  for  a  minute  while  blowing  him,  then  climbs  onto  him  and  takes  his  cock  in  her  hand  and  puts  it  into  her  pussy  and  then  rides  him,  then  spins  around  and  rides  him 
           backwards,  so  hot  neither  of  them  can  take  it,  they’re  both  about  to  explode,  and  all  the  while  the  TSA  watches  and  they  eventually  start  jerking  off,  one  by  one  they  just  take  out  their  cocks  and  masturbate...

           TITLE OVER BLACK - DAY 9

           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL ROOM / BATHROOM - MORNING

           Steve looks groggily into the mirror. Jack stands over his 
           shoulder, holding out a little baggie of coke.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Looking pretty groggy there. Sure 
                        you don’t want, I don’t know, a 
                        little pick me up?

                                 STEVE
                        Not today. I told Tabby I’d try and 
                        Goddammit, I intend to do that.

           EXT. DIXIE BOY / PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Emilio and Demi walk through the Dixie Boy parking lot, arms 
           around one another.

                                 DEMI
                        So, what scene do I get to watch 
                        you shoot? Something heroic?

           On her words, something dawns on Emilio and his face falls.

                                 EMILIO
                        Oh no.

           INT. DIXIE BOY / BACK ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Emilio and Laura lie naked in a bed in the back room of the 
           truck stop. About to shoot a love scene.
           Demi stands behind the cameras, visibly enraged. With her are 
           Armando and STEVE -- who is presently sober and looking a 
           little worse for wear for it.

           AS THE CREW PREPS, Laura leans in towards Emilio, who is 
           clearly uncomfortable, and whispers-- 

                                 LAURA
                        I know it’s awkward that your 
                        girlfriend is watching, but we 
                        should just be focused on making 
                        this as hot as possible. You know. 
                        For the good of the movie.

                                 EMILIO
                        Well fuck... I’m a professional. 
                        I’ll give it my A-game, Laura. 

                                 LAURA
                        You know what I saw in a French 
                        film once that was really hot?

           Laura whispers something into Emilio’s ear. Emilio blanches.

                                 EMILIO
                        I don’t know--

                                 LAURA
                        Come on, don’t you want our movie 
                        to be authentic? To feel real?

                                 EMILIO
                        I mean I guess so.

           Laura looks up at Demi. Makes eye contact. Winks at her.

                                 STEVE
                        Action!

           Emilio and Laura begin to kiss furiously. After a minute, 
           they separate.

                                 LAURA
                        I’ll tell you one thing.

                                 EMILIO
                        What’s that?

                                 LAURA
                        You sure make love like a hero.

           She laughs and caresses his chest. They continue kissing, 
           cuddling together. They turn and look out the window.
                                 EMILIO
                        Wow. Look at that light.

                                 LAURA
                        I think it’s the comet. You know 
                        we’ve been in its tail for almost 
                        twelve hours. And if it is that 
                        comet that’s making everything go 
                        crazy then all we gotta do is stay 
                        alive for the next seven days.

                                 EMILIO
                        No problem.

           They resume making out. Emilio begins kissing her forehead. 
           He hesitates-- and then literally LICKS THE SWEAT OFF OF IT 
           (a real thing that happens in Maximum Overdrive).

           Demi leans in to Steve.

                                 DEMI
                    (furious whisper)
                        Why did you direct him to do that?

                                 STEVE
                        ...I didn’t. Pretty hot though.

           Laura glances at Demi again, then begins to MOAN FURIOUSLY. 
           Demi fumes. Laura and Emilio roll apart.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        CUT! Great work everybody.

           Laura and Emilio roll apart. Laura touches Emilio’s arm.

                                 LAURA
                        That was fun. Wasn’t it?

                                 EMILIO
                        I just hope it was convincing--

           Emilio sees Demi storming towards the door.

                                 EMILIO (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit.

           Emilio leaps out of bed and runs after Demi.

                                 EMILIO (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry! It’s just acting! You 
                        know what it’s like!

                                 DEMI
                        Save it.
           Demi exits. Laura comes up behind Emilio and puts a hand on 
           his lower back.

                                 LAURA
                        What’s she so mad about?

           Emilio ignores her, runs out of the room.

           EXT. DIXIE BOY PARKING LOT - MAGIC HOUR

           The sun sets in the background. Actress ELLEN MCELDUFF, 
           dressed in a waitress outfit, delivers a full-blown emotional 
           monologue to the trucks in the parking lot.

                                 ELLEN
                    (shaking her fist)
                        YOU CAN'T! WE MADE YOU, Y'HEAR? WE 
                        MADE YOU! YOU CAN'T! WHERE’S YOUR 
                        SENSE OF LOYALTY, YOU PUKEY THINGS? 
                        YOU SONS OF BITCHES! YOU DIRTY SONS 
                        OF BITCHES! WE MADE YOU! DON'T YOU 
                        UNDERSTAND? YOU CAN'T DO THIS, WE 
                        MADE YOU!

           MULTIPLE SQUIBS GO OFF AT ONCE as Ellen’s front explodes with 
           bloody spray. She falls to the ground.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        We... made you.

                                 STEVE
                        Cut! Great work, Ellen.

           Ellen gets to her feet and looks at her bloody costume.

                                 ELLEN
                        Well geez, Steve, you got me 
                        looking like that Carrie girl.

           Steve turns to address the crew. When he speaks, it’s with a 
           little less confidence than his normal coked-up self.

                                 STEVE
                        Everyone, quick reminder! Tonight, 
                        the Dixie Boy is not just a set! As 
                        a celebration of how well the shoot 
                        has been going, we are turning the 
                        Dixie Boy into a party! I hope to 
                        see you all there.
           EXT. DIXIE BOY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Later that night. The Dixie Boy’s parking lot is abandoned.

           INT. DIXIE BOY - SAME

           On a ladder, Steve hangs a disco ball from the ceiling. It 
           turns on and begins to spin, casting its rad disco light all 
           over the interior of the Dixie Boy, abandoned save for tables 
           of food and drink.

           Steve looks around. Without music, without people, without 
           drugs in his system, the dancing lights can’t mask the hollow 
           emptiness of the desolate set.

           The front door of the truck stop CREAKS OPEN. Armando enters. 
           Upon seeing Steve, he pauses awkwardly.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Oh... Hey Steve.

                                 STEVE
                        Armando! Hey! Come on in!

                                 ARMANDO
                        Am I... early?

                                 STEVE
                        No, no. Well, sorta. I said 8. In 
                        American parlance, that means 
                        roundabout 8:28. But, if you don’t 
                        mind helping me set up...

                                 ARMANDO
                        You don’t have P.A.’s to do the 
                        setting up?

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, I do, but I wanted to give the 
                        little guys a break. Here, mix some 
                        punch. Should be one part punch, 
                        four parts vodka.

           He gestures to a table, where the ingredients lie. Armando 
           nods and begins mixing the punch.

                                 ARMANDO
                        You want a cup?

           Steve clearly does, but...
                                 STEVE
                        No. That’s alright, I’m actually 
                        trying to cut back.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Listen... Steve... We’ve had 
                        some... tough moments.

                                 STEVE
                        Yes, Armando, yes we have.

           Steve hops down from the ladder and walks up to Armando.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        You think I’m a piece of shit.

                                 ARMANDO
                        No. I don’t know. Maybe I do. Maybe 
                        I just think you’re... reckless. At 
                        times.

                                 STEVE
                        Isn’t that the fun of life, being 
                        reckless at times?

                                 ARMANDO
                        Not if you put others’ lives in 
                        danger.

                                 STEVE
                        We’re both sensible men. You can’t 
                        be a writer and not believe in 
                        change. I’m trying to change. So I 
                        believe we can still be friends. 
                        Can we just try to have fun 
                        together tonight? 

                                 ARMANDO
                        Yes, Steve. We can try.

           INT. DIXIE BOY - MINUTES LATER

           The Dixie Boy has been transformed into a thriving party. The 
           disco ball casts its light on dancing partiers. Steve stands 
           alone against the wall.

           STEVE’S P.O.V. -- A party filtered through the lens of 
           somebody with extreme social anxiety. Too much movement, too 
           many people, all of it too overwhelming. If he was high, on 
           the other hand...

           Emilio and Demi walk up to Steve, who has begun to sweat.
                                 EMILIO
                        Steve! I just want to thank you 
                        again for the role. This is my 
                        girlfriend, Demi.

                                 STEVE
                        I-- uh-huh, yeah, nice to meet you.

           He extends a shaky hand. Demi takes it awkwardly.

                                 EMILIO
                        Alright, well... Take care, man.

           Emilio claps him on the shoulder and walks off.

           INT. DIXIE BOY / BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Steve washes his face. He looks up at the mirror, AND SEES--

           A WOMAN IN A BAGGY BLACK DRESS standing over his shoulder. 
           This is MARGARET WHITE (50s) -- the mother of inafamously 
           terrible prom date CARRIE. Steve JUMPS, startled.

                                 MARGARET WHITE
                        I told you you’d be boring off 
                        drugs. Lots of people out at that 
                        party and they’re not gonna like 
                        you, not a single one, they’re all 
                        gonna laugh at you, like when you 
                        were an ugly little boy with no 
                        friends and they called you Freaky 
                        Stevie, FREAKY STEVIE, FREAK--

           Steve turns away from the mirror and leans against the wall. 
           He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small handful of 
           assorted uppers. The pills rattle in his shaking hand.

           He raises them towards his mouth.

           INT. DIXIE BOY - MINUTES LATER

           In the middle of the room, Steve shucks and jives with the 
           shamelessness that only a middle aged white guy can have. 
           Dino wanders up to Steve.

                                 DINO
                        Steve!

                                 STEVE
                        Dino! Glad you could make it!
                                 DINO
                        You really know how to throw a 
                        party.

                                 STEVE
                        That’s why they called me the Cool-- 
                        Mr-- Mr. Cool-- Mr. Cool Normal Guy 
                        in high school!

                                 DINO
                        Sure, just don’t let this thing go 
                        too late, alright? You’ve gotta 
                        make your day tomorrow!

                                 STEVE
                        I thought tomorrow was simple!

                                 DINO
                        Relatively, but even so--

                                 STEVE
                        I’ll be fine, Dino!

           EXCITED WHOOPS ring out around them. 

           Steve and Dino look up to see Angus Young, Brian Johnson and 
           the rest of AC/DC walking through the door.

                                 DINO
                        Is that--

                                 STEVE
                        AC motherfuckin’ DC, baby. Angus! 
                        Hey, Angus!

           The band walks over.

                                 ANGUS
                        Steve, what’s up?!

                                 DINO
                        Did you boys fly here from 
                        Austrailia?

                                 ANGUS
                        I never miss a chance for pussy. Is 
                        there any pussy here?

                                 BRIAN
                        Where do you want us to set up?

                                 STEVE
                        In the corner, just smash that 
                        sound system out of the way.
                                 BRIAN
                        On it.

           Brian runs across the room and PUNCHES the sound system. 
           Sparks fly. The music stops. People groan. 

           AC/DC quickly set up in the corner. Brian takes the mic.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ll start with a little something 
                        we whipped up for the movie. This 
                        one’s for you, Steve.

           CHEERS all around. The band launches into a performance of 
           Who Made Who -- the hit single which was indeed written 
           exclusively for Maximum Overdrive.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        The video game says play me,
                        Face it, on a level, but it takes you,
                        every time on a one on one!

           Steve looks at Armando and GRINS.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Who made who, who made you? Who 
                        made you, ain’t nobody told you?

           Dino and Yeardly dance together in the crowd.

           BEFORE LONG -- AC/DC is wrapping up the song. 

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Who made who, who made who,
                        Yeah, nobody told you!

           Brian Johnson steps away from the microphone.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Steve! Swap in for a song?

           Steve rubs his hands together.

                                 STEVE
                        Dreams do come true, Stevey boy!

           Steve runs up to the microphone. All eyes in the room on him. 
           Steve turns to the band.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        “Highway to Hell,” hit it!

           The band begins to play. Steve sings terribly, but with 
           tremendous gusto.
                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Livin’ easy,
                        Lovin’ free!
                        Season ticket on a one way ride!
                        Askin’ nothin’
                        Leave me be!
                        Takin’ something something side!

           In the crowd, Armando laughs. Animosity forgotten. 

           This party is alive! 

           INT. DIXIE BOY BACK ROOM - SAME TIME

           Demi and Emilio lay on the floor making out. She pulls away. 
           He sighs, frustrated.

                                 DEMI
                        I just- I can’t stop thinking about 
                        you and Laura on that bed together.

                                 EMILIO
                        We were shooting a scene together, 
                        Dem! You know what that’s like.

                                 DEMI
                        You licked sweat off her forehead! 

                                 EMILIO
                        She told me it would be hot, said 
                        she saw it in a French film! Oh, 
                        shit, do you think she was lying?

                                 DEMI
                        She winked at me when you were sex 
                        acting! Has anything happened? 
                        Between you two? If it has... I 
                        need to know.

                                 EMILIO
                        No. I promise. I mean maybe she’s 
                        flirted a little, but--

                                 DEMI
                        She what?! I fucking knew it!

           The door opens and Laura walks in.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh. Sorry. Am I fucking up a moment?

                                 DEMI
                        You mean the same way you fucked my 
                        boyfriend?
                                 LAURA
                        Wow, hold on, I didn’t fuck Emilio. 
                        I asked, but he said no.

                                 EMILIO
                        That’s true, she’s telling the truth!

                                 LAURA
                        Not sure why though. Not sure what 
                        he sees in you.

                                 DEMI
                        Oh, you fucking--

                                 EMILIO
                        Hold on! What is this Laura? You’re 
                        trying to, what, break us up? 

                                 LAURA
                        I just... think you’re cute?

                                 EMILIO
                        Really? Or do you think I’m famous?

           Laura has no answer. Emilio wraps his arm around Demi.

                                 EMILIO (CONT’D)
                        She’s my girlfriend. You’re not. 
                        Come on, Demi.

           Emilio and Demi go back into the main room. Laura looks after 
           them, pissed.

           INT. DIXIE BOY - SAME TIME

           People drinking, dancing in the main floor of the Dixie Boy. 
           HOLTER, the child actor, sneaks a cup of spiked punch when 
           nobody’s looking.

                                 STEVE
                        And I’m goin’ down...
                        All the way...
                        I’m on the highway to hell!

           The song wraps to BOISTEROUS CHEERS.

                                 ANGUS
                        You got another one in you?

                                 STEVE
                        Only if we can make it a duet! 
                        Armando! Armando!
           Steve beckons Armando to the stage. Armando looks around.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Who, me?

                                 STEVE
                        You and me, friend! A new era!

           Armando comes up to the band.

                                 ARMANDO
                        I only know “Back in Black.”

                                 STEVE
                        “Back in Black” it is. Hit it!

           The band begins to play.

                                 ARMANDO
                    (timid)
                        Back in black. I hit the sack.
                        It’s been too long I’m glad to be 
                        back.

           Steve takes over, with verve.

                                 STEVE
                        YES, I’M LET LOOSE!
                        FROM THE NOOSE!
                        THAT’S KEPT ME HANGING ABOUT!

           Steve and Armando sway, arms around one another. Soon they’re 
           at the end of the song.

                  STEVE
                                       ARMANDO
           Yes, I’m back!
           Well, I’m back, back!
           Well, I’m back in black!
           Yes, I’m back in black!
                                Whoop, I’m back!
                                True, I’m back, back!
                                Bro, I’m back in black!
                                Yeah, I’m back in black!

           The crowd erupts into cheers!

           Steve grabs Angus’s guitar and begins to play for all he’s 
           worth, loving every moment. 

           Every. 

           Fucking. 

           Moment.

                                        CUT TO BLACK.
           INT. STEVE’S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Steve’s eyes open. He’s hungover as fuck. We’ve been here 
           before.

           EXT. STEVE’S HOTEL - LATER

           Steve walks through the hotel parking lot, sunglasses on, 
           beer in hand -- hair of the dog.

           He stops next to a trash can, leans over, and retches into 
           it. He then looks up and looks around. Gray skies. Wind. A 
           palpable sense of dread in the air.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Steve walks up to the crew. They’ve set up the production in 
           the driveway of a house located in a suburban neighborhood.

           They’ve clearly been waiting for him a few minutes too long. 
           But the goodwill from the party remains.

                                 STEVE
                        Hey, gang!

                                 VARIOUS
                        Hey Steve! / Fun party, man. / 
                        Rough night?

           Dino walks up to Steve and takes him aside.

                                 DINO
                        Steve. You know what’s happening in 
                        this scene?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah yeah yeah. A lawnmower chases 
                        Deke, tries to kill him, he bikes 
                        away from it, right?

                                 DINO
                        Essentially. And you feel... up to 
                        directing?

                                 STEVE
                        Excuse me?

                                 DINO
                        I just know it was a big night, are 
                        you sure--
                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, I feel up to directing. 
                        Matter of fact, I’m feeling like 
                        this scene lacks bite. Get my stunt 
                        coordinator over here. And Armando.

           Dino calls them over.

              STUNT COORDINATOR 
                                       ARMANDO
           What’s up?
                                What is the issue, friend?

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think this scene is 
                        working. I don’t think it feels 
                        dangerous enough.

                                 ARMANDO
                        What do you propose?

                                 STEVE
                        I wanna put real blades in the 
                        lawnmower.

                                 STUNT COORDINATOR
                        Okay, man, but you know that nobody 
                        is actually gonna see the blades.

                                 STEVE
                        How do you mean?

                                 ARMANDO
                        He means we only ever see the top 
                        of the lawnmower.

                                 STEVE
                        I don’t care. This is an authentic 
                        production, it all has to be real. 
                        All of it. Or audiences won’t care.

                                 ARMANDO
                        This is illogical, it only adds 
                        danger--

                                 STEVE
                        Hey. Armando. I thought we were 
                        buddies now.

           Armando hesitates -- then smiles.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Yes. Of course.

                                 DINO
                        I’ll tell props to get on it.
                                 STEVE
                        And faster, too. However fast it 
                        was going before-- I want it 
                        doubled.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Didn’t you learn your lesson last 
                        time from--

                                 STEVE
                        Just do it. Please.

                                 DINO
                    (hesitant)
                        Sure, Steve.

           LATER -- Everyone is in their places. Prop Master stands with 
           the lawnmower.

                                 STEVE
                        Remember! Twice as fast!

           Prop Master turns up the dial on the LAWNMOWER, and adjusts 
           the rig that will hold down the acceleration to make it look 
           as though the thing is moving on its own.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Action!

           Prop Master STARTS the lawnmower. It takes off on its own. 

           The lawnmower rumbles quickly across the shooting space 
           marked out on the driveway. 

           Then. Without warning.

           IT VEERS OFF COURSE. And rumbles straight towards the crew.

           Everything happens quickly.

           The crew members dive out of the way. The lawnmower strikes a 
           wooden beam that’s being used as a camera support. 

           The real lawnmower blades TEAR INTO THE WOOD.

           IN SLOW MOTION--

           A single chip of woods is spat out. It flies through open 
           air, soaring across the driveway. 

           Moving straight towards the unprotected face of Armando 
           Nanuzzi. 

           His eyes go wide.
           The chip 

           of wood 

           pierces 

           through 

           Armando’s 

           left 

           eyeball.

           END SLOW MOTION

           Armando SCREAMS and falls to the ground, clutching his face. 
           Blood and gore seep through his fingers.

           Crew members RUSH to Armando’s side. Steve stands back, face 
           gaunt in terror.

           INT. HOSPITAL / ARMANDO’S ROOM - LATER

           Armando sleeps in a hospital bed, a bandage over one eye.

           INT. HOSPITAL / HALLWAY OUTSIDE ARMANDO’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Steve and Dino talk to a DOCTOR.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Fortunately, it looks like he’ll 
                        keep the eye.

                                 DINO
                        Thank God.

                                 DOCTOR
                        But it was close. Don’t know how 
                        this could have happened on a 
                        professional film set.

           The Doctor walks off. Steve breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 STEVE
                        Well, that’s a load off my back.

                                 DINO
                        A load off your back? A load off 
                        your fucking back?! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DINO (CONT'D)
                        You nearly blinded a man! I told 
                        you, Steve, I told you not to let 
                        the party run late and now look at 
                        what you’ve fucking done!

                                 STEVE
                        It was an honest accident!

                                 DINO
                        Why the hell did the lawnmower need 
                        real blades? Armando knew this 
                        would happen, too! Jesus Christ. 
                        Jesus. In all my years...

           Dino paces down the hallway. He runs a hand through his hair.

                                 STEVE
                        Dino.

                                 DINO
                        What?!

                                 STEVE
                        I’m... I’m sorry.

                                 DINO
                        Let’s just finish this fucking 
                        shoot. So I can go home to my wife 
                        and never think about this Goddamn 
                        cursed movie ever again.

           He storms off. Steve looks in at Armando, asleep in his bed.

           INT. HOSPITAL / ARMANDO’S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Steve tiptoes into the room and approaches the bed. He looks 
           down at the sleeping Armando.

                                 STEVE
                        Armando. Armando, friend. I don’t 
                        know if you can hear me, but--

                                 ARMANDO
                        I can hear you fine, you oversized 
                        tub of shit.

           Armando’s uncovered eye creeps open.

                                 ARMANDO (CONT’D)
                        You blinded me.
                                 STEVE
                        The doctor said your eye would be 
                        fine.

                                 ARMANDO
                        You misunderstand. You blinded 
                        me... with kindness. And with 
                        AC/DC. I forgot you were a moron. 
                        This is the price that I pay.

                                 STEVE
                        Armando...

           Steve reaches out and touches Armando’s shoulder. Armando 
           stares coldly down at Steve’s hand.

                                 ARMANDO
                        Only a fool rebuilds a bridge more 
                        than once. It is too likely to fall 
                        again. Or in your case, to blow the 
                        fuck up.

                                 STEVE
                        Armando, pal, I obviously didn’t 
                        intend for this to happen. Can I 
                        make it right? Let me know how.

                                 ARMANDO
                        The first step is realizing you’re 
                        the one who is blind. Leave me to 
                        my pain.

           Steve takes a step back and looks at Armando a moment longer, 
           helpless in his hospital bed. Then he turns and leaves.

           TITLE OVER BLACK -- END OF SHOOTING

           EXT. DIXIE BOY PARKING LOT - MAGIC HOUR

           As the sun sets pink and red, as crew members pack up the 
           set, PEOPLE SAY GOODBYE. Hugs exchanged this way and that.

           Emilio makes the rounds, hugs Yeardley, Pat, Holter, the 
           other cast members. LAURA watches him from a distance, still 
           angry.

           STEVE, too, watches all the goodbyes from afar, bittersweet. 

           Steve scans peoples’ faces. Makes eye contact with Armando 
           Nannuzzi, gauze over one eye, standing off to the side of the 
           lot. No expression in his stony face.
           Steve raises a hand to his forehead and tips him a salute. 
           Armando just stares back... Then turns and walks away.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           Steve’s car ZOOMS OFF down the highway. He passes a “Now 
           Leaving North Carolina” sign.

           EXT. KING HOME / BANGOR - NIGHT

           Steve cruises into the King driveway at a steady sixty miles 
           an hour. He rolls up the driveway at the same speed, nearing 
           the house. Then--

                                 STEVE
                        Oh fuck!

           He SLAMS the brake.

           SQUeaLSCReEChCAREEnREEEEEEE

           The car SLOWS, SLOWS--

           And comes to a stop almost in time. The nose of the car 
           THUNKS into the garage door, creating a sizable dent.

           Steve opens the door of the car. Forty beer cans fall out 
           into the driveway.

           INT. KING HOME / DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Steve enters the dining room.

           Tabby, Joe, Naomi and Owen eat dinner around the kitchen 
           table. They look up as he enters.

                                 TABBY
                        Steve!

           Tabby gets up, runs to him, and hugs him.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know you were getting home 
                        today.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, shit, I knew I forgot to 
                        mention something.

                                 TABBY
                        Come on, come eat with the family.
           INT. KING HOME / DINING ROOM - LATER

           The family sits around the table, enjoying a quiet meal. 
           Steve looks across the table to Naomi and smiles. 

           RACK FOCUS to the wine bottle in the middle of the table.

           INT. KING HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Steve and Tabby sit on the couch watching TV. The wine bottle 
           is clutched between Steve’s legs.

           Tabby cuddles closer to Steve. Steve kisses her on the cheek 
           and puts an arm around her.

                                 TABBY
                        Hey Steve?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah babe?

                                 TABBY
                        I think we should take it easy for 
                        a while.

                                 STEVE
                        Like for the rest of the night?

                                 TABBY
                        No. No, I mean a few weeks. A 
                        month. The family, I think we 
                        should go on vacation, spend some 
                        quality time together.

                                 STEVE
                        That’s not gonna be possible. I 
                        have to fly to Los Angeles tomorrow 
                        to start post and sit in on 
                        editing, and then the release 
                        date’s gonna be looming--

           INDIGNANT, Tabby moves away from Steve.

                                 TABBY
                        How is all that possibly already 
                        happening?

                                 STEVE
                        I ordered a rush on the prints, 
                        that’s what all the experts say. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVE (CONT'D)
                        Tabby, you gotta jump on this stuff 
                        while it’s fresh in the mind or 
                        else it’ll slip away from you, slip 
                        the fuck away from you and you’ll 
                        never get it back, and that’s, I’m 
                        not gonna let that happen, plus 
                        then the press tour’s gonna start--

                                 TABBY
                        Why do you have to do press, you’re 
                        not exactly Emilio Estevez!

                                 STEVE
                        Plus there’s that new book I just 
                        started writing--

                                 TABBY
                        WHEN did you start a new book?

                                 STEVE
                        At dinner. In my head. It’s about 
                        this writer chick who’s always 
                        getting her period and then one day 
                        she’s walking in the woods and she 
                        finds a spaceship--

                                 TABBY
                        I don’t give a FUCK what your new 
                        book is about.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay. You’re mad.

                                 TABBY
                        No, Steve. Not at all. Have fun in 
                        Los Angeles.

           She gets up and storms out. He looks after her sadly.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (O.S.)
                        Women. Right?

           Steve looks over, sees JACK sitting on the couch next to him.

                                 STEVE
                        She’s really upset.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Eh, she’ll get over it. Come on, 
                        let’s do some blow and write about 
                        that chick who’s on her period.

           As they walk out of the room--
                                 STEVE
                        I think I’m gonna call it The 
                        Tommyknockers.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Sure you are, buddy.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Sweepingly cliched establishing shots of Los Angeles.

           INT. STUDIO / EDITING BAY - DAY

           Steve sits on a couch in an editing bay, watching the final 
           few frames of Maximum Overdrive. The movie ends. The EDITOR 
           stops the projection.

                                 EDITOR
                        Well?

                                 STEVE
                        I love it. Perfect. No notes.

                                 EDITOR
                        That was an assembly cut. There was 
                        no music and it was three hours 
                        long.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh. In that case. Run it again.

           The Editor SIGHS and starts it again.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           Shots from around Los Angeles.

           IN A SHINY RED CONVERTIBLE -- Steve CRUISES down the PCU. The 
           ocean bright and beautiful beside him.

           IN THE EDITING BAY -- Steve watches footage of the kid 
           getting smashed by the street cleaner and LAUGHS maniacally.

           IN A MOVIE THEATER -- Steve watches ROCKY IV.

           -- ON SCREEN, Apollo Creed dies. 

           -- IN THE AUDIENCE, Steve wipes away a tear.

           ON THE BEACH -- Steve walks along the coast. He breaks into a 
           jog, goes ten feet, and has to stop and catch his breath.
           IN A CONCERT HALL -- Steve is onstage singing with -- 
           inexplicably -- the band Bowling For Soup.

           -- A MASSIVE CROWD cheers for them.

           -- Steve is front and center on stage, flanked by band 
           members JARET REDDICK and CHRIS BURNEY. Steve leans into the 
           microphone.

                                 STEVE
                    (singing for all he’s worth)
                        Springsteen, Madonna,
                        Way before Nirvana.
                        There was U2 and Blondie,
                        And music still on MTV.

           PCU -- Steve continues cruising down the PCU.

           MUSIC FADES OUT -- MONTAGE ENDS. 

           INT. STUDIO / EDITING BAY - DAY

           AS BEFORE, the final few frames of Maximum Overdrive play.

                                 EDITOR
                        Okay. Now what did you think?

                                 STEVE
                        Now it’s perfect.

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - EVENING

           ACTUAL FOOTAGE FROM THE ENDING OF MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (Courtesy 
           of the ‘De Laurentiis Entertainment Group’... Hopefully) 
           FILLS THE SCREEN.

           THE IMAGE CUTS TO CREDITS--

           And we PULL BACK to reveal the interior of a screening room. 

           THREE EXECUTIVES, sitting in fancy seats and smoking cigars, 
           turn away from the screen and look at one another.

           EXECUTIVE #1 takes a LONG PUFF ON HIS CIGAR and inhales for 
           like twenty seconds. HE EXHALES a long, long stream of smoke.

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Oh no. Oh, no, no, no.

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        It’s not so bad.
                                 EXECUTIVE #3
                        It’s not so good.

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        We’ve seen worse.

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Where was I for the worse 
                        screening?

                                 EXECUTIVE #3
                        Jerking off in your office?

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Fuck off, Billy, that was one time.

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        Gentlemen! We can settle this 
                        later. Right now we have a bigger 
                        issue. Figuring out how the fuck we 
                        sell this.

                                 EXECUTIVE #3
                        Can we just say “Starring trucks 
                        and the guy from ‘Breakfast Club’?”

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        No! I’ve got it. People aren’t 
                        gonna like this movie. But you know 
                        what people do like?

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        ...The trucks?

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        Stephen. King. People like Stephen 
                        King. How do you think we got here 
                        in the first place? They like his 
                        books, they see his name in the 
                        trailer...

                                 EXECUTIVE #3
                        So what are you suggesting?

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        We put him in the trailer. Have him 
                        pitch the movie. Directly to the 
                        audience. Imagine it -- “Maximum 
                        Terror! Maximum King!” They like 
                        him, they come.

                                 EXECUTIVE #3
                        He’s not an actor. And... He’s 
                        weird as fuck.
                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        Do you have any better ideas?

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

           A COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR (20s) stands behind a camera. People 
           mill back and forth in the background and foreground. The 
           camera points directly at a green screen.

                                 COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR
                        Ready... Rolling... And... Wait. 
                        Where the fuck is King?

           He looks up from the camera. The venerable Stephen King is 
           nowhere to be seen.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE / BATHROOM - SAME

           Steve looks into the bathroom mirror. In one hand, he holds a 
           swath of script pages.

                                 STEVE
                    (reciting)
                        I thought, why not do it myself?
                    (then, to himself)
                        Fuck. Fuck. What’s next?

           He looks down at the pages in his hands--

           Then SLAPS HIMSELF across the face and barrels the mirror.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Get it together! Get it the fuck 
                        together!

           Suddenly, THE MAN IN BLACK steps into view in the mirror 
           behind Steve. He doesn’t say anything. Just stares at him.

           Steve closes his eyes... takes a deep breath... sticks a hand 
           into his pocket... And freezes.

           He pulls A SMALL VIAL OF COCAINE out of his pocket. He just 
           looks at it. For a long while. A long, long while.

           SECONDS LATER, a line of coke DISAPPEARS into King’s nose.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - MINUTES LATER

           Commercial Director looks through his camera.
                                 COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR
                        And... ACTION.

           Across the soundstage, STEVE stands in front of a giant image 
           of the Green Goblin truck. Steve walks towards the camera.

           SUPER -- THIS IS A REAL COMMERCIAL, FIND IT ON YOUTUBE 
           (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWS4tTzs60).

                                 STEVE
                        Hi. My name is Stephen King. I’ve 
                        written several motion pictures but 
                        I want to tell you about a movie 
                        called Maximum Overdrive, which is 
                        the first one I directed.

           WE PUSH IN to an extreme close-up on Steve’s face.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        I finally decided if you want 
                        something done right, you outta do 
                        it yourself. 

           BEHIND STEVE, the eyes of the truck begin to GLOW BRIGHT RED.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        It was my first picture as a 
                        director, and you know something? I 
                        sort of enjoyed it!

           He flashes a wild, crazy-eyed chipmunk grin and points 
           aggressively into camera.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna scare the hell out of 
                        you. And that’s a promise. 

                                 COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR
                        Cut!

           ASSISTANT COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR runs up to Commercial Director.

                                 COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        I think we got it.

                                 A.C.D.
                        We only did one take.

                                 COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR
                        We’ll splice it up with a bunch of 
                        shots of explosions and Mr. 
                        Breakfast Club and call it a day. 
                        Good work, Steve!
           They look up. Steve has already departed.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Yeah, he left already.

           INT. KING HOME / LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           The front door of the King home SWINGS OPEN. Steve steps 
           through.

                                 STEVE
                        Wonderful family! I am home!

                                 TABBY (O.S.)
                        We’re in here.

           Steve looks in the direction of her voice -- the living room. 
           Something. Feels. Off.

           CAUTIOUSLY, Steve walks towards the living room.

                                 STEVE
                        Is everything alright?

                                 TABBY
                        Everything’s fine.

           INT. KING HOME / LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Steve steps into the room and sees -- HIS GREATEST FEAR.

           FIFTEEN PEOPLE sitting in a circle. Amongst them, Tabby. 
           Naomi. Joe. Owen in a high chair. Dino, Dan and Suzy. Other 
           people whom we’ll assume to be his relatives, family friends.

           This is an intervention. Interventioning is happening.

                                 STEVE
                        What is this?

                                 TABBY
                        Don’t you remember from five years 
                        ago? Or were you too high then, 
                        too?

                                 STEVE
                        An intervention? You’re giving me 
                        an intervention? This is bullshit, 
                        I don’t have to listen to this.

           Steve turns, makes to walk out the door.
                                 TABBY
                        WAIT!

           Steve freezes.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit, Steve. You will not walk 
                        out that door. I don’t care if you 
                        quit, I don’t even care if you turn 
                        around and call me a bitch, I just 
                        care that for two seconds you turn 
                        around and FUCKING LISTEN TO ME. 
                        GIVE ME THE TIME OF DAY. FOR ONCE. 
                        Or me and the kids leave.

           Steve turns around slowly.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay. Okay, you want me to listen? 
                        I’ll listen. What do you wanna say?

           Tabby rises from the couch, leans down, picks up a large 
           garbage bag, and turns it upside down.

           THE REMNANTS OF ALL THE DRUGS KNOWN TO MAN tumble out. Beer 
           cans. Grams of coke, Xanax, NyQuil, Valium. Empty cough 
           medicine bottles. Two broken bongs. More beer cans.

           They pour out endlessly for seconds upon seconds.

           And more seconds upon seconds.

           AND STILL they keep pouring out onto the ground until the 
           entire floor is covered in a sea of the remnants of his sad, 
           sad self-destruction.

                                 TABBY
                        You were home for three days in the 
                        last month. This was from three. 
                        Days. Do you see? Do you see now?

           Steve just stares at her. Steely eyed anger. Tabby gives it 
           right back.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        This is it. The part where you hear 
                        about everyone you’ve hurt. Let’s 
                        go.

                                 DINO
                        You blinded a man. Besmirched my 
                        name.
                                 STEVE
                        The doctor said Armando would 
                        probably be fine--

                                 DINO
                        They said that. But he won’t. They 
                        only thought that at first but it’s 
                        gotten worse. Armando has lost all 
                        vision in his left eye and he’s 
                        suing us for 18 million dollars.

                                 TABBY
                        Who else? Who else has Steve hurt?

           She looks around. Naomi raises her hand timidly.

                                 STEVE
                        You... You have something to say, 
                        Naomi? After all the allowances I 
                        gave you?

                                 NAOMI
                        There was a father daughter dance 
                        at my school, Dad. You said you 
                        would come but you didn’t. I stood 
                        in that auditorium but you never 
                        showed up. And do you know what you 
                        were doing when I came home? You 
                        were passed out in a bathtub full 
                        of beer. You filled a bathtub with 
                        beer and got into it. And then in 
                        the morning when I asked you what 
                        you were doing you said “beer 
                        city,” and laughed at me.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay, anyone else wanna speak up?

                                 DAN
                        I relocated my office here for you. 
                        And now you’re at risk of 
                        destroying both our careers.

           Joe raises his hand.

                                 STEVE
                        You too?

                                 JOE
                        You were supposed to take me to see 
                        Jaws 3D but you were too fucked up 
                        to drive. I had to run to the 
                        theater and by the time I got there 
                        they were out of 3D glasses. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Who the FUCK wants to see a shark 
                        in 2D? It looked terrible!

           Joe rises to his feet.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        And more than that. You didn’t read 
                        my short story. I want to be you, 
                        don’t you get that? And you didn’t 
                        even read my damn story.

                                 STEVE
                    (genuinely confused)
                        Joe. What story?

                                 JOE
                        Exactly.

           Joe sits. Tabby rises.

                                 TABBY
                        You missed our anniversary. For the 
                        first time in fifteen years. You 
                        just forgot.

           Steve scans the rest of the faces. He looks at Owen, the tiny 
           infant, sitting in his high chair. Owen looks straight into 
           Steve’s eyes.

                                 OWEN
                    (British accent)
                        You’ve honestly been quite a 
                        disappointment to me, father.

           Steve blinks with disbelief.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay I might still be a little 
                        high.

           Tabby rises to her feet. She and Steve stand face to face.

                                 TABBY
                        That’s the problem! Don’t you see 
                        that that’s the problem! You’re 
                        always high!

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, okay, maybe I am. But Christ, 
                        Tabby! What do you want me to do, 
                        stop?
                                 TABBY
                        Yes! For fuck’s sake, yes, of 
                        course that’s what I want!

                                 STEVE
                        I! CAN’T!

                                 TABBY
                        Why not?! Why can’t you try, for 
                        us?!

           Steve hesitates -- looks like he’s really considering it. He 
           glances over Tabby’s shoulder.

           The Man in Black stands coolly against the wall. Arms 
           crossed. Looking at Steve. All other sound in the room fades 
           away.

                                 THE MAN IN BLACK 
                        Don’t listen to them. They’re all 
                        wrong.

           And Steve looks back at Tabby, exasperated, like it’s the 
           most obvious thing in the world, and when he talks spittle 
           flies out of his mouth.

                                 STEVE
                        Because I don’t stop! I never stop! 
                        Don’t you get that?! We lived in a 
                        trailer ten years ago, a fucking 
                        trailer, or did you forget?! My mom 
                        died and all I’ve done is work, I 
                        worked to get us a house and to get 
                        my book published and to get 
                        another book published and another 
                        book and another book and I worked 
                        to fuck a baby into you and another 
                        and another, and I worked to keep 
                        us moving up and up and up and 
                        we’re still moving up, we’re still 
                        fucking moving up and it’s all 
                        because I don’t stop! If I stop, 
                        what happens then?! We go back? 
                        Back like the nothing we were 
                        before, back in a fucking trailer? 
                        THAT’S NOT US, NOT ME, I’M NOT 
                        GONNA BE ALONE AGAIN, LIVING IS 
                        GOING, AND IF I STOP-- IF I STOP, I 
                        DIE!

           BOOM. A dead silence falls on the room. Tabby just stares at 
           him. And he stares back at her.
           His gaze shifts off her, he looks around the room. His eyes 
           land on Joe, on Naomi. On Owen. On Dan, Suzy and Dino. The 
           others. Then back on Tabby.

                                 TABBY
                        Jesus Christ, Steve. What the fuck 
                        are you talking about? If you stop, 
                        we’re here. If you stop, we’re all 
                        still here, like we were before. 
                        Don’t you see that?

           Steve takes another look at all his loved ones.

                                 STEVE
                        I have to go. I have a movie to 
                        promote.

                                 TABBY
                        Steve.

           He walks towards the door. As he goes through it--

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        STEVE. 

           Steve turns back. A trickle of blood runs from his nose.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        Your nose is bleeding.

           He wipes away the blood, inadvertently smearing it across his 
           face --- a pathetic sight.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        And don’t come back.

           Steve pauses in the doorway. Then leaves and SLAMS the door.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Steve lays on the bed. Glass of Scotch in his hand. Ah, the 
           loneliness of hotel rooms. Steve flips through TV channels 
           and lands briefly on--

           INSERT -- Sissy Spacek getting covered in pig’s blood.

           A faint, sad smile crosses Steve’s face.

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EARLY MORNING

           Steve and a cheery MORNING SHOW HOST (50s), all smiles, sit 
           on chairs opposite one another in a small studio. 
           On-screen morning show graphics tell us this is a Canadian 
           breakfast interview show.

           SUPER: This is a real interview. Find it on YouTube 
           (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdPWlb2B6LM).

                                 MORNING SHOW HOST
                        You must have made like twenty five 
                        million dollars on these books.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s not that much yet but I guess 
                        it could get there, gross huge 
                        amounts of money, yeah.

                                 MORNING SHOW HOST
                        But you don’t have any desires to 
                        elaborate further than the movies 
                        and the written word, do you?

                                 STEVE
                        No, I don’t even think I wanna make 
                        another movie, it’s a primitive way 
                        to create. You know what I’d really 
                        like to have?

                                 MORNING SHOW HOST
                        What? 

                                 STEVE
                        A pair of lizard skin boots.

           Steve grins. His tongue flicks out of his mouth and he licks 
           his lips.

           EXT. STUDIO - MINUTES LATER

           Steve exits the studio, fake smile still plastered on his 
           face. As soon as he steps outside, the smile fades.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           A flashing marquee-- the premiere of Maximum Overdrive.

           Red carpet in full swing. A limo pulls up. Steve gets out. He 
           walks down the carpet. Cameras FLASH as he enters the 
           theater.

           INT. PREMIERE THEATER - LATER

           Steve sits next to Demi in the front row of the theater.
           ON SCREEN -- The kid getting run over by the street cleaner.

           Steve grins. He leans over to Demi, looking to say 
           something... 

           But she’s leaning to the other side, whispering to Emilio. 
           Steve’s smile falls. He slumps back in his seat.

           A FEW ROWS BACK -- Dino watches the movie unfold. He glowers. 
           Arms crossed. Not happy.

           EXT. PREMIERE THEATER - LATER

           People stream out of the theater. Among them, Demi and 
           Emilio.

                                 DEMI
                        I’m gonna find the bathroom.

           Demi walks off, leaving Emilio alone. After a moment, Laura 
           walks up. 

           She nods towards Steve, standing across the carpet and 
           talking to reporters.

                                 LAURA
                        You hear about Armando? How he’s 
                        gonna lose the eye? You were right, 
                        Steve really is out of control. 

                                 EMILIO
                        Yeah, it’s-- it’s pretty fucked up.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey, sorry if things got a little 
                        weird there for a minute. 

                                 EMILIO
                        Don’t worry about it.

                                 LAURA
                        I didn’t mean anything by it. Just-- 
                        wanted to have some fun. 

           She reaches out and clasps his shoulder. Her hand lingers 
           there a little too long. Emilio laughs. Shakes his head.

                                 EMILIO
                        Jesus, you’re still at it. You 
                        know, you and Steve...
                                 LAURA
                        What? What, you think we’re the 
                        same or some shit?

                                 EMILIO
                        He thinks he’s doing what he has to 
                        do to stay on top. You’re think you 
                        can fuck your way to the top.

                                 LAURA 
                        And what do you think?

                                 EMILIO 
                        That you’re both crazy. Love’s what 
                        matters. I’m gonna propose to Demi.

                                 LAURA 
                        Shit. Really?

                                 EMILIO
                        What can I say? She’s the one. Take 
                        it easy, Laura.

           Emilio walks off towards Demi. Laura watches him go. She 
           lights a lonely cigarette and begins to smoke. Emilio reaches 
           Demi. Puts an arm around her. Kisses her. She smiles.

                                 DEMI
                        What’s up?

                                 EMILIO
                        Nothing. Just missed you.

           They share a quick kiss, and walk off.

           ACROSS THE RED CARPET -- People continue to stream out of the 
           theater. Steve walks up to Dino.

                                 STEVE
                        Friend, it wasn’t the easiest path 
                        but we pushed on through and at the 
                        end of the day I think it came out 
                        pretty well. Just wanted to thank 
                        you for believing in me.

           Dino glares at Steve for a full five seconds.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DINO
                        You think the movie came out good, 
                        do you? Huh? You think people liked 
                        it? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DINO (CONT'D)
                        People were LAUGHING AT US, you 
                        buffoon of a man! I know I said 
                        we’d make money even if it was shit 
                        but... Christ, what shit it is.

                                 STEVE
                        Dino, I-- You really don’t think 
                        people liked it? Because I think 
                        it’s a fun ride, the music is 
                        great, it’s--

                                 DINO
                        Where’s your wife, Steve?! Where’s 
                        your family? Why aren’t they here? 
                        Answer me that question, then I’ll 
                        listen to your opinions. Until then-

           He SPITS on the ground.

                                 DINO (CONT’D)
                        Good day to you.

           He marches off.

           REPORTERS begin snapping pictures-- flashbulbs illuminating 
           Steve’s forlorn look.

           INSERT - A TV SCREEN

           TWO ENTERTAINMENT REPORTERS, JANET AND CHETT, look to camera.

                                 CHETT
                        ...the toddler has been 
                        successfully apprehended. In other 
                        news, popular author Stephen King 
                        may be the Master of Terror, but 
                        the scariest thing this weekend was 
                        the box office for his new film.

                                 JANET
                        That’s right, Maximum Overdrive, 
                        the new comet killer truck Emilio 
                        Estevez film, opened to a mere 
                        three million dollars, and is 
                        unlikely to recoup its production 
                        budget. Speaking about the film, 
                        Leonard Maltin told me the movie, 
                        quote, raped him in his eyeholes, 
                        unquote.

                                 CHETT
                        That’s right, Janet, but that was 
                        supposed to be off the record.
           PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           This news report plays on a TV in a dingy bar. Steve sits 
           alone at the bar, watching the news with visible despair.

           The BARTENDER sets a pint glass in front of Steve and begins 
           to pour tequila into it. He fills it all the way up.

                                 BARTENDER
                        As requested, fifteen fingers of 
                        vodka.

                                 STEVE
                        Thanks.

           The Bartender walks away. Steve picks up the pint glass and 
           looks at it sadly.

           Then... He begins to chug. He keeps chugging. And soon it’s 
           all gone. Steve stays seated at the bar for about ten seconds-

           THEN JUMPS TO HIS FEET and sprints to the back door.

           EXT. BAR / BACK PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Steve stumbles through the back door into an empty lot behind 
           the bar. He leans towards the wall and--

           VOMITS.

           Panting, he stays bent over, hands on his knees.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (O.S.)
                        Not feeling too hot, huh, champ?

           Steve stands slowly and turns around.

           Jack Torrance, in all his grinning lunatic third act of The 
           Shining glory, stands before him.

                                 STEVE
                        What the fuck are you doing here?

           Jack grins a terrible grin, reaches behind him--

           And pulls out a beer. He holds it out to Steve.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Thought you could use a beer, ace.
           Cautiously, Steve takes the beer.

                                 STEVE
                        Is this one real?

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Come on, now, Steve. Is any of this 
                        real?

           Steve looks at the beer, cold vapor misting appetizingly 
           through the already-opened mouth of the bottle. He lifts it 
           to his lips.

           Then stops.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter?

                                 STEVE
                        I don’t know if I want it anymore.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        What do you mean?

                                 STEVE
                        I don’t want it anymore. I want to 
                        go home. I want to roll over in the 
                        middle of the night and put my arm 
                        around my wife. And have breakfast 
                        with my family. That’s all I should 
                        have fucking ever wanted.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        That’s fine, but let’s not do 
                        anything rash--

                                 STEVE
                        I DON’T WANT IT!

           Steve SMASHES THE BOTTLE on the wall behind him. Beer 
           explodes onto the wall. He holds the broken mouth of the 
           bottle in his hand.

           With his other hand he reaches into his coat. He pulls out a 
           flask and THROWS IT TO THE GROUND.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t want that!

           He pulls several joints out of his coat and throws them to 
           the ground.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t want those!
           He pulls out a bottle of pills and throws it to the ground.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t want those, either!

                                 CARRIE (O.S.)
                    (morose)
                        Why not?

           Steve WHIRLS AROUND and sees a girl in a blood-soaked prom 
           dress walking towards him. CARRIE (17), of course.

                                 CARRIE (CONT’D)
                        Why not? Are they bad? Are they bad 
                        like mama? Are they bad like my 
                        dirtypillows?

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        She has a point there, Steve. 
                        What’s so bad about all of it? 
                        After all, PAL, you created all of 
                        us with that shit -- do you regret 
                        creating us?

                                 STEVE
                        Of course not, I love all of you!

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        But you want us to disappear? 
                        Forever?

                                 STEVE
                        No. But there’s such a thing as 
                        over-indulgence.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        What a crazy thing to say.

           He pulls out another beer, holds it out to Steve.

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        Drink the beer, Freaky Stevey.

                                 STEVE
                        No.

                                 JACK TORRANCE
                        Well then. I guess I don’t have any 
                        other choice.

           Jack reaches behind him and produces A MASSIVE ROQUE MALLET 
           (the weapon he uses in the book The Shining, not the movie).
           He raises it into the air as if he’s gonna BRING IT DOWN ON 
           STEVE--

                                 JACK TORRANCE (CONT’D)
                        HERE’S JOHNNY!

                                 STEVE
                        That line’s from the movie, you son 
                        of a bitch!

           Steve lashes out with the broken neck of his beer bottle--

           AND SLASHES JACK’S THROAT.

           A garish slit appears in Jack’s neck as BLOOD SQUIRTS ALL 
           OVER STEVE’S FACE.

           Jack grabs at his throat -- then collapses dead to the 
           ground.

           Steve breathes heavily in disbelief. Suddenly, his breath 
           catches in his throat. His eyes BULGE. He starts to TURN 
           BLUE.

           Steve turns and sees Carrie staring at him, one hand raised-- 
           she’s using her telekinetic powers.

           Steve reaches into his waistband, PULLS OUT A GUN, and shoots 
           Carrie in the forehead.

           Her blood exits her head in a thick ropey spatter.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I killed you the first 
                        time, YOU CUNT!

                                 ANNIE WILKES (O.S.)
                        Hey now! Where did you get a gun? 

           Steve turns to see ANNIE WILKES coming towards him, an axe in 
           her hand.

                                 ANNIE WILKES (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t have a gun before! 
                        That’s cheating, you got that gun 
                        from COCKADOODIE NOWHERE! You--

                                 STEVE
                        You got a thing for writers? Get a 
                        load of me!

           He SHOOTS-- but the gun clicks empty. Annie LAUGHS and swings 
           her axe. 
           Panicked, Steve brings his hand up and GRABS the handle, 
           stopping its descent.

           Steve wrestles the axe from her hands, swings, and BURIES the 
           axe in her neck. 

           Blood. Sprays. Everywhere. Steve is coated head to toe.

           Annie FALLS DEAD, her body landing on top of Carrie’s body.

           Out of nowhere, Steve’s shirt CATCHES FIRE. 

           He screams, RIPS HIS FLAMING SHIRT OFF (revealing an 
           unappealing rug of chest hair), and turns to see CHARLIE 
           MCGEE (8), the little girl from Firestarter, pointing at him.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        What, you think I’ve never written 
                        a child’s death before?!

           Steve runs at Charlie, JUMPS, and kicks her straight in the 
           face. She falls to the ground.

           A CAR REVS offscreen.

           Steve turns to see a driverless white and red 1958 PLYMOUTH 
           FURY rolling towards him.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        CHRISTINE!

           Christine accelerates.

           Steve turns and RUNS AWAY across the parking lot. He reaches 
           the edge of the parking lot and disappears into A TALL 
           THICKET OF REEDS.

           EXT. CREEK BED - CONTINUOUS

           Steve runs through thick reeds, batting them out of his way.

           BEHIND HIM, Christine PLOWS into the reeds, her headlights 
           illuminating the night as she searches for Steve.

           Steve comes up against the edge of a creek -- not very wide, 
           but too wide to jump across.

           Christine BURSTS out of the reeds and speeds towards Steve. 
           Steve JUMPS out of the way--

           And Christine SMASHES nose first into the creek. Her engine 
           SPUTTERS and shuts off.
           Steve stumbles away from the car.

           LOUD FRANTIC BARKING sounds nearby. Steve whirls around to 
           see--

           A MASSIVE SAINT BERNARD barreling towards him. CUJO.

                                 STEVE
                        Cujo! Wait! Good dog! Fuck!

           Steve turns and runs.

           Steve barrels through the reeds, running along the edge of 
           the creek, looking back over shoulder as Cujo gains on him.

           The chase continues, frantic.

           Cujo is fifteen feet behind.

           Ten feet.

           Five.

           IT’S HOPELESS.

           Steve digs into his pants pocket, pulls out a MASSIVE BOWIE 
           KNIFE, and whirls around. CUJO LEAPS. Steve swings the knife 
           up and BURIES IT IN CUJO’S CHEST.

           Cujo’s weight PLOWS into Steve. The two of them fall back--

           And SPLASH into the shallow creek.

           Cujo pants heavily, then dies on top of Steve. Steve tries to 
           shove him off. He can’t do it. Too weak.

           Splish. Splish. Splosh. Footsteps coming towards him. Steve 
           looks up to see THE MAN IN BLACK pacing towards him. He comes 
           to a stop standing over Steve, leering down.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Alright. You got me. You gonna kill 
                        me?

                                 THE MAN IN BLACK
                    (Considers. Then--)
                        Nah. You got more living to do. But 
                        remember. I always come back.

           He taps his head. Then turns and walks away.

           Steve slumps back, his body in the water, his head resting on 
           the opposite bank--
           And falls asleep.

           EXT. CREEK - MORNING

           Steve, still asleep, moans and rolls from side to side. His 
           eyes twitch. Suddenly, HE JOLTS AWAKE--

           And sees that his shirtless torso is submerged in the creek.

           Shockingly, there are no Plymouth Furies or Saint Bernards 
           anywhere to be seen.

           Steve looks at his hand -- and sees a mostly empty bottle of 
           Scotch. One swallow left. He lifts the bottle to his mouth--

           Then DROPS IT INTO THE CREEK instead. 

           He watches as it floats 

           they all float down here

           away down the creek.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Steve walks towards his car. He picks his discarded shirt up 
           off the ground and RINGS water out of it.

           EXT. BANGOR, MAINE - LATER

           Steve cruises through Maine. Looking around. He passes liquor 
           shops, the high school, Dan’s office, other familiar sights. 
           A sad smile on his face.

           EXT. KING HOME - LATER

           Steve parks. He takes a deep breath, exits his car, and walks 
           up to the front door.

           INT. KING HOME / KITCHEN - SAME

           Tabby sits at the kitchen table, reading a newspaper, when  
           she hears A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

           She gets up, opens the door, and sees Steve standing there. 
           Tabby SIGHS. And swings the door shut. Steve reaches out a 
           hand to stop it.
                                 STEVE
                        No, wait!

           Tabby reopens the door.

                                 TABBY
                        What?

           He hesitates. He doesn’t know what to say. Hasn’t thought 
           this far ahead.

                                 STEVE
                        My movie tanked.

                                 TABBY
                        I know. I saw it. 

                                 STEVE
                        What’d you think?

                                 TABBY
                        It was a piece of shit.

                                 STEVE
                        Really?

                                 TABBY
                        ...No. I enjoyed it. I liked the 
                        part when the kid got run over by 
                        the steamroller.

                                 STEVE
                        It was actually an industrial 
                        street cleaner. But that’s beside 
                        the point.
                    (beat)
                        I tried, Tabby. I really tried to 
                        make it great.

                                 TABBY
                        You think you might know where you 
                        went wrong?

           Steve looks at her sadly.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.

           Tabby looks at his dripping clothes.

                                 TABBY
                        You’re soaking wet.
                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. I spent the night in a creek 
                        with a bottle of Scotch in my hand.

           Tabby SIGHS AGAIN, swings the door shut. AGAIN, he stops it.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m done!

           She reopens the door.

                                 TABBY
                        What?

                                 STEVE
                        I’m done. Tabby, I’m done. I want 
                        to come home.

                                 TABBY
                        You’ve only been sober for, what, 
                        six hours?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah.

                                 TABBY
                        That’s hardly a solid sobriety.

                                 STEVE
                        I know. But I’m done. I stabbed 
                        Cujo.

                                 TABBY
                        Do I even want to know what that 
                        means?

                                 STEVE
                        I doubt it.

           Tabby looks past his large glasses to his eyes.

                                 TABBY
                        You’re done.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m done.

                                 TABBY
                        You’re done?

                                 STEVE
                        I’m done. And we’re gonna fix all 
                        of it. You and me. We’ll deal with 
                        the lawsuit. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVE (CONT'D)
                        We’ll get this marriage back up on 
                        its fucking feet, Tabby. It’s not 
                        over. I’m done with the drugs. But 
                        I’m not done with you.

                                 TABBY
                        Then I guess you’d better come in.

           She opens the door wider. Steve comes in.

           INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Tabby stands in the middle of the office with a trash bag.

           Steve opens a desk drawer, pulls out a bottle of bourbon, 
           drops it in the trash bag.

           Steve reaches under the desk, pulls out one of those 
           dispensary canisters of weed that has been velcroed to the 
           underside of the desk, and drops it in the trash.

           INT. FAMILY ROOM - LATER

           Joe sits on the couch. Steve enters.

                                 STEVE
                        What’s on TV?

                                 JOE
                        Jaws 2. I guess you can watch with 
                        me. If you want.

                                 STEVE
                        I’d love to, buddy, but I’m 
                        actually busy with a project.

                                 JOE
                        Of course you are.

           Steve pulls out the manuscript of Joe’s short story. The 
           pages are covered in notes.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s this short story of yours. I 
                        was looking through it, and I 
                        thought you might want some, I 
                        don’t know, friendly feedback?

           Joe tries to suppress a smile-- and can’t quite do it. He 
           wordlessly slides over on the couch. Steve sits beside him. 
           They turn to the first page of the story.
           INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Steve enters his office and shuts the door.

           It’s quiet, being alone.

           Steve walks to his desk and sits down in front of the 
           typewriter. 

           He opens a drawer, looks inside. One page of manuscript is on 
           top. A page from The Shining. The name “JACK TORRANCE” stands 
           out to him. Steve looks around the room. No Jack around. 
           Steve smiles.

           He slots a piece of paper into the typewriter. And begins to 
           type. The words come slowly at first, then faster and faster.

           INSERT -- THE FIRST PAGE -- “It. By Stephen King.”

           INSERT -- THE NEXT PAGE -- “Chapter One. After the Flood. 1. 
           The terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight 
           years - if it ever did end - began, so far as I know or can 
           tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspaper floating 
           down a gutter swollen with rain.”

           Steve types with renewed vigor. As he types, a tear forms in 
           his eye and rolls down his cheek. He wipes it away and 
           continues typing.

           INT. BANGOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

           Steve stands in front of a small podium. A SMALL CROWD OF 
           EAGER FANS sits in folding chairs. Steve’s family front and 
           center.

           Several manuscript pages are spread in front of Steve. He 
           READS ALOUD from them.

                                 STEVE
                        ‘They float,’ it growled, ‘they 
                        float, Georgie, and when you’re 
                        down here with me, you’ll float, 
                        too.‘ George’s shoulder socked 
                        against the cement of the curb and 
                        Dave Gardener, who had stayed home 
                        from his job at The Shoeboat that 
                        day because of the flood, saw only 
                        a small boy in a yellow rain 
                        slicker, a small boy who was 
                        screaming and writhing in the 
                        gutter with muddy water surfing 
                        over his face and making his 
                        screams sound bubbly.
           Tabby smiles up at Steve from the front row.

           EXT. BANGOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - SUNSET

           Steve and Tabby walk to their car parked behind the library.

                                 TABBY
                        Well I think that went really well.

                                 STEVE
                        I think so too. I think they’re 
                        really gonna like it.
                    (beat)
                        Hey Tabby? 

                                 TABBY
                        Yeah?

                                 STEVE
                        You mind waiting here for a second? 
                        I’d like a second to myself.

           She hesitates.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Not myself and drugs. Just myself.

                                 TABBY
                        I’m sorry. I guess we’re still 
                        getting the trust back. Go on, 
                        honey.

           Steve walks to the driver’s seat of the car.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)
                        You’re taking the car?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes, my love, but I shall return 
                        for you.

           He blows her a kiss.

           EXT. BANGOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - SUNSET

           The sun is beginning to set on the horizon. The sky is just 
           starting to look ridiculously beautiful... Or it would be if 
           not for some clouds in the sky.

           An access ladder extends up the side of the library.
           Steve’s car ZOOMS INTO FRAME and parks below the ladder. 
           Steve gets out. Clambers onto the roof of his car. Grabs onto 
           the ladder. Begins to climb.

           EXT. BANGOR PUBLIC LIBRARY / ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Steve walks to the edge of the roof of the library and looks 
           out at the sunset.

           It’s a pretty decent sunset. But there are some clouds 
           blocking the spots that should be really awesome.

           This sunset, it shines a glow over the miles and miles of 
           Bangor, Maine. It’s beautiful. But as beautiful as it should 
           be? Hard to say. 

           Hard to know, if there’s uncertainty in heart of the person 
           looking.

           Stephen King looks out at this half-spectacular, half-shitty 
           sunset for a long, long, long, long time.

                                        CUT TO BLACK.

                            THE END
