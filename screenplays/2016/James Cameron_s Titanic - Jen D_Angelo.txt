           INT. BEAUTIFUL SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY - 1996

           REBECCA, a beautiful middle-aged woman who will be played by 
           an actress that James Cameron will divorce his wife for and 
           marry (if past patterns are to be believed), gets ready for a 
           formal event. She walks into the living room.

                                 REBECCA
                        Hey, Mom? Roger and I have that 
                        benefit tonight, and I wanted to 
                        wear your diamond necklace. Have 
                        you seen it?

           OLD MARY, who is VERY old, like maybe the oldest lady we’ve 
           ever seen on screen?, is lost in thought, staring out the 
           window at a beautiful sunset. She looks over.

                                 OLD MARY
                        Titanic was the ship of dreams --

           Rebecca sighs, having heard this story 10,000 times before. 
           Dementia is hard and it affects everyone. She sits down to 
           listen, already bored. 

           EXT. SOUTHAMPTON STREET - 1912 - DAY

           A very crowded city street in 1912. 

                                 OLD MARY (V.O.)
                        -- just not my dreams. 

           We find YOUNG, HOT MARY (17) in the crowd. She’s sullen, 
           pissed. A total teen. She follows her mother, MARGARET (38), 
           a poor, overly-protective, Irish widow. Margaret politely 
           squeezes through the crowd. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Pardon me, pardon --

           Margaret turns back to Mary.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Keep holding my wrist, Mary, I 
                        don’t want us to get separated -- 
                        where’s your brother?

           Margaret stops dead in her tracks. Mary shrugs.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        And where’s Aunt Patty?! This is 
                        precisely the reason I wanted us to 
                        all wear one big belt, so we 
                        wouldn’t get lost! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        They can’t be far, calm down. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Calm down? My son is lost in a 
                        city! A city! Do you know what kind 
                        of filth lives in cities?!

                                 NEARBY CITY MAN
                        Oi! I take offense to that! 

           This man is covered in blood.

           Margaret pushes against the flow of the crowd, frantically 
           searching for her son like a real Julianne Moore. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Timothy! TIMOTHY!

                                 PATTY (O.S.)
                        I got him!

           PATTY (30s), an often-drunk, one-woman party, appears. She’s 
           holding TIM (10, wishes he were older), up like Simba.

                                 TIM
                        Put me down! I’m not a baby!  

                                 PATTY
                        Can’t do that, Tim. You keep 
                        wandering off. 

           Patty throws Tim over her shoulder and pushes through the 
           crowd to catch up to Margaret and Mary. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry! He stopped walking and I 
                        lost him in the crowd.

                                 TIM
                        I saw a man murdering someone in an 
                        alley! 

           Margaret gasps, horrified.

                                 PATTY
                        He didn’t see a murder.
                             (whispers)
                        They were fucking.

                                 MARGARET
                        Ugh! Come on, we’re late, we have 
                        to hurry. But stay close.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Margaret pushes through the crowd, her family close behind. 
           They make their way towards:

           THE TITANIC

           It’s big. It’s beautiful. It’s the most expensive 
           establishing shot of all time. 

           EXT. DOCK - LICE INSPECTION STATION - DAY

           The family is in line for STEERAGE BOARDING with a bunch of 
           people who look like they are constantly surrounded by flies. 
           Patty open-mouth stares at the Titanic like a Big Mouth Bass. 

                                 PATTY
                        Look at this thing. It’s as high as 
                        a fucking mountain.

                                 MARGARET
                        Patty! Watch your language.

                                 PATTY
                        Sorry Mum.

                                 MARGARET
                        I am a mother. So it doesn’t hurt 
                        my feelings when you call me that.

                                 PATTY
                        I’m not calling you a mother, I’m 
                        calling you our mother, and she was 
                        a shitpile.

           There’s a COMMOTION at the front of the line. Margaret and 
           Patty crane their necks to see a BEARDED MAN getting pushed 
           back down the gangplank, away from the ship. 

                                 TIM
                        What’s happening? 

                                 PATTY
                        People are yelling and shoving. 
                        Looks like we’re starting a riot! 

           Patty, excitedly laughing, shoves a NICE GRANDPA. She turns, 
           about to punch a WOMAN, but Margaret grabs her fist. 

                                 MARGARET
                        We are not starting a riot!

                                 PATTY
                        We’re not?
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Patty checks in with surrounding people, who are shaking 
           their heads, very frightened. Patty holds up her hands.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        My mistake.

           Tim climbs onto his suitcase to see what’s happening.

                                 TIM
                        Why aren’t they letting that man 
                        get on? 

                                 MARGARET
                        They’re checking for lice, he must 
                        not have passed the inspection. 

                                 MARY
                             (muttering)
                        I wish I had lice. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What did you just say?

                                 MARY
                        I said I WISH I HAD LICE! 

                                 MARGARET
                        What is the matter with you? There 
                        are people in this world who would 
                        kill for a ticket aboard the 
                        Titanic, you know. 

                                 BLOOD COVERED MAN
                        I did!

           REVEAL: The blood-covered man is right behind them. He 
           excitedly holds up his ticket. Margaret ushers her family 
           further away from him. 

                                 MARY
                        I don’t care, I’d rather stay home. 
                        I don’t want to go on vacation -- 

                                 PATTY
                        Vacation? What are --

           Margaret shoots Patty a POINTED LOOK.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Why are you looking at me like 
                        that? You look like you want me to 
                        stop talking. Do you want me to 
                        stop talking? I was just going to 
                        ask what she meant by “vacation” --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        She means that we’re going on 
                        vacation, it’s a fun trip to New 
                        York and back.

                                 MARY
                        It’s not a fun trip, it’s a stupid 
                        trip. I don’t want to go! You’re 
                        making me miss the Potato Festival! 
                        Why can’t I just stay home?! 

                                 MARGARET
                        Because life isn’t about what you 
                        want, it’s about what you get. And 
                        you are getting on this ship.

           Mary lets out a FRUSTRATED SCREAM and kicks her suitcase in a 
           fit of rage. Her suitcase goes STRAIGHT into the face of a 
           nearby child, who instantly bursts into tears.

                                 MARY
                        Ohhhhh I’m so sorry I’m so sorry --

           The CRYING CHILD’S PARENTS comfort the child and glare at 
           Mary, speaking rapidly in ITALIAN.

           Mary smiles apologetically. She catches Margaret looking at 
           her and immediately scowls again. Patty sees Mary’s scowl.

                                 PATTY
                        Aw, cheer up, Mary. It’s six days 
                        on a boat. What’s the worst that 
                        could happen?

           A QUICK FLASH OF PEOPLE SCREAMING IN A DARK OCEAN WHILE THE 
           TITANIC SINKS BENEATH THEM.

           INT. TITANIC - STEERAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           Margaret, Patty, Mary, and Tim make their way through a 
           crowded steerage hallway. Margaret scans the room numbers 
           along the hallway, then stops.

                                 MARGARET
                        Here we are.

           She opens the door to:
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. STEERAGE CABIN - DAY

           A tiny cabin with three bunkbeds crammed along the walls. On 
           one of the bunkbeds are TONY and RICO CICCOTI, two gruff 
           Italian twins that look like Tom Hardy(s) from LEGEND.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh. Um. Hello.

           Rico and Tony stare back. Rico’s spiral-peeling an apple with 
           a knife like a psycho. 

                                 MARY
                        Who are they?

           Patty pushes past Mary to get into the room.

                                 PATTY
                        They’re your Aunt Patty’s new best 
                        friends. 

           She leans against their bunkbed seductively.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Hi. Name’s Patty. Which of you 
                        wants to go first?
                             (re: Rico’s apple)
                        You look busy, top bunk. I’ll start 
                        with Mr. Bottom. 

           She starts to crawl into Tony’s bottom bunk.

                                 TONY
                        So predendo un pisolino!

           Tony yanks his sheet out from under Patty and pulls it over 
           himself as he rolls to face the wall. He’s sleepy!

                                 PATTY
                        Good idea. Get some rest.
                             (whispers in his ear)
                        You’ll need it.

           Mary curls up on one of the beds and buries herself in a 
           book. Tim puts his suitcase down on the other bunkbed.

                                 MARGARET
                        No, Patty and I will take this one. 

           Margaret moves Tim’s suitcase to Mary’s bunkbed, the one not 
           adjacent to Rico and Tony.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        You two stay as far away from these 
                        strange men as possible.

                                 MARY
                        You can’t get far away from 
                        anything in this cupboard.

                                 TIM
                        I thought this ship was fancy, 
                        shouldn’t we have our own rooms?

                                 MARY
                        It’s fancy for the rich people. 
                        We’re poor, so we travel like dogs.

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re lucky to travel at all. 

           Mary rolls her eyes. The SHIP’S ENGINES start up. They hear a 
           MECHANICAL WHIR. Tim runs for the door.

                                 TIM
                        They turned on the engines! We’re 
                        going to push off the dock!

           Tim runs for the door. Margaret stops him. 

                                 MARGARET
                        We’ll all go have a look together. 
                        Take my hand. We don’t want anyone 
                        getting lost. Come on, Mary.

           Mary, very sullen and annoyed, closes her book with a big 
           harumph and follows Margaret and Tim out the door.

                                 MARY
                        It’s a boat. How lost can we get?

           As Patty follows Mary out, she turns back to glimpse the 
           sleeping Tony and scary apple-carving Rico.

                                 PATTY
                        I’ll fuck both of you before we 
                        reach New York. I promise you that.

           Rico stares at her, confused. Patty winks. 

           EXT. TITANIC - STEERAGE DECK

           Crowds of steerage people are gathered at the railing, waving 
           to people on the dock. Tim pulls Margaret through the crowd. 
           Mary and Patty are behind them.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 TIM
                        BYE! BYE IRELAND! 

                                 MARY
                        We already left Ireland, you idiot. 
                        That’s England. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t call your brother an idiot.

                                 MARY
                        We left home days ago, traveled all 
                        the way through England, and he’s 
                        sitting here saying bye to Ireland.

                                 MARGARET
                        Doesn’t mean he’s stupid.

                                 MARY
                        Tim. I’ll give you a pound if you 
                        can tell me the name of that city.

           Tim stops waving, and thinks for a long time.

                                 TIM
                        Hand... ver... chandles?

           Tim smiles, incredibly smug, thinking he very successfully 
           made up a city name. Mary looks to Margaret. See? He’s dumb. 

                                 MARY
                        I’m going back to the cabin.

                                 MARGARET
                        Not without us. You can’t be in 
                        there alone with those men. They 
                        look like murderers.  

                                 MARY
                        Do I have to be glued to your side 
                        for this entire trip? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course you do. This is the first 
                        time you’ve ever left Kilgarney. 
                        You don’t know what the world is 
                        like -- 

                                 MARY
                        Neither do you.

                                 MARGARET
                        -- so we have to stick together and 
                        keep each other safe.

                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Which means you’re staying right 
                        here. Now wave goodbye to Ireland!

                                 MARY
                        England!

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s what I meant!

           Mary groans and turns back to the dock, pouting. Margaret 
           stands behind her, fuming. Patty sidles up next to her.

                                 PATTY
                        Why do the children think we’re 
                        going on a vacation?   

                                 MARGARET
                        It was hard enough to get Mary to 
                        leave home even with her thinking 
                        she’d be coming back. She would 
                        have thrown herself down a well if 
                        she knew we were leaving for good.

                                 PATTY
                        Isn’t there a bit in your precious 
                        book about thou shalt not lie? 

                                 MARGARET
                        It says don’t lie to your parents, 
                        it doesn’t say anything about lying 
                        to your children. I will tell them 
                        the truth, when the time is right. 
                        But please, don’t blurt it out.

                                 PATTY
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 MARGARET
                        You are awful at keeping secrets.

                                 PATTY
                        I’m great at keeping secrets! You 
                        never found out about the time Tim 
                        and I kidnapped a cow so we could 
                        make free butter. Oh shit, I just 
                        told you, didn’t I. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You’ve actually told me about that 
                        several times. Please. I’m trusting 
                        you. Do not tell the children.

                                 PATTY
                        I won’t. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Margaret looks to her children -- her face is full of worry. 
           She has no idea if she’s doing the right thing. 

           The ship lurches, and everyone cheers. Except for Mary, who 
           is scowling. But then... 

           Through the crowd, she sees PATRICK, teen heartthrob. He’s 
           standing on the railing, which is dangerous and rude, but it 
           looks very cool. Also, he’s glistening in the sun. 

           Mary gapes at him. He is the hottest boy she has ever seen 
           and OMG HE’S LOOKING RIGHT AT HER OMG OMG. 

           Mary quickly looks away. Then slowly glances back -- OMG HE’S 
           SMILING AT HER OMG!!! THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MARY’S LIFE. 
           Margaret appears right in front of her.

                                 MARGARET
                        Alright. Time to get some dinner 
                        and then off to bed. Let’s go.

           Mary cranes her neck to look over Margaret’s shoulder, but 
           Patrick is gone. Mary sullenly follows her family inside. 

           INT. STEERAGE CABIN - NIGHT

           Tim climbs into bed on the top bunk. Margaret tucks him in.

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you say your prayers?

           Tim, a bit begrudgingly, clasps his hands together.

                                 TIM
                             (super fast)
                        Ourfatherwhoartinheavenhallowedbe 
                        thynamethykingdomcome --

           Margaret glances at Rico and Tony, who are now both carving 
           apples with knives??? Margaret quickly looks away.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        -- foreverandever amen.

           Margaret smiles and leans to kiss his forehead. Tim dodges.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Not in front of the murderers. I 
                        don’t want them thinking I’m some 
                        baby. They need to know I’m a man.

           Margaret floats a sad little smile. As she turns to go --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        But can you tuck my sheets in so 
                        the demons under the bed can’t 
                        steal my feet while I’m sleeping?

           Margaret obliges. Patty and Mary come into the room. 

                                 PATTY
                        The bathroom is full of people 
                        vomiting. I don’t think man is 
                        meant to be at sea. 

           Mary climbs into her bed, scowling.

                                 MARGARET
                        Goodnight Mary. 

           Mary, making a big show of her angst, gets in bed as noisily 
           as possible. After several beats of sighing, groaning, and 
           pillow-punching:

                                 MARY
                        GOODNIGHT.

           She flips to face the wall and pulls a blanket over her head. 

           Margaret pulls Patty aside.

                                 MARGARET
                        I think one of us should be awake 
                        at all times in case those 
                        murderers try to steal anything.
                        I’ll do the first watch.

                                 PATTY
                        Fine. But if you’re asking me to 
                        stay up all night to watch them, 
                        you can’t get mad if I fuck them.

                                 MARGARET
                        How can you speak like that right 
                        in front of the children?

                                 PATTY
                        They’re asleep.

                                 MARY/TIM
                        No we’re not.

                                 MARGARET
                        Do not fornicate while my children 
                        are in the room.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        Oh alright. Wake me for my shift.

           Patty rolls over and goes to sleep. Margaret looks back over 
           at Rico and Tony. In perfect unison while still staring at 
           her, they stab their knives into the walls and cuddle up in 
           their beds to go to sleep.

           INT. STEERAGE CABIN - NIGHT - LATER

           All is quiet and still. Including Margaret, who fell asleep 
           sitting up. The DOOR OPENS. Margaret JUMPS awake and sees:

           A SHADOWY, OMINOUS FIGURE STANDING IN THE DOOR. 

           Margaret SCREAMS. Patty and Tim JOLT AWAKE.

                                 TIM
                        I’ll protect you, mother! 

           Tim LEAPS ONTO THE SHADOWY FIGURE. Patty turns on the lights, 
           revealing that the figure is TONY.

                                 MARGARET
                        TIM! GET AWAY FROM THE MURDERER!  

                                 TIM
                        He’s no match for me! 

           Tony hooks Tim under his arms and puts him back on his bed. 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Stop, that tickles.

           Tony, angrily gesticulating and yelling, gets back in bed.

                                 PATTY
                        Well, he certainly won’t be going 
                        to the bathroom in the night again. 
                        Which is gonna wreck his bladder. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry, I -- I got scared.

                                 TIM
                        They’re the ones who should be 
                        scared! Did you see me jump on him? 
                        I had my hands around his neck! Did 
                        you see it, Mary?!

           Tim leans over to look at Mary’s bed. Which is EMPTY. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           We VERTIGO ZOOM in on MARGARET’S HORRIFIED FACE. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Margaret sprints down a hallway in her nightgown.

                                 MARGARET
                        MY DAUGHTER’S BEEN KIDNAPPED! 
                        SOMEBODY HELP! MY DAUGHTER’S BEEN 
                        KIDNAPPED! 

           She stops, unable to find anybody. But then she hears PEOPLE 
           TALKING. She runs towards the noise and into:

           INT. STEERAGE MESS HALL - NIGHT

           Groups of drunken steerage people sit at tables. It’s fairly 
           crowded. Margaret runs up to a table and grabs a DRUNK MAN.

                                 MARGARET
                        Help! Please, my daughter’s been 
                        kidnapped! 

           The DRUNK MAN stares at her for a beat, then tries to kiss 
           her. Margaret shoves him, he falls into ANOTHER GUY. The 
           Drunk Man stares at the guy for a beat. They make out. 

           Margaret turns to another TABLE OF DRUNKS.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Please! Help! My daughter’s been 
                        kidnapped! I need to find her! I 
                        need to find my --

           Margaret spots, across the room:

           MARY. 

           Sitting with COOL TEENS. One of whom HANDS MARY A BEER.

           WE VERTIGO ZOOM IN ON MARGARET’S HORRIFIED FACE. 

           IN SLOW MOTION, MARY LIFTS A PINT OF BEER TO HER LIPS.

           MARGARET RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM, GRABS THE PINT FROM MARY --

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        NO!

           -- AND THROWS IT AT THE WALL, SHATTERING THE GLASS.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Other drunks see the pint shatter and think it looks fun, so 
           they happily start throwing their pints at the wall too.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

                                 MARY
                        Do not embarrass me.

           Patrick, who is next to Mary, leans in. He looks at Margaret.

                                 PATRICK
                        Who’s this? 

                                 MARGARET
                        I am her mother!

           AINSLEY (17), too cool, is next to Mary.

                                 AINSLEY
                        All the mothers are drinking over 
                        there.

           She points to a table of TIRED WOMEN. They’re drinking white 
           wine, rubbing their temples, thinking about bed.

                                 TIRED MOM
                             (head in her hands)
                        My son won’t stop biting me.

           Ainsley smiles at Margaret. 

                                 AINSLEY
                        Have fun.

                                 MARGARET
                        There’s been enough fun tonight!

           Margaret grabs Mary’s arm and pulls her towards the door.

                                 MARY
                        Let me go!

           Mary tries to wrestle her arm away but can’t.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Since when are you this strong?!

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s the power of rage!

           INT. STEERAGE CABIN - NIGHT

           Patty sits with Tim on his bed.

                                 PATTY
                        Now for maximum pain, you want to 
                        punch low, so you get more oomph 
                        behind it. Watch.

           Patty low-punches the wall. It hurts A LOT. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        FUCK this wall is strong.

           Margaret drags Mary back into the cabin. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Apologize to Tim and Aunt Patty for 
                        worrying them!

                                 TIM
                        We weren’t worried.

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah I figured she just snuck out 
                        and would eventually turn up.

                                 MARGARET
                        Well... then... apologize to the 
                        murderers for waking them!

           Margaret points to Rico and Tony, who are sound asleep.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Alright! Well, then apologize to 
                        the Lord for -- 

                                 MARY
                        OH JUST SHUT UP! 

           THE LIMPEST, QUICKEST VERTIGO ZOOM ON MARGARET’S STUNG FACE.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I just met a boy who could very 
                        well be the love of my life and you 
                        humiliated me in front of him!

                                 MARGARET
                        Are you talking about that skinny 
                        creep who was sitting next to you?

                                 MARY
                        Patrick is not a skinny creep! He’s 
                        free and adventurous! 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        He’s traveled the world and he said 
                        I have the prettiest eyes he’s ever 
                        seen! 

                                 MARGARET
                        Trust me, Mary, that boy is not the 
                        love of your life.

                                 MARY
                        You don’t even know him! God! Why 
                        can’t you just leave me alone?! 

                                 MARGARET
                        Because you’re my daughter --

                                 MARY
                        I don’t care! I HATE YOU!  

           Mary, angrily crying, buries her face in her pillow.

           Margaret stands there, stunned. She blinks back some tears, 
           too proud to cry in front of anyone. Just like Emma Thompson 
           in Love Actually. So brave.

                                 MARGARET
                        I... I need the washroom. 

           Margaret hurries out into the hallway.

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Margaret closes the cabin door behind her, collapses against 
           the wall, and cries. Patty comes out and sits next to her.

                                 PATTY
                        She didn’t mean that.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes she did.

           Margaret cries. Patty wraps an arm around her.

                                 PATTY
                        Want some advice?

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m not going to fornicate with 
                        anyone.

           Patty doesn’t know what to say. That was her advice.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t understand, the world 
                        is dangerous. Especially for girls 
                        who are poor and pretty. There’s 
                        evil men who will trick her into 
                        selling her teeth. Or worse! 

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah, but part of becoming a woman 
                        is figuring out who the evil men 
                        are and then learning how to punch 
                        them in the face without hurting 
                        your hand. I can teach her. 

           Patty holds up her hand, which is BRUISED AND BATTERED.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Oh right, I punched a wall. But as 
                        soon as it heals, I’ll teach her.

                                 MARGARET
                        If she hates me this much now, 
                        she’ll never forgive me when she 
                        finds out we’re not going home.

                                 PATTY
                        Just try to make New York sound 
                        exciting. You know, like, “hey 
                        kids, remember your Uncle Sean? 
                        How’d you like to live in his house 
                        and work in his shoe factory?” 

           Margaret looks at Patty. That sounds awful. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. Just saying it out 
                        loud made me want to kill myself.

                                 MARGARET
                        What if this is all a mistake?

                                 PATTY
                        It’s not a mistake. You’re a 
                        widowed mother and you’re poor as a 
                        pig. America’s your only shot. 

                                 MARGARET
                        How do I tell the children? 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        Just do what I do whenever I have 
                        bad news to deliver -- get the 
                        person really drunk, tell them the 
                        bad news right before they pass 
                        out, and then run away and never 
                        see them again.

           Margaret looks at Patty. Is that really her suggestion?

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Okay so you can’t get your kids 
                        drunk. But you can make them happy! 
                        Have so much fun with the kids that 
                        they get all excited about being 
                        out in the world, and then tell 
                        them they’re never going to see 
                        their home again! They might not 
                        even care! 

                                 MARGARET
                        I... I don’t know how to have fun. 

                                 PATTY
                        It’s easy. You just have to stop 
                        being such a nagging shrew.

           Margaret wipes her eyes, thinking. Then nods. 

           INT. BEAUTIFUL SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY - 1996

           Old Mary sits in her chair, smiling nicely.

                                 OLD MARY
                        Something changed in mother after 
                        our first night on the Titanic, 
                        after she saw me with Patrick. 

           Rebecca is across the room, on the phone, not listening.

                                 REBECCA
                        I can’t just leave her in the 
                        middle of a story, it’s rude. I’ll 
                        have to meet you there later.
                             (beat)
                        Well I’m not the one who said a 
                        nursing home was too expensive, 
                        Roger!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 OLD MARY
                        Suddenly, she wanted to be a fun 
                        mom. But her idea of fun left much 
                        to be desired...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TITANIC - STEERAGE DECK - DAY

           Margaret, Patty, Mary, and Tim sit on deck chairs. Mary 
           reads, not listening to anything. 

                                 MARGARET
                        -- and after a long day of honest 
                        work, you eat a big roast, and then 
                        the dishes wash themselves! 
                        Alright, Patty, your turn. What do 
                        you think Heaven is like?

           Margaret turns to Patty, who is sound asleep and snoring. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Patty?

                                 MARY
                        You bored her to sleep.

                                 TIM
                        Mother, is there any way to make 
                        money on this ship?

                                 MARGARET
                        What do you need money for?

                                 TIM
                        I want to be able to buy souvenirs 
                        in America that I can bring back 
                        for my friends.

           Margaret’s face goes white with guilt.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        And I’ll charge those idiots triple 
                        what I paid, make a ton of money, 
                        and buy us a castle. No! Four 
                        castles. We each get our own.  

                                 MARGARET
                        There’s no way to make money on the 
                        ship, Tim, I’m sorry --

           Over Tim’s shoulder, Margaret catches sight of PATRICK, who 
           has just walked out onto the deck. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           He’s squinting into the distance, lighting a cigarette, 
           looking like Scott Eastwood. He sees Mary and smiles at her. 
           Mary smiles back. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        You know what! I -- I just had a 
                        great idea! Mary, you’re going to 
                        love it. Come on, let’s go. 

           Margaret shakes Patty.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Patty, wake up. 

           PATTY JOLTS AWAKE, SCREAMING, AND BITES MARGARET’S HAND. Upon 
           seeing it’s Margaret, Patty immediately relaxes.

                                 PATTY
                        Sorry! I was having a nightmare. 
                        What are we doing?

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re going back to the cabin. 

           They all get up and head back to the cabin. Mary turns to 
           smile back at Patrick again. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Mary, come along.

           Mary, rolling her eyes, follows Tim and Patty. Margaret, with 
           one final glare at Patrick, follows Mary. 

           INT. STEERAGE CABIN - DAY

           Margaret, Mary, Patty, and Tim sit around on the floor. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I know how sad you were to miss the 
                        Potato Festival, so I brought the 
                        Potato Festival to us!

           Margaret excitedly pulls a potato from her pocket.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I took it from lunch. 

                                 TIM
                        What do we do with it?

           Margaret pauses. She had not thought this through.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        Well. Um. We can... we can all pass 
                        it around! And touch it!

           Margaret passes the potato to Mary, who doesn’t take it.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Yeah that’s no fun. Mary, what’s 
                        your favorite thing from the Potato 
                        Festival? We’ll do whatever it is.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t care about the stupid 
                        Potato Festival.

                                 MARGARET
                        But you were so sad when you found 
                        out you wouldn’t get to go.

                                 MARY
                        That was before I met Patrick.

           Margaret sighs. Not this again.

                                 MARGARET
                        You barely know this boy.

                                 MARY
                        Do you know why it’s called falling 
                        in love? Because it happens 
                        instantly. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Life is not like one of your 
                        romance novels -- 

                                 MARY
                        We locked eyes across a crowded 
                        deck and I knew. I knew that this 
                        was the beginning of the great love 
                        story I’ve dreamt of. He’s the one 
                        true love I’ve been waiting for.

                                 TIM
                        If Patrick is going to be a part of 
                        our family, does that mean I have 
                        to buy five castles? 

                                 MARY
                        No, stupid. He’ll live in my 
                        castle.

           Rico and Tony storm in, arguing and angrily gesticulating at 
           each other. It looks tense. Margaret jumps up. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        Okay, time to go! Quickly, before 
                        they murder each other!

           Margaret hurries Tim and Mary out of the room. Patty stands 
           next to the twins.

                                 PATTY
                        Boys, boys, why shove when you can 
                        shove?

           She does a single hump against Rico’s butt. But he and Tony 
           are too busy yelling and gesticulating at each other to 
           notice her. Patty throws up her hands -- no worries.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll leave you to your business. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STEERAGE MESS HALL - NIGHT

           Margaret, Patty, and Tim eat dinner. Mary is reading. 

                                 TIM
                        Ship Tin Orchestra?

           Margaret consults a piece of paper in her hand, and nods. 

                                 PATTY
                        I’m stumped.

                                 MARGARET
                        Mary, would you like to guess? 
                        Whose name can be rearranged to 
                        spell Ship Tin Orchestra?

                                 TIM
                        Captain Orchestra!

                                 MARGARET
                        No. Orchestra’s not in the name, 
                        you have to use the letters --

                                 MARY
                        It’s Saint Christopher.

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s right! You won, Mary! Now 
                        it’s your turn.

           Mary slams her book closed, annoyed. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        Alright. Whose name can be 
                        rearranged to spell “I’m Seventeen 
                        Years Old, I Should Be Allowed to 
                        Make My Own Decisions and Not Be 
                        Chained to My Mother For the Rest 
                        of My Life”? 

           Mary glares at Margaret. Margaret, owned, looks away.

                                 PATTY
                        Bloody hell. That’s all one name? 

           Patty exhales, thinking hard on this riddle.

           EXT. TITANIC - SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - DAY

           Margaret, Mary, Tim, and Patty are at the shuffleboard court.

                                 MARGARET
                        This looks fun, right?

                                 TIM
                        How do you play?

           Margaret consults the rules written on the wall.

                                 MARGARET
                        Alright, so... Mary, you go first. 
                        You push the disc, and try to get 
                        it in this triangle here. 

           Mary, with a truly amazing lack of effort, pushes the disc 
           barely an inch. What a sullen teen!

                                 MARY
                        How many points is that?

                                 TIM
                        My turn!

           Tim picks up his disc and HURLS it, but it also doesn’t go 
           far because he’s a weak little boy.

                                 MARGARET
                        No, you have to use the stick.

                                 PATTY
                        This game has too many rules. Swim 
                        to a Dolphin is a simple game.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           MICHAEL (cocky, stupid) and DANIEL (cocky, will die by 
           falling off the sinking ship and hitting the propeller on the 
           way down RIP) sidle up to the court. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Mind if we play the winners?

           Daniel approaches Margaret, who is still reading the rules.

                                 DANIEL
                        You in steerage?

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes.

                                 DANIEL
                        You should come to our party.

           From across the court, Mary’s ears perk up.

                                 MARY
                        Party?

                                 DANIEL
                        People’ve been drinking in the mess 
                        hall after dinner service, but we 
                        decided to make it a proper good 
                        time tonight. Will you come? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Thank you, but no. If you’ll excuse 
                        us, we’re playing a game.

           Margaret pushes the disc way too hard and way off course. The 
           disc goes under a railing and flies overboard. 

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           A beautiful dolphin swims alongside the Titanic. The 
           shuffleboard disc hits it in the head and it dies. Just like 
           Ashley Judd in Simon Birch!!! 

           EXT. TITANIC - SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel walks behind Margaret like a sleaze.

                                 DANIEL
                        Would you like me to teach you? 

                                 MARGARET
                        No, that’s alright! In fact, I 
                        think we’re done with shuffleboard. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        What? Why? I’m just now getting the 
                        hang of it.

           Patty tosses a disc in the air and swings at it with the 
           pole. She of course misses. Margaret pulls her aside. 

                                 MARGARET
                        These men are ogling us. We have to 
                        go. And also you’re not getting the 
                        hang of it, that’s very wrong.

           Margaret turns back to Daniel and Michael. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        The court’s all yours, we have to 
                        be going. Come along, Mary. Tim. 
                             (notices)
                        Where’s Tim? 

           Mary points over to Tim, who is further down the deck, 
           sitting with JACK DAWSON. Jack is showing Tim his nudie 
           drawings, like a total perv. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Timothy! Come on! We’re going!

           WITH TIM AND JACK:

           Tim looks to his mother, then turns back to Jack.

                                 TIM
                        I gotta go. My m -- wife is calling 
                        for me. She’s my wife because I’m 
                        an adult man.

           Tim holds his hand out to shake like a real business brah. 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for showing me your naked 
                        lady doodles. I don’t suppose I 
                        could have some to sell for money? 

                                 JACK DAWSON
                        Sorry man, I need these. 
                             (like it’s a secret)
                        I masturbate to them. 

           Tim nods, pretending to know what that means. 

                                 JACK DAWSON (CONT’D)
                        What do you need money for?
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 TIM
                        I want to be rich so that I can buy 
                        things for my family and my mother 
                        doesn’t have to be a wash woman for 
                        the rest of her life.

           Jack smiles. What a good kid.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        And so I can do whatever I want and 
                        if anyone gets mad I can slap them 
                        with a wad of money, like blap! 

           Tim mimes slapping someone across the face with money.

                                 JACK DAWSON
                        Alright, Tim, I don’t know if I 
                        should be telling you this. But. 
                        Have you seen the people up there? 
                        In First Class?

           Jack points up to the First Class deck, where fancy rich 
           people are milling around. 

                                 TIM
                        Those people who look like 
                        skeletons draped in velvet?

                                 JACK DAWSON
                        Yep. They’re the richest people in 
                        the world. And all of their stuff 
                        is in the cargo hold. Don’t you see 
                        what that means?

                                 TIM
                        ... they have a lot of stuff?

                                 JACK DAWSON
                        The cargo hold is full of treasure! 
                        And I bet they wouldn’t even notice 
                        if some of it went missing. 

           Tim’s eyes light up. Margaret comes over and grabs him.

                                 MARGARET
                        What did I tell you about talking 
                        to strangers?

           Margaret pulls Tim away. Tim waves to Jack.

                                 TIM
                        Bye Jack! I hope you live forever!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Jack smiles back, with a look that tells us he knows he’s 
           going to die. (It’s fun to watch TITANIC with the read that 
           Jack is a suicidal maniac who desperately wants to drown.)

           EXT. STEERAGE DECK - DAY

           The family sits down for dinner. Margaret and Patty eat. Mary 
           and Tim sit, arms folded, stern. Margaret eyes them. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What’s this? 

                                 MARY
                        We’re refusing to eat until you 
                        agree that we can go to the party.

                                 TIM
                        And we’re very hungry so please 
                        agree quickly.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh you don’t want to go to that 
                        mess. Look around. Do you know what 
                        these people do at parties? They 
                        get drunk and punch each other.

                                 PATTY
                        And it’s great.

           Margaret glares at Patty. 

                                 MARY
                        I promise I won’t drink any 
                        alcohol.

                                 PATTY
                        That sounds like a fair compromise. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Would you stay out of this?

                                 TIM
                        Mother, this is very serious. I 
                        need to go to the party so that I 
                        can ask Jack how to find the 
                        treasure in the cargo hold.

                                 MARGARET
                        You are not to speak to that man 
                        again. I don’t trust him, his 
                        fingernails are too clean.

           Mary and Tim groan, miserable. Margaret panics.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        How about, instead of going to the 
                        party, we have our own party in the 
                        cabin? We’ll guess each other’s 
                        favorite psalms, make sock puppets! 

                                 MARY
                        This is so UNFAIR!

           Mary pounds her fist on the table, HARD. The force of it 
           knocks her bowl of slop onto the person sitting next to her, 
           which is the CRYING GIRL SHE HIT IN THE FACE WITH A SUITCASE 
           EARLIER. The Crying Girl SCREAMS and then, of course, cries.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh -- sorry!

           The Crying Girl runs away. Mary watches the girl go, feeling 
           bad, then turns back to Margaret, instantly mad again.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s unfair. We all want to go to 
                        the party, so we should get to! 

                                 MARGARET
                        Trust me, we’ll have much more fun 
                        in the cabin. Now eat your dinner. 

                                 MARY
                        No! Tim and I are on a hunger 
                        strike and we won’t break it until 
                        you --

                                 TIM
                        All done!

           Tim puts down an empty bowl. He has slop all over his face. 
           He sees Mary glaring at him.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        I was starving! 

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The family heads back to the cabin. Mary and Tim go in. Patty 
           shoves in front of Margaret, closes the door, and blocks it. 

                                 PATTY
                        Listen very carefully. You are at a 
                        crossroads. You can either continue 
                        slowly killing yourself with worry 
                        and making everyone miserable with 
                        your lame attempts at fun --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           This hits Margaret hard.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        -- or you can take your children to 
                        the party. We’ll both be there to 
                        keep an eye on them, nothing bad 
                        will happen, and they just might 
                        start treating you like a mother 
                        instead of a prison warden. 

                                 MARGARET
                        A prison warden?

                                 PATTY
                        It’s honestly a job you should look 
                        into when we get to America. You 
                        would be great at it. But that’s 
                        not important right now. What’s 
                        important is that you get serious 
                        about being a fun mom. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you really think this will help 
                        my relationship with them, or do 
                        you just want to go to the party?

                                 PATTY
                        Fifty-fifty, but that doesn’t make 
                        me wrong. 

           Patty opens the cabin door. Mary and Tim are standing there.

                                 MARY
                        What’s going on?

           Patty looks to Margaret, and nods to her encouragingly. 
           Margaret hesitates, then takes a deep breath.

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re going to the party. Together. 
                        But we’re not going to drink any 
                        alcohol, or talk to any handsome 
                        thieves, and we are going to be 
                        back here by midnight. Understood?

           Tim and Mary excitedly nod.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Alright then. Let’s go.

           Tim and Mary run past her and down the hallway. Patty 
           follows, giving Margaret a pat on the shoulder. Margaret 
           takes a moment to steel herself, then heads off.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Father forgive me, for I am about 
                        to enter a party.

           DEEP BASS FROM AN ORIGINAL SUPER SICK PARTY SONG THAT KID 
           CUDI WILL WRITE FOR THIS MOVIE kicks in as we hit a:

           STYLIZED SUPER SICK STEERAGE PARTY MONTAGE

           People are DANCING LIKE CRAZY -- it is all JIGS AND DO-SEE-DO 
           TYPE STUFF but it still looks sick!!!

           Sweaty women chug beer, it’s so sick!!!!

           Burly men punch each other, it’s in good fun and also sick!!! 

           Patty arm wrestles a MAN while Tim refs and it’s, yeah, SICK!

           Mary laughs with the teens. Friendship is the sickest!!

           Margaret stands alone in the corner. Not sick. Healthy. 
           Daniel walks over. He’s got a beer, already a little drunk.

                                 DANIEL
                        You made it! Want some beer? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, no thank you, I don’t want to 
                        go to Hell.

           Margaret looks back to Mary, who is now making her way 
           through the crowd, with Patrick, TOWARDS THE DOOR. Margaret’s 
           eyes go wide. She tries to follow them, but the room is 
           PACKED. She squeezes in between people.  

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me -- pardon -- excuse me -- 
                        pardon -- excuse me --

           Margaret turns, searching for Mary, but she’s gone! 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        No. No! They’ve gone to have sex!!

           Margaret hurries out, pushing past BILLY ZANE’S BODYGUARD, 
           who is there spying on Rose, because he is in love with Billy 
           Zane and cares for Billy Zane’s happiness above all else.

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Margaret runs down a hallway.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        Father, please curse this Patrick 
                        boy with a broken penis!!!

           EXT. STEERAGE DECK - NIGHT

           Margaret runs out onto the deck. A few couples are out there, 
           looking at stars that Neil Degrasse Tyson will one day point 
           out are inaccurate. (Get a life, Neil.) 

           Margaret sees Mary walking with Patrick. She’s JUST about to 
           storm over there, but stops. Mary looks so happy. Margaret 
           freezes, wrestling with what to do. 

           At the last second, she ducks behind a DECK CHAIR. 

           Patrick and Mary walk up.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t want to just be a wash 
                        woman like my mother. I want to 
                        really experience life, you know 
                        what I mean? 

                                 PATRICK
                        I do. 

           Patrick smiles at Mary. Then tries to kiss her, which she 
           does not notice and accidentally dodges.

                                 MARY
                        You know I didn’t even want to 
                        leave Ireland. I was upset about 
                        missing the Potato Festival. Isn’t 
                        that so stupid? 

                                 PATRICK
                        What’s a Potato Festival? You just, 
                        like, look at potatoes? 

                                 MARY
                        And there’s games and stuff. But 
                        back home all I would do is read. 
                        And I thought that was enough. But 
                        hearing about your travels... 
                        that’s what I want. To go where the 
                        wind takes me, to live each day 
                        without thinking about tomorrow. I 
                        don’t want to just read stories, I 
                        want to live the stories. 

           Patrick gently tucks Mary’s hair behind her ear.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s so hot.

           He leans in to kiss her again, she excitedly spins out to 
           look at the ocean.

                                 MARY
                        I mean look at this! Look how big 
                        the world is! I want to see it all. 
                        That’s why... when we dock in New 
                        York... I’m getting off with you.

           Behind the deck chair, Margaret’s eyes go wide.

           Patrick hesitates, he’s not looking for a long term thing. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Um, cool. Yeah, that sounds... 
                        aren’t you supposed to be going 
                        back to Ireland?

           Margaret furrows her brow -- this boy sounds bad. 

           Mary looks lovingly at Patrick.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t want to go back. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Okay well, I mean, as you know I 
                        live my life one day at a time -- 

                                 MARY
                        It’ll be an adventure.

           Mary kisses him. Margaret jumps up.

                                 MARGARET
                        No, no no! 

                                 MARY
                        Mother?! 

           Mary pulls away from Patrick, who tries for a little too long 
           to keep making out.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m stopping this before it goes 
                        too far. This boy is a bad boy! 

                                 MARY
                        I don’t care what you think of him! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re getting so swept up in the 
                        excitement of having finally found 
                        someone to be your first kiss -- 

           Mary’s eyes bulge and she turns BRIGHT RED.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        -- that you can’t see he’s a creep! 

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m not a creep.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh please. I was a wash woman at 
                        the Ballybunion Golf Club for ten 
                        years, I know how to spot a creep! 

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t need this. I’m going back 
                        in. You know, moms usually love me! 

                                 MARGARET
                        Not this mom! 

                                 MARY
                        No, Patrick, wait --

           Mary touches his arm but he shrugs her off.

                                 PATRICK
                             (so whiny)
                        NO-ah! 

           He goes inside. Mary turns back to Margaret, furious.

                                 MARGARET
                        Go ahead. Yell at me. Tell me I’m a 
                        horrible mother. But I know I am 
                        right about this.

                                 MARY
                        What’s the point of yelling? You’re 
                        never going to change. 

           Mary sits down a deck chair, defeated. Margaret softens.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m just trying to protect you. 

                                 MARY
                        What was the point of even going on 
                        this trip? 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        If you wanted to keep me safe, you 
                        should have just let me stay in 
                        Kilgarney, reading books, working. 
                        Living and dying in the same house 
                        I was born in.

                                 MARGARET
                        I don’t want that for you. And I 
                        never knew that you didn’t want 
                        that either. 

                                 MARY
                        It doesn’t matter what I want. You 
                        won’t rest until Patrick hates me 
                        and I have no choice but to come 
                        home with you. 

           Mary collapses back against the deck chair, miserable. 

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re not going home.

           Mary turns to Margaret. What?

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I thought you would do something 
                        drastic if I told you that we were 
                        leaving for good, so I lied. 

           Mary sits up, unable to process this.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s a lot to understand, 
                        but America is our only choice. I 
                        want you and Tim to have a shot at 
                        a better life. America is famous 
                        for treating the Irish very well. 

           Margaret reaches out to touch Mary’s hand, but Mary gets up. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Besides, you told the creep that 
                        you’re excited about seeing the 
                        world. And now you will, with me, 
                        and Tim, and Patty. I was scared to 
                        tell you, but now that I know you 
                        don’t care about leaving Ireland -- 

                                 MARY
                        It’s not that I don’t care about 
                        leaving Ireland. 

           Mary turns to Margaret, her face hard, cold.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care about leaving you.   

           Margaret exhales sharply, her eyes suddenly full of tears. A 
           level of hurt she’s never known. 

           Mary just walks away. 

           Margaret sits there. Stung. Defeated. Angry. Lost. 
           Devastated. Furious. Her mind is racing. Finally, she pulls 
           it together. Her face hardens. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Fuck this shit.

           INT. STEERAGE MESS HALL - NIGHT

           Margaret storms into the party. She spots Daniel sitting at a 
           table with a bunch of drunks. She sits next to him.

                                 MARGARET
                        Give me that beer. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I thought you didn’t want to go to 
                        Hell.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m already there. 

           Margaret grabs a pint and takes a big sip, which she 
           immediately spits out. Her hardened face instantly crumbles.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Ewwwww ew ew bad bad bad. Blech! 

           She pushes the pint away and coughs. Daniel laughs.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re even more of an uptight nun 
                        than I thought.

                                 MARGARET
                        I am not a nun! The convent said I 
                        was too mean!  

           Margaret hears herself say that.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god. 

           Michael leans in from across the table. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m afraid you can only sit here if 
                        you beat me in a drinking race, 
                        love. So if you’re not drinking --

           Michael pulls her pint away. Margaret grabs it.

                                 MARGARET
                        Who says I’m not drinking? 

           Michael raises his eyebrows.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ve been challenged. 

           Michael clinks Margaret’s glass. Daniel pounds on the table:

                                 DANIEL
                        One! Two! Three! 

           They start chugging. Michael is soundly beating Margaret. He 
           flips Margaret off. Margaret’s eyes narrow. This asshole.

           Margaret KICKS MICHAEL IN THE NUTS UNDER THE TABLE. He drops 
           his beer. Margaret chugs while Michael writhes in pain.

           Michael sees Margaret is almost done with her beer. He grabs 
           his and tries to beat her, but -- it’s too late! 

           Margaret slams her pint down and jumps up victoriously. The 
           CROWD CHEERS AND LIFTS HER UP IN THE AIR. But it’s a low 
           ceiling so she instantly hits a beam. 

           The crowd lets her down, and she knocks into a man, who falls 
           into ROSE. Rose turns to Daniel and Michael at the table.

                                 ROSE
                        You boys think you’re so tough?

           Rose then stands on her big toes for some reason???

           Margaret spots PATTY through the crowd. She’s sitting at a 
           table with a bunch of men. Tim stands on the table.

                                 TIM
                        Step right up! See if you’re strong 
                        enough to beat Aunt Patty! 

           People hold up money, clamoring for a chance to arm-wrestle 
           Patty. Tim collects the money while Patty flexes.  

           Margaret stumbles through the crowd to get to Patty. She 
           kneels down and grabs Patty’s shoulder.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        Psst. Hey.

           Patty, who is in the middle of arm-wrestling a BURLY MAN, 
           turns to see Margaret.

                                 PATTY
                        What’s up?

                                 MARGARET
                        I drank beer. Shh. Don’t tell God.

                                 PATTY
                        That’s great! You’re letting loose!

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes! I’ve decided that I’m tired of 
                        everyone hating me so now I’m doing 
                        things that will make everyone love 
                        me even if the things I’m doing 
                        make me hate myself!

           Margaret hiccups, almost barfs, then grins.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        S’a great plan!

           Patty, greatly straining, PINS THE BURLY MAN’S ARM. The crowd 
           CHEERS. Margaret thinks the cheering is for her.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Yeah! Great plan! Woo! 

                                 TIM
                        Mother! Look how much money we’ve 
                        made from arm-wrestling!

                                 MARGARET
                        S’good, Tirm! Money is yay! 

           Margaret gives Tim a double thumbs-up, then turns to Patty.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        My son is gambling and I’m not 
                        telling him to stop. I’m fun!

           Margaret’s eyes bulge on “fun”. Her energy is approaching The 
           Mask levels. Ssssssomebody [should] stop [her]!

           Margaret grabs a nearby beer and takes a sip.

                                 DRUNK MAN
                        Hey! That’s my beer!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        Well I stole it. Because I’m FUN! 
                        But hey, you can have it back --

           She holds the beer out, but then pulls it back.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        NOT! 

           IMDB Trivia: This was the world’s first “not!” joke. 

           Margaret chugs the beer. The Drunk Man grabs it from her.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        HEY! You made me spill on my dress! 

                                 DRUNK MAN
                        Yeah, what are you going to do 
                        about it? 

           The Drunk Man and his friends laugh at her. Margaret hardens.

                                 MARGARET
                        Patty.

           Patty is in the middle of a difficult arm-wrestling match.

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah?

                                 MARGARET
                        Cover Tim’s eyes.

                                 PATTY
                        I’m a little busy --

           MARGARET DIVES ACROSS THE TABLE AND TACKLES THE DRUNK MAN. 
           She gets on top of him and punches him lightly in the chest.

                                 DRUNK MAN
                        Stop! This is annoying!

           Someone pulls Margaret away. She kicks, trying to get free. 

                                 TIM
                        Let go of my mother! 

           Tim, standing on the table, kicks the guy holding Margaret IN 
           THE NECK. Margaret gets free and TACKLES THE GUY. 

           It’s a FULL BRAWL. Patty’s in the middle of her arm wrestling 
           match, almost pinning the HUGE MAN. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        I can’t -- lose -- this -- 

           Margaret frantically kicks and punches people.

                                 MARGARET
                        None of you can hurt me anymore 
                        than my daughter already has!

           A SWEATY WOMAN, who was about to punch Margaret, stops.

                                 SWEATY WOMAN
                        Oh. Whoa. Are you okay?

           That woman gets punched by another woman. 

           Margaret stands there, suddenly present. She takes in her 
           surrounding: a brawl? Tim kicking people in the head?

                                 TIM
                             (kicking)
                        Yah! Yah! 

                                 MARGARET
                        What am I doing here? 

           Patty PINS THE HUGE MAN. 

                                 PATTY
                        YES! Now I can brawl!

           She picks up a SHORT MAN and hurls him across the room. 
           Margaret, very drunk, stumbles towards Patty.

                                 MARGARET
                        Patty! No brawling for Tim! We have 
                        to stop it! 

                                 PATTY
                        Oh, alright. OY! BAND! 

           The BAND looks over.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Play the Kesh Jig!  

           The band confers with each other, then turns back to Patty.

                                 FIDDLER
                             (small and far away)
                        No.

           Patty hurls a pitcher at them.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        PLAY THE FUCKING JIG!

           The band, scared, plays the Jig. The brawl instantly turns 
           into dancing. Patty turns to Margaret, who looks VERY upset.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

           Margaret shakes her head.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You feel sick?

           Margaret nods.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You think you might throw up?

           Margaret looks at Patty.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You already threw up?

           Margaret gives a very small nod.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You have the throw up in your mouth 
                        but you’re embarrassed to let it 
                        out?

           An even smaller nod.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        No one’s looking. Just let it out.

           Margaret sheepishly opens her mouth. Some vomit dribbles out. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve had a rough night. I’ll 
                        watch the children. You should go 
                        get some sleep. 

           Margaret, struggling to keep her balance, nods. She stumbles 
           for the door. Patty turns back to the crowd.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, who’s next?! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Margaret makes her way down the hallway, lip quivering. She 
           stumbles and falls against a wall, which is just enough to 
           send her over the edge. She slides down the wall, crying.

           A crew member, WILLIAM (30s, very kind but also skittish, 
           like a shy deer or Eddie Redmayne) walks by. He stops. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Miss? May I assist you?

                                 MARGARET
                             (slurring)
                        No! I’m beyond assisting! My head 
                        is spinning and my daughter hates 
                        me and I can’t change who I am but 
                        nobody likes who I am and -- 

           Margaret catches herself, and wipes her face. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, I’m going on and on --

           She looks up. William is gone. She’s alone in the hallway.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Wonderful, Margaret. Now you’re 
                        scaring people.

           She stands, wobbly. William reappears with a glass of water.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Here you are. That should help with 
                        the head spinning. 

           Margaret hiccups and takes the glass of water.

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s very kind. Thank you, 
                        Mister...?

                                 WILLIAM
                        William.

                                 MARGARET
                        William.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (genuinely amazed)
                        Your name’s William?
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        No, I was just repeating -- my name 
                        is Margaret.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ah. Pleasure to meet you. 

           Margaret takes a sip of water. An awkward moment passes.

                                 MARGARET
                        You work on the -- here? You work 
                        here? On the, um, the big boat? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes, I work upstairs. In the First 
                        Class Lounge. Or, just outside the 
                        Lounge. I’m the door opener. 

                                 MARGARET
                        The what?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I open the door? For people, for 
                        the people going into the Lounge?

           Margaret nods. She finishes the water and doesn’t know what 
           to do with the empty glass.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        I shall take that. Is there 
                        anything else I can help you with?

                                 MARGARET
                        I don’t think so. Thank you.

           Margaret takes a step and stumbles. She holds onto the wall.

                                 WILLIAM
                        May I walk you back to your room so 
                        that you don’t hurt yourself in a 
                        drunken stumble?

           William politely offers his arm. Margaret demurely takes it.

                                 MARGARET
                        Thank you. You know, I’m not 
                        usually this emotional. I just 
                        found out my daughter is going to 
                        abandon me once we get to America 
                        because she hates me, and hating me 
                        is just about the only thing we 
                        have in common! 

           Margaret collapses against William in tears.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh. Um. Well. That’s a lot to worry 
                        about, isn’t it. Um. Perhaps your 
                        husband can help?

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s dead!!! 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh William, why’d you bring that 
                        up? Stupid. 

                                 MARGARET
                        He died and left us with nothing. 
                        So now we’re going to New York to 
                        live with his brother and I lied to 
                        my children and told them we were 
                        just going on a vacation because I 
                        thought it would be easier but 
                        actually I think it made it harder? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes, well. Um. Lying is tricky. 

                                 MARGARET
                        And now my daughter hates me. She 
                        thinks I’m too --

           Margaret, too drunk to remember words, makes a “strict” face.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        So I tried to be more --
                             (does a “fun” dance)
                        -- woo! But “woo!” doesn’t feel 
                        good. I can’t be something I’m not, 
                        you know what I’m talking... ? 

           William stares for a long beat, no idea what she’s saying but 
           not wanting to be rude.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Um. Well.

                                 MARGARET
                        ... about? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Right. You -- um -- so -- you’re 
                        saying that -- we are who we are? 

                                 MARGARET
                        We are who we are! Yes! Exactly!

           William looks DELIGHTED to have guessed correctly.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I am a strict mother, that’s just 
                        who I am, but Mary is just too 
                        young to understand, you know?! 

           William, a little deer in headlights again, just nods.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes, she’s too young.

                                 MARGARET
                        But she doesn’t know she’s too 
                        young! 

           William vehemently shakes his head.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, she doesn’t know! 

                                 MARGARET
                        She thinks she knows everything, 
                        but she’s a little girl. And now 
                        she wants to leave! What do I do?

           Margaret looks to William, who has NO idea what to say.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well... you... you have to protect 
                        her. She’s your daughter and -- and 
                        even if she doesn’t appreciate you 
                        now, she will grow to realize that 
                        you had her best interest at heart.

           Margaret, so drunk, tears up. She’s incredibly touched.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes. You’re right.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes! Because strict mothers are 
                        good. My mother was very strict, 
                        and I hated her, but eventually I 
                        realized that she was fine.

                                 MARGARET
                        Your mother was strict? And now 
                        look at you, a nice man with a good 
                        job! She raised you well! 

                                 WILLIAM
                             (blushing)
                        Oh, well, bah. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        I never should have listened to 
                        Patty. She knows nothing about 
                        responsibility. I can’t be a fun 
                        mother. I have to be strict!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes! Strict mother!

           Margaret stops in front of her cabin door. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Well. This is my home. 

           Margaret hiccups, and smiles up at William.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. Really.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It was very nice to meet you, 
                        William -- Margaret! Margaret. 
                        Please, allow me. 

           William grabs the doorknob of Margaret’s cabin door, stands 
           up VERY straight, and opens the door with a flourish. 

                                 MARGARET
                             (delighted)
                        Ahhhh!

           William smiles. He’s partially blocking the doorway, because 
           the door opens in. Margaret squeezes past him. She pauses in 
           front of him, awkwardly close to his face.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight.

           William smiles politely. Margaret goes into the room, and 
           William closes the door. He instantly gags.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Wow. Very bad breath.

           INT. STEERAGE CABIN - DAY

           Margaret is passed out, arms at her side, face smushed into 
           her pillow. She’s in all her clothes and drooling.

           Patty shakes her awake. Margaret groggily comes to.

                                 PATTY
                        Good morning! How are you doing?
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        My head feels pregnant.

                                 PATTY
                        That’ll pass. Hey, wanted to run 
                        something by you, don’t be alarmed, 
                        but --

                                 TIM
                        Morning, Mother! Mary never came 
                        home last night and we have no idea 
                        where she is. Also look at how much 
                        money we made last night! 

           Tim holds up fistfuls of bills and coins. 

                                 MARGARET
                        She never came home?!

                                 PATTY
                        Yes, that was the information that 
                        I was going to deliver slowly and 
                        calmly, Tim.

           Margaret climbs out of bed, slowly, aching. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I never should have let her storm 
                        off like that.

                                 PATTY
                        This is not the reaction I was 
                        expecting. I thought you’d scream 
                        so loud the walls would smash. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m saving the screaming for when 
                        we find her. 

           Margaret hobbles for the door, miserably hungover. 

           INT. BEAUTIFUL SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT - 1996

           Old Mary has fallen asleep. Rebecca gingerly shakes her.

                                 REBECCA
                        Mom? ... Mom? 

           Old Mary wakes up, confused. She blinks at Rebecca.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        It’s time to go to bed. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Old Mary nods, looks like she’s about to stand, then:

                                 OLD MARY
                        Mother thought I had spent the 
                        night with Patrick, but I hadn’t.

                                 REBECCA
                        Mom, I really have to go, but I 
                        want to make sure you take your 
                        night pills. Can you please just go 
                        get ready for bed?

                                 OLD MARY
                        I had been so upset, I spent the 
                        whole night crying, seething, 
                        dreaming of a life on my own...

           Rebecca rubs her temples, so frustrated.

           EXT. TITANIC - LIFEBOAT DECK - DAY

           Mary’s curled up in a lifeboat. She rubs her puffy red eyes 
           and slowly climbs out. The boat rocks and she falls, HARD. 
           Her knee pops a hole in the side of the boat.

                                 MARY
                        Whoops. Good thing we won’t be 
                        needing these.

           GIRL YOU HAVE NO IDEA. 

           Mary steps onto the deck. A few FIRST CLASS PEOPLE are out 
           for a morning stroll. Among them is KATHY BATES, ROSE’S MOM, 
           and a RICH LADY friend. They see Mary. 

                                 RICH LADY
                        Ugh! Look at that filthy rag girl! 

                                 ROSE’S MOM
                        Steerage rats are not supposed to 
                        be in the First Class area! She 
                        probably came up here to steal! 
                        Somebody call the Master At Arms! 

           Mary panics. Kathy Bates steps forward. 

                                 KATHY BATES
                        Come on now girls, no need to make 
                        a scene. Ain’t you ever seen a kid 
                        sleep outside before? 
                             (to Mary)
                        You look like you could use some 
                        breakfast, little lady. 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 KATHY BATES (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t you head on down to the 
                        dining hall and get yourself some 
                        doggone biscuits and gravy?

           Did you guys know that Kathy Bates’s character was American? 

           Mary nervously nods to Kathy Bates and hurries off.

                                 ROSE’S MOM
                        If you come up here again, we’ll 
                        have you arrested! 

           Kathy Bates turns to Rose’s Mom.

                                 KATHY BATES
                        Damn, Ruth. Why can’t you just be 
                        cool about stuff?

           Rose’s Mom, owned, purses her lips and walks away.

           INT. STEERAGE MESS HALL - DAY

           The tables are full, breakfast service is in full swing. Mary 
           walks in. She sees Patrick eating with the other cool teens. 
           She steels herself and walks over to sit next to him.

                                 MARY
                        Hi. Can we talk?

                                 PATRICK
                        You know, your mom’s really 
                        annoying. I hate when people treat 
                        me like I’m not cool. Because I am 
                        cool.

                                 MARY
                        I know. I’m so sorry about --

                                 PATRICK
                        This is just too complicated for 
                        me. I want my life to be simple. 

                                 MARY
                        I want my life to be simple too. 
                        Once we get to New York, my mother 
                        won’t be an issue. We’ll run away, 
                        go wherever we want, live day to 
                        day just like you said --

                                 PATRICK
                        So much talking. Look, I’m not a 
                        words guy. All I care about is what 
                        feels right and this --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Mary grabs Patrick’s face and kisses him passionately. She 
           pulls away and looks him in the eyes.

                                 MARY
                        Did that feel right? 

                                 PATRICK
                        It definitely felt good. 

           Patrick leans in to kiss her again, but Margaret APPEARS OUT 
           OF NOWHERE AND PUTS A PLATE IN FRONT OF PATRICK’S FACE.

                                 MARGARET
                        Mind if I squeeze in? 

           Margaret squeezes between them. Tim and Patty are behind her.

                                 PATTY
                        Margaret, this table looks full, we 
                        should sit somewhere else --

                                 MARGARET
                        Nonsense, there’s plenty of room. 
                        Patrick, scooch down. 

                                 MARY
                        He doesn’t have to scooch. We’re 
                        leaving. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Yeah, I’m out of here.

           Patrick and the other cool teens walk away. Mary gets up to 
           follow but Margaret grabs her wrist.

                                 MARGARET
                        If you don’t sit back down I will 
                        tell him about the time I caught 
                        you practice kissing a pig. 

                                 MARY
                        You wouldn’t.

                                 MARGARET
                        Patrick!

           Patrick, almost out the door, turns back.

                                 PATRICK
                        What?

           Margaret opens her mouth to keep talking but Mary sits.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        Shut up shut up shut up! I’ll stay. 

           Margaret nods. Good. Patrick is still waiting by the door.

                                 PATRICK
                        WHAT!

                                 MARGARET
                        Nothing! Run along!

           Patrick scoffs and leaves. Margaret turns back to Mary.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look at me like that. You are 
                        in so much trouble for not coming 
                        home last night!  

                                 MARY
                        Home? Yes. Let’s talk about home. 
                        Does Tim know that we’re never 
                        going back to Ireland?

           Tim freezes, mid-bite. Margaret looks to him, guilty.

                                 MARGARET
                        No, wait, let me explain -- 

                                 MARY
                        Mother lied in order to get us on 
                        the ship. We’re never going back. 
                        We’re going to live in America.

           Tim pauses, thinking, looking confused, but then he smiles.

                                 TIM
                        Great! America is a way better 
                        place to make money! I’m going to 
                        become a billionaire! 

                                 MARY
                        You don’t care that Mother lied? 
                        That you’ll never see home again? 

           Tim shrugs and takes a bite of breakfast slop.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You’re happy about going to New 
                        York to live with Uncle Sean?! 

           Tim drops his fork.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 TIM
                        Uncle Sean? NO! I hate Uncle Sean! 
                        He smells like old meat! 

                                 MARGARET
                        You haven’t seen him since you were 
                        three.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah! That’s how much he smells 
                        like old meat! I still remember! 

           Tim puts his head in his hands.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Now I have to find the treasure in 
                        the cargo hold. I need plenty of 
                        stuff to sell so I can buy us a 
                        castle as soon as we get there. I 
                        am not living with the meat man! 

                                 MARGARET
                        Where is your head? Haven’t I 
                        taught you that stealing is wrong? 

                                 MARY
                        You also taught us that lying is 
                        wrong. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Mary -- 

                                 PATTY
                        Margaret, take a breath, you’re a 
                        little tense -- 

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course I’m tense! I’m a single 
                        mother widow far away from home in 
                        the middle of the flippin’ sea! I 
                        have no idea what I’m doing and on 
                        top of all of that, I’m hungover! 

                                 MARY
                        Hungover? Are you kidding?! You’ve 
                        been lecturing me about bad 
                        decisions, but you got drunk?!

                                 MARGARET
                        Everybody makes mistakes. Even the 
                        Lord! Why do you think there’s so 
                        many different sizes of snakes?! 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        He made one, realized it was way 
                        too big, then made a smaller one, 
                        but it was still too big -- 

                                 PATTY
                        Margaret, for the last time, nobody 
                        agrees with your snake theory. 

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s the only possible explanation 
                        for why there are so many different 
                        sizes of snake! 

           A KIND WOMAN leans over.

                                 KIND WOMAN
                        Excuse me, can you lot please shut 
                        the fuck up?

           Margaret stares back at the woman, dumbfounded.

                                 KIND WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been screaming at each other 
                        for the past four days, and we’re 
                        all bloody sick of it.

                                 MARGARET
                        Really. You’re all sick of it. 
                        Everyone in this room. Everyone in 
                        this room got together and agreed 
                        that they’re all sick of my family. 

                                 EVERYONE IN THE ROOM
                        Yes!

           Margaret reacts. She really wasn’t expecting that.

                                 MARGARET
                        Well fine! We’ll just go then! I 
                        should step outside anyway because 
                        I’m feeling ill and I need to vomit 
                        into the ocean! So goodbye! 

           Margaret points to the door. Patty and Tim go, Mary hurries 
           after them, bright red with embarrassment. Margaret follows.

           EXT. TITANIC - STEERAGE DECK - DAY

           Margaret, Patty, Tim, and Mary come out to the deck.

                                 MARY
                        I’ve never been more embarrassed in 
                        my life!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        I can’t believe all of steerage was 
                        talking about us. We’re going to be 
                        the story of the Titanic. People 
                        will say to their families “you 
                        won’t believe what happened on the 
                        Titanic, everyone had a great time, 
                        except for this one family.” 

                                 MARGARET
                        Nobody’s going to remember us.

                                 MARY
                        Yes because you’re so determined to 
                        keep us chained together, living 
                        safe, unremarkable lives.

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s not what I -- AGH! I wish we 
                        could just go back to when my 
                        biggest concern about you was that 
                        you would lock yourself in a 
                        library to get out of doing chores!  
                        Now one cute boy has smiled at you, 
                        and all of a sudden I have to fight 
                        with everything I have to make sure 
                        you don’t turn into Patty! 

           Patty, SO SLOWLY, turns to Margaret with the biggest “What, 
           bitch?” look on her face.

                                 PATTY
                        What, bitch?

                                 MARGARET
                        I didn’t mean it like that.

                                 PATTY
                        What’s so bad about me?! 

                                 MARGARET
                        Patty, please don’t do this, I’m in 
                        the middle of screaming at Mary --

                                 PATTY
                        You think it’d be better if she 
                        turned out like you? All repressed 
                        and miserable?! 

                                 MARGARET
                        You know, the only reason that I am 
                        repressed and miserable is that I 
                        have been taking care of children 
                        since I was ten years old!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        Let’s take it down a notch with the 
                        dramatics, you had Mary when you 
                        were twenty.  

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m talking about you! I never got 
                        to be young and carefree because 
                        ever since mother died, I’ve had to 
                        take care of you! 

                                 PATTY
                        How dare you blame that on me. I 
                        never asked you to be my mother. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Somebody had to be! Lord knows you 
                        can’t take care of yourself.

                                 PATTY
                        I lived in Dublin for three years 
                        on my own and I was fine!

                                 MARGARET
                        You were homeless! You had to come 
                        crawling back to live with me! 

                                 PATTY
                        I came back because Connor died and 
                        you needed help with the children!

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, what a great help you’ve been! 
                        I left you in charge of Tim and he 
                        got into a brawl --

                                 PATTY
                        That you started!

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes! But! I never would have even 
                        been at that party if it weren’t 
                        for you! It’s still your fault! 

                                 PATTY
                        I just wanted you to have some fun!

                                 MARGARET
                        I can’t afford to have fun! I have 
                        responsibilities. Something you 
                        know nothing about.

                                 PATTY
                        I’m plenty responsible. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        Please. I can’t even leave you 
                        alone with the kids. They’d be 
                        better off with a dog in charge.

                                 PATTY
                        HEY! The only thing I have in 
                        common with a dog is that we smell 
                        alike! And we bite when we’re 
                        scared! And we piss where we want! 
                        And we --

                                 MARGARET
                        None of this is anything to be 
                        proud of! 

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t tell me what to be proud of! 
                        God! I don’t need this shit from 
                        you! You think I can’t take care of 
                        myself? Well watch me! 

           Patty, super intense, storms off. She gets pretty far away 
           and then turns back.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I just realized -- I shouldn’t have 
                        said “watch me” because the whole 
                        point is that I’m going on without 
                        you. So I guess just imagine it? I 
                        don’t know. But FUCK YOU!

           Patty storms off. 

           Margaret stands there, too angry to feel anything else. She 
           turns back to Mary and Tim. 

                                 MARGARET
                        She’ll be back. She just needs to 
                        calm down.

                                 MARY
                        She needs to calm down?

                                 TIM
                        Aunt Patty was right. We’re going 
                        to be all anyone remembers about 
                        the Titanic.

                                 MARY
                        No. People will remember me and 
                        Patrick. 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        Because our love will inspire books 
                        and songs and paintings -- that’s 
                        how great our love is. Time will 
                        never forget it.
                             (to Margaret)
                        And nothing can keep us apart.

           Mary turns to leave, but Margaret grabs her.

                                 MARGARET
                        Mary, I don’t care if I have to 
                        handcuff you to my wrist, you are 
                        not going to see that boy again.

                                 MARY
                        No matter how much you hold onto me 
                        now, I am gone the second we get to 
                        New York, so why don’t you just 
                        make this easy and let me go!

                                 MARGARET
                        No! William was right --

                                 MARY
                        Who’s William?

                                 MARGARET
                        A First Class Doorman! And he 
                        agreed with me, it doesn’t matter 
                        if children hate having a --

                                 MARY
                        He works in First Class? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes, in the Lounge. Or just outside 
                        the Lounge. And he said that being 
                        a strict mother is -- 

           Mary cocks her head, devious. She has an idea.

                                 MARY
                        Bullshit.

                                 MARGARET
                        Excuse you?

                                 MARY
                        Bullshit. There’s no “William the 
                        First Class Door Opener”. You just 
                        want me to think there are people 
                        who back you up so I’ll give in. 
                        But you’re lying! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        I am not lying!

                                 MARY
                        You lied about this being a 
                        vacation! Who knows what else 
                        you’ll lie about? 

                                 MARGARET
                        You don’t believe me? Fine! He’ll 
                        explain it to you himself! 

           Margaret grabs Mary and pulls her along. Mary smiles 
           mischievously, as if this is part of her plan. Tim follows.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        He’ll tell you all about how 
                        mothers know best and --

           As Margaret lectures, Mary turns back to Tim.

                                 MARY
                             (whisper)
                        If you want to find the treasure, 
                        you’ll need mother out of your way.

                                 TIM
                        What do you mean?

                                 MARY
                             (whisper)
                        Just follow my lead.

           Tim, who really is a good boy, looks to Margaret, conflicted.

                                 MARGARET
                        -- if you didn’t need your mother 
                        then you wouldn’t be born a baby, 
                        you would come out fully grown and 
                        responsible --

           Tim looks back to Mary and nods. He’s in. Mary smirks.

           INT. FIRST CLASS AREA - DAY

           William stands by the door to the First Class Lounge. (No big 
           deal, but William is the guy who opens the door for Rose when 
           she gets to Heaven. Do you know what I’m talking about? 
           Probably not. I’ve seen Titanic 25 times.)

           William opens the door for JOHN JACOB ASTOR.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 WILLIAM
                        Good afternoon, Mr. Astor.

                                 JOHN JACOB ASTOR
                        Shut the fuck up, William. 

           William smiles and nods. He loves his job.

           Margaret walks in, dragging Mary and Tim. 

                                 MARGARET
                        William!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Margaret? You shouldn’t be up here. 

           A RICH WOMAN stops at the door. She is VERY confused by the 
           fact that the door isn’t opening for her. 

                                 RICH WOMAN
                        What?! How do I -- what do I -- ?!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh! I’m so terribly sorry.

           William opens the door for the woman. She slaps him. 

                                 RICH WOMAN
                        Don’t ever let that happen again. 

           William nods. The woman walks into the lounge. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry to bother you, I just 
                        need you to quickly explain to Mary 
                        that hating me is just a phase and 
                        she will eventually love me for 
                        being a strict mother.

           Mary looks around - a crowd of First Class people are 
           starting to gather, looking at them like they’re gross.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Is this Mary? I thought she would 
                        be, um, younger?

                                 MARGARET
                        Younger? Why would she be younger?

           Mary rips her arm away from Margaret and pulls Tim away.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        Somebody help! This woman made us 
                        come up here! She wanted us to 
                        steal things! 

                                 MARGARET
                        What?!

                                 MARY
                        Call the Master At Arms! She 
                        dragged us up here and told us we 
                        had to steal things or else! 

                                 TIM
                        Mary, what are you --

                                 MARY
                        Shh. It’s the plan.

                                 TIM
                        But you --

           Mary clamps a hand over Tim’s mouth and turns him to the 
           door, shuffling him out.

                                 MARGARET
                        Mary! Have you lost your mind?!

                                 MARY
                        Just let us go back to steerage 
                        where we belong, crazy lady! I 
                        don’t even know you!

           Mary and Tim are almost out the door. Margaret chases --

                                 MARGARET
                        Get back here! 

           But she is STOPPED BY A FANCY MAITRE D.

                                 MAITRE D
                        You’re not going anywhere, miss. 
                        Call the Master At Arms! 

           Margaret, caught, turns to Mary, incredulous. Mary smirks 
           back at her -- fuck you. And disappears. 

           EXT. TITANIC - DECK - DAY

           Tim and Mary walk out onto the deck. Tim turns on Mary.

                                 TIM
                        Why did you get mother arrested?! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        So that I can see Patrick. 
                             (off Tim’s look)
                        And so you can find your treasure. 
                        Look, it’s a good thing, now we can 
                        do whatever we want.

                                 TIM
                        But mother doesn’t belong in jail! 
                        I’m getting her out!

           Tim tries to go back inside but Mary blocks the door.

                                 MARY
                        If you go back in there, they’ll 
                        just arrest you too. Steerage 
                        people aren’t allowed in First 
                        Class. There’s nothing you can do.

           Tim lets out a RAGE SCREAM and kicks the wall. 

                                 TIM
                        I never should have let you do your 
                        stupid plan!

                                 MARY
                        Let? You don’t let me do anything. 
                        You’re just a wee little boy. 

                                 TIM
                        No I’m not! I’m a man! 

                                 MARY
                        Who put this idea in your head 
                        about you being a man?

                                 TIM
                        Father! He said if anything ever 
                        happened to him, it would be my 
                        responsibility to take care of you 
                        and mother. 

           They both calm down a bit, sad at the mention of their dad. 

                                 MARY
                        I don’t need taking care of.

                                 TIM
                        Oh right, because you’re seventeen 
                        and you’ve got it all figured out.

                                 MARY
                        Exactly.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 TIM
                        No, not exactly! Because you want 
                        to know something? You suck! You’ve 
                        barely spoken to me or mother for 
                        like three years and ever since we 
                        left home you’ve just been mean! 

                                 MARY
                        Because mother has been --

                                 TIM
                        She just wants to protect you, you 
                        idiot! 

                                 MARY
                        Protect me from what?! We’re on the 
                        biggest, grandest ship in the 
                        world, we’re fine! 

           A QUICK FLASH OF THE TITANIC SNAPPING IN HALF 

                                 TIM
                        It’s her first time leaving Ireland 
                        too, she’s scared!

                                 MARY
                        That doesn’t give her the right to 
                        control my life and keep me away 
                        from Patrick!

           Tim does the world’s biggest eye roll.

                                 TIM
                        Ugh, Patrick. He sucks too! When I 
                        find the treasure, neither of you 
                        are getting any! 

           Tim starts off, head full of steam.

                                 MARY
                        There is no treasure, you idiot! 

                                 TIM
                        Yes there is! And I’m going to take 
                        it and sell it and use all the 
                        money to BUY A BETTER SISTER!

           Tim storms off. Mary shakes her head, pissed, then heads off.

           INT. CREW CORRIDOR - DAY

           THOMAS KING, the burly, bearded MASTER AT ARMS, leads 
           Margaret down a hallway towards his office.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas handcuffs Margaret to a chair.

                                 MARGARET
                        This really isn’t necessary, I’m 
                        not a criminal. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Miss, you were trespassing in First 
                        Class with two children that you 
                        had kidnapped and forced to join 
                        your pick-pocketing syndicate. 

           Thomas looks at her, making a Steve Harvey Family Feud face.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        You’re a criminal.

                                 MARGARET
                        I didn’t kidnap them, they’re my 
                        children. 

                                 THOMAS
                        That’s precisely what a kidnapper 
                        would say. Now if you’ll excuse me, 
                        I have an incident report to write.

           Thomas fills out a form. Margaret, completely defeated, 
           slumps in her chair. 

                                 MARGARET
                        This is probably a good thing. 
                        Everyone will be a lot happier with 
                        me out of the picture. I should 
                        just stay here, rot away in jail. 

                                 THOMAS
                        This isn’t a jail. It’s my office.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh. Sorry, I -- it’s just so -- 
                        it’s a little drab. There aren’t 
                        any windows.

                                 THOMAS
                        I’ve got a window.

           He gestures to a tiny porthole. Margaret looks at it and 
           feigns being impressed. Thomas eyes her, a little stung, then 
           goes back to writing his report. 

           After a beat, he looks up.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        You know, I like my office. 

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - DUSK

           Patty storms down a hallway.

                                 PATTY
                        Joke’s on you Margaret. You think 
                        you don’t need my help? Then you 
                        get to take care of the kids on 
                        your own while I finally get to 
                        fuck the twins. I don’t even care! 

           FABRIZIO passes by. He stops.

                                 FABRIZIO
                        Hey, who are you talking to? 

           Patty punches him. Fabrizio holds his face, stunned.

                                 FABRIZIO (CONT’D)
                        Bastardo!

           He runs away. Patty looks at her fist.

                                 PATTY
                        Ooh, I’ve got to calm down. Angry 
                        fucking’s not as fun. 

           Patty shuts her eyes, takes a deep breath, then walks off 
           with a spring in her step.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                             (singing to herself)
                        Gonna fuck the same man twice at 
                        once -- 

           INT. STEERAGE CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Patty opens the door.

                                 PATTY
                        Alright, you identical meatbags, 
                        we’ve got the room to ourselves and 
                        it’s time to --

           She sees the room is empty. Her face falls.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           She taps her fingers on the wall, thinking. Finally:

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just wait. You’re not so 
                        desperate to get porked that you 
                        can’t wait a few minutes, Patty.

           She sits, but then immediately jumps back up.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Yes you are, let’s go find ‘em.

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - DUSK

           Mary nervously knocks on a cabin door. Patrick opens it. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Where’s your mom?

                                 MARY
                        I got her arrested. She can’t 
                        bother us anymore.

           Mary kisses him. He closes the door.

           INT. CREW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Tim sneaks down a crew corridor. He passes a door labeled 
           “RESTRICTED ACCESS”. He smiles to himself. Found it. He tries 
           the knob, and it turns! It’s open! 

                                 TIM
                        Mary thinks there’s no treasure, 
                        but the treasure is right --

           INT. SMALL ROOM - NIGHT

           Tim pops into the room.

                                 TIM
                        -- here! Damn it.

           He is in a tiny, loud room crowded with big pipes. There’s an 
           open hatch in the middle of the floor. Tim, a bit hesitant, 
           peers down the hatch. Then climbs down the ladder.

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Tim jumps down into the ENGINE ROOM, which is loud, hot, 
           steamy, red-tinged. Tim looks around in fearful awe.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 TIM
                        Whoa. I’m in Hell!

           An ENGINEER spots him.

                                 ENGINEER
                        Hey! You can’t be down here!

                                 TIM
                        Get away from me, hell-man!

           Tim runs for it, but gets two steps before his foot gets 
           caught in a grate and he falls to the floor HARD. His body 
           goes completely limp. He lays in a lifeless pile. Another 
           Engineer approaches.

                                 ENGINEER #2
                        Who’s this?

                                 ENGINEER
                        I don’t know, he ran from me and 
                        tripped and -- I guess he’s dead?

                                 ENGINEER #2
                        Jesus Christ. We got to get rid of 
                        another dead kid?

           Tim jumps up.

                                 TIM
                        I was fooling you! I thought you’d 
                        leave me alone if I was dead! Would 
                        a kid come up with a plan that 
                        smart? I don’t think so! Ha-HA!

           Tim runs for it, gets one step, trips, and falls HARD again. 
           The Engineer pulls him up.

                                 ENGINEER
                        Alright, back to steerage.

                                 TIM
                        Aw, man. I’m never gonna find the 
                        stupid cargo hold. 

                                 ENGINEER
                        The cargo hold? You can’t go in 
                        there, it’s a restricted area.

           An idea lights up Tim’s face. The Engineer pushes Tim towards 
           the ladder he came down and turns to leave.

                                 TIM
                        Wait wait wait!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The Engineer turns. Tim smirks and reaches into his pocket.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        How restricted? 

           He holds up his ARM-WRESTLING MONEY. 

           INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

           Tim walks into the Cargo Hold. It’s a HUGE room, full of 
           boxes, cars, trunks. He looks around, awe-struck. He turns 
           back to the Engineer, who’s standing in the doorway.

                                 TIM
                        Thank you! 

           The Engineer holds up Tim’s money.

                                 ENGINEER
                        No, thank you. When I get to 
                        America, I’m going to use this 
                        money to buy a hat! 

                                 TIM
                        If you get to America.

           They laugh and laugh. 

                                 ENGINEER
                        Alright, I better get back to work.

           He turns to go, then stops. Turns back to Tim.

                                 ENGINEER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, did you know that I work in 
                        the forward-most starboard 
                        compartment, which would be the 
                        first compartment to flood if we 
                        ever scraped along an iceberg on 
                        the starboard side? That’s just 
                        something I think about sometimes. 
                        I guess you could call it my 
                        biggest fear. Anyway, bye! 

           He leaves.

           Tim walks around, in awe. He passes a STEAMY OLD CAR and 
           thinks he hears weird noises coming from it. Like the faint 
           whimpering of a boy-faced virgin who has never orgasmed 
           before? (Doesn’t Jack seem like a creepy virgin?)

           Tim gets close to peer into the window but a HAND slaps the 
           glass and scares him so he hurries away thank god.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Tim turns down an aisle in a far corner of the cargo hold. 
           There are several ORNATE TRUNKS. He tries to open them, but 
           they’re all locked, until one opens! 

           He excitedly opens the trunk. Inside is a VERY ORNATE SWORD. 
           Like a fuggin’ royal sword.

           Tim holds it up, very impressed. Then starts wildly swinging 
           it around, playing like a little kid.

           INT. PATRICK’S CABIN - NIGHT

           Mary and Patrick make out on his bed. He’s on top of her, 
           being really handsy and moaning. He sucks. Mary stops him. 

                                 MARY
                        Sorry, I just -- 

                                 PATRICK
                        I knew it. You aren’t ready to 
                        totally surrender yourself to life 
                        and see where it takes you. 

                                 MARY
                        No, I am. I want to do this. It’s 
                        just that... there’s a lot of 
                        people in here.

           REVEAL: there are five other men in the room -- sleeping, 
           reading, doing chin-ups.

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh, they don’t care.

           Patrick makes out with her neck. 

                                 MARY
                        Why don’t we go outside?

           Patrick stares at her, excited. Really?

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        We can see the stars, they’ll be 
                        all around us -- in the sky, their 
                        reflections twinkling on the 
                        surface of the sea. We’ll be 
                        wrapped up in stars, as if we’re 
                        floating through the universe, just 
                        the two of us. Together.  

           Mary looks deep into his eyes. He smiles.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATRICK
                        Yeah, I’ll fuck outside. 

           He takes her hand and pulls her towards the door. Mary 
           follows, underwhelmed and confused by that response.

           EXT. BOW DECK - NIGHT

           Patty walks out to the bow deck, where various groups are 
           hanging out. She scans the crowd and finds Rico and Tony. 
           They’re smoking and wildly gesticulating at each other.

           Patty smiles. 

                                 PATTY
                        Found ‘em. 

           She hoists up her boobs, accidentally pushing one out of her 
           shirt, exposing it completely. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Whoops.

           She goes to put her boob back in her shirt, then pauses 
           momentarily to consider leaving it out? No, too much. She 
           puts it back in and walks over to Rico and Tony.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Listen up, boys. My family’s 
                        scattered all around the ship, 
                        now’s the time to stink up the 
                        cabin to high heaven. 

           Rico and Tony stare at her. Patty groans. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        If only you spoke English.

                                 RICO
                        I do speak English. Leave us alone. 

                                 PATTY
                        You speak English?! Then you’ve 
                        heard me discussing how bad I want 
                        a double salami sandwich! You know 
                        how much this means to me!

                                 RICO
                        We don’t do that sort of thing. 
                        We’re brothers, it’s disgusting.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                             (heartbroken)
                        So I can only fuck one of you?

                                 RICO
                        Lady, I’ll fuck you the day the 
                        unsinkable Titanic lays at the 
                        bottom of the ocean. 

           He laughs and takes a drag of his cigarette.  

           Oh and then they hit the iceberg.

           THE SHIP SCRAPES ALONG THE ICEBERG, everyone struggles to 
           keep their balance. 

           TITANIC HITTING THE ICEBERG MONTAGE

           We see all the same footage that we saw in Titanic (my piece 
           of shit cousin is good at ripping scenes off DVDs so we’ll 
           save some money here): 

           Bolts popping, water busting in, people fleeing the engine 
           room and almost getting trapped in the closing doors...

           INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE - ICEBERG MONTAGE - NIGHT

           Margaret and Thomas are there. His desk VIBRATES, there’s a 
           LOUD SCREECHING. They look at each other -- what is that?

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - ICEBERG MONTAGE - NIGHT

           Patrick leads Mary down a hallway, the floor shakes a little. 
           They steady themselves on the wall. 

           INT. STEERAGE MESS HALL - ICEBERG MONTAGE - NIGHT

           The two dudes who made out on the first night are having a 
           wonderful late-night dinner date. One of their soup bowls 
           VIBRATES WILDLY on the table. They exchange concerned looks.

           INT. CARGO HOLD - ICEBERG MONTAGE - NIGHT

           Tim, holding his sword and wearing a too-big wool overcoat 
           and a top hat, gets THROWN by the force of the hit. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           WATER RUSHES IN, instantly killing two Crew Members who were 
           looking for Jack and Rose (perhaps those Crew Members would 
           still be alive today if not for Jack and Rose’s secret car-
           bone. Makes you think.)

           Tim quickly climbs up several boxes to see what’s going on. 
           He sees the water rushing in on the far side of the room. He 
           panics, frantically searching for a way out. He spots a DOOR 
           on his side of the hold and runs for it.

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - ICEBERG MONTAGE - NIGHT

           Remember in Titanic when the engine room is flooding and 
           everyone runs for the automatically closing doors? But one 
           guy doesn’t make it before the door closes? You won’t believe 
           this. THAT’S the engineer who showed Tim the cargo hold!!!!

           EXT. BOW DECK - NIGHT

           The ship gets away from the iceberg. Everyone looks around, 
           unsure of what just happened. Patty turns to Tony.

                                 PATTY
                        Alright, then. So Rico’s out. As 
                        much as I’d love both, I’ll settle 
                        for one. Tony, shall we?

           Rico and Tony kick around a piece of ice that fell off the 
           iceberg, ignoring Patty.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, that’s it!

           She grabs the ice chunk they’re playing with. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        One of you comes to bed with me 
                        right now, or I’m throwing your ice 
                        chunk overboard.

           They are already playing with a different ice chunk.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Damn it!

           Pouting, she tosses her ice chunk overboard. 

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           A dolphin swims alongside the Titanic. The ice chunk falls on 
           its head and it dies :( 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE - NIGHT

           Margaret and Thomas in the office, shaken.

                                 MARGARET
                        What was that? Why was the whole 
                        room shaking? 

                                 THOMAS
                        We must have hit a whale? Or 
                        maybe...
                             (very scared)
                        A whale hit us.

           Thomas gets up to peer out his porthole window.

                                 MARGARET
                        Please, may I be released? I need 
                        to make sure my children are 
                        alright.

                                 THOMAS
                        I apologize, Miss O’Malley, I must 
                        speak to the Captain first.

           The phone RINGS. Thomas picks up.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Master-At-Arms. Mmhmm. Oh my. 
                        Alright. I’m on my way.

           The Master-At-Arms character in Titanic is essentially a 
           cartoon. He hangs up the phone.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        There’s been a burglary in one of 
                        the First Class staterooms. 

           He heads for the door.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Someone stole a big blue heart-
                        shaped diamond. I can’t imagine 
                        why, it sounds very ugly. Anyway, 
                        wait here, I shall return.

           Thomas leaves.

           EXT. BOW DECK - NIGHT

           Mary and Patrick walk out to the deck. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        What was all that shaking? 

           They see that there are a bunch of people on the deck, 
           including the other cool teens. Ainsley sees them.

                                 AINSLEY
                             (so drunk)
                        You made it!

                                 PATRICK
                        What’s happening? 

                                 AINSLEY
                        The ship hit a ice so we’re having 
                        a ice party!  

                                 MARY
                        What did we hit? 

                                 AINSLEY
                        Just like a big ice. But now we’re 
                        doing this thing where you suck on 
                        this ice ball til your mouth is 
                        numb then you drink as much as you 
                        can in one pull. S’fun!!!!! 

                                 PATRICK
                        Ooh I wanna! 

                                 AINSLEY
                        PETER! Patrick wants the ice ball!

           PETER (17), sidekick douche, brings the ice ball over. 
           Patrick takes it.

                                 MARY
                        What about... our plan?

                                 PATRICK
                        Mary, life isn’t about plans. It’s 
                        about rolling with whatever happens 
                        to you. Life brought us to this ice 
                        party, and we should experience it.

                                 PETER
                        Okay okay you gotta suck on it til 
                        you can swallow it. Did you get how 
                        I made it sound like a beej?! 

           Patrick laughs and shoves a huge ice chunk in his mouth. Mary 
           looks on, grossed out. 

           Ainsley takes out a cigarette. She offers the pack to Mary.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Mary hesitates, but then takes one. Ainsley lights it for 
           her. Mary takes it and immediately starts coughing.

                                 MARY
                        Ugh! Ew! Bad bad bad bad!

           She tosses the cigarette overboard. 

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           A whale surfaces right next to the Titanic. How majestic! The 
           lit cigarette falls straight into its blowhole and, you 
           guessed it, the whale explodes.  

           EXT. BOW DECK - NIGHT

           Mary coughs. Ainsley laughs at her.

                                 AINSLEY
                        Jesus, Mary, don’t tell me that was 
                        your first cigarette. You’re like 
                        the biggest virgin I’ve ever met.

           Mary rolls her eyes and turns to Patrick.

                                 MARY
                        I’d like to go.

                                 PATRICK
                             (mouthful of ice)
                        Okay. See you tomorrow.

           Patrick goes in to hug her, but she pulls back.

                                 MARY
                        You’re not coming with me?

                                 PATRICK
                        Babe. It’s a ice party.

           Mary glares at him, then turns to storm off. Patrick runs 
           after her.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, hey, I’m sorry, okay? Of 
                        course I still want to go float 
                        through space and stars or 
                        whatever, I just also want to chill 
                        at the ice party for a bit --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Mary’s attention is caught by PANICKED OFFICERS on a higher 
           deck, seen just over Patrick’s shoulder. It looks bad. She 
           pushes past Patrick to get a closer look.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Mary, don’t be like this!

           EXT. UPPER DECK - NIGHT

           Mary climbs over a stairway gate to get onto an upper deck. 
           TWO OFFICERS rush past her. She follows them. 

                                 OFFICER
                        They can’t be serious.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        You think their idea of having a 
                        laugh is telling us to ready the 
                        lifeboats?

           Mary stops dead in her tracks. She looks up at the higher 
           decks -- she can see MORE OFFICERS cutting the ropes on a 
           lifeboat. Mary’s eyes go wide.

           EXT. BOW DECK - NIGHT

           Mary runs up to Patrick. He’s chugging vodka while Peter, 
           Ainsley, and other cool teens cheer him on. 

                                 MARY
                        Patrick! I think the ship is 
                        sinking!  

           Patrick holds up a finger: one sec.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        No! This is serious!

           Mary grabs his arm, which causes him to bottle to slip out of 
           his mouth, vodka dribbles onto his shirt.

                                 PETER
                        OH! You lost! 

                                 PATRICK
                        Babe! You made me lose!

                                 MARY
                        It doesn’t matter, listen to me --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATRICK
                        Ugh, more talking. The only thing I 
                        need to listen to is life. 

           Mary stares at him, furious.

                                 MARY
                        You know what? You suck!

                                 PATRICK
                        Psh. What?

                                 MARY
                        You suck! You talk about life and 
                        spontaneity and adventure but all 
                        you care about is yourself. Mother 
                        was right. You’re a creep.

                                 PATRICK
                        At least I’m not some frigid bitch.

           Mary slaps him across the face. He smirks.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Nice try, but my face is numb.

           Mary pokes him in the eye.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        AH!

           She hurries off.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah walk away! I don’t need you! 
                        I’m a cool dude and my future is 
                        bright, baby! 

           A QUICK FLASH OF PATRICK’S LIFELESS BODY FLOATING IN A ROOM 
           FULL OF WATER. DON’T FEEL BAD FOR HIM. HE WAS A DOUCHE.

           Mary, panicking, doesn’t know what to do. Then she hears: 

                                 PATTY
                        So it’s been four nights of no 
                        porking, and I’m ready to throw 
                        myself off the ass of this boat.

           Mary sees Patty, who’s taking rips straight from a vodka 
           bottle and has cornered a NICE OLD WOMAN. Mary runs over. 

                                 MARY
                        Aunt Patty!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        Mary! Did you see the ship hit that 
                        big white water mountain? 

                                 MARY
                        No, but --

                                 PATTY
                        I wish we’d hit it harder. Rico 
                        said he would only fuck me if the 
                        Titanic sank. 

                                 MARY
                        Patty, I saw --

                                 PATTY
                        You know, it’s not fair. I’m a good 
                        person, and I deserve to get double-
                        porked by those dangerously 
                        handsome dangerous handsomes. 

                                 MARY
                        The ship is sinking!

           Patty stares at Mary. She blinks. What?

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I saw officers cutting down the 
                        lifeboats. 

                                 PATTY
                        Oh my god.
                             (then)
                        RICO!

                                 MARY
                        NO! We have to find Mother and Tim. 

                                 PATTY
                        Where are they?

                                 MARY
                        I don’t know -- it’s all my fault -- 
                        I got mother arrested and I let Tim 
                        storm off -- what if we can’t find 
                        them? What if they’re trapped?

           Mary cries. Patty places steadying hands on her shoulders.

                                 PATTY
                        We’ll find them. I promise. 

           Patty looks out the crowd of drunk steerage people.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        OY! Which of you lot has been 
                        arrested on this boat?

           Several people raise their hands.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Where did they take you?

                                 DRUNK MAN
                        The Master At Arm’s office. It’s 
                        down on E deck. Don’t say it looks 
                        like a jail, he’s sensitive!

                                 PATTY
                        Thank you! 

           Patty hands her vodka bottle to the Nice Old Woman.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Hold this. I have to go rescue my 
                        big sister and tiny nephew. 
                             (starts off, turns back)
                        I know exactly how much is in 
                        there, don’t you dare take a sip!

           Patty and Mary hurry off.

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mary and Patty race down a corridor.

                                 MARY
                        How are we going to find Tim? 

                                 PATTY
                        I’m sure he went for the treasure, 
                        so we just have to find the cargo 
                        hold. And I am VERY good at finding 
                        secret locations. I’ve found so 
                        many skeletons, all by accident.

           Patty opens the same Restricted door that Tim went through. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Ah, shit. This is a closet.

           The hatch is open. WATER RUSHES UP THE HATCH. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Well. That’s not great. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        What if he’s down there? What if 
                        he’s already --

                                 PATTY
                        No, shh, shut up. Sorry. But 
                        everything will be alright. We need 
                        to split up. You get your mother 
                        from the Master At Arms office. I 
                        will find Tim. Okay?

           Mary, fighting back tears, nods. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        We’ll meet at the lifeboats.

                                 MARY
                        Which lifeboats?

                                 PATTY
                        The starport ones.

                                 MARY
                        No, there’s no -- it’s starboard or 
                        port. Starboard is the right side, 
                        port is the left.

                                 PATTY
                        If you’re facing the front?

                                 MARY
                        Yes.

           Patty holds out her hands to orient herself for left and 
           right if you’re facing the front. She nods. Got it. 

                                 PATTY
                        Great! So we’ll meet at the 
                        starboard ones on the left.

                                 MARY
                        Right!

                                 PATTY
                        Great.

           Patty turns to run off.

                                 MARY
                        No, you mixed them up! Starboard is 
                        right, port is left. Meet at the 
                        port side lifeboats!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        Right! I mean, yes! 

                                 MARY
                             (tearing up)
                        I’m never going to see you again, 
                        am I? 

           Patty pulls Mary into a hug. 

                                 PATTY
                        No, don’t say that. I will see you 
                        again. At the port side lifeboats. 

           They pull out of the hug. Patty holds Mary’s shoulders and 
           looks her in the eye. It’s a meaningful moment.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        On the right.

                                 MARY
                        The left!

                                 PATTY
                        The left! See you there! 

           Mary and Patty run off in opposite directions.

           INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE - NIGHT

           Margaret, handcuffed to her chair, nervously fidgets. She 
           closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. 

                                 MARGARET
                        They’re fine. They’re fine. 

           She takes another deep breath. Settled. Her eyes pop open.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        But what if they’re not fine?

           She desperately tries to squeeze her hand through the 
           handcuffs, but it doesn’t work. She gives up. 

           There’s an OMINOUS GROAN from the ship. 

           Worried, Margaret drags the chair over to the office door. It 
           takes a lot of effort, the chair is well-made and nice wood 
           is heavy! She creaks open the door. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. CREW CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Margaret peaks into the hallway. There’s no one around. But a 
           CREW MEMBER hurries by, carrying life vests.

                                 MARGARET
                        Excuse me!

           The Crew Member turns, a bit startled.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        What’s that noise?

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        You need to get your life belt on, 
                        Miss, and come up to the deck. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Why, what’s happening?

           The Crew Member eyes Margaret suspiciously.

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        Where’s the Master At Arms? 

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s... he’s sleeping. Shh. 

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        Wake him. He’ll need to keep order 
                        among the crowds at the lifeboats.

                                 MARGARET
                        Lifeboats?!

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        Come on now, miss, I’ll take you --

           The Crew Member holds out his arm to usher Margaret, but she 
           shies further into the office, trying to hide her handcuffs. 

                                 MARGARET
                        No, that’s alright! When Mr. King 
                        wakes up we’ll be right behind you.

           The Crew Member stares at her, confused. Margaret panics.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I mean...
                             (flirty)
                        If he wakes up. 
                             (catching herself)
                        Because he’s so tired from all the 
                        fornicating we’ve been doing.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Margaret winks. The Crew Member nods, confused, and hurries 
           off. Margaret slams the door in a panic.

           INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE - NIGHT

           Margaret drags the wooden chair over to a case of keys on the 
           wall. She clocks her silver handcuffs, then scans the keys.

                                 MARGARET
                        Damn! Only brass ones!

           She looks at the chair, not knowing what to do.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Father, give me strength.

           She picks up the wooden chair, takes one step, and collapses.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Little more strength, please, 
                        Father!

           She drags the chair through the door.

           INT. STEERAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mary hurries down the hallway. She turns a corner to get to a 
           staircase, but it’s blocked off. People clamor at the gate.

           A NASALLY CREW MEMBER is on the other side of the gate.

                                 NASALLY CREW MEMBER
                        We have to load the First and 
                        Second Class passengers first, and 
                        then it will be your turn.

           Mary pushes her way through the crowd to get to the gate.

                                 MARY
                        Sir, please, I need to get to the 
                        Master At Arms office --

                                 NASALLY CREW MEMBER
                        Don’t crowd the gate, miss. Go back 
                        down the main stairwell.

                                 SAD WOMAN
                        The main stairwell’s blocked!

                                 NASALLY CREW MEMBER
                        It will be unblocked when it’s your 
                        turn to load into the boats. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 VERY ANGRY MAN
                        If you’re going to trap us down 
                        here, why not just open all the 
                        windows so we can drown faster?! 

           Mary hurries back downstairs and back the way she came. She 
           gets to a CREW STAIRWELL that goes DOWN. 

           Mary pauses at the top of the stairs. She sees ankle-deep 
           water at the bottom. She steels herself and hurries down. 

           INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

           Tim desperately tries to open a heavy door. There’s a thin 
           layer of watering covering the floor where he is, it’s rising 
           fast. Across the cargo hold, water is RUSHING IN. 

           Tim tries to turn the wheel-lock on the door, but he’s not 
           strong enough. He’s pressed up against the door, using all 
           his weight, when he hears, faintly:

                                 PATTY (O.S.)
                        TIM! TIM!

           Tim presses his ear harder to the door.

                                 PATTY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        GODDAMNIT TIMOTHY O’MALLEY WHERE 
                        THE FUCK ARE YOU?!

                                 TIM
                        AUNT PATTY!

           Tim bangs on the door.

           INT. CREW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Patty hurries down a corridor. She stops.

                                 TIM (O.S.)
                        I’M IN HERE!

           Patty runs to the door and bangs on it.

                                 PATTY
                        TIM! Yes! I knew I was good at 
                        finding things!  

                                 TIM (O.S.)
                             (short pause)
                        Yeah, okay, help me open the door! 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Patty pulls on the door but it does nothing. 

                                 PATTY
                        Is there another way out?

                                 TIM (O.S.)
                        No! The water’s coming in fast!

                                 PATTY
                        Alright -- okay -- alright! Is 
                        there anything you can use to break 
                        through the wall? Like a ram? Or a 
                        cannon?! A cannon would be great --

           TIM’S SWORD pokes through the wall, near Patty. She jumps.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Yes! Great! Stab it again!

           The sword disappears, then reappears, making another tiny 
           hole right next to the first hole. 

           Patty sees WATER CREEPING DOWN THE HALLWAY TOWARDS HER. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        We need to move a little faster, 
                        Tim! Is there anything bigger?

           INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

           The water is almost to Tim’s knees. He rips the sword out of 
           the wall and frantically looks around for something bigger. 
           He lands on something and runs for it.

           INT. CREW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Patty’s tugging on the door. She’s standing in water.

                                 PATTY
                        Come on, come on --

           Nothing. She pounds on the door.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Have you found anything Tim?
                             (beat)
                        Tim? TIM!

           A FANCY OLD CAR RAMS THROUGH THE WALL.

           Tim sits in the driver’s seat, delighted. He’s got the top 
           hat, overcoat and sword. He looks like an insane prince.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 TIM
                        That was amazing!

           Patty stares, stunned. Then she lets out a big laugh.

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah it was!

                                 TIM
                        Do you want to try?

                                 PATTY
                        Hell yes I do!

           She climbs into the completely demolished car, then stops.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        No, wait, the ship is sinking. Okay 
                        no, we’ve got to go. Come on!

           They run off. 

           INT. CREW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Margaret lugs her chair down a hallway. She’s exhausted. 
           William rounds a corner.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Margaret!

                                 MARGARET
                        William? What are you doing here?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I was worried you’d get trapped in 
                        the Master At Arms office, so I 
                        came to get you.

                                 MARGARET
                        You came down here to rescue me 
                        even though I made such a scene and 
                        caused you to get slapped?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh I get slapped all the time.

           Margaret looks up at him, no idea what to even say.

                                 MARGARET
                        Thank you.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 WILLIAM
                        No thank you necessary. It’s my job 
                        to take care of guests.

           Margaret smiles. What a nice guy.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Even the drunken steerage ones.

           Her smile fades. That’s not how she likes to be thought of.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Are you trying to steal this chair?

                                 MARGARET
                        No! He handcuffed me to it, I 
                        couldn’t find the key.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’ll have to break it.

           He picks it up. 

                                 MARGARET
                        No, wait! What if they make me pay 
                        for it? 

           The ship is crumbling around them. William holds for laughs.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t think they’ll notice. 

           He throws the chair HARD against the wall, which pulls 
           Margaret too. The chair breaks, Margaret hits the wall HARD.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Oh! I’m terribly sorry!

           Margaret holds her face in pain. The handcuffs hang from her 
           wrist, the end that was attached to the chair now dangling.

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s alright. 

           William quickly ushers Margaret down the hallway.

                                 WILLIAM
                        They’re not letting steerage 
                        passengers onto the lifeboat decks, 
                        but I can get you up there through 
                        the crew passages --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        I need to get my children first. 
                        They’ll be somewhere in steerage -- 

                                 WILLIAM
                        All the stairwells are blocked, the 
                        only way to get to steerage is to 
                        go all the way down to the crew 
                        level and come back up, but --

                                 MARGARET
                        How do I get to the crew level?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s probably flooded by now --

                                 MARGARET
                        William. I have to get my children.

           She’s resolved. She will do this. William sees that.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Come on.

           He leads her to a UTILITY CLOSET. He pulls out three life 
           jackets -- all that’s left. He hands them to her.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Take these.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where do I go?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ll take you. I just want you to 
                        have these in case we get 
                        separated. Put them on, it’ll be 
                        easier than carrying them.

           William helps her put on three life jackets. She looks like 
           the Michelin Man.

                                 MARGARET
                        You don’t have to come with me. 
                        It’s dangerous.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s my job to help the guests.
                             (a bit more lovingly)
                        Even the drunken steerage ones.

           Margaret winces. Really doesn’t feel great. They head off.

           INT. LOWER CREW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Mary wades through chest-deep, freezing water. 

                                 MARY
                        Mother! MOTHER!

           She passes an UNBLOCKED STAIRWELL. She pauses, unsure if she 
           should go up or keep looking for Margaret. As she’s stopped, 
           the current PUSHES HER FORWARD. She gets thrown underwater. 

           She struggles to the surface and GASPS for air, but the 
           current pushes her further down the hallway. She manages to 
           GRAB ONTO A CEILING BEAM to anchor herself. 

           The water is almost at the ceiling. She can’t go further. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        MOTHER!

           Mary coughs up water. Desperate, she follows the beam back to 
           the stairwell. She dives for it and GRABS THE BANNISTER.

           Mary climbs up the steps. She collapses and coughs up more 
           water. She’s shivering and terrified. 

           Grasping the bannister, she cries, not knowing what to do. 
           The rising water hits her feet. She jumps, forced back to 
           reality. She runs up the stairs.

           INT. DIFFERENT CREW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Margaret and William hurry down a flight of stairs.

                                 MARGARET
                        Thank goodness, it’s not flooded.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We have to go down one more --

           They turn to go down another stairwell and it is COMPLETELY 
           FLOODED. [INSERT HANS ZIMMER BWOM]

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Oh. That’s... not great.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s okay. I can hold my breath for 
                        almost twenty seconds. I’m sure 
                        that’s enough.

           She takes a HUGE DEEP BREATH and heads for the stairs.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 WILLIAM
                        There’s no use going down there.

                                 MARGARET
                        Is there another way?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s all blocked off.

                                 MARGARET
                        Then I have to go down there.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’ll die!

                                 MARGARET
                        Then I’ll die with my family!

           That hits Margaret. She tears up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What if they’re not down there? 
                        What if they found a way out? You 
                        can drown looking for them, or you 
                        can hope to find them upstairs. 

           Margaret considers, then shakes her head. She can’t leave. 
           She can’t. She turns to go down the stairs. Then stops. The 
           water is too high. She can’t do that either. 

           She takes a deep, shuddering breath. Closes her eyes. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Please. Find me at the lifeboats.

           She turns to William, terrified, but ready to go. He holds 
           out his hand. She takes it. They run up the stairs.

           EXT. STEERAGE DECK - NIGHT

           Mary runs out onto the steerage deck, which is MUCH closer to 
           the water than before. She’s freezing and terrified. She 
           hurries to the upper decks, where the lifeboats are loading.

           EXT. UPPER DECK - NIGHT

           Mary fights through a crowd of people, searching for Patty, 
           Tim, Margaret. None of them are there. 

           Mary panics. She’s lost. She’s alone. She’s --

           ALMOST STABBED BY A SWORD?!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Tim’s sword JUTS THROUGH A DOOR RIGHT IN FRONT OF MARY. He 
           and Patty walk through. 

                                 PATTY
                        I don’t think we need the sword 
                        anymore, all these doors seem to be 
                        open -- Mary!

           Mary hugs Patty and Tim. A man who looks like a NEW YORKER 
           CARTOON BILLIONAIRE walks by and stops short.

                                 NEW YORKER CARTOON BILLIONAIRE
                        Hey! That’s my sword!

           He takes it from Tim in a big harumph and walks away.

                                 PATTY
                        Jesus Christ, you’re frozen! Tim, 
                        give her your coat.

           Tim begrudgingly takes off his coat.

                                 TIM
                             (grumbling to himself)
                        Losing all my treasure. 

           Patty wraps the coat around Mary.

                                 PATTY
                        Where’s your mother?

                                 MARY
                        The water was too high, I didn’t 
                        know what to do --

           Mary’s crying. Patty’s worried, but she tries to hide it. 

                                 PATTY
                        That’s alright. I’m sure she found 
                        her own way out.

                                 MARY
                        Even if she got out of the office, 
                        she would never come up without us. 
                        She’ll die looking for us! And it’s 
                        all my fault! 

                                 PATTY
                        She’s not going to die. I will find 
                        her, I promise. But first we need 
                        to get you two on a lifeboat.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Patty pulls Mary and Tim to the front of a crowd by a 
           lifeboat. FIRST OFFICER WILLIAM MURDOCH helps women and 
           children into the boat.

                                 WILLIAM MURDOCH
                        Women and children only please!

                                 PATTY
                        Here’s two!

           She pushes Mary and Tim forward. Murdoch helps Mary into the 
           boat, but then reaches past Tim for another woman.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        What about him?! He’s a child! 

           Murdoch looks Tim over. Tim is still wearing the top hat.

                                 WILLIAM MURDOCH
                        Looks like a man to me.

           Tim looks to Patty, excited.

                                 TIM
                        He thinks I’m a man! 

           Mary, snapping out of her daze, looks up from the lifeboat.

                                 MARY
                        No, wait! He has to come with me --

           Murdoch isn’t listening, just pulling more women and children 
           into the boat. Mary stands and grabs the edge of the Titanic.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        He has to come with me!

                                 PATTY
                        Sit down, it’s okay. He’ll get on 
                        the next one. I’ll make sure of it.

                                 MARY
                             (crying)
                        I can’t do this -- 

           The lifeboat lowers. Mary loses her footing and falls into a 
           seat. She looks up at Patty and Tim. They’re all terrified.

                                 PATTY
                        It’s okay, Mary, it’s okay.

           Mary’s crying, eyes fixed on Patty and Tim as they get 
           farther and farther away and the beautiful non-diagetic flute 
           notes of Celine Dion’s greatest song reach into our hearts. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET (O.S.)
                        PATTY!

           Margaret and William run through the crowd towards them.

                                 MARY
                        Mother?!

           Mary’s lifeboat is level with a lower deck. Without thinking, 
           she leaps onto the Titanic, STRAIGHT INTO THE CRYING CHILD 
           SHE HAS REPEATEDLY TERRORIZED, ACCIDENTALLY TACKLING HER. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’m so sorry!

           The Crying Child runs away, screaming. (Don’t worry, she is 
           the child that gets saved by Billy Zane. Thanks Billy!)

           ON THE UPPER DECK

           Margaret, Patty, Tim, and William look over the railing, 
           having just seen Mary jump off the lifeboat.

                                 MARGARET
                        MARY!

           They run off to find her. 

                                 ASTONISHED BYSTANDER
                        Jesus Christ! She’s the second one 
                        to do that! What is wrong with 
                        these people, they’re very stupid?!

           EXT. LOWER DECK - NIGHT

           Patty, Margaret, Tim, and William run down a lower deck. Mary 
           runs straight into hugging Margaret.

                                 MARY
                        I’m sorry! I’m sorry I got you 
                        arrested! I’m a horrible daughter! 

                                 MARGARET
                        I can’t believe you’re here.

                                 MARY
                        I thought I’d never see you again! 
                        I’m so sorry, for everything --

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re together now. That’s all that 
                        matters.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Margaret pulls Tim and Patty into the hug. William stands 
           awkwardly outside of it, rocking back on his heels, not 
           wanting to intrude.

           Margaret pulls out of the hug and quickly removes her life 
           jackets. She gives two to Mary and Tim. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Take these. We have to get to a 
                        lifeboat. 

                                 TIM
                        They won’t let me on. They said I’m 
                        not a child!

                                 MARGARET
                        If anyone tries to tell me that 
                        you’re not a child, I’ll punch them 
                        in the face. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        There aren’t enough boats for all 
                        the passengers, we must hurry.
                             (to Tim and Mary)
                        Ah, terribly sorry, we have not 
                        been formally introduced. I am 
                        William. I open the door to the 
                        First Class Lounge.

           Margaret hands Patty the third life jacket.

                                 MARGARET
                        Put it on, hurry.

                                 PATTY
                        No, you keep it.

                                 MARGARET
                        Patty, please, you’re my sister, I 
                        have to take care of you --

                                 PATTY
                        You have enough to take care of.

           Patty pushes the life jacket back to Margaret.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be fine.

           Margaret relents and puts the life belt on. She follows her 
           family to a staircase that is blocked off by a gate. William 
           opens the gate with a flourish, they all hurry through.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           EXT. UPPER DECK - NIGHT

           Pure chaos. People running, screaming. But the string quartet 
           is still playing so that’s nice.

                                 MARY
                        Where are all the lifeboats?! 

           William runs ahead to check for boats. Margaret climbs onto a 
           box and scans the crowd. She sees that the bow is further 
           into the water than the stern. William comes back.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I have good news and bad news. The 
                        bad news is that all the boats are 
                        gone. But the good news is that we 
                        are alive.
                             (catches himself)
                        For now. Um. Ha. Well. I don’t know 
                        why I brought that up.

           Margaret jumps down from her perch.

                                 MARGARET
                        The front is lower than the back. 

                                 PATTY
                        Just like an old lady.
                             (off their looks)
                        Like when your tits are so saggy 
                        they go below your butt.
                             (off their looks)
                        Why is everyone looking at me like 
                        I’m crazy? Has no one ever seen a 
                        naked old lady before?

           One of the smokestacks SNAPS OFF AND FALLS. (RIP Fabrizio)

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhh boy. This thing’s crumbling 
                        faster than a cracker.

                                 TIM
                        If there aren’t any boats left, 
                        what do we do? 

           Mary and Margaret share a look -- what do they do? 

                                 MARGARET
                        We stay on the ship as long as we 
                        can. There must be another ship 
                        coming to rescue us, we just have 
                        to wait for it to get here.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The ship LURCHES, going up at an angle. Tim and Mary are 
           knocked down, and slide down the deck. Patty grabs Mary and 
           Mary grabs Tim. They pull each other up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We have to get as far aft as 
                        possible!

           They struggle up the now inclined ship, fighting through a 
           crowd trying to get higher. As they push through:

                                 TIM
                        I wish I still had my sword.

           A HAND grabs Patty’s shoulder.

                                 PATTY
                        GET OFF! GET OFF OF --

           Patty turns to shove the person, but stops when she sees it’s 
           the NICE OLD WOMAN, who hands Patty her vodka bottle.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, thank you! 

           Patty checks the bottle. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you drank some!

           The Nice Old Woman shrugs coyly.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh, that’s alright. Best of luck 
                        to you! 

           The Nice Old Woman shakes her head and waves that off. She 
           knows there’s no way she’ll survive this, but that’s fine. 

           EXT. TITANIC BUTT - NIGHT

           They get to the back of the Titanic and grab the railing. 

                                 PATTY
                        Margaret, you better start praying 
                        that the rescue ship is close. I’d 
                        do it but God doesn’t listen to me.

           Margaret takes in the scene. It doesn’t look good. She turns 
           to Patty, so much to say. Patty shares the look and nods.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m -- 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t, Margaret.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m so sorry --

                                 PATTY
                        There’s nothing to be sorry for --

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m so sorry you didn’t get to fuck 
                        those twins.

           They can’t help but laugh with each other.

           But then the ship snaps in half and everybody screams.

           The back of the ship FALLS BACK DOWN TO THE WATER. 

                                 PATTY
                        This is good, right?! Being flat on 
                        the water is good, right?! 

           The ship LURCHES AGAIN and ANGLES DOWN TOWARDS THE WATER.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Oh well then fuck me I guess! 

           Tim notices Jack, a little ways away, climbing over the 
           railing to the outer edge. Tim climbs over the railing too.

                                 MARGARET
                        Tim! What are you doing?

                                 TIM
                        It’s what Jack’s doing!

                                 MARY
                        Who’s Jack?

                                 TIM
                        My friend who showed me naked lady 
                        drawings and told me where I could 
                        steal all those King’s items. I 
                        trust him!

           TRUDY (Rose’s maid) falls and slides down the ship to her 
           death. Bye Trudy! 

           Margaret, Patty, Mary, and William quickly climb over to join 
           Tim on the other side of the railing. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s a good idea, but I still don’t 
                        want you talking to him. 

           They brace themselves on the railing. The ship BEGINS TO 
           LOWER INTO THE WATER.

           Mary and Tim share a look of sheer terror. Mary places her 
           hand on top of Tim’s on the railing. Tim turns to Margaret 
           and places his hand on tops of hers. She puts her hand on top 
           of Patty’s. Patty turns to William, hesitates.

                                 PATTY
                        I don’t really know you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You don’t have to hold my hand.

           Patty turns back to the family. They’re not ready for this. 
           But they’re facing it. Together. Just like in Toy Story 3!!

           They all turn to face the water, which is fast approaching.

                                 PATTY
                        Fuck.

                                 MARGARET
                        Ohhhhhhhh fuck.

           William eyes this and shakes his head. Drunk steerage people.

           As the ship draws closer to the water:

                                 PATTY
                        FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! 

                                 MARGARET
                        OH FUCK. OH FUCK LORD.

                                 MARY
                        FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK --

                                 TIM
                        LET’S FUCKING DO THIS, OCEAN!

           AND THEY’RE UNDERWATER

           It’s CHAOS. People swirling everywhere, the suction of the 
           ship pulling people down -- 

           Margaret tries to swim but the suction is too strong! She 
           kicks as hard as she can for the surface --
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           -- which is FULL of people scrambling, Margaret gets kicked 
           HARD IN THE HEAD. She’s out cold. Completely still, she 
           drifts down... deeper into the water... 

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Tim bursts through the surface, in a melee of screaming 
           people. He gasps for air. He looks around for his family, but 
           they aren’t there.

           He’s a frightened little boy in a sea of terrified adults.

           He doggy-paddles through the crowd, searching. WILLIAM 
           surfaces next to him. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ah! Hello, young sir. Do you 
                        remember me? From the First Class --

                                 TIM
                        I need to find my family!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Right! 

           Patty pops up nearby. 

                                 PATTY
                        FUCK IT’S COLD!

                                 TIM
                        Patty!

                                 PATTY
                        TIM!

           Patty tries to swim over to Tim, but there are too many 
           people in the way, clawing, scrambling, trying to rip life 
           vests off each other.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming Tim!

           Patty starts just punching people in the face to get them out 
           of the way. With every punch:

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry! I know you’re just trying to 
                        survive, but I have to get through!
                             (punches someone)
                        You actually deserved that, you’re 
                        being a cunt!
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Patty gets to Tim. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Are you alright? 

                                 TIM
                        Where’s Mother and Mary? 

           UNDERWATER

           Margaret, lifeless, fading into the dark ocean, hands limp, 
           handcuffs dangling from her wrists... 

           ANOTHER HAND GRABS THE OTHER END OF THE HANDCUFFS.

           IT’S MARY.

           Mary squeezes her hand through the loose handcuff and swims 
           for the surface, straining to pull Margaret with her --

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Mary breaks through the surface and GASPS for air. She pulls 
           Margaret up and frantically looks around. She spots PATTY.

                                 MARY
                        PATTY!

                                 PATTY
                        MARY! YOU’RE ALIVE! 

           Patty, William, and Tim swim over to her. 

                                 MARY
                             (out of breath)
                        These lifebelts are shit!

                                 TIM
                        What’s wrong with mother?

                                 MARY
                        I don’t know, I saw her in the 
                        water, getting sucked down --

           Margaret’s lifeless body coughs up water. Gross! 

                                 PATTY
                        Oh thank hell, she’s still alive.

           Patty struggles to tread water.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        We need something to rest on. You 
                        can’t stay afloat on your own.

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t worry about me. We’ve got to 
                        focus on your mother.

                                 MARY
                        You’ll drown!

                                 PATTY
                             (drowning)
                        No, I’m fine.

           Mary hooks her arms under Patty’s arms, and pulls her along.

                                 MARY
                        Come on, there must be some deck 
                        pieces or something we can use. 

           William and Tim pull Margaret, still unconscious, through the 
           water. They get away from the crowd and find a FLOATING DOOR.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Here!

           Mary pushes Patty onto the door. Patty pulls Margaret onto 
           it, then reaches for Tim. But Tim tips it.

                                 PATTY
                        We’re too much weight. Here, Tim.

           Patty slides off.

                                 MARY
                        No, Patty --

                                 PATTY
                        You two are more important. Get on 
                        there! 

           Patty gives her Margaret’s stern mom glare. Mary knows 
           there’s no arguing with that. She takes off her lifebelt.

                                 MARY
                        At least take my lifebelt.

                                 TIM
                        Wait! This door doesn’t float 
                        enough, but what if we use the 
                        lifebelts to make it floatier?
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        What do you mean?

                                 TIM
                        Like this.
                             (to Margaret)
                        Sorry, mother, just need a minute.

           Tim shoves Margaret off the door. She lands face down in the 
           water. Patty quickly corrects that.

           Tim takes off his lifebelt, then grabs Mary’s.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        William, lift up the door.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Lifting a door? This is new.

           William holds up the door. Tim puts his and Mary’s lifebelts 
           under it and wraps the straps around. Mary and William help 
           tie it up. Patty holds Margaret and struggles to stay afloat.

                                 MARY
                        Tim, you’re a genius!

           Mary climbs onto the door, then helps Tim onto it. She pulls 
           Margaret and Patty on, then turns to William. But it is very 
           obvious that William will not fit.

                                 WILLIAM
                        There’s no room. It’s alright.
                             (drowning)
                        I can float.

                                 PATTY
                        Here.

           Patty undoes Margaret’s lifebelt and tosses it to William.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I think she fancies you. She’d be 
                        pissed if we just let you die. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Thank you, that’s very kind.

           He puts the lifebelt on. 

           Mary, shivering, looks out at the crowd of people. It’s 
           noticeably stiller, quieter. Cause everyone’s dead.

           Margaret stirs.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY
                        Margaret?

           Margaret holds her throbbing head.

                                 MARGARET
                        What happened?

                                 PATTY
                        You drowned a little, but Mary 
                        found you and pulled you out.

           Margaret looks to Mary, touched and proud.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        And then I was drowning a little, 
                        and Tim made us this raft.

           Margaret looks to Tim, touched and proud.

                                 MARGARET
                        You two saved me? 

           She pulls the kids into a hug.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Oh heavens, you’re shaking.

           She pulls them closer. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Come here, we have to huddle for 
                        warmth. Patty, get in.

           Patty hugs Margaret, taking the outside of the group hug. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                             (gasp)
                        Where’s William?

           Mary looks over at William, who is floating in a little ball, 
           completely blue and frozen. He’s dead.

           Margaret follows Mary’s gaze and sees William’s body.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Oh, William...

           William’s eyes drift open. He’s just ALMOST dead.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes? How may I be of service?
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh! I thought you’d died!

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, no, I’m just very tired. I had 
                        a long day.

           William smiles politely.

                                 TIM
                        Is there really a rescue ship 
                        coming to save us, mother?

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes, Tim. Someone’s coming.

           Margaret and Mary share a look. They both know Margaret 
           doesn’t believe that. 

           A long, heavy silence passes. 

                                 MARY
                        Whose name can be rearranged into 
                        the phrase “Crafts in a Sin”?

           A shorter silence passes.

                                 TIM
                        Saint... Farts?

                                 MARGARET
                        Saint Francis.

                                 MARY
                        Mum wins.

           Margaret smiles, but it is VERY cold. They’re all dangerously 
           shivering, especially Patty.

           Some time goes by.

           All is still. Eerily calm.

           William is certainly dead.

           Then, in the distance... 

           A lifeboat comes back. It’s manned by IOAN GRUFFUD, who is a 
           featured extra in Titanic but will later go on to play Mr. 
           Fantastic in Fantastic 4. The only fantastic thing about that 
           is that a man named Ioan Gruffud could headline a movie.

           Anyway, the lifeboat comes back.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 IOAN GRUFFUD
                        Is there anyone alive out there?!

           William, remarkably not actually dead yet, looks up.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (so hoarse, so near death)
                        Oh!

           He struggles to turn himself to face Margaret and her 
           children. In the struggle, he accidentally touches AINSLEY’S 
           FROZEN DEAD BODY. It SHATTERS. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Whoops.

           William splashes away the pieces of Ainsley’s shattered body. 
           He looks to the family, who is all slumped together. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                             (so hoarse, so near death)
                        I’m... h-happy to... rep-port that 
                        a... l-lifeboat has returned.

           Mary, Tim, and Margaret perk up. Margaret shakes Patty. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Patty, there’s a boat.

           Patty does NOT look well. Mary and Tim wave to the lifeboat.

                                 MARY/TIM
                        OVER HERE!

           The boat looks like it’s coming to them, but then a WHISTLE 
           BLOWS a little bit away, and the boat turns.

                                 MARY
                        NO! COME HERE FIRST!

                                 MARGARET
                        Patty, stay with us.

           Patty’s drifting off to sleep/death. Margaret shakes her.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        No, no -- Patty! You should have 
                        been on the inside of the huddle, 
                        there’s no warmth on the outside --

                                 PATTY
                             (shivering, dying)
                        But then... 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        wh-who would have gone on the 
                        outside? You? You’re too skinny. 
                        Tim has bigger tits.

           Margaret can’t help but laugh.

                                 TIM
                        HELP! OVER HERE!

                                 MARY
                        They can’t hear us. We need a 
                        whistle! 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh! I have a whistle!

           William, PAINFULLY SLOWLY because he is almost completely 
           frozen, pulls out a whistle...

           Then PAINFULLY SLOWLY raises it to his lips...

           Then PAINFULLY SLOWLY takes a big breath...

           MARY swims up, grabs the whistle, and blows it.

           The LIFEBOAT TURNS TOWARDS THEM.

                                 MARGARET
                        They’re coming, Patty! 

           Patty slumps against Margaret. The lifeboat drifts up.

                                 IOAN GRUFFUD
                        My god, there’s five of them! 

           Two men reach forward to pull Tim onto the lifeboat. Then 
           Mary. Margaret hoists Patty up and pushes her towards them.

           Patty is near death. She looks up at the sky, beyond the 
           lifeboat, the light from the stars almost blinding her. She 
           gets a faint little smile, as if she knows she’s about to die 
           and is fine with it. But then...

           FOUR HANDS reach toward her. Manly hands. They pull her onto 
           the lifeboat. They lay her down on the ground. 

           TWO FACES lean in to inspect her. 

           It’s the TWINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                                 RICO
                        She’s frozen. She needs body heat.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Tony and Rico exchange a look. They nod. Then strip. Patty is 
           totally blissed out. The naked twins undress her. They spoon, 
           naked, using the twin’s clothes as a blanket.

           EXT. CARPATHIA - DAY

           The Titanic survivors are on the deck of the Carpathia. And 
           it’s raining. As if they haven’t been through enough!

           Tim and Patty look around at all the downtrodden survivors.

                                 TIM
                        Why are people so sad? We survived!

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah but a lot of people died.  

                                 TIM
                        Really??

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah, I think like, most people 
                        died.

                                 TIM
                        Wow. I had no idea. Everyone I know 
                        survived. 

                                 PATTY
                        That’s because you were looking 
                        after them. 

           And also because this ending couldn’t be a huge bummer. 

           Anyway, Tim smiles. Proud of himself. Then:

                                 TIM
                        I’m gonna go find Jack! 

           Tim runs off, excited to find his best friend, who is dead.

           WITH MARGARET

           Margaret looks out at the ocean. Mary walks up beside her.

                                 MARY
                        Are you alright?

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re worrying about me now?

                                 MARY
                        You are the one who almost drowned. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Margaret half-smiles, then looks away, mustering up the 
           courage to say something. She turns to Mary.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry I held onto you for too 
                        long, and kept you too close. 

                                 MARY
                        You were just worried about me 
                        because you love me, and I -- 

                                 MARGARET
                        I was worried about myself. I’ve 
                        been so lonely since your father 
                        passed, and I didn’t want to lose 
                        anybody else. 

           Margaret tears up. Mary’s never seen this before. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I was selfish. But I can’t be with 
                        you forever. I have to let you go. 

                                 MARY
                        You’re my mother. You’re always 
                        with me, even if you’re not right 
                        next to me. I love you, mum. 

           They hug. Over Margaret’s shoulder, Mary catches sight of 
           William, who is Forrest Gumping (sitting nicely on a bench.)

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad I don’t have to worry 
                        about you being alone when I go off 
                        traveling. Now that you’ve got 
                        William. 

           Mary nods to William. Margaret looks over. 

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s a nice man, isn’t he?

           A seagull lands next to William. He happily pets it. 

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, extremely.

           Mary looks at her mother smiling at William. She nudges her.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Tell him you love him.

                                 MARGARET
                        Mary, please. I barely know him.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Mary raises her eyebrows, doubtful. Margaret smiles in spite 
           of herself and walks over to William.

           The seagull flies away. William waves goodbye. Margaret sits. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Is everything alright with Mary?

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes.  William, I can’t thank you 
                        enough for saving me and my family.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It was my pleasure to be of 
                        service.

                                 MARGARET
                        You know, the Titanic doesn’t exist 
                        anymore. So you are out of a job, 
                        which means you don’t have to keep 
                        acting so... cordial.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Uh. Yes. Well. I suppose you’re --
                             (clears throat)
                        -- correct. So.

           He grabs her hand, then immediately takes his hand away.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, that was --

                                 MARGARET
                        It was nice.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh. Then...

           He slowly takes her hand again. They sit in silence together.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        So. Um. Have you ever been to New 
                        York before?

                                 MARGARET
                        No.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Me either. I look forward to 
                        exploring it with you. 

           Margaret smiles. What a nice thing to say.
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        I just hope I can keep up with your 
                        wildly degenerate lifestyle. 

           Margaret winces, but doesn’t know where to begin correcting.

                                 MARGARET
                        I think you’ll manage.

           A CARPATHIA CREW MEMBER comes up to Mary with a clipboard.

                                 CARPATHIA CREW MEMBER
                        Can I get your name please?

                                 MARY
                        Mary O’Malley.

                                 CARPATHIA CREW MEMBER
                        And are you traveling alone, miss?

           Mary turns back to look at Tim and Patty -- smiling, 
           laughing. And her mother, happy like never before.

                                 MARY
                        No.

           She turns back to face the approaching New York skyline. 

                                 CARPATHIA CREW MEMBER
                        Okay, so who are you traveling 
                        with? We’re trying to figure out 
                        who survived the -- eh, who cares.

           He walks off, ready to quit his job. 

           Mary looks up at the STATUE OF LIBERTY as they sail 
           underneath it. She smiles, excited for this new adventure.

           We hold on Mary’s smiling face, and it starts to fade. In the 
           fade, behind Mary and almost out of frame, Patty sees the 
           Statue of Liberty and SCREAMS IN TERROR.

           Mary’s smiling face fades into:

           OLD MARY’S SMILING FACE. EW!!!

           INT. BEAUTIFUL SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT - 1996

           Old Mary has finally finished her three-hour blah-blah about 
           the Titanic. She smiles to herself. 
                                     Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 OLD MARY
                        I know it’s not an epic romance, 
                        but... I like my story. Even if 
                        it’s just about a daughter learning 
                        what it means to be a family.

           Old Mary places her hand on Rebecca’s hand. It’s a tender, 
           loving moment. Except Rebecca is curled up on the couch, 
           watching Seinfeld, not listening.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        George is getting upset! 

           Old Mary leans back in her chair, smiling about a life well-
           lived. Some OLD FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS on the table next to her:

           Mary and Tim riding horses together.

           Mary and Margaret smiling on the front steps of their New 
           York apartment. 

           Mary and Tim on bikes. Rico, Tony, and Patty riding a three-
           person bicycle in the background.

           Mary, Margaret, Tim, William, and Patty at Coney Island. 
           Patty is visibly drunk and inexplicably topless, covering her 
           nipples with a double thumbs up.

           And finally, we land back on Old Mary, who has died. RIP.

                                 THE END
