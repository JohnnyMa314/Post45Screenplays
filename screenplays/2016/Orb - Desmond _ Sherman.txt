           FADE IN:

           On thousands of stars giving life to the sprawling night
           sky. A sight that fills anyone with awe and wonder.

           Moving down, we reveal --

           A RURAL HOUSE

           Illuminated amidst the darkness, every light on inside. A
           gentle breeze blows waves through the vast wheat fields
           surrounding it. But that's the only sound...

           It's eerily quiet.

           A LATE 1990s CAR drives down the gravel driveway and skids
           to a stop. DR. EDWARD FLETCHER (40s) steps out and hurries
           to the front door. Rings the doorbell. Looks through the
           screen into the house -- the front door standing open.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Hey Liz? Liz, I'm sorry. My shift
                        was about to end and then I had to
                        take someone straight into surgery. 

           No response from inside. He suddenly realizes how quiet it
           is. No voices. No television.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Liz? Mitchell?

           He rings the doorbell again.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Mitchell, you in there buddy? It's
                        dad. Mitchell?

           He looks back at the TWO OTHER PARKED CARS, uncertainty
           growing. Then tries the screen door. It opens and he steps
           inside --

           INT. RURAL HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           The screen door swings shut with a slam. Fletcher moves
           forward with caution. Something is very wrong here.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Mitchell? Liz? Brad? Anyone here?

           He sees the dining room table set for five. A pot of stew
           bubbling on the stove top in the kitchen. A pan of fresh
           rolls that looks like it just came out of the oven. A chopped
           salad on the counter. But no signs of life. 

           Unease growing, he makes his way through the house, glancing
           through doorways. But there's no one here.
           His eyes are drawn to FRAMED PHOTOS on the wall of a HAPPY
           FAMILY OF FIVE. Liz, her husband, two other kids, and the
           YOUNGEST SON, MITCHELL (8), whom Fletcher focuses on. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        Mitchell, where you at buddy?

           He moves through the house with more urgency. Opening every
           door. Searching every room.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Mitchell, where are you?! Mitchell?!

           Then he pushes through a closed door and freezes --

           We don't see what's in front of him. WE ONLY SEE HIS FACE as
           he's OVERCOME WITH HORROR AND REVULSION. The sight so
           terrifying, he can't even muster the will to scream.

           EXT. RURAL HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Fletcher stumbles outside, in a state of shock. He manages a
           few shaky steps and hunches over. Tears in his eyes. He's
           trembling all over. Then he throws up.

           Whatever he just saw in there, he'll never forget.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD -- NIGHT

           MITCHELL jerkily walks down the middle of the dark, empty
           road, the same YOUNG BOY from the photos. He's barefoot.
           Eyes completely disconnected from reality. BLOOD splattered
           on his clothes and face. But it's not his.

           The RED AND BLUE LIGHTS of a POLICE CAR illuminate the
           darkness behind him. Mitchell doesn't react, not breaking
           his unsteady gait. The car pulls to a stop and the OFFICER
           quickly climbs out, coming after the boy.

                                 OFFICER
                        Hey kid! Kid! Slow down!

           But Mitchell keeps moving.

                                 OFFICER
                        Are you Mitchell? Is your name
                        Mitchell Fletcher? Listen, just slow
                        down, son. Stop!

           He grabs Mitchell by the shoulders. Mitchell resists, focused
           on the road ahead.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Mitchell sits on the bed with his legs pulled up close, a
           blanket wrapped around him, held tight by Fletcher.
           The blood has been cleaned off, but the detachment is still
           present. OFFICERS and a DOCTOR stand nearby, talking to each
           other with heated restraint. We don't see their faces.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Did he see the person's face?

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        He hasn't said a word.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        He had to have seen someone.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        He's in a state of shock. Could be
                        hours. Could be days.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        I've got four bodies, doctor, we
                        need something. Anything.

           Fletcher glares in their direction.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Come on. This sort of thing takes
                        time.

           He ushers the officers out the door, leaving Fletcher and
           Mitchell alone.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Listen to me, Mitchell... You're
                        safe now. It's gonna be okay.

           He wraps his protective arms around his son.

                                 FLETCHER
                        You hear me? I'm not gonna let
                        anything else happen to you.

                                 MITCHELL
                             (whispers)
                        It's not time...

                                 FLETCHER
                        What?

           He leans closer.

                                 MITCHELL
                        It's not time...

           But Mitchell's not responding to his father. He's not saying
           it to anyone. Just staring away at nothing.
                                 FLETCHER
                        Not time for what?

                                 MITCHELL
                        It's not time... It's not time...

                                 FLETCHER
                        What is it not time for?

           Mitchell keeps repeating the phrase over and over. Fletcher
           stares, dread building.

                                                             CUT TO BLACK:

           TITLE OVER: 15 YEARS LATER

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- EVENING

           The setting sun's last rays cast a warm glow over the
           comfortable house that is cozily secluded in the forest, far
           from the nearest big city. A brisk breeze blows through the
           tall trees. It's beautiful out here. Peaceful and isolated.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- EVENING

           Several HALF-UNPACKED MOVING BOXES remain, but everything
           else is in its place. Inviting decor with lots of personal
           touches. FRAMED PHOTOS show a smiling young couple. At college
           graduation, on a road trip, in a concert hall, on their wedding
           day. The unmistakable glow of young love. A BABY GRAND PIANO
           a distinct fixture in the living room.

           Laughter and classic rock emanate from the nearby kitchen.
           They may have moved in recently, but they're already at home.

           KITCHEN

           Food sizzles in pans. Knives dice vegetables. Hands sprinkle
           seasoning over meat. They're making chicken cacciatore and
           it looks so good you can taste it.

           CLAIRE MORGAN (late 20s) moves effortlessly about the kitchen,
           head bobbing with the music. She's passionate and carefree as
           she tastes the sauce, then sprinkles a little of this, a dash
           of that, in no real order, but it all makes sense to her.

           By contrast, DAVID MORGAN (late 20s), is serious and focused,
           with a wry sense of humor that gives him charm. He slices
           onions with expert precision, wiping away tears from his eyes.

                                 DAVID
                        You know sweetie, I put the measuring
                        spoons in that drawer right by the
                        stove... So we could use them.
                                 CLAIRE
                        For what?

           She pulls out more jars of spice, seemingly at random, and
           adds them in. Tastes it, then tosses in more. David smirks.

                                 DAVID
                        Your grandma gave you her prized
                        cookbook as a wedding gift and all
                        you ever do is go off script.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Grandma was a master improviser.
                        It's in our blood. Half the recipes
                        in there were happy accidents anyway.

                                 DAVID
                        So that's why they taste different
                        every time.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's something we artists like to
                        call... Experimentation. But I know
                        that's a concept that scientists
                        have no understanding of.

           She smirks and glances over at him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh no David, the recipe specifically
                        calls for onions sliced into one
                        square centimeter cubes. You're gonna
                        have to start all over.

           He playfully glares, teary-eyed from the onions.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Love you, baby. Don't cry.

           She smiles and wipes his tears. Then scoops up a handful of
           onions and tosses them into the pot. David sighs. We get the
           sense this happens every night.

           INT. DINING ROOM -- LATER

           The dinner setting isn't particularly fancy. In fact, there
           are lit birthday candles clumped in the holders instead of
           candlesticks. But it's cute. Claire eyes David expectantly
           as he digs in, trying to hide the fact that he loves it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Say it...

                                 DAVID
                        What?
                                 CLAIRE
                        You know what...

                                 DAVID
                        I suppose it is rather... Pleasant
                        to my palate.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You mean it's 112% amazeballs.

                                 DAVID
                        The hint of Cajun seasoning is...
                        Unique.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was leaning more towards perfect.

                                 DAVID
                        But you know what's really making it
                        come together for me...
                             (takes another bite)
                        The onions. And their perfect
                        dimensions, no doubt.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No doubt.

                                 DAVID
                        Wanna know what else is amazeballs?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Tell me.

                                 DAVID
                        Listen.

           A moment passes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don't hear anything.

                                 DAVID
                        Right? No jackhammers. No honking
                        horns. No helicopters.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No annoying couple having sex on
                        that squeaky bed upstairs.

                                 DAVID
                        I thought you loved the sex noises.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Seriously, like five times a day!
                        How is that even physically possible?!
           David throws her a suggestive look, willing to try. She laughs. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Too bad we've already christened
                        most of the house... And you only
                        get to once.

                                 DAVID
                        We haven't christened the new washer
                        and dryer...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ooo, spin cycle? That's hot. Well if
                        you're feeling that feisty, we might
                        as well go right here.

           She presses down on the table, playfully testing its strength.

                                 DAVID
                        I can't do it where we eat.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So I guess the kitchen counter is
                        out then. And the couch.

                                 DAVID
                        But the floor's fair game.

                                 CLAIRE
                        The floor... Oh David. How romantic.
                             (overdramatic sigh)
                        In that case, let's just go to the
                        bedroom. Old school.

                                 DAVID
                        Honestly, I'm happy wherever... I
                        figure we can just see what happens.

                                 CLAIRE
                        See what happens?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

           And suddenly she understands what he's suggesting. There's a
           lot more history here.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David...

                                 DAVID
                        I know we're waiting. And I'll wait
                        however long we need to. I'm just
                        saying that... Maybe...
                                 CLAIRE
                        Maybe what?

           He reaches across the table and takes her hand.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe we're doing better now. Maybe
                        it's time.

           She looks down at the table, weighing the heavy prospect.
           Then meets his gaze. And after a long moment -- 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah...

           He smiles broadly, rising from his chair.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's just that...

           She pulls her hand away, taking another bite of dinner.

                                 CLAIRE
                        This chicken cacciatore is really...
                        Pleasant to my palate.

           She chews it lustfully.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And if I'm gonna be feeding two of
                        us, you're gonna have to get used to
                        me eating... Very... Very... Slowly.

           She cuts off another piece and takes an excruciatingly slow
           bite. Torturing him.

                                 DAVID
                        I hate you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That's called love.

           He leans over and kisses her. She kisses back, full of
           vibrance and passion. It's going to be a great night.

           INT. CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           David is asleep in bed, Claire snuggled up next to him.

           But her eyes are open. Something troubling her.
           She slowly gets out of bed, careful not to wake him. Shivering
           in the cold, wearing only a long t-shirt. She grabs her PURSE
           from on top of the dresser and steps into the --

           BATHROOM

           Claire quietly closes the door. She reaches into her purse
           and pulls out a small pack of BIRTH CONTROL PILLS, halfway
           through the month. She pops out the next pill. Stares at it
           for a long moment.

           Then puts the pill in her mouth, fills a cup under the faucet,
           and swallows.

           She takes in her reflection in the mirror, a lingering pain
           shining through. Tears begin to fill her eyes. But she fights
           them back with deep shaky breaths, trying to keep them buried.
           And she does. Breathing steady once again.

           EXT. DECK, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The door opens and Claire steps outside onto the deck, wearing
           pajama pants and pulling on a sweatshirt. She leans against
           the wooden rail, taking in the starry night sky. So many
           beautiful little dots.

           And yet, her sadness lingers. She stares away, trying to
           move past it. Then she sees something...

           High above, a STAR SHINES BRIGHTER than the others as it
           STREAKS across the night sky.

           A SHOOTING STAR.

           Whatever sadness Claire was feeling vanishes as she gazes
           up. A smile spreads across her face.

           Then ANOTHER SHOOTING STAR soars across the sky. And another.
           And another. It's a METEOR SHOWER.

           INT. CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Claire rushes to David, practically yanking him out of bed.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David! David, wake up!

                                 DAVID
                             (groggy)
                        What? What's wrong? Is it a spider?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Just come on! Hurry up!

           He stumbles out of bed, following her.
           EXT. DECK, MORGAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           The moment David steps outside, he instantly snaps awake.

                                 DAVID
                        Holy shit...

           High above, HUNDREDS OF SHOOTING STARS STREAK ACROSS THE
           NIGHT SKY.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Told you...

           She leans her head against his shoulder, absorbing the beauty.

                                 DAVID
                        I hadn't read anything about a meteor
                        shower --

                                 CLAIRE
                        Shh... You're killing it.

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry.

           They hold each other close, just taking it in.

                                 DAVID
                        You know... I think we're gonna be
                        okay here.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Me too.

           They smile, sharing a sweet kiss as the magical light show
           continues to fill the sky above.

           EXT. SMALL PRIVATE COLLEGE -- DAY

           Beautiful buildings in the Renaissance Revival style. Tall
           trees. Angular brick paths bisecting the lush, green lawns. 

           STUDENTS make their way across the quad, David amongst them
           in jeans and professorial tweed. Leather attaché case over
           his shoulder.

           INT. DAVID'S OFFICE, COLLEGE -- DAY

           David sits in front of his laptop. Engineering textbooks
           line the shelves. Photos of him and Claire on his desk.

           A knock on the open door as JOSH HANSON (late 20s) pokes his
           head in. He's the hip looking, low professor on the totem
           who could easily be mistaken for a grad student.
                                 JOSH
                        I see they'll give just about anyone
                        an office nowadays. And yours seems
                        to be bigger than mine, you asshole.

                                 DAVID
                        Didn't you get the memo? They hand
                        them out now based on intelligence.

                                 JOSH
                        Damn. That explains everything.

           They both laugh as David greets him with a bro hug.

                                 JOSH
                        I can't get over this look on you.
                        Seems like just yesterday you were
                        stumbling around after a keg stand
                        and hooking up with some hot music
                        major -- by the way, you know that'll
                        get you fired here, FYI.

                                 DAVID
                        You know I married that music major,
                        FYI. So how was your summer?

                                 JOSH
                        Enlightening. Thailand is incredible
                        when you're single. So many majestic
                        creatures.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't even want to imagine what
                        that means.

                                 JOSH
                        So how's Claire adjusting to the new
                        digs? She miss the symphony?

                                 DAVID
                        I thought it was gonna be a lot harder
                        for her to transition, but she's
                        really enjoying running her own
                        business. The house has been full of
                        students all summer. Forced us to
                        unpack a lot faster than I was
                        expecting.

                                 JOSH
                        Cool. I admit I wasn't sure how she
                        was gonna take it.

                                 DAVID
                        She needed a change. Honestly, we
                        both did.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I mean, you should see her now, it's
                        amazing. I mean, compared to two
                        years ago, she's just...

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        She's like the girl I married again.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Claire sits beside a TEENAGE GIRL playing Chopin's "Prelude
           in E minor." The girl is hesitant and pauses to find the
           right chords, but Claire nods along encouragingly, then turns
           the page for her.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- LATER

           A GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN in her 70s is now on the bench, playing
           Luigi Denza's "Funiculi, Funicula" rather stiffly. Claire
           paces behind her, wanting her to play better so badly.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        You know the notes Margaret. So I
                        want you to feel the song. It's a
                        happy song, a festive song. Let your
                        emotions guide the music.

           As the woman continues to play, she relaxes, and the song
           becomes more elegant and beautiful.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- LATER

           Claire sits on the piano bench beside ALAN (10), who stumbles
           through a harmonized version of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,"
           growing visibly frustrated.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Let's just take it measure by measure.

           She points to a measure on the sheet music and he plays the
           notes. Almost. Adjusts and gets them right.

                                 CLAIRE
                        There you go.
                             (next measure)
                        Pinky finger -- that's it.

           Next measure. The harmony is all wrong. Alan sighs.

                                 ALAN
                        Can we take a break now?
                                 CLAIRE
                        You're nervous, aren't you? About
                        the recital?

           A long moment, then Alan reluctantly nods.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You want to know something? I was
                        always nervous before my concerts
                        too. Sometimes I felt like I was
                        going to throw up. Once time I even
                        did on my brand new shoes.

           She smirks and Alan smiles a little.

                                 ALAN
                        But you always play so perfectly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No one plays perfectly. I've made
                        lots of mistakes. This one time, I
                        was sitting at the piano in front of
                        a concert hall full of people for
                        one of my final recitals in college,
                        and you know what happened... I froze.

                                 ALAN
                        You froze?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I mean, I completely forgot what I
                        was supposed to play. Not just a
                        note or two. All of it.

           Alan's jaw hangs open at the terrifying thought.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And you know what I did? I started
                        playing my own song instead. It was
                        uncomfortable at first, and a bit
                        silly, but eventually I found my
                        groove. And then something amazing
                        happened. The whole song that I was
                        supposed to play came back to me all
                        at once. I played it straight through 
                        and everyone loved it.

           Alan smiles, transfixed.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You see, that's what you do. When
                        you make a mistake or things go wrong,
                        you just have to keep going. 
                             (beat)
                        Now, what note is that?
                                 ALAN
                        G.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And did you know that when you walked
                        in the door six weeks ago?

                                 ALAN
                        No.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Exactly. You've come so far, and
                        you're doing incredibly well. So
                        what do you think we should do now?

                                 ALAN
                        Take it from the top?

           Claire nods with a smile. Alan plays the song, pushing through
           little mistakes as his confidence grows.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Alan runs around the front yard as ALAN'S MOM (30s) stands
           at the door with Claire.

                                 ALAN'S MOM
                        So does he need to wear anything
                        specific for the recital?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Whatever makes him comfortable. Some
                        kids wear suits. Others wear capes.

                                 ALAN'S MOM
                             (laughs)
                        I'm sure we'll find something. Might
                        have to come out of his older
                        brother's closet.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh and Donna, he's really nervous
                        about performing, so if you could
                        give him some extra encouragement
                        this week, I'm sure it'd help a lot.

                                 ALAN'S MOM
                        Of course.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Perfect. Bye Alan!

           Alan waves shyly. Claire watches as they walk towards their
           car, Alan's Mom putting her arm over his shoulder sweetly.

           It's enough to make Claire's smile fade.
           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY -- DAY

           Claire opens the door and steps into what is clearly her
           creative sanctuary. A comfy chair, desk, easel, some of her
           sketches and artwork on the walls. Music books on the shelves.

           But that's not what she's drawn to. There are a few remaining
           open moving boxes. She reaches into one, sorting through its
           contents. Looking for something. Then she finds it. Wrapped
           up in a protective layer of paper.

           She unwraps it to reveal a FRAMED PHOTO of her, David, and a
           NEWBORN BABY. Smiling, laughing, perfect. They all look so
           happy. A family with their whole life ahead of them.

           Claire gazes longingly at it, once again resisting the pain.

           EXT. FOREST TRAIL -- DAY

           Claire walks alone on a trail through the woods. It's calm
           and beautiful. But she doesn't seem to notice the scenery.
           Her thoughts wandering as she reaches a --

           STREAM

           It cascades down rocks, creating a small SERIES OF WATERFALLS.
           A beautiful and relaxing place secluded from the world.

           She takes a deep, soothing breath, looking over the scene.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (sotto)
                        We're gonna be okay.

           She sits on a fallen log, takes off her backpack and pulls
           out a sketch pad and case full of colored pencils. Then she
           puts pencil to paper, drawing the scene before her.

           EXT. FOREST TRAIL -- LATER

           Claire heads down the path towards home, backpack slung over
           her shoulder.

           A DISTANT SOUND catches her attention.

           She listens. What was that?

           Then she hears it again. Very faint. There's a melodious
           quality to it. Along with a twinge of fear. And pain. Almost
           like the whine of an animal in distress.

           Claire listens as the sound seems to come and go on the wind.
           Then she steps off the path, heading in its direction. She
           makes her way through the trees, the sound growing louder
           with every step. Until she emerges into a --
           FOREST CLEARING

           Sunlight reflects off something shiny on the ground just
           ahead. Claire curiously approaches and sees that it's a --

           SILVER METALLIC ORB

           About the size of a bowling ball. It's seamless, not a single
           line or crease anywhere on it. Distinctly out of place amidst
           the rich greens and browns of the forest. Sunlight glimmers
           off of its silvery surface, giving it a warm magical glow
           that beckons.

           Claire looks around, but the sound she heard is gone now.
           Only the wind blowing through the trees.

           Her gaze returns to the Orb. She reaches down and carefully
           lifts it off the ground. It's lighter than she expected. She
           looks it over, delicately rotating it.

           Then smiles, intrigued.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           The Orb now sits on the fireplace mantle near the piano. A
           new decoration. 

           Claire sits on the piano bench, playing a complex, classical
           piece that only a professional could handle. But there's a
           hesitancy in her movement, a sense of distraction.

           She hits the wrong key and stops. Takes a breath and starts
           over. Plays several more measures eloquently. Then another
           mistake.

           She takes her hands off the keys and sighs. Closes her eyes
           for a moment, focusing.

           Then begins again. Slower this time, building confidence
           with each new note. Picking up the pace now, getting
           comfortable. The piece has a sense of sadness to it, but it
           is also rising towards something bigger, more powerful.

           And slowly, we begin to see who Claire really is. A concert
           pianist who can command a symphony hall. Her fingers elegantly
           dancing over the keys. She's in her zone now.

           Until a CHORD ABRUPTLY SOUNDS OUT OF TUNE. Claire stops.

           She hits the same chord again, testing it. But something is
           strange about the way it sounds. Like there's something
           resonating in the air as she plays. She tries a different
           chord. Same effect.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What in the world...
           ANOTHER NOTE SUDDENLY SOUNDS OUT OF THIN AIR.

           Claire startles back and gasps. Then her eyes slowly rise...

           To the silver Orb sitting on the mantle. Did it just... It
           couldn't have.

           Then it VIBRATES, and from somewhere inside it, ANOTHER NOTE
           rings out.

           Claire stares, wide eyed. Then hesitantly plays another key.

           And the Orb responds with a similar note, tuned slightly
           differently.

           Claire hits the key again. The Orb responds, adjusting its
           tune as the note sounds. Closer this time.

           She plays it again. And this time, the Orb is perfectly in
           tune. The exact same note. An ethereal, harmonious quality
           to it, unlike any traditional instrument. Uniquely soothing
           to the ear. Claire can't take her eyes off of it, dumbfounded.

           She slowly plays the first few notes of "Twinkle Twinkle
           Little Star."

           And the Orb plays them back with its own special sound.

           Claire laughs out loud, enthralled.

           INT. FRONT ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE --  NIGHT

           David opens the front door and steps in, tired from his day.
           Claire greets him with a whirlwind of energy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You've gotta see this!

                                 DAVID
                        See what? Did you finish unpacking?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Better!

           She grabs him by the hand and pulls him into the --

           LIVING ROOM

           She leads him towards the piano.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Now just stand right there. Don't
                        move.

                                 DAVID
                        What is it?
                                 CLAIRE
                        You'll see.

           She sits on the bench, placing her hands over the keys before
           playing the first few notes of Beethoven's "5th Symphony."

                                 DAVID
                        I've heard you play Beethoven before.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Just listen.

           She stops playing. David stands there, waiting. Claire just
           smiles, staring at him. David laughs awkwardly.

                                 DAVID
                        So... Are you gonna keep playing --

           The next set of notes RING OUT OF THE SILENCE. David yells
           and jumps, startled. Claire bursts out laughing. He only now
           notices the Orb sitting on the nearby mantle.

                                 DAVID
                        What is that...

           He picks it up, looking it over curiously.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don't know, but it's awesome. Put
                        it down here.

           David sets it next to the music rack on the piano. Claire
           plays the next few measures. A moment later, the Orb vibrates
           as it responds with its own rendition.

                                 DAVID
                        That's incredible.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Wait, wait, it can do swing too.

           She begins playing "Sing Sing Sing" and the Orb responds,
           sounding along with her. David can't help but smile as Claire
           and the Orb play the song. You'd think they've been playing
           together for years.

                                 DAVID
                        Where'd you get it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I found it in the woods.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you mean you found it in the
                        woods?
                                 CLAIRE
                        I went for a walk out to the
                        waterfalls, and it was just lying
                        there. I thought it was pretty, so I
                        brought it back.

           She hasn't stopped playing, the Orb keeping perfect time.

                                 DAVID
                        And you have no idea what it is?

                                 CLAIRE
                        You're the engineer, you tell me.

           She stops playing as he takes a closer look at the Orb,
           spinning it around with his hands.

                                 DAVID
                        Well... It's some kind of metallic...
                        Orb?

                                 CLAIRE
                        That's the rocket scientist I married.

                                 DAVID
                        Shut it, music major.
                             (beat)
                        It looks like some super expensive
                        toy you'd find at a high end gadget
                        store. Like some funky Japanese music
                        box or something. Why would anyone
                        leave it out in the woods?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don't know, but I'm glad they did.
                             (beat)
                        You want to know what song it likes
                        the best? You'll never guess.

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Remember what was playing in the bar
                        when you first came up and talked to
                        me?

                                 DAVID
                        No way...

           Claire smiles as she plays the iconic intro to Guns N' Roses'
           "Sweet Child O' Mine." The Orb joins in, matching her tempo.

                                 DAVID
                        You've gotta be kidding me!
           David laughs, blown away. Claire and the Orb play the song
           together, Claire brimming with joy, completely in the moment
           as she sings along.

                                 CLAIRE
                        She's got a smile it seems to me,
                        reminds me of childhood memories,
                        where everything was as fresh as the
                        bright blue sky. 

           David watches, elated with how happy she is.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Now and then when I see her face,
                        she takes me away to that special
                        place, and if I'd stare too long I'd
                        probably break down and cry. Come
                        on, David!

           David joins in, quietly at first. Gradually getting more and
           more into it.

                                 CLAIRE/DAVID
                        Oh, oh, oh, sweet child o' mine! Oh,
                        oh, oh, oh sweet love of mine!

                                 CLAIRE
                        Watch, it'll go solo!

           She stops playing and the Orb keeps going, continuing to
           sound out the song. Claire and David watch, big smiles on
           their faces as they sing along.

                                 CLAIRE/DAVID
                        Oh, oh, oh, sweet child o' mine! Oh,
                        oh, oh, oh sweet love of mine!

           They keep singing, rocking out --

           But the song abruptly stops as the ORB SUDDENLY ROLLS TOWARDS
           THEM, STOPPING ON ITS OWN right at the edge of the piano.

           David and Claire leap back and scream.

           A few moments pass as they stare, catching their breath.
           Then they laugh nervously.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay seriously. What the hell is
                        this thing?

                                                                   CUT TO:
           INT. TRUCK STOP DINER -- NIGHT

           Somewhere off the beaten path. Mostly empty. Patrons converse
           quietly, minding their own business.

           A man in a dark jacket sits alone at the counter. We recognize
           his face - DR. FLETCHER (60s), the father from the beginning.
           But now his hair is ashen gray. Wrinkles frame his stern
           expression. A man who has not enjoyed life, but rather
           survived it. He clicks away on his LAPTOP, focused on the
           countless NEWS HEADLINES scrolling by in his feed.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Get ya some more coffee?

           Fletcher doesn't respond. Doesn't seem to hear her speak.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sir? Would you like some more coffee?

           He slides his cup towards her without looking up, continuing
           his search. She sighs, then refills it and goes on her way.

           Fletcher picks it up and slowly raises it towards his lips --

           Then freezes, staring.

           ON SCREEN: "UNEXPECTED METEOR SHOWER LIGHTS UP NIGHT SKY"

           Fletcher's hand begins to tremble ever so slightly. He's not
           awed by the beautiful imagery in the article. He knows exactly
           what this means.

           He sets down his cup, closes his computer, throws cash on
           the counter, and walks out the door, leaving his meal
           practically untouched.

           INT. CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           David sits on the bed with his laptop, clicking through a
           website showing PHOTOS OF A FAMILY in the 1970s posing with
           a SIMILAR LOOKING ORB. Claire gets ready for bed behind him.

                                 DAVID
                        So apparently, in 1974, near
                        Jacksonville, Florida, the Betz family
                        was out surveying their land after a
                        forest fire and came across a silver,
                        seamless, metallic ball... Orb...
                        Type thing. Then a few days later,
                        when the wife was playing her guitar,
                        it began to respond musically.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Shut up.
                                 DAVID
                        Not kidding. It also says it propelled
                        itself across the floor and caused
                        doors to open and shut. They called
                        it the Mystery Sphere.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So what was it?

                                 DAVID
                        That's the thing. No one seems to
                        know for sure. Most people thought
                        it was a hoax. Some thought it was a
                        piece of a satellite or some top
                        secret Russian technology.
                             (reads more)
                        Oh get this, one scientist, and I
                        use that term very loosely, concluded
                        that it had an atomic number greater
                        than plutonium and attempting to cut
                        it would set off an explosion on the
                        scale of a nuclear bomb.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So basically, you're saying we have
                        a doomsday device in our living room.
                             (smirks)
                        Sure beats a security system.

                                 DAVID
                        Looks like the general theory is it
                        was just some ball bearing from a
                        steel mill. Sounds like some fell
                        off a truck in the area a few years
                        earlier. This thing was about the
                        same size and shape.

                                 CLAIRE
                        A ball bearing that responds to music?
                        Those are some really fancy balls
                        for the seventies.

                                 DAVID
                             (laughs)
                        I'm just reading what it says.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So what happened to them?

                                 DAVID
                        The balls?

                                 CLAIRE
                        The Betz family.
                                 DAVID
                        Oh.
                             (scans article)
                        It doesn't really say. The story
                        just sorta ends...

           An unsettling moment.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I bet the Russians got 'em.

           David laughs.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           A SMARTPHONE CAMERA BEGINS RECORDING, showing David sitting
           on the floor next to the Orb.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Alright, this is experiment number
                        one involving our shiny new test
                        subject. The studly man you see before
                        you today is David Morgan. Amazing
                        professor. Mediocre chef.

                                 DAVID
                        Love you too, babe. 

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        So why don't you tell everyone what
                        wonders they're witnessing?

                                 DAVID
                        We're waiting... To see if it moves
                        again.

           He stares at the Orb expectantly. Nothing happens.

                                 DAVID
                        Science takes time.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Maybe it just needs a push.

           David pushes the Orb gently. It rolls a few feet then stops.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Or... Maybe not. Try calling to it.

                                 DAVID
                        Call to it? Like a dog?
                             (silly voice)
                        Come on shiny ball! Come on! Come
                        on! Come to dadda!
                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Very scientific, David --

           THE ORB SUDDENLY ROLLS BACK TOWARDS HIM. Claire yelps and
           jumps back with the camera.

                                 DAVID
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa!

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Holy shit! Holy shit!

           The Orb comes to a rest in front of him.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Do it again! Do it again!

           David moves to push it again but before he touches it, the
           ORB ROLLS AWAY ON ITS OWN.

                                 DAVID
                        What --

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Oh my God!

           The Orb gradually changes direction, and ROLLS TOWARDS CLAIRE,
           stopping at her feet.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Oh my God... David... David...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- LATER

           SMARTPHONE POV: Claire sets the Orb down at the beginning of
           an OBSTACLE COURSE. Various books, pillows and other objects
           arranged into a maze. The Orb begins to MOVE AGAIN.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Look at it! Look at it go!

           She claps and cheers gleefully as the Orb NAVIGATES ITS WAY
           THROUGH THE OBSTACLE COURSE.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        No freaking way...

           The Orb comes to a dead end. Then backs up, and rounds a
           corner, heading towards the finish.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come on, come on, almost there --
                        Yes!
           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- LATER

           SMARTPHONE POV: The Orb on the table in front of David.

                                 DAVID
                        Don't try to catch it.

           HE LIFTS ONE END OF THE TABLE, causing the Orb to roll down --

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Wait, you're gonna break it!

           But the ORB COMES TO A STOP ON ITS OWN, teetering at the
           edge of the sloped table.

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus...

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        But... It's... How?!

           The ORB SLOWLY ROLLS ITSELF BACK UP THE TABLE'S INCLINE to
           safety.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you kidding me?!

                                 DAVID
                        Unbelievable. It's like it has
                        survival instincts.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- EVENING

           Claire and David sit on the couch with glasses of wine. Claire
           stares at the Orb on the table in front of them while David
           searches the web on his laptop.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well professor, I've come to the
                        conclusion that that is not a ball
                        bearing.

                                 DAVID
                        The data leads me to concur.

           David types in different phrases and searches.

                                 DAVID
                        Seriously, there's gotta be someone
                        out there who knows what this thing
                        is. Some kind of fancy toy
                        manufacturer or advanced robotics
                        company or... Something.
                                 CLAIRE
                        But that's kinda cool, right? Not
                        knowing.

                                 DAVID
                        It's driving me insane.

           It amuses Claire to see him frustrated. She finishes her
           wine and refills their glasses.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Did I ever tell you how my dad used
                        to do magic tricks for me when I was
                        little?

                                 DAVID
                        No...

                                 CLAIRE
                        He'd put on this velvet cape and hat
                        out of my grandma's old cedar chest.
                        And he'd have me draw a card out of
                        a deck. Then he'd shuffle them all
                        around... And he'd pull out my card
                        every single time. Without fail.
                        He'd even do it with his eyes closed.
                        And I believed it. Literally, the
                        first ten years of my life, I actually
                        thought my dad was magical, like
                        Merlin. And I'd passionately argue
                        with anyone who said otherwise.
                             (beat)
                        Then one day, I found his how-to
                        book in a drawer. And I learned that
                        there wasn't really magic. There was
                        just misdirection. It was all a trick.
                        A lie. And just like that, the game
                        was over.

           She eyes the Orb, sipping her wine.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know that there is some logical
                        explanation for this. But I just...
                        Kinda wish there wasn't.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, at the very least, it's pretty
                        much the coolest toy I've ever seen.
                        Our kids are gonna love it.

           Claire hesitates. Then puts on a smile.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah.
           David kisses her softly and she reciprocates. They set down
           their glasses, lips never parting when --

           The Orb begins to VIBRATE. Softly at first, but slowly growing
           in volume and intensity.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David.

           They look over at the Orb vibrating, the table beneath it
           beginning to rattle.

                                 DAVID
                        What's it doing?

           SLIGHT INDENTATIONS appear across the Orb's smooth surface,
           spreading out in geometrically straight lines. A LOW RUMBLE
           builds from inside it as --

           The ORB BEGINS TO OPEN UP, BREAKING APART INTO SMALLER AND
           SMALLER CUBES THAT DECONSTRUCT ONTO THE TABLETOP, A BLUE
           LIGHT GLOWING FROM WITHIN ITS CORE.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David...

                                 DAVID
                        My God...

           The BLUE LIGHT FLASHES OUTWARD IN A SPHERICAL EXPLOSION.
           Claire and David scream and flinch back. They look up...

           And what they see is beyond their wildest dreams.

           THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE COSMOS. GORGEOUS STARS AND
           BRILLIANT NEBULAE SOARING PAST THEM AT INCREDIBLE SPEED,
           GIVING THE SENSATION THAT THEY'RE TRAVELING THROUGH SPACE.

           All of it is being projected from the Orb, filling the entire
           room, like an immersive VR film that feels all too real.

           Claire and David stand up, mesmerized, taking in the
           extraordinary sight. Holding hands as the stars fly past.

           It's absolutely breathtaking.

           Then ALL OF THE IMAGERY IS PULLED BACK INSIDE THE ORB. Its
           blue glow fades as it CLOSES BACK UP.

           And Claire and David are left standing in the living room.

           For several long moments, they don't move, no words for what
           they just experienced.

                                 DAVID
                        I... I think I...
           He takes a moment, trying to compose himself.

                                 DAVID
                        I know what it is. It's... It's like
                        Voyager.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Voyager?

                                 DAVID
                        It's a probe. Like, a deep space
                        probe. And I think it just showed us
                        the journey it took to get here...

                                 CLAIRE
                        But who sent it?

           They exchange a look. Then stare at the silver ball sitting
           on the table before them, once again looking so benign.

           INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Claire walks in, still in a daze, the enormity of the
           situation setting in. While David is giddy with excitement.

                                 DAVID
                        This is huge, Claire. I mean, it's
                        beyond huge!

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know, I know --

                                 DAVID
                        NASA, CNN, BBC, the White House, I
                        don't even know where to start!

                                 CLAIRE
                        Just... Just slow down, okay?

                                 DAVID
                        The technology inside it could be
                        revolutionary. It'll change everything
                        we think we know.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I get it!

                                 DAVID
                        Then why aren't you freaking out?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I am freaking out! It's just...

           A long moment passes as she considers.
                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 CLAIRE
                        What would happen if... If we didn't
                        tell anyone.

                                 DAVID
                        Why wouldn't we tell anyone?

                                 CLAIRE
                        If this really is... What we think
                        it is... We'll have news vans camped
                        out on our lawn for months. Our faces
                        will be all over every TV, every
                        computer screen, every phone in the
                        world. For years. Forever. Nothing...
                        Nothing will ever be the same.

                                 DAVID
                        I know!

           He's excited by that fact.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can't handle that. Not right now.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, we can handle it. I know we
                        can.

                                 CLAIRE
                        They'll focus on everything that's
                        wrong with us. They'll talk about
                        the baby.

                                 DAVID
                        This isn't about us --

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's all about us! It's ours. Yours
                        and mine. Standing out there, floating
                        in the stars, I felt like...
                        Everything really could be okay again.
                             (beat)
                        This isn't just some probe. It's a
                        gift. It's our gift. We can't just
                        give it away.

                                 DAVID
                        So what are you saying we should do?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Would it be so bad if we just enjoyed
                        it ourselves for a little while?
                                 DAVID
                        But for how long?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don't know. Just... A little while.
                        Until... We're sure we're ready.

           David can sees how badly she wants this. And though he wants
           to say more, he reluctantly nods agreement.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay. If that'll make you happy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Thank you.

           She hugs him, and he holds her close. But there is tension
           in his expression. Conflict.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The lights are out. All is quiet. Moonlight shines in the
           window, illuminating the Orb, still sitting on the piano.

           A low HUMMING SOUND begins to build. We can barely hear it,
           but it's there. Coming from the Orb.

           It slowly rolls itself right off the piano. It lands gently
           on the carpet and continues to roll, navigating its way
           through the dark house. Round a corner and down the hallway.
           Through an open door into --

           CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM

           It moves quietly towards the bed. Claire and David sleep
           soundly, Claire's arm dangling off the side. Their steady
           breathing the only sound. The Orb slows to a stop...

           Right beneath Claire's hanging hand. Her fingers lightly
           touching it, bending around its spherical curve.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- MORNING

           Claire walks in, still wearing her night shirt. As she passes
           the piano, she stops.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David... Where is it?

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        What?

           He walks in in athletic shorts, yawning.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Did you move it?
                                 DAVID
                        It was on the piano last night.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Then where'd it go?

                                 DAVID
                        You don't think it could have...

           But they both do at the same moment and begin looking. Under
           end tables. Behind furniture. In different rooms.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        You find it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Shit.

           CLAIRE'S STUDY

           Claire walks past the doorway and sees the Orb sitting in
           the center of the floor.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Here it is!

           She picks it up and spins it in her hands with a smile. David
           comes down the hall and enters. 

                                 DAVID
                        Where was it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Right in the middle of the floor.
                        Must have rolled in here. Little guy
                        has a mind of his own.

           She sets it down on her desk.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Probably better in here anyway. So
                        none of my students see it.

           David nods warily as she positions it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You want coffee?

                                 DAVID
                        Sure.

           But his gaze lingers on the Orb.
           INT. JOSH'S OFFICE, COLLEGE -- DAY

           There may be textbooks lining the shelves, but they are
           surrounded by nerdy ACTION FIGURES and LEGOS. David walks in.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey man, I need an opinion.

                                 JOSH
                        Doesn't matter how hot she is, it's
                        not worth it.

                                 DAVID
                        What would you do if you found
                        something that no one had ever seen
                        before? Would you keep it to yourself?
                        Or would you show it to the world?

                                 JOSH
                        Well that depends, I guess... Are we
                        talking about a cool new indie band,
                        or an STD?

                                 DAVID
                        It's... This device. This machine
                        that does all this extraordinary
                        stuff.

                                 JOSH
                        Like what? You an inventor all of a
                        sudden?

                                 DAVID
                        I didn't build it. Claire found it
                        in the woods.

                                 JOSH
                        In the woods?

                                 DAVID
                        And I think it's something everyone
                        will wanna see.

                                 JOSH
                        Alright, all this cryptic talk is
                        confusing the shit out of me. You
                        walked into my office, so just spit
                        it out.

                                 DAVID
                        She doesn't want to tell anyone.

                                 JOSH
                        So why are you telling me?
                                 DAVID
                        Because this thing, it's... It's
                        extraordinary.

                                 JOSH
                        You said that already.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you keep in touch with anyone from
                        when you interned at JPL?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, I still know a couple of them.
                        What's that got to do with this?

                                 DAVID
                        Cause I think they're gonna want to
                        see it.

                                 JOSH
                        Seriously, what are we even talking
                        about? 

           David sighs, torn.

                                 JOSH
                        Listen man, if this is so important
                        to you, you know I won't tell Claire. 

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           The front door opens and David steps in with Josh.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire's out running some errands,
                        so we have to be quick. Just wait
                        right here.

           David steps down the hall and comes back a moment later with
           the Orb in hand. Josh eyes it.

                                 JOSH
                        That's your 'machine?' It looks like
                        a lawn ornament.

                                 DAVID
                        I think it landed during that meteor
                        shower the other night. Only it's
                        definitely not a meteor. Watch this.

           David sets the Orb on the floor and gives it a push. It rolls
           a few feet before slowing naturally to a stop.

           Then it just sits there.
                                 JOSH
                        I assume something was supposed to
                        happen?

                                 DAVID
                        Give it a second.

           They wait... Still nothing.

                                 DAVID
                        Wait. It'll move on its own.

           Josh eyes him skeptically.

                                 DAVID
                        Just... Just wait.

           But it doesn't move.

           David grabs the Orb and sets it on the piano. Plays a few
           notes. Nothing. Plays a few more. Still nothing.

                                 JOSH
                        Dude. You're starting to freak me
                        out.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know what's wrong. It should
                        be responding. Hold on, this'll work
                        for sure.

           He sets the Orb on the table and lifts up one end like before.
           The Orb rolls down and -- THUNK! -- Lands hard on the floor,
           just like gravity intended.

                                 DAVID
                        Come on, you piece of junk!

                                 JOSH
                        What was it supposed to do?

           David sighs heavily. Then has a thought.

                                 DAVID
                        Here, just watch this.

           He pulls out his smartphone and loads one of the videos.
           Shuttles ahead. ON SCREEN: David on the floor with the Orb.

                                 DAVID
                        Here we go...

                                 DAVID (FROM PHONE)
                        Come on shiny ball! Come on! Come
                        on! Come to dadda!
                                 CLAIRE (FROM PHONE)
                        Very scientific, Dav --

           But just before the Orb moves, the IMAGE BECOMES GARBLED AND
           THE VIDEO ENDS.

                                 DAVID
                        That's not...

           David tries to bring up the next video. But it ends in a
           garbled mess before it even begins. Same with the next video,
           and the next. NONE OF THEM WORK.

                                 DAVID
                        What the hell!

                                 JOSH
                        What were they supposed to show me?

           Now David is embarrassed.

                                 DAVID
                        I... Umm... I don't know how to say
                        this with a straight face.

                                 JOSH
                        Just say it.

                                 DAVID
                        I think it came down in the meteor
                        shower and... I think it's an
                        extraterrestrial probe.

           Josh stares at him. What. The. Fuck.

                                 DAVID
                        I know it sounds crazy --

                                 JOSH
                        David, it's a silver bowling ball.

                                 DAVID
                        It's not. You can ask Claire.

                                 JOSH
                        I thought we couldn't tell Claire.
                        Is everything okay with you two?

                                 DAVID
                        What? Yeah, we're fine. Listen, why
                        don't we just talk tomorrow so I can
                        try to sort this out.

                                 JOSH
                        Alright.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        Well if the magic alien ball starts
                        shooting laser blasters at you, call
                        me.

           David forces an awkward laugh.

                                 JOSH
                        You're really okay?

                                 DAVID
                        I'm fine. Must just be stressed from
                        starting school and all. I'll see
                        you tomorrow.

                                 JOSH
                        Alright man.

           Josh leaves, trying to play down his concern. David stands,
           frustrated and confused.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           David sets the Orb on Claire's desk.

                                 DAVID
                        Nice time to get performance anxiety,
                        pal.

           No sign of life. He sighs and walks away.

           But as he comes to the doorway, he stops. His expression
           hardens as the true ramifications begin to sink in. Is this
           thing more intelligent than he was giving it credit for? He
           turns to glance back at it --

           WHACK! THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT IN HIS FACE, HITTING HIM HARD.

           David yells out in pain, holding his nose. He pulls his hand
           away, seeing BLOOD. More of it coming from his nose.

           He throws opens the door... But the Orb is still just sitting
           there. It hasn't moved. Then David notices the CURTAINS
           FLUTTERING IN THE BREEZE.

           Maybe the wind blew the door shut?

           He lingers for a moment, uncertain, before heading towards
           the bathroom.

           INT. DINING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           David sits at the table, grading assignments, trying to focus.
           He glances up, seeing Claire backpedaling away from the Orb,
           playfully calling as it rolls after her. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        Come on, little ball. Come on.

           David watches with a growing sense of unease.

           INT. CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Claire is asleep. But David lays awake.

           He gently throws the covers off and gets out of bed.

           INT. GARAGE, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The workbench light snaps on. David sets the Orb down
           underneath it. Then starts rummaging through his tools.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           David closely inspects the Orb through a MAGNIFYING GLASS as
           he runs an X-ACTO KNIFE over the surface. But he can't find
           the finest seam.

           He GENTLY TAPS the surface of the Orb with a HAMMER, listening
           closely -- a deep thunk, suggesting a solid interior. He
           taps in different places, yielding the exact same sound.

           David ignites a BLOW TORCH. He holds the blue flame to the
           surface of the Orb. Then he pulls it away, seeing no visible
           effect. He tentatively tests the surface temperature, then
           places his fingers firmly on the surface -- it's not hot.

                                 DAVID
                        Crazy...

           He touches the Orb to spin it around --

           ZAP! He gasps and pulls his hand away, more in surprise than
           pain. IT SHOCKED HIM.

           He sits there for a moment, staring at the Orb.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           David sets the Orb back in its place.

           He moves away but hesitates, eyeing the open door. He glances
           back at the Orb, sitting silently. Then steps out.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST -- DAY

           The sun's light cuts through the branches, illuminating a
           TREE that has been SPLINTERED IN HALF by some kind of impact.
           WOOD SINGED BLACK.
           Fletcher stands nearby, staring up at it. He glances at
           several other DAMAGED TREES, following the trajectory of
           whatever smashed through them.

           Until he sees an IMPACT CRATER in the ground.

           Fletcher bends down for a closer look, his hands tracing
           over the spherical indentation at its center.

           He knows what landed here.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Claire sits at the piano next to an OLDER WOMAN (60s) as she
           delicately plays a lullaby.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Your granddaughter's gonna love this.

           The Older Woman smiles and continues to play.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- LATER

           Claire waves out the open front door. Then closes it and
           returns to the piano bench. She considers the keys for a
           long moment.

           Then THE ORB STARTS PLAYING A CLASSICAL PIECE FROM THE OTHER
           ROOM. She smiles warmly at the sound. The Orb pauses...

           And Claire takes her cue, continuing the song with fingers
           flowing over the keys. Then she pauses and the Orb continues.
           A few measures later, Claire picks up the song again. She
           pauses -- 

           But the Orb misses its cue. Claire plays the notes again and
           listens. But there's no response.

           Then she hears a SHRILL WHINE. Like the cry of distress she
           heard out in the woods but far louder.

           Claire gets up and rushes into the --

           STUDY

           THE ORB VIBRATES INTENSELY on her desk, moving around as it
           shakes. Claire cringes at the sound.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Jesus! What's wrong?!

           She picks it up --

           And instantly the Orb quiets, soothed. Claire eyes it as it
           vibrates subtly in her arms.
                                 CLAIRE
                        What was that about?

           BWONG! Claire jumps at the sound of the old CRT MONITOR on
           her desk SPONTANEOUSLY TURNING ON. She stares in confusion
           as --

           UNRECOGNIZABLE SHAPES AND SYMBOLS RAPIDLY SCROLL ACROSS THE
           SCREEN IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Nothing human about it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh my God...

           Several symbols align together, forming a single line of
           characters -- an unrecognizable sentence. The symbols shift
           and transform, their shapes quickly evolving into a human
           language... And finally into ENGLISH:

           "DON'T LET HIM TAKE ME."

           Claire stares at the haunting words. The reality of the
           situation sinking in. This thing can communicate.

           When she finally speaks, her voice is shaky. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Don't... Don't let who take you?

           The CREAK OF THE WOOD STEPS leading to the front door. Claire
           rushes to the window, looking out to see --

           Dr. Fletcher walking up to the house.

           Claire looks back to the message on the computer, realizing.

           A LOUD KNOCK on the front door. Claire turns, unsure what to
           do. The Orb vibrates again, as if its fear is growing.

           More knocks.

           FRONT DOOR

           Claire opens the door to reveal Fletcher standing outside.
           In spite of his friendly tone, Claire is very uneasy.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Hello ma'am, my name is Dr. Philip
                        LaFond from the University of
                        Washington Astronomy Department. I'm
                        here looking into the meteor shower
                        from a few nights ago. Did you happen
                        to see it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah. It was hard to miss.
                                 FLETCHER
                        Quite beautiful, wasn't it? I was
                        wondering if you happened to see any
                        of those meteors crash nearby?

           Claire hesitates.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No. I don't think so.

                                 FLETCHER
                        You see, we got a couple calls from
                        local residents who saw one come down
                        in the area. So I've been out there
                        hiking around in the woods, and I
                        came across an impact crater. But the
                        meteor seems to be gone. I'm guessing
                        someone must have picked it up.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah... We haven't found anything.

                                 FLETCHER
                        It's also possible that it wasn't
                        actually a meteor. Could be a piece
                        of a satellite, for instance.
                        Something shiny and metallic.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sorry. I wish I could help you.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I don't want to give you the wrong
                        idea, miss. I wouldn't keep it if
                        you did find something. Just take it
                        to the lab and run a few quick tests.
                        Then I promise I'd bring it right
                        back. You have my word.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I told you. We haven't seen anything
                        like that.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Okay... Well thanks for your time.
                        Plenty more doors for me to knock
                        on. You stay safe now.

           He walks off. Claire watches him go, unsettled.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Claire steps back in and closes the door behind her. As she
           turns, she sees a new message written on the screen:

           "THANK YOU, CLAIRE."
           Claire stares. Somewhere between creeped out and blown away.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- EVENING

           David opens the front door. Sets down his bag.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, I'm home. Claire?

           He hears her voice, but can't make out her words. He follows
           the sound to the closed study door, listening curiously.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        So how long did it take you to get
                        here? / That's it?

           Confused, David pushes the door open --

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?

           He steps into --

           CLAIRE'S STUDY

           Where Claire sits at her desk. The Orb in front of her.

                                 DAVID
                        Who're you talking to?

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, it can hear us! It can talk!

                                 DAVID
                        What can talk?

                                 CLAIRE
                        The Orb, silly! Well, I mean, it
                        doesn't talk, exactly. But it can
                        write. Look!

           She points to the computer. But THE SCREEN IS BLACK.

                                 DAVID
                        Where...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Here, just watch this!
                             (to Orb)
                        What's his name?

           The monitor remains blank.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come on, I know you know his name.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                             (waits, nothing)
                        Okay... Then what's my name?

           Still nothing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I... I don't know. Maybe you scared
                        it when you came in.

           He looks behind the desk. Then pulls out the HANGING POWER
           CABLE. THE MONITOR WAS NEVER PLUGGED IN.

                                 DAVID
                        Or you're screwing with me.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why would I make this up? It's been
                        writing up a storm.
                             (off his look)
                        After all it's done, is this really
                        that hard to believe?

                                 DAVID
                        I suppose not.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Listen, I came in here and it had
                        written, "Don't let him take me," on
                        the screen. Then a moment later,
                        there's a knock at the door and it's
                        some college professor asking if
                        we'd found a crashed meteor --

                                 DAVID
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa... Someone was here
                        looking for it?

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- EVENING

           David's laptop is open, scrolling through the University of
           Washington's website, cell phone to his ear. Claire pacing.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (FROM PHONE)
                        Astronomy department.

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        Hi, can you connect me with Dr.
                        LaFond.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (FROM PHONE)
                        I'm sorry, who?

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        Dr. Philip LaFond.
                                 RECEPTIONIST (FROM PHONE)
                        We don't have a Dr. LaFond here.

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        Oh. I'm sorry, my mistake. Thank
                        you.

           He hangs up.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I swear that's the name he gave me.

           David googles the name. Nothing to see but a wiki on some
           old pro wrestler.

                                 DAVID
                        I believe you... I just don't think
                        it was his real one.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why would he give me a fake name?

           INT. KITCHEN, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Claire and David cook dinner, tension in their demeanors.
           Claire chopping vegetables, David managing the stove top.

                                 DAVID
                        He could work for anyone. The
                        government, a corporation, some
                        billionaire, who knows. And if one
                        guy knows about it, there's bound to
                        be more.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He didn't know anything. Some people
                        saw a meteor come down in the forest.
                        He found an impact crater. That's it.

                                 DAVID
                        So that's where you found it? In an
                        impact crater? That's a pretty big
                        detail to leave out.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I found it in a bunch of tall grass.
                        There wasn't anything... Impact crater
                        about it. It was just pretty. Come
                        on, I thought you'd be excited that
                        it can talk.

                                 DAVID
                        I am excited. All I'm saying is he
                        could know something we don't. Maybe
                        you shouldn't have lied to him.
                                 CLAIRE
                        You weren't here. It was scared.

                                 DAVID
                        How can a machine be scared?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It sounded like it was screaming. And
                        then afterwards, it told me it needed
                        our help. It asked me to protect it.

                                 DAVID
                        You're talking about it as if it has
                        feelings.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think it does. It's all alone here.
                        And there's a world out there that
                        will rip it apart to try and figure
                        out what every last gadget and gizmo
                        inside of it does. So yes, I think
                        it's terrified.

           She sees his look.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You really don't believe me.

                                 DAVID
                        Honestly, I don't know what to
                        believe.

           Claire stares a moment longer. Then turns back to chopping.

                                 DAVID
                        Listen, if this thing really feels
                        fear, what else can it feel? Have
                        you thought about that?

           She doesn't respond. David turns and continues to stir.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Claire sits alone at the piano, fingers running over the
           keys, thinking. She picks up her cell and dials.

                                 CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                        Helen, it's Claire. Listen, I'm not
                        feeling so well today and wouldn't
                        want to give either of you a bug.
                        Could we reschedule Aubrey's lesson?

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Claire steps in, closing the door. Just her and the Orb now.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey... Are you there?

           The monitor turns on. Text forms on the screen.

           "HELLO, CLAIRE."

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why wouldn't you talk to David? You
                        made me look like a crazy person.

           "BECAUSE HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND."

                                 CLAIRE
                        Of course he understands. He thinks
                        you're amazing. We both do.

           "HE WOULD GIVE ME AWAY."

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well don't worry. He won't do anything
                        without asking me first.

           "ARE YOU CERTAIN?"

           Claire hesitates.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Of course.

           But she's not. An uncomfortable moment passes as the screen
           stays dark.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So what's your world like? I hope
                        you guys didn't screw it all up like
                        we're doing.

           "WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?"

                                 CLAIRE
                        How?

           "GIVE ME YOUR HAND."

                                 CLAIRE
                        Seriously?

           "IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT."

           Claire stares at the text on the screen, reservations shining
           through.

           "DO NOT BE AFRAID."

           Claire takes a deep breath.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay...

           She slowly sticks her hand out... And places it on the Orb.

           The moment she does, the LIGHTS FLICKER IN THE ROOM, before
           DIMMING DOWN AROUND HER. Only Claire isn't paying attention
           to the lights.

           Her head slowly turns, eyes widening with wonder, LOOKING
           ALL AROUND HER AS IF SHE'S SEEING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE
           IN EXISTENCE. But it's something that only she can see.

           She pulls her hand off, and the lights return to normal. She
           catches her breath, blown away by the experience.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's... It's so beautiful. Why would
                        you ever leave?

           "I WAS SENT HERE."

                                 CLAIRE
                        To do what?

           "HELP PEOPLE."

           Claire stares at the words. Then they transform --

           "ARE YOU HAPPY, CLAIRE?"

                                 CLAIRE
                        I... Yeah. Of course I'm happy. I'm
                        very happy.

           "THEN WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SAD?"

                                 CLAIRE
                        I... I don't...

           "WHO IS THE OTHER WITH YOU AND DAVID?"

                                 CLAIRE
                        The other?

           Then she suddenly realizes, turning to the shelf where she
           left the PHOTO of her, David and their baby.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That's Ethan. That's my son.

           "TELL ME ABOUT HIM."

                                 CLAIRE
                        He... He passed away. A little over
                        two years ago.
           She waits for another response to form. But it doesn't.

           The statement lingers. "TELL ME ABOUT HIM."

                                 CLAIRE
                        He...

           Her eyes fall, weighing if she can.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He was... Joy. The brightest light
                        in my life. He was just starting to
                        smile, with his little pudgy cheeks...
                        And when he looked up into my eyes,
                        everything else just seemed to
                        vanish...
                             (beat)
                        He would hold on so tight as he was
                        falling asleep, his whole little
                        hand wrapped around one of my fingers.
                        I'd sit there with him. And when his
                        hand relaxed, I'd leave him there,
                        looking so beautiful. And every day,
                        I'd wake up exhausted, but so excited
                        because I'd get to see him again. 

           Tears well up.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Until one morning, he... He wasn't
                        breathing. They tried, but... He was
                        eight weeks and two days old. Everyone
                        kept saying that it wasn't my fault.
                        That they don't know why it happens.
                        But I never should have left him
                        alone... I shouldn't have left him
                        alone...

           The tears roll down her cheeks. She doesn't bother wiping
           them. The pain will never go away.

           "WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOLD HIM AGAIN?"

                                 CLAIRE
                        Only every second of every day.

           A moment passes.

           Then the ORB BEGINS TO VIBRATE. Claire watches as --

           The ORB OPENS UP AGAIN, breaking into smaller and smaller
           cubes like before, BLUE LIGHT shining from within --

           Only this time it doesn't show the cosmos. The blue light
           begins to FORM A FIGURE. A tiny human figure.
                                 CLAIRE
                        No...

           She can't believe her eyes. It can't be. It's not possible.
           But right in front of her she sees --

           A HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF HER SON. Alive and well. A smiling,
           wiggling baby. Exactly like the picture. The sound of his
           cooing fills the room.

           Tears stream down Claire's face as she gazes in wonder at
           her baby boy. She reaches out to touch him --

           But the light fades and the image disappears, leaving Claire
           with her arm still outstretched. She looks to the Orb. Its
           words flow across the screen.

           "I CAN BRING HIM BACK AGAIN."

           Claire's breath catches as she stares at the words through
           teary eyes.

           "IF YOU TRUST ME."

                                 CLAIRE
                        How...

           "WITH YOUR MEMORIES. IF YOU LET ME SEE THEM."

           But Claire has uncertainty now. This is all too fast. Too
           much. Then, as if sensing her feelings, the Orb writes --

           "HE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, CLAIRE."

           "HE WILL TAKE ME AWAY FROM YOU."

           Claire stares at the ominous words. Knowing they're true.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Claire and David stand, the distance between them growing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It told me that where it comes from,
                        there's no death. They live for
                        however long they want. Until they
                        choose to move on.

                                 DAVID
                        And for some reason when I go in
                        there, it doesn't say a thing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It knows you want to give it away.
                                 DAVID
                        Of course I do. This might be the
                        most incredible discovery in human
                        history and we're keeping it locked
                        up in our house so you can play piano
                        with it and have afternoon chats.
                        It's insane.

                                 CLAIRE
                        This is our son we're talking about.

                                 DAVID
                        Listen, I believe that it talks to
                        you. I can even believe that it
                        projected an image of him. But I do
                        not believe for one second that it
                        can bring Ethan back. I don't think
                        there's anything in the universe
                        that can do that. He's gone, Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        But what if he wasn't? What if this
                        really is possible?

                                 DAVID
                        What have we been working on for two
                        years? Letting go and moving on. I
                        thought we'd done that.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don't want to move on. I want my
                        son back.

           A tense moment as her honest words hang.

                                 DAVID
                        Don't you see what's happening here?
                        We were past this. Now that thing's
                        digging it back up again. It's taking
                        you in and shutting me out.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why would it do that?

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know but I don't trust it.
                        We don't know why it's here. We don't
                        know what it wants. And I'm to the
                        point that I don't care about
                        scientific discoveries or getting
                        famous or any of that shit. I just
                        want that thing gone.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That "thing" is the only hope we
                        have of seeing Ethan again.
                                 DAVID
                        Okay, let's say for the sake of
                        argument that it really could bring
                        him back. How do you know he'll
                        actually be our son? Maybe he'll
                        look like him, but he might be
                        something else entirely.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He won't be buried in the ground.
                        We'll finally have a chance to be a
                        real family.

           Pain in David's eyes.

                                 DAVID
                        I thought we were a real family.

           INT. CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Claire and David lie on opposite sides of the bed, a
           noticeable gap between them. But David is wide awake, staring
           across the bed at her. She's sound asleep.

           He slowly gets up and quietly goes to the door. A quick glance
           back to make sure Claire is still asleep, then he slips out.

           CLAIRE'S STUDY

           David steps in. The Orb sits on the desk in the moonlight.
           So benign... Yet so ominous.

           David approaches apprehensively. Then cautiously reaches out
           and lifts it, glaring as he holds it in his hands.

           THE ORB BEGINS TO HUM ever so subtly...

           HALLWAY

           David moves quickly, carrying the Orb through the dim hallway.
           The hum coming from deep within growing steadily louder.
           Even more intense as he steps out the front door --

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           David doesn't slow, the Orb's warning growing in intensity
           as he heads towards the car. Then --

           A SICKENING SIZZLING SOUND. David YELLS OUT IN PAIN and drops
           the Orb, SMOKE RISING FROM IT.

           He gasps for breath, looking at his BURNED HANDS, trying not
           to scream.
           INT. KITCHEN, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           David cringes as he runs cold water over his hands. As the
           pain gradually diminishes, his face becomes awash with
           something else.

           Hatred.

           GARAGE

           David turns on the light and quickly looks around the shelves,
           rummaging through his TOOLS.

           Until he sees what he's after.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The garage door opens and David steps back out, now holding
           a SLEDGEHAMMER. He lifts the sledgehammer high above the Orb
           and swings it down with full force --

           But the SLEDGEHAMMER REPELS TO THE SIDE, like the Orb is
           EXTREMELY MAGNETIZED, causing the sledgehammer to hit the
           ground. David swings again, with the same result. 

           Incensed, David focuses, bringing the sledgehammer down with
           all of his strength, but the WOOD HANDLE SPLINTERS, stunning
           his hands, causing him to gasp in pain.

           David stares at the Orb in disbelief.

           Then has a new idea, moving to the car. He unlocks it and
           opens the back. Pulls out a pair of LEATHER GLOVES, and slips
           them on. Opens the passenger door.

           He grabs the Orb off the ground. Again, we hear SIZZLING,
           SMOKE RISING from where the Orb and gloves meet. David moves
           quickly to the car, struggling to withstand it, and drops
           the Orb onto the floor. Comes around the driver's side --

           INT. DAVID'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           David gets in, starts up the car and hits the gas, backing
           up to turn around --

           But the ENGINE SUDDENLY DIES AND THE CAR LURCHES TO A STOP.

                                 DAVID
                        You've gotta be kidding me!

           David turns the key, but the engine just chugs.

                                 DAVID
                        Come on!
           The DASHBOARD LIGHTS FLICKER. As he turns the key again, all
           he hears is CLICK, CLICK, CLICKS FROM THE STARTER.

           David slowly turns to the Orb, sitting silently on the floor,
           understanding.

                                 DAVID
                        Son of a bitch --

           SUDDENLY THE RADIO BLASTS STATIC AT FULL VOLUME. David yells
           and covers his ears. Reaches for the door handle --

           BUT ALL OF THE DOORS LOCK SHUT. David yanks the handle but
           it won't release the latch. He desperately tries to unlock
           the door, but the moment he does, it instantly locks again.

           He covers his ears, the sound overwhelmingly loud. Unbearable.

                                 DAVID
                        STOP! PLEASE STOP!

           Still at full volume, the RADIO BEGINS RAPIDLY CHANGING
           STATIONS, STRINGING TOGETHER INDIVIDUAL WORDS from different
           hosts, songs, and commercials, MASHING THEM INTO SENTENCES.

                                 RADIO (V.O.)
                        DO - NOT - TRY - TO - HURT - ME -
                        DAVID. YOU - CANNOT - TAKE - ME -
                        AWAY. THIS - IS - MY - HOME. THIS -
                        IS - MY - HOME. THIS - IS - MY - HOME.

           THE LAST PHRASE REPEATS over and over again, faster and
           faster. David covers his ears, until he yells out --

                                 DAVID
                        OKAY! OKAY!

           And the radio goes silent. The locks pop up. All is calm.

           David catches his breath, in a state of shock.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           David returns the Orb to its place on the desk. It sits there,
           unmoving. He glares, knowing it's far beyond him.

           CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM

           David dashes in, turning on the light.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, wake up. Wake up sweetie, we
                        have to go.
                                 CLAIRE
                             (half asleep)
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        We have to go right now!

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you talking about?

           He pulls her out of bed, putting clothes in her hands for
           her to pull on.

                                 DAVID
                        Just trust me, come on.

           He guides her out the door.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY -- SIMULTANEOUS

           The Orb sits on the desk.

           And then it begins to VIBRATE once again with an ENTIRELY
           DIFFERENT TONE.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           David leads Claire away from their house down the road.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, what's happening?

                                 DAVID
                        I'll explain everything when we get
                        away from here. It's gonna be fine,
                        I promise.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY -- SIMULTANEOUS

           The intensity of the Orb's VIBRATIONS increase.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- SIMULTANEOUS

           And suddenly CLAIRE SNAPS!

                                 CLAIRE
                        NO! LET GO OF ME!

           She shoves David, clawing at his face like a crazed animal!
           He struggles to hold her back.

                                 CLAIRE
                        LET GO OF ME! LET GO OF ME, YOU
                        BASTARD! LET GO!
           She screams bloody murder as SHE SWINGS FEROCIOUSLY AT HIM,
           HITTING HIM HARD. Then BREAKS FREE and RUNS back to the house.

           Leaving David alone in the darkness. At a loss.

           INT. HALLWAY, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           David hesitantly comes down the hall. He opens the door and
           looks into their room.

           CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM

           Claire sleeps soundly in bed. Then she stirs, seeing him
           standing in the doorway.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (groggy)
                        David... What are you doing up? Come
                        back to bed.

           And David realizes, she has no memory of what just happened.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David?

           He hesitantly lays down next to her. She snuggles up next to
           him, laying her head on his chest, as his dread grows.

           INT. DAVID'S OFFICE, COLLEGE -- DAY

           David sits at his computer. He didn't sleep last night and
           didn't bother shaving this morning.

           A KNOCK draws his attention. Josh stands in the doorway.

                                 JOSH
                        You wanna grab lunch, man?

           He recognizes how bad David looks.

                                 JOSH
                        Or if you'd rather nurse your
                        hangover, totally get it.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey Josh? I need to ask you a big
                        favor.

           Josh's jovial demeanor fades as he hears the desperation in
           David's voice.

           INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT

           Claire stands in the spotlight, a grand piano on stage behind
           her. She looks out over her wide variety of STUDENTS, some
           of whom we recognize, along with their FAMILIES. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        I'm so glad that you could be here
                        tonight. Now some of our performers
                        have been playing for years, while
                        others just began a few weeks ago.
                        But all of them have been making
                        incredible progress that they want to
                        share with you.
                             (smirks)
                        Or in some cases, I'm making them
                        share with you.

           Laughs from the parents.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Because music is about more than
                        just notes and tempos. It's about
                        family. It creates memories and takes
                        us back to times of happiness, and
                        sadness. And ultimately, it brings
                        us closer together. It means the
                        world that you all are here, standing
                        by your loved ones. So thank you.
                        And without further ado...

           Claire sits down in the front row as the first STUDENT walks
           onto the stage, sits down at the piano and begins to play.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           An old SUV slows to a stop outside.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           David watches from a window as Josh approaches the door. He
           opens it before Josh knocks.

                                 JOSH
                        I just want to go on the record again
                        as saying that this is ridiculous.

                                 DAVID
                        Duly noted.

           Josh follows him inside.

           INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT

           Alan sits down at the piano, very tense. He puts his fingers
           on the keys and glances at Claire. She returns a confident
           smile and nod.

           With a deep breath, he begins to play his song, a harmonized
           version of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." As he successfully
           plays measure after measure, a smile gradually forms, his
           confidence growing.
           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           David and Josh step in. The Orb sits on the desk where it
           always does.

                                 DAVID
                        Go on. You have to be the one to
                        carry it.

                                 JOSH
                        Why?

                                 DAVID
                        Because it won't do anything to you.
                        It doesn't want you to know what
                        it's capable of.

           Josh rolls his eyes and picks up the Orb. Just as David
           predicted, it doesn't respond in any way.

           INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT

           Claire watches Alan play, bobbing her head slightly as if
           willing him through each new note.

           Then TEARS begin to form in her eyes. She wipes them away,
           but they keep coming.

                                 PARENT
                             (whisper)
                        You okay?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, I'm... I'm fine...

           But she's not. She looks away from the stage, as if sensing
           something is wrong.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Josh leads the way towards his truck with the Orb in hand.
           David follows, on edge.

                                 JOSH
                        Dear NASA, enclosed please find an
                        alien orb. Do as you will.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't really care what you tell
                        them as long as it's gone.

                                 JOSH
                        Relax man. I'm sure they get stuff
                        like this all the time. They can put
                        it in their warehouse next to the
                        Ark of the Covenant.
           He opens his SUV's door and sets the Orb inside. Heads to
           the driver's side but David stops him.

                                 DAVID
                        Listen. If it does do anything...
                        Just get away from it. Don't talk to
                        it. Don't interact. Just get away.

                                 JOSH
                        David, the moment the paperweight
                        starts talking, I promise you, I
                        will run.

           He climbs into his SUV, starts it up and drives off. David
           watches as his taillights disappear in the distance. A sense
           of relief coming over him. It's gone.

           EXT. ROAD / INT. CLAIRE'S CAR -- NIGHT

           Claire drives, expression stern, intent on getting home.

           She passes by Josh's truck going the opposite direction, but
           doesn't recognize it.

           INT. JOSH'S TRUCK -- NIGHT

           Josh drives towards town, singing along with the music on
           the radio. Eyes on the road ahead.

           The DASHBOARD LIGHTS FLICKER and the music GARBLES WITH
           STATIC. Josh rolls his eyes.

                                 JOSH
                        Oh don't give me that, you piece of
                        shit.

           He pounds his fist on the dashboard, like you do in old
           vehicles. The lights come back and the radio plays clearly.
           He continues to sing along with the song.

           All the while, the Orb sits on the passenger side floor.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Claire walks in. David greets her from the couch.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey. How was the show?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Good. Really good.

           But her thoughts are elsewhere. She walks past him to the --
           STUDY

           Claire goes straight to her desk where the Orb sat. She
           doesn't even have to look around to know.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David...

           He stands in the doorway. She turns, tears in her eyes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, please...

                                 DAVID
                        I had to do it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No... Oh God...

           She staggers, tears flowing. David goes to her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It would have brought him back...

                                 DAVID
                        Claire --

           He tries to put his arms around her, but she shoves him away.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No... NO!

           And behind her tears, her animosity grows.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It was a miracle. A miracle that
                        came to us. And you gave it away...
                        You've let Ethan die all over again.

           A dagger to the heart. She turns away, crying as all of her
           pent up emotion boils to the surface. A wound that has been
           ripped open again.

           And David can only watch, helpless.

           INT. OFFICE SUITE, COLLEGE -- NIGHT

           Josh opens the door and turns on the lights. He sets the Orb
           on a nearby table. Looks it over. 

                                 JOSH
                        So what are you... Some spectacular
                        alien probe? Or has David completely
                        lost his mind?

           The Orb just sits there.
                                 JOSH
                        Option two it is.

           He walks across the room and opens a supply closet. Rummages
           through the various items. Finds PACKING TAPE. Keep rummaging.

                                 JOSH
                        Damn it Jan, where do you keep the
                        boxes?
                             (sighs)
                        Whatever.

           He walks back over to the Orb and sets the roll of tape on
           top of it like a crown.

                                 JOSH
                        I guess you'll just have to wait
                        till tomorrow, ole boy.

           He heads for the door and turns off the light.

           The TAPE SLIDES OFF THE ORB. Josh glances back at the sound.
           Then hears a STRANGE HUMMING NOISE coming from the Orb.

           His expression hardens, not believing it.

           The humming grows louder, the Orb VIBRATING. Small
           indentations form across its surface as it breaks apart into
           smaller and smaller cubes.

                                 JOSH
                        Holy... Shit...

           He watches, dumbfounded, as THE ORB OPENS UP --

           Its ETHEREAL BLUE LIGHT FILLS THE ROOM.

           Josh gazes into it as he steps closer, drawn to it, the
           radiant light washing over his face. His eyes widen in wonder,
           transfixed. It's breathtaking... 

           Then BLOOD BEGINS TO RUN OUT OF HIS NOSE. But Josh keeps
           staring, spellbound.

           Blood runs out of his ears.

           Out of his eyes.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. COLLEGE -- MORNING

           David's car pulls into a parking spot. He steps out, bag
           over his shoulder, a lot still on his mind.
           But he's snapped back to reality as he sees POLICE CARS and
           an AMBULANCE parked outside his building, lights flashing.

           INT. OFFICE SUITE, COLLEGE -- CONTINUOUS

           David rushes inside to see several POLICE OFFICERS. A small
           crowd of FACULTY and STUDENTS has gathered, some crying.
           David pushes through them to see --

           JOSH BEING ZIPPED UP INTO A BODY BAG. His jaw hangs open,
           eyes still wide with wonder. While JAGGED STREAKS OF BLOOD
           have dried on his face. A horrific sight.

           David watches as the body bag zips closed over his friend's
           face, realizing what happened.

           He begins to look around, searching. But there is no sign of
           the Orb anywhere.

                                 DAVID
                             (sotto)
                        Claire...

           EXT. COLLEGE -- CONTINUOUS

           David dashes outside, pulling out his cell phone and dialing
           as he runs towards his car.

           He passes several more STUDENTS, among them an older man...
           Fletcher. He watches David climb into his car and speed away.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY -- SIMULTANEOUS

           The blinds are closed. Claire sits alone in the darkness,
           staring at her sketch of the stream that she drew the day
           she found the Orb. Her PHONE RINGS. She glances to see "David"
           on the ID. She considers for a moment. Then silences it and
           continues to stare away.

           Then she abruptly turns, as if sensing something.

           HALLWAY

           Claire moves through the house, a feeling of hope beginning
           to shine through her sadness. She opens the door --

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           And steps outside to see --

           THE ORB SITTING IN THE GRASS under the morning sun. Waiting
           there just for her.
           INT. DAVID'S CAR -- SIMULTANEOUS

           David drives erratically, trying not to panic. He dials Claire
           again. It rings and rings before going to voice mail.

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        Hey, it's Claire. Leave a message.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, please pick up! Pick up!

           He hangs up and drives faster.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Claire sets the Orb back in its place.

           Bwong! The old CRT MONITOR on the desk turns on again as
           letters scroll across the screen, forming --

           "HE IS COMING FOR ME."

           "THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE."

           Claire turns as she hears her PHONE RINGING. She lifts it
           off the table, seeing "David" again on the ID. Uncertainty
           as it RINGS and RINGS. She looks towards the Orb.

           "YOU'LL GET TO SEE ETHAN SMILE AGAIN."

           And she turns her phone off.

           The Orb vibrates on the desk as it breaks apart into smaller
           and smaller cubes. BLUE LIGHT GLOWS FROM WITHIN.

           But this time, the cubes rearrange themselves differently,
           gradually TAKING THE SHAPE OF A BABY.

           The blue light grows brighter and brighter as the cubes
           LIQUEFY and MERGE. THEY TAKE ON A HUMAN SKIN TONE AND MELD
           INTO MORE DELICATE FEATURES that distinctly define her son.

           Ethan begins to wiggle and move in front of her. Glowing
           blue light radiating off of him.

           Tears of joy run down Claire's face. 

           "DO YOU TRUST ME, CLAIRE?"

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes... Please... Please, just bring
                        him back to me.

           BABY ETHAN OPENS HIS EYES. Then he smiles and coos as he
           recognizes her.
           Claire beams as she picks him up in her arms.

           The glowing blue light radiating off of Ethan grows even
           brighter now. It SWIRLS AROUND CLAIRE, surrounding them both
           with its ethereal glow. But she doesn't notice, totally
           enraptured, as she rocks her baby.

           Then WISPS OF LIQUID SILVER EMERGE FROM BABY ETHAN. The same
           color as the Orb.

           THEY SLOWLY FLOW UP HER ARMS AND OVER HER BODY.

           But Claire doesn't notice. She just stares away into his
           beautiful eyes, lost in her happiness.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           David's car screeches to a stop. He climbs out and sprints
           towards the door.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           David rushes inside, looking around.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire! Claire!!

           But he is immediately overtaken by BEAUTIFUL PIANO MUSIC
           echoing through the house. Mozart's complex variation on
           "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," played with amazing speed and
           dexterity. He follows the sound into the --

           LIVING ROOM

           Where Claire sits at the piano, completely engaged in the
           music, hands flowing over the keys. But while Claire is a
           pro, this is on an entirely different level.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?

           She stops playing and turns with an elated smile.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey, you're back early.

           She comes over and greets him with a loving kiss.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you doing home? Don't you
                        have a class soon?

           Then she catches his demeanor.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Baby, what's wrong?

           David looks over his wife, not sure what to make of her.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire... Josh is dead.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh my God! What happened?!

                                 DAVID
                        It... It killed him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What killed him?

           David stares at her, trying to comprehend.

                                 DAVID
                        Where's the Orb, Claire? Did it come
                        back here?

                                 CLAIRE
                        The what?

                                 DAVID
                        The Orb! Where is it?

           Complete bewilderment in Claire's eyes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sweetie... What are you talking about?

                                 DAVID
                        Don't play games with me. Where is
                        it?!

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where is what?

           David storms away, heading into --

           CLAIRE'S STUDY

           He looks around but the Orb is nowhere to be seen. He starts
           rummaging, searching everywhere. Claire watches from the
           doorway with confusion, concern rapidly growing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Babe, you're really freaking me out.
                        What happened to Josh?

                                 DAVID
                        Where is it?! Where did you hide
                        it?!
                                 CLAIRE
                        Where did I hide what?!

                                 DAVID
                        The silver ball you found in the
                        woods! The alien probe that rolls
                        around and writes messages and told
                        you it could bring Ethan back! I
                        know it's here!

                                 CLAIRE
                        There's nothing here! Now just talk
                        to me. What happened?

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know why you're doing this.
                        But I'm gonna find it.

           He heads out of the room. Claire follows him into the --

           LIVING ROOM

           Where David searches in closets, behind furniture, everywhere.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David... David stop!

           He turns as she comes to him, trying to calm him by putting
           soothing hands on his shoulders.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You have to listen to me. There's
                        nothing here. It's just you and me.
                        Okay? It's just you and me. I am so
                        sorry about Josh, but we're gonna
                        get through this. Together. Like we
                        always do.

           She hugs him tightly, holding him close.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Do you hear me, baby? I'm here for
                        you. Everything's gonna be okay.

           David holds her. But there is genuine fear in his eyes.

           INT. KITCHEN, MORGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           David and Claire make dinner. Claire whistles along with a
           classic rock song, happy as a clam. David watches her, uneasy.

           Claire's eyes scan the recipe book. She opens a cupboard and
           takes out two measuring cups. Uses them to precisely measure
           out the proper ingredients, her movements meticulous. David
           can't help but notice, knowing it isn't like her at all.
           She opens the fridge to put away the milk. But as it closes,
           she stops, staring inquisitively. David notices.

                                 DAVID
                        What're you looking at?

                                 CLAIRE
                        The girl in this picture...

                                 DAVID
                        What about her?

                                 CLAIRE
                        What's her name?

           David eyes the collage of photos on the fridge, focusing on
           an old one of CLAIRE (9) and ANOTHER GIRL.

                                 DAVID
                        You're serious?
                             (off Claire)
                        That's Megan... Your cousin. Who
                        lived with your family for two
                        summers.

           Claire stares at the image, not recognizing her.

           INT. CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           David opens a PHOTO ALBUM and sets it in Claire's lap.

                                 DAVID
                        Who's that?

                                 CLAIRE
                        This isn't necessary at all.

                                 DAVID
                        Then just tell me who they are.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That's Lily...

           She points from photo to photo.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And Brad. Tom was your freshman
                        roommate. Darcy was his girlfriend
                        but they broke up before senior year,
                        right?

           David scrambles to pull out an OLDER ALBUM.

                                 DAVID
                        These people?
                                 CLAIRE
                        David...

           But she sees how intent he is.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That's Uncle Lyle, with hair. And
                        Aunt Joan before she stopped eating
                        carbs.
                             (turns the page)
                        And --

           She freezes. David looks from her face to the photo of Claire
           next to another girl.

                                 DAVID
                        You don't know who that is, do you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Just... Just give me a second.

                                 DAVID
                        That's Stacy, Claire.

           She looks at him, baffled.

                                 DAVID
                        Your best friend growing up. She
                        lived right next door to you for
                        twelve years. Your birthdays were a
                        week apart for God's sake. You
                        celebrated them together every year.

           Claire turns the page and sees herself with STACY at a
           children's birthday party.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh right, of course.

           But it's clearly unsettling to her. She stares at the photos
           for a long moment, before closing the album.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come on, dinner's probably burning
                        by now.

           David watches her put the album back, his own trepidation
           growing.

           INT. CLAIRE & DAVID'S BEDROOM -- LATER

           David is asleep, dreaming of something, eyes moving behind
           his closed lids, body shifting subtly. He shudders, eyes
           snapping open. He lays there for a moment, catching his breath.
           Then realizes --
           Claire is not in bed next to him.

           He sits up, looking around.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?

           Only silence. He gets up and steps out into the --

           HALLWAY

           All the lights are off as David wanders, peeking into darkened
           rooms, his footsteps making the floor creak.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?

           He moves on, anxiety rising. Opens the door to her study and
           looks in. But she's not there.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?

           His voice lingers in the silence.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?!

           CREAK!

           David jumps and turns. Claire stands behind him, silhouetted
           in the darkness.

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus. What are you doing? Do you
                        have any idea what time it is?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's not time...

                                 DAVID
                        What?

           But she doesn't move. Her eyes are open but unfocused, like
           she's in a trance.

                                 DAVID
                        You okay?

           He nervously approaches. But she doesn't seem to notice him.
           Not moving a muscle.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?
           She stares through him like he's not even there. David puts
           his hands on her shoulders, shaking her gently.

                                 DAVID
                        Wake up, honey. Wake up!

           No reaction.

                                 DAVID
                        CLAIRE!

           The glazed over look disappears and Claire focuses on David.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (groggy)
                        Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. I
                        was just getting a drink of water.

                                 DAVID
                        No, you were sleepwalking.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you talking about? Come on,
                        I'm tired.

           David eyes her warily as she heads back towards the bedroom.

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

           The DOCTOR spins his monitor around for David and Claire to
           see. On it are a variety of MEDICAL TEST RESULTS. He clicks
           through the MRI imagery.

                                 DOCTOR
                        There's no cortical abnormality to
                        imply a seizure focus. No abnormal
                        enhancement to suggest a tumor. No
                        volume loss to imply a hallucinatory
                        dementia. I'm not seeing any
                        indicators that anything is wrong.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That's good, right?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Of course, that's very good.

                                 DAVID
                        There has to be some more tests that
                        you can run.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Tests for the sake of tests can often
                        cause more harm than good.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Not to mention rack up your out of
                        pocket expenses. Or is there something
                        I'm missing here?

           He looks back and forth between David and Claire. Claire
           seems perfectly satisfied. But David --

                                 DAVID
                        I guess there have just been some...
                        Changes in her personality lately.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, he said I'm okay. I feel fine.

                                 DAVID
                        And she's been forgetting things.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I forgot the names of two people who
                        I haven't seen in years.

                                 DAVID
                        But they're people she should know.
                        And she's been sleepwalking too.

                                 CLAIRE
                        One time. Ever. Babe, he's saying
                        there's nothing wrong. I'm fine.

                                 DAVID
                        Will you stop saying that!

           An uncomfortable beat. The Doctor isn't sure what to make of
           them. Claire sighs.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Listen, one of his best friends just
                        passed away suddenly and I think
                        he's afraid of something happening
                        to me too.

           The Doctor nods, suddenly understanding.

                                 CLAIRE
                        But sweetie, I really am fine. You're
                        not gonna lose me. I promise.

           She puts her hand on his and smiles warmly. But it only
           unnerves him more.

                                 DOCTOR
                        A loss like that can be difficult
                        for anyone. I know several great
                        psychologists if you'd like to --
                                 DAVID
                        I don't need a shrink! That has
                        nothing to do with this.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well then maybe you can tell me a
                        little more about the root of your
                        concern?

           David can't bring himself to respond.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- EVENING

           Claire steps back inside, David following her.

                                 DAVID
                        I know you're toying with me. I know
                        this is all part of... Whatever's
                        going on.

           Claire looks him over with genuine sympathy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can't imagine how hard this is on
                        you, especially after all that Josh
                        did to help us get here. But there's
                        nothing going on.
                             (off his look)
                        Don't you trust me, David?

           He sure doesn't. Not now.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well clearly I'm not the one who
                        needs a doctor.

           She walks into her study and closes the door, leaving David
           standing alone in the quiet house.

                                 DAVID
                             (sotto)
                        Fuck.

           He eyes the framed photos adorning the walls. All of his
           memories with Claire from years past. They look so young and
           in love.

           Then the LIGHTS SUDDENLY FLICKER.

           David looks around. What was that?

           The LIGHTS FLICKER AGAIN. Then the SOUND SYSTEM TURNS ON,
           scanning between static and different radio stations.
           The TV TURNS ON. David watches as a series of BIZARRE SYMBOLS
           AND SHAPES scroll across it from all directions, just like
           the ones Claire saw before.

           He races towards Claire's study, bursting through the door --

           STUDY

           Claire lies on the floor, BODY TWITCHING, EYELIDS BLINKING
           RAPIDLY. Her lips are moving, MUMBLING something. The computer
           monitor is on, the SAME BIZARRE SYMBOLS AND SHAPES MOVING
           ACROSS IT in all directions.

           For a moment, David just stares, frozen in horror by the
           sight. Then he rushes to Claire, shaking her.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, wake up baby! Snap out of
                        it!

           She continues mumbling. And David realizes --

           She's not speaking English. It's some kind of GROTESQUE
           UNRECOGNIZABLE LANGUAGE. Inhuman.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh God...

           He shakes her hard.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, please wake up! Open your
                        eyes!

           She mumbles incessantly, her volume increasing. He slaps her
           across the face! Nothing. Harder! Still no reaction. The
           words are coming more rapidly now. Harsher. The symbols on
           the computer screen moving faster and faster. 

           David stands up, beside himself, not knowing what to do.

           Then, just for a moment, the terrifying symbols on the monitor
           TRANSFORM INTO ENGLISH, spelling out --

           "HELP ME."

           Before turning back into the alien language.

                                 DAVID
                        No...

           He lifts the computer monitor up, its power chord dangling.
           Then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE CORNER OF THE DESK. Glass and
           parts fly as he slams it over and over and over again.
                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        David?!

           David turns --

           Claire is no longer on the floor. SHE'S STANDING IN THE
           DOORWAY. Totally normal looking. But shocked by the sight.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you doing?

                                 DAVID
                        You were... You were on the floor
                        speaking this crazy language, and
                        the computer... The computer...

           He looks around, seeing the broken computer pieces scattered
           across the floor.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David... I was in the kitchen.

           He can see the way she's looking at him, questioning his
           entire reality.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Classical piano music echoes through the house. David sits at
           his laptop making uneasy glances towards the next room. He
           looks terrible, a desperate man approaching his breaking point.

           about alien abductions. Every new website more ridiculous
           than the last. David grows more infuriated with every click.
           Blurry photos of UFOs. Strange symbols carved into stone.
           Bizarre statues from ancient times. All sorts of ridiculous
           stories and comments from total lunatics.

           He's grasping at straws. Searching for any kind of answer.

           The house PHONE RINGS. David doesn't care. It continues to
           ring and ring, until Claire answers in the next room.

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Hello.
                             (listens)
                        It's not time.

           David looks up. What did she say?

           He quickly moves to the doorway, spying on Claire.

                                 CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                        It's not time.
                             (listens)
                        No problem. Goodbye. 
           She hangs up. David walks into the room.

                                 DAVID
                        Who was that?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Just a wrong number.

           She goes back to playing the piano as if it was nothing.

           INT. CLAIRE AND DAVID'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           David steps in and quietly closes the door. He grabs the
           phone off the end table and eyes the caller ID. Dials the
           number. He waits anxiously as it rings... And rings... Then --

           Someone picks up... But they are silent on the other end.

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello? Who's there?

                                 FLETCHER (FROM PHONE)
                        What time is it?

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        What? Who is this?

           A moment passes.

                                 FLETCHER (FROM PHONE)
                        What time is it?

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        Who is this?! Tell me who you are!

           No response.

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        Tell me who you are!

           Nothing. Then David eyes his watch.

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        It's eleven thirty-seven, now who is
                        this?

                                 FLETCHER (FROM PHONE)
                        Good. I had to be sure.

                                 DAVID (INTO PHONE)
                        Sure of what?

                                 FLETCHER (FROM PHONE)
                        That you weren't one of them.

           David stiffens.
                                 FLETCHER (FROM PHONE)
                        I know what happened to your friend,
                        Mr. Morgan... And I can tell you
                        what's happening to your wife. Meet
                        me at the diner on Ridge Road in an
                        hour. Do not bring a computer, phone,
                        or any other electronic device.

           Click. David stares at the phone, unsettled.

           INT. LOCAL DINER -- DAY

           Another mostly empty place. David sits at the counter,
           nervous, plate of food untouched.

                                 FLETCHER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Morgan?

           David turns to see Fletcher standing over him.

                                 FLETCHER
                        You took the precautions I requested?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, of course. No phone. No computer.
                        Claire thinks I'm at work.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Then let's take a drive.

                                 DAVID
                        You gonna tell me who you are first?

                                 FLETCHER
                        My name is Dr. Edward Fletcher. And
                        I'm the only person who's ever going
                        to believe you.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD -- DAY

           Fletcher's nondescript car drives down the lonely road.

           INT. FLETCHER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           David sits in the passenger seat as Fletcher drives. The
           POLICE SCANNER on his dashboard crackles with a radio call.

                                 FLETCHER
                        It might be a glitch in their
                        programming or something different
                        about how they perceive the world,
                        but for some reason, they don't think
                        of time the same way we do. To you
                        and me, it's five minutes to one.
                        But to them, "It's not time yet..."
                                 DAVID
                        Not time for what?

                                 FLETCHER
                        I don't know. And that's what scares
                        me the most.
                             (beat)
                        I'm afraid I don't have good news
                        about your wife, Mr. Morgan.
                        Unfortunately, your story starts the
                        same way as many others.

                                 DAVID
                        With finding the Orb?

                                 FLETCHER
                        Yes. The Orb, sphere, magical ball,
                        whatever name you choose to give it.
                        It hones in on our emotional
                        vulnerabilities. Maybe someone wants
                        to bring their family back together
                        after a divorce. Or they lost a parent
                        or a child. It claims that it can
                        fix everything and lures us in with
                        promises of its extraordinary powers.

                                 DAVID
                        And she believed it.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Even in our darkest times, we still
                        have hope. It understands this...
                        And uses it against us.

                                 DAVID
                        But it's gone now. I've searched
                        everywhere.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Where does she think it is?

                                 DAVID
                        She acts like it never even existed.

           Fletcher slowly nods with understanding.

                                 FLETCHER
                        That's because it's inside her now.

           David turns and stares.

                                 FLETCHER
                        What landed near your home wasn't a
                        machine. It's a living creature. A
                        creature that needs a host to survive.
                                 (MORE)
                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        And now it has one. After a few days,
                        it'll take her over completely.
                             (beat)
                        Then she'll kill you...

           The statement chills David to his core.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Along with anyone else who knows about
                        the Orb's existence, like your friend.
                        It's how these things have remained a
                        mystery after all these years. Ever
                        hear those stories about a mother or
                        father who was perfectly normal one
                        day and then slaughters their entire
                        family the next? Sometimes, people go
                        crazy. Other times... It's them.

           EXT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Fletcher's car pulls up to a lone farmhouse out in the middle
           of nowhere, wheat fields stretching away to the horizon in
           every direction. The distant rumble of MACHINERY.

           INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

           The quaint home is decorated with antique furniture. Nothing
           to suggest a believer in extraterrestrials. Fletcher and
           David look over old framed photos of Fletcher and his son,
           MITCHELL, whom we met in the beginning.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I was never a good father. When
                        Mitchell's best friend passed away,
                        I didn't even bother to drop a shift
                        to go to the funeral. Instead, he
                        got a two minute phone call before I
                        went into some surgery that any other
                        doctor could have performed.

           David looks on with sympathy.

                                 FLETCHER
                        And then one night when I called, he
                        was over the moon about his new little
                        toy. A magical ball. He found it out
                        in the field near their house. It
                        rolled around, and talked to him. Of
                        course, I thought it was a boy's
                        imagination at play. Part of his
                        grieving process. But he'd fallen
                        into the trap. And then it was too
                        late.
                                 DAVID
                        He couldn't have...

                                 FLETCHER
                        I was the one who found the bodies.
                        His mother. Step father. Siblings.
                        Snapped necks. Crushed skulls. His
                        step sister bled out because he slit
                        her throat. She was only a year older
                        than him.
                             (beat)
                        The coroner couldn't understand it.
                        All the evidence made it clear that
                        my son, my eight year old son, had
                        killed them. But no one could believe
                        it. Except for me. I figured out
                        what really happened.

                                 DAVID
                        So how did you save him?

                                 FLETCHER
                        I didn't.
                             (beat)
                        But I might be able to save your
                        wife.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Claire sits next to Alan as he plays the piano. She nods
           along, but she's not really present. A glassiness in her
           expression.

           INT. FRONT DOOR, MORGAN HOUSE -- LATER

           Claire stands with Alan's Mom, Alan already by the car.

                                 ALAN'S MOM
                        So we'll see you next week.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Actually, this is going to be Alan's
                        last lesson.

                                 ALAN'S MOM
                        What?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I'm going away for a while.

                                 ALAN'S MOM
                        Back to the symphony?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes. Back to the symphony.
                                 ALAN'S MOM
                        Oh. Well I'm sorry to hear that. I
                        mean that's great for you, but Alan
                        will be...
                             (sighs)
                        Listen, I didn't want to pry, but
                        you left the recital the other night
                        in an awful hurry.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Something came up. A close friend
                        needed my help.

                                 ALAN'S MOM
                        Is everything okay?

           Claire eyes her, smile unwavering.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You should leave now.

           A tense moment. Then Alan's Mom walks towards the car,
           glancing back over her shoulder with unease. Claire waves to
           Alan with a smile. He innocently waves back.

           INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

                                 FLETCHER
                        Over the years, as I encountered
                        more cases like my son's, I developed
                        a procedure... A very dangerous
                        procedure.

                                 DAVID
                        And it'll save her?

                                 FLETCHER
                        It's worked before... It's also killed
                        those who weren't strong enough to
                        endure it. But if you love your wife,
                        this is her only chance.

                                 DAVID
                        You're saying Claire's only chance
                        is some kind of crazy procedure that
                        might kill her?

                                 FLETCHER
                        I wish there was another way.

                                 DAVID
                        I can't risk her life. She's all
                        I've got.
                                 FLETCHER
                        That's what everyone says when I
                        first explain it to them... So let
                        me show you something that might
                        change your mind.

           INT. STAIRCASE, FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Fletcher opens a door to reveal a DARK STAIRCASE DESCENDING
           TOWARDS A CLOSED DOOR, bright white light shining around the
           frame. Fletcher begins descending. David follows warily.

                                 FLETCHER
                        The police believed my son was an
                        innocent witness to a horrible
                        tragedy. But I knew what he really
                        was. I knew he would kill again. So
                        if they weren't going to protect
                        people from him, then I had to.

                                 DAVID
                        Had to what?

                                 FLETCHER
                        It's a father's responsibility to
                        protect the world from what he's
                        made. I hope you can understand. 

           Fletcher opens the door at the bottom, flooding the stairs
           with BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. They step into the --

           BASEMENT

           The walls, floor, ceiling, every surface is white, like a
           clean room environment. Banks of florescent lights overhead.
           And standing in the center of the space is a --

           PRISON CELL

           The inner walls are made of thick clear plexiglass with holes
           at regular intervals. While the outer walls are made of thick
           metal bars, each wrapped with TIGHT COILS OF WIRE that run
           up to an ELECTRICAL GRID that spider webs across the ceiling.

           Within the cell, a man in a white jumpsuit sits on a chair,
           facing away from the door. This is MITCHELL (late 20s). No
           other furniture within.

                                 DAVID
                        What the hell is this...

                                 FLETCHER
                        An electromagnetic prison. It's the
                        only way to contain him.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        The engine you heard outside is a
                        generator that powers the magnetic
                        field twenty-four hours a day. I
                        can't let it run out of fuel. Not
                        ever. Or else he'll walk right out
                        of here, and I'll be a dead man.

                                 DAVID
                        This is torture.

                                 FLETCHER
                        This is necessary.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Aren't you going to introduce me to
                        your new friend, Dr. Fletcher?

           David startles. Mitchell still hasn't turned to face them.

                                 FLETCHER
                        You already know who he is.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Do I?

                                 FLETCHER
                        Maybe you should start by introducing
                        yourself.

           Mitchell stands from his chair in a slow, fluid motion and
           turns to face them. A neutral expression on his face.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Why don't you tell him your name.

                                 MITCHELL
                        My name? I don't have a name. I am...
                        Me.

                                 FLETCHER
                        And what are you doing here?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Waiting.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Waiting for what?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Until it's time.

                                 FLETCHER
                        And when will it be time?
                                 MITCHELL
                        Not much longer now.

           David exchanges a glance with Fletcher, suddenly understanding.

                                 FLETCHER
                        This is what Claire will become.
                        When that happens, she will kill you
                        without hesitation.

           But David can't bear the sight anymore.

                                 DAVID
                        I... I can't... I have to go.

           He moves towards the stairs --

                                 MITCHELL
                        You shouldn't worry, Mr. Morgan...

           David snaps back around.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Claire will be much better very soon.

           And for the first time, he smiles subtly.

           INT. CLAIRE'S STUDY, MORGAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Claire stands alone in her study, glancing around. Her eyes
           fall upon the framed photo of Ethan, David, and her. She
           focuses on Ethan's smiling face, gazing at it blankly.

           Then she picks up the frame. REMOVES THE PHOTO from it. And
           DROPS IT IN THE TRASH.

           She takes a framed photo of her and David off the wall. Stares
           into it, emotionless. Then begins to take apart the frame.

           EXT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Fletcher follows David towards the car.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I know you're frightened, but you
                        have to trust me when I say that
                        there's no other option.

           David hesitates, turning back to him.

                                 DAVID
                        This procedure of yours... What
                        exactly do you do?
                                 FLETCHER
                        It's a form of electroshock therapy.
                        It seems to interrupt the connection
                        between whatever this life form is
                        and the human mind. You might think
                        of it like an exorcism, but with
                        science instead of religion.

                                 DAVID
                        And what if it doesn't work?

           Fletcher just stares, his implication clear. David looks
           away, torn.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Mr. Morgan... What's inside her,
                        it's like a cancer. The sooner you
                        catch it, the better her chances.
                        I've never been able to save someone
                        who has been incubating for more
                        than a few days. Claire doesn't have
                        much time left. Ultimately... This
                        comes down to your will against its.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE / INT. DAVID'S CAR -- NIGHT

           David's car pulls into the driveway. He sits there, grappling.
           Dreading what's to come. Then steps out, seeing his house
           before him, the lights on inside.

           His eyes rise to the STARRY NIGHT SKY overhead. What was
           once so beautiful now appears ominous. He stands there for a
           long moment, one small man beneath the overwhelming cosmos.

           Fletcher's car pulls up behind him. David turns as Fletcher
           climbs out and approaches. They exchange a knowing look.

           Then head towards the house.

           INT. MORGAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           David walks in, Fletcher behind him. All is quiet.

           David looks around to see that there are NO PHOTOS IN ANY OF
           THE FRAMES ON THE WALLS. He turns to Fletcher, who has clearly
           seen this before.

           STUDY

           David steps into the doorway.

           NUMEROUS PHOTO ALBUMS lay open on the floor, THEIR PAGES
           BARE. PHOTOS PILED IN THE TRASH. All of her artwork is gone.

           Claire stands holding another album, methodically removing
           the photos one by one, letting them fall to the floor.
           No emotion on her face. David is heartbroken by the sight.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?

           Her head turns and she eyes him for a moment. Then seems to
           remember. A smile spreads.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh hi, honey. I missed you.

           Fletcher steps in behind David. Claire's smile instantly
           fades. Their eyes lock.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Hello, Claire. Do you remember me?

           Claire lets out a SCREAM and LUNGES FOR HIM --

           But DAVID GRABS HER FROM BEHIND, one arm around her neck,
           the other restraining an arm as she screams and struggles.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, no! Let me go! You can't trust
                        him!

           She claws at him as Fletcher steps forward, PULLING OUT A
           SYRINGE. He yanks the cap off with his teeth and STABS THE
           NEEDLE INTO CLAIRE'S ARM, pressing the plunger down.

           Claire continues to scream and struggle.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David stop! Please! Let go! Let go...

           But her fight diminishes, strength fading, eyelids getting
           heavy. And she falls unconscious.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Quickly!

           DINING ROOM

           David and Fletcher haul Claire's limp body to the table,
           laying her on it.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Get these on her.

           He pulls a bag off his shoulder and removes HAND AND LEG
           RESTRAINTS. David looks to Claire, unconscious on the table.

                                 DAVID
                        These are really necessary?
                                 FLETCHER
                        Extremely necessary.
                             (beat)
                        Now, David! We have no time to lose.

           David musters a nod.

           SERIES OF SHOTS: Restraints are fastened around Claire's
           arms and legs. Fletcher sets up a BOXY OLD COMPUTER. Old
           MEDICAL MONITORS are powered on. ELECTRODES are attached to
           Claire's head and body.

           INT. DINING ROOM, MORGAN HOUSE -- LATER

           Fletcher comes in the front door, unspooling a THICK CORD
           all the way to his computer system.

                                 FLETCHER
                        The generator's setup about a hundred
                        feet away. It shouldn't be able to
                        interfere with it at that range.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you mean interfere with it?

                                 FLETCHER
                        Exactly what it sounds like.

                                 DAVID
                             (re: old computer)
                        And you don't think it'll be able to
                        interfere with that?

                                 FLETCHER
                        This is electromagnetically shielded,
                        like old combat computers from the
                        Cold War. It'll hold.

           Fletcher powers up all of the electronics. Monitors come to
           life showing Claire's vital signs and brain activity.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Alright. The shock therapy will
                        attempt to sever the connection. 
                        But electricity isn't enough on its
                        own. The brain activity from Claire's
                        own emotions and memories has to
                        overpower the invading entity. She's
                        still in there. You have to help her
                        find her way back.

           Fletcher takes a step closer to David, his expression grave.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Now...
                                 (MORE)
                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Whatever this thing is that's inside
                        her, it's going to recognize that
                        it's in danger. And it's going to
                        fight back aggressively. It will
                        target your emotions and exploit
                        your love of your wife. But no matter
                        what it says, no matter what it does,
                        no matter what happens... We cannot
                        stop the procedure. You understand?

           David nods apprehensively.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Now grab yourself a pair of gloves
                        out of that bag.

           Fletcher makes final adjustments on his computer as David
           unzips the bag and rifles around. He finds the gloves and
           grabs them. But underneath is a holstered REVOLVER. David
           eyes it with dread. As he turns, Fletcher is already watching.

                                 FLETCHER
                        A last resort. If we fail, we shoot
                        her in the head. Let's hope it doesn't
                        come to that.

                                 DAVID
                        There's no way you're using that on
                        my wife.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Mr. Morgan, if this doesn't work, my
                        guess is you'll use it on her
                        yourself.

           David grits his teeth, putting on the gloves. Fletcher presses
           several keys, initiating a CRUDE BRAIN WAVE ANALYSIS PROGRAM.
           Beside it he has an OLD CONTROL BOARD covered with dials,
           knobs and sliders.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Take her hand.

           David takes Claire's hand, held down by the restraints.

                                 FLETCHER
                        And remember, it's not your wife on
                        this table.

           David nods, holding Claire's hand in both of his.

           Fletcher begins to gradually adjust dials on the control
           board. He takes a breath, readying himself. Then he MOVES UP
           A SLIDER --
           Claire's body subtly SPASMS.

           Fletcher moves the slider up more...

           Her spasms grow more frequent. More intense as Fletcher
           continues to increase the voltage. David holds her hand
           tighter.

           Then Fletcher moves the slider up even further --

           And CLAIRE'S ENTIRE BODY SHAKES VIOLENTLY. HER EYES SNAP
           OPEN and she gasps for breath, CAUSING DAVID TO JUMP BACK.

           Her head whips around, taking in her situation -- restrained
           to the table, not recognizing anything around her. Another
           spasm rocks her and SHE SCREAMS OUT IN PAIN.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Take her hand!

           David stares with wide eyes. Then steps closer as she
           continues to wail. As he takes her hand, her eyes lock on
           him, pleading.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David... David, what are you doing?
                        Why are you doing this?! DAVID!

                                 FLETCHER
                        Don't listen to her!

           Fletcher turns up the voltage, causing her to CRINGE IN PAIN.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Help me, David! Please help me --
                             (spasm / scream)
                        Don't do this --
                             (spasm)
                        He's hurting me! Don't let him hurt
                        me!

           Fletcher continues to turn up the voltage, making her SCREAM
           EVEN LOUDER as David watches, horrified.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Focus! I can't do this without you!

                                 DAVID
                        I... I love you, Claire. We're trying
                        to help you.

           But his words can barely be heard over her strained screams.

                                 FLETCHER
                        She needs a lot more than that!
                                 (MORE)
                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Tell her stories. Memories. Anything
                        that she can latch onto.

                                 DAVID
                        I... Claire... Do you... Do you
                        remember when --

                                 FLETCHER
                        Louder! She has to hear you!

           Claire screams out in pain. David flinches back.

           Then he suddenly seems to take stock of the situation and
           steels himself. He firmly grabs her hand and runs his other
           hand through her hair, speaking loudly to her.

                                 DAVID
                        I need you to remember the first
                        time we met, Claire! In that shitty
                        bar on University Way --

           She wails and cringes, but David doesn't falter.

                                 DAVID
                        I know you remember the song that was
                        on, but I never told you this part.

           Suddenly, the LIGHTS BEGIN TO FLICKER.

                                 DAVID
                        I was always too embarrassed to tell
                        you...

           The flickering lights grow more frenetic.

                                 DAVID
                        When I saw you across that bar, I
                        envisioned our entire life together --

           ALL OF THE ELECTRONICS BEGIN TO FREAK OUT. Flashing,
           flickering and buzzing. The STEREO TURNS ON, rapidly flipping
           through stations -- COUNTRY MUSIC, HEAVY METAL, LOVE SONGS.

           But David just raises his voice.

                                 DAVID
                        I saw our house. I saw our kids. I
                        saw our family. I suddenly didn't
                        give a shit about anything else. Not
                        classes or other girls or anything.
                        In one moment, you changed my life.
                        You took my breath away and you still
                        take it away every single time I
                        wake up next to you.
           The blaring music from THE STEREO CHANGES TO STATIC AS ALL
           OF THE LIGHTS FREAK THE FUCK OUT.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, he's killing me! He's killing
                        me!

           David rips off his gloves, and grabs her hand even tighter,
           stomaching the pain. He yells over the noise.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, do you remember our wedding
                        day? How it poured rain. It poured
                        for hours. And then suddenly the
                        clouds parted right before you walked
                        down the aisle.

           Claire fights against her restraints, continuing to scream
           in agony.

                                 DAVID
                        We swing danced in front of everyone,
                        and I nearly fell. But you caught
                        me, and somehow made it look like it
                        was all part of the show.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can't see! Oh God, I can't see
                        anything! Everything's going black!

           She cries out, struggling far more violently. ONE OF HER
           HANDS SUDDENLY RIPS FREE of the restraints.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Tie her back down!

           David runs around the table and fights to grab her arm as it
           flails violently through the air. He uses all of his strength
           to muscle it back into the restraint. And after he cinches
           it tight, he continues to speak, tears in his eyes.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, I know you're in there and if
                        you'll remember anything, you'll
                        remember this. When they took Ethan
                        from your arms, I held you. I held
                        you tight and I promised you that no
                        matter what, we'd be okay, that I'd
                        always be with you. And I always will
                        be. I'm here, Claire. I'm right here --

           A moment of clarity in her eyes --

                                 CLAIRE
                        I remember, David... I remember...
           Another jolt of electricity makes her spasm. David's
           confidence begins to falter at the sight.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Don't believe a word she says! Just
                        keep talking! Keep talking to her!

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, I...

           But David is growing more distracted by all of the chaos
           around them.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, please, I remember! I remember
                        everything now! You have to stop him!

           The TV suddenly shows a VIDEO OF THE FIRST KISS FROM THEIR
           WEDDING. Static. CLAIRE FROLICKING IN TROPICAL OCEAN WAVES.
           Static. CLAIRE AND DAVID KISSING SWEETLY in front of a sunset.
           Static. CELEBRATING TOGETHER AT THEIR COLLEGE GRADUATION.

           Tears fill David's eyes as he watches.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Close your eyes!

           Fletcher pushes up the voltage even higher.

                                 CLAIRE
                        DAVID! HELP ME!

           Claire's heart rate grows more erratic on the monitor. Her
           screams and pleas become more disjointed.

           The scene around them grows more chaotic with all of the
           electronics going haywire. ONE LIGHT BULB EXPLODES. THEN
           ANOTHER. AND ANOTHER.

           Then Claire's ENTIRE BODY GOES RIGID and HER EYES ROLL BACK.
           She's unconscious and spasming.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire? Claire?!

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                             (calm and soothing)
                        David...

           David whips around, looking for the source of the voice. But
           Claire's body is still locked rigid by violent spasms.

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        David... I love you.

           THE VOICE IS INSIDE HIS HEAD. Tender, soft and heartfelt.
                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        I've always loved you. From the first
                        moment our eyes met.

                                 DAVID
                        No...

           David is crumbling. Fletcher looks up, realizing.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Stay with me! Don't listen to her!

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        You can't let him take me from you.
                        I don't want to live without you.

                                 FLETCHER
                        It's not real! It's not her talking!

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        I want to be with you forever, baby.
                        You and me. We're a family, David...
                        We're a family... We're a family...

           David clamps his eyes shut, holding his hands over his ears.

           Then he suddenly HEARS A BABY CRYING. He opens his eyes --

           Their BABY SON is right in front of him, wailing in Claire's
           arms. She's awake and nestling Ethan close, smiling at him
           sweetly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We're a family, David.

                                 DAVID
                        Ethan...

           Ethan holds his little hand out. David reaches to touch him.

                                 FLETCHER
                        There's nothing there, David! There's
                        nothing there!

           David looks back to Claire. The baby is gone and she's still
           unconscious. He's beside himself, not knowing what to believe.

           Fletcher pushes up the voltage even higher. CLAIRE SPASMS
           MORE VIOLENTLY. No human being could take this.

           And then LIQUID METAL suddenly becomes visible FLOWING THROUGH
           HER VEINS, bulging, seeping through to the surface before
           instantly BOILING AWAY INTO THE AIR.

                                 FLETCHER
                        It's working! It's working!
                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        I forgive you, David...

                                 FLETCHER
                        Just hold on! Just a little longer!

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        I forgive you... For killing me...

           David turns to the monitors, and Claire's heart is barely
           beating. Growing more faint...

                                 DAVID
                        You're killing her...

           Her heartbeat is moments from flat lining...

                                 FLETCHER
                        We're nearly there!

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        I love you, David...

                                 DAVID
                        You're killing her!

           And suddenly DAVID SHOVES FLETCHER OUT OF THE WAY AND RIPS
           THE PLUG OUT of the system.

           In an instant, EVERYTHING GOES DEAD in the house and THERE'S
           SILENCE. Claire's body goes limp, the liquid metal gone.

           David rushes to her, grabbing her head.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire? Claire?!

           She doesn't respond.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire!

           An agonizing moment of silence.

           But then there is a low beep... Beep... Of her heart beating.
           Getting stronger by the second. 

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, baby! I've got you! I've got
                        you!

           Fletcher comes over to her, taking her vitals with a renewed
           sense of hope.
                                 DAVID
                        Did it work? Please God tell me it
                        worked.

           Claire's eyes slowly open...

           And she focuses on David, recognizing him. Remembering.

           A smile forms on her face.

           She's home. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        I think... I think it just might
                        have.

           David lets out a cry of joy as he quickly removes the
           restraints from her hands and legs.

           Then Claire turns to Fletcher.

           And HER EXPRESSION GOES DEAD NEUTRAL.

                                 FLETCHER
                        No!

           Her hand rises with lightning speed and LOCKS AROUND FLETCHER'S
           THROAT. He fights against her grip, gasping for breath.

           David stumbles back, dumbfounded by the sight.

           And then CLAIRE LAUNCHES FLETCHER ACROSS THE ROOM WITH INHUMAN
           STRENGTH. HIS BODY SLAMS INTO THE FIREPLACE HEAD FIRST.

           David watches, horrified, as Claire calmly walks over to
           Fletcher. He groans, trying to move. She turns his body over
           with her foot. Then she picks up the nearby FIRE POKER,
           looking into his terrified eyes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Mitchell asked us to say... Goodbye.

           SHE STABS THE POKER THROUGH HIS NECK. He gasps and gargles,
           as she watches with idle curiosity. Until he moves no more.

           Then she turns to face David...

           In a panic, he scrambles to Fletcher's bag and PULLS OUT THE
           REVOLVER. Aims it at her with shaking hands. She shows no
           fear, no love, nothing at all.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David... Why are you frightened?

           David backs away as she slowly approaches, not lowering the
           gun. She smiles at him.
           But there's something wrong with her expression, something
           foreign and frightening.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come here, David. I can make it all
                        better.

           David's shaking finger rests on the trigger... But he can't
           do it. He just can't do it.

                                 DAVID
                        Shit...

           He frantically pulls out his cell and dials 9-1-1. But Claire
           TILTS HER HEAD SLIGHTLY. THE SCREEN GLITCHES AND GOES BLACK.

                                 DAVID
                        Shit!

           David drops the phone and backs away from Claire, holding the
           gun between them as she continues her slow advance.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, where are you going? Stay
                        here with me. This is our home now.

           But David turns and runs out the front door. Claire's
           expression goes neutral once again.

           EXT. MORGAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           David heads straight for the car, scrambling to pull out his
           keys. He jumps into the driver's seat and shoves the keys
           into the ignition --

           BUT THE STARTER JUST CLICKS.

           He pumps the gas, but the engine won't turn over.

           Then he sees Claire standing in the open doorway, staring at
           him in the car. It's not going to start.

           David gets out of the car and runs into the woods.

           Claire calmly walks down the steps after him. 

           EXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

           David runs as fast as he can through the darkness.

           He ducks behind a thick trunk, gasping for breath. Looks
           back and sees Claire walking through the trees after him.

           Then she stops, eyes scanning, listening.
                                 CLAIRE
                        David? I know you're close. I want
                        you to know, that I remember. I
                        remember everything. I remember our
                        first dance together. That look in
                        your eyes. I instantly knew it was
                        love. I knew we were always meant to
                        be together --

           He takes off running again, revolver still in his hand.
           Claire's head snaps around like a predator, and she moves
           after him.

           David zigs and zags, tree branches cutting at his face. He
           struggles to push through. HE TRIPS AND FALLS, DROPPING THE
           GUN. Scrambles to pick it back up --

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        Why are you running from me, David?

           David freezes, looking back over a rock. Somehow she is still
           close behind him, head panning, searching.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We can't run away from our problems.
                        Isn't that what the doctors always
                        told us? We have to face them. We
                        have to face them together.

           David gets to his feet and runs.

           EXT. ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

           David comes out of the trees and runs down the center of the
           rural road towards the nearby CROSSROADS. Several STREETLIGHTS
           illuminate the intersection.

           Claire walks out of the trees, still calm, totally unfazed
           by the chase.

           David looks desperately up one road, and the other.

           Claire's eyes rise to the streetlights and suddenly --

           A BULB EXPLODES, sending down a SHOWER OF SPARKS near David.
           He flinches as another bulb explodes. Then the last one,
           plunging the road into darkness again as Claire gets ever
           closer. He doesn't wait a second longer, ducking back into
           the trees.   

           EXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

           David sprints, revolver in hand, constantly glancing back
           over his shoulder. Claire is nowhere in sight, but he doesn't
           slow down.
                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                             (distant, echoey)
                        Daaaviiiid...

           David stops in his tracks and turns, scanning the trees. No
           sign of Claire. The voice is in his head.

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                             (from the right)
                        Come back to me, David.

           David frantically spins with each new sound, but he sees no
           sign of her.

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                             (from the left)
                        I love you.
                             (behind)
                        It's time to have another baby.
                             (all around)
                        We can be a family again.

           David sprints away, terrified.

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        David... David...

           His head turns on a swivel. And he doesn't see as --

           THE GROUND DROPS OUT FROM UNDER HIM AND HE TUMBLES DOWN A
           STEEP EMBANKMENT. Barely avoiding tree trunks. Rolling over
           rocks. Bouncing. Sliding. Before skidding to a stop.

           He's badly beat up, but forces himself back to his feet.
           Gets a few feet then falls again, his strength sapped. He
           looks around, struggling to get his bearings.

           EXT. STREAM, FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

           And we realize that he's at Claire's special, secluded place,
           near where she first found the Orb.

           Then Claire emerges from the trees. She calmly approaches
           until she is standing right over him. He looks up at her.

                                 DAVID
                        Please... Claire... Come back to me.
                        I know you're still in there.

           Claire looks down on him without annoyance or anger. Only
           the slightest hint of curiosity.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Claire has to go now. She's been
                        chosen for something far greater
                        than you could ever understand.
                                 DAVID
                        No! Let her go! You've destroyed
                        everything that we had! We were a
                        family! We were happy!

                                 CLAIRE
                        If she was happy, she wouldn't have
                        let us in.

           David struggles to his feet, fueled by rage, RAISING THE
           REVOLVER with more certainty now.

                                 CLAIRE
                        She's not coming back, David. It's
                        time to let her go.

                                 DAVID
                        No...

                                 CLAIRE
                        She's with us now. And she's much
                        happier...

           She steps towards him.

                                 DAVID
                        NO!

           Tears in his eyes, HE PULLS THE TRIGGER. Again, and again,
           and again. HITTING CLAIRE SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

           A surprised expression comes over Claire's face as blood
           runs down her clothes.

           Then she stumbles back, and falls to the ground. But she
           doesn't show any sign of pain. Just lies on her back and
           breathes once... Twice... And then stops. Not moving. Dead.

           David lowers the gun. His anger quickly fades, replaced by
           the horror of what he's just done.

           Tears run down his cheeks as he gasps for breath, falling to
           his knees next to her body, completely breaking down.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh God... Oh God, Claire... Claire,
                        I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

           He rests his head on her chest as he continues to sob. Alone
           in the dark woods.

           But suddenly a GLOWING BLUE LIGHT BEGINS TO FLOW THROUGH
           CLAIRE'S WOUNDS -- the same light cast by the Orb.

           David sees it and stumbles away, watching as --
           The light swirls around her chest wounds, and miraculously
           they BEGIN TO REPAIR. Blood ceases to flow, and unblemished
           skin grows over them.

           CLAIRE TAKES A DEEP BREATH. Her eyes blink. Then focus on
           David standing over her.

           David is overtaken with panic. He points the gun at Claire
           again and pulls the trigger --

           Click. Click. Click. No bullets left.

           Claire gets back to her feet with no sign of aggravation.
           She moves towards him. David is too stunned to move as --

           SHE HUGS HIM.

           And something in David makes him hug her back. He clings
           tightly to her as his tears run.

                                 DAVID
                        I love you.

           A hint of conflict shines through Claire's eyes as A SINGLE
           TEAR STREAMS DOWN HER FACE. She delicately kisses David on
           the cheek and whispers in his ear...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Goodbye.

           Then SHE EFFORTLESSLY SNAPS HIS NECK.

           David's body collapses to the ground. Claire looks down at
           her dead husband... And wipes away her tear.

           Then she calmly walks away into the forest, disappearing into
           the shadows.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

           A beautiful, sunny day at Fletcher's home. The same distant
           sound of the generator... Until it chugs, stuttering.

           EXT. GENERATOR, FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           The industrial GENERATOR is installed behind an outbuilding,
           with a several THOUSAND GALLON FUEL TANK next to it...

           But the GAUGE HAS FALLEN BELOW EMPTY. The generator sputters
           once, twice, and THEN IT DIES. 
           INT. BASEMENT, FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Mitchell sits in his chair. The HUM of the electrical field
           around him suddenly GOES SILENT.

           He slowly glances from one side. To the other.

           Then he calmly stands.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           A door opens to reveal another room in the basement. Mitchell
           walks in.

           The walls are covered with ARTICLES AND OBITUARIES RELATING
           TO MYSTERIOUS METEOR SHOWERS AND DEATHS. To MASS MURDERS and
           MISSING PERSONS. All of them linked together on a WORLD MAP
           with pins, strings and arrows. All of Fletcher's work.

           Mitchell's gaze drifts over it. Then he sees a LIQUID NITROGEN
           FREEZER in the corner. He lifts the lid, unleashing a WAVE
           OF WHITE GAS. It clears to reveal the contents of the tank:

           A DOZEN SOFTBALL SIZED ORBS, smaller than the one Claire
           found, but equally ominous.

           A subtle smile creeps across his face.

           EXT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Mitchell walks out the door, now wearing jeans and a jacket,
           a backpack over his shoulders. Looking perfectly normal. He
           walks away up the gravel drive towards the road.

           Behind him, ROILING BLACK SMOKE BEGINS TO RISE out of the
           house's door and windows. But Mitchell doesn't look back.

           EXT. METROPOLITAN CITY CENTER -- DAY

           We're somewhere in a big city. PEDESTRIANS fill the sidewalk,
           moving with all of the haste that their busy lives call for.

           And amongst them we find Claire, now with a different hair
           color and appearance, walking at a relaxed pace. She looks
           just like any other city dweller.

           But as she moves through the crowd, she MAKES EYE CONTACT
           with certain others, who EXCHANGE KNOWING LOOKS. Young people.
           Old people. Even a child. She subtly nods to each in turn
           and they return the gesture in an almost imperceptible way.

           They walk among us... Right in front of our eyes.

                                                          SMASH TO BLACK.
