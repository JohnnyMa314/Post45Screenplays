           EXT. KINGDOM OF POSITANIA - DAY

           As glorious a day as you’ve ever seen. The blue sky 
           practically sparkles as, below, the velvety green leaves 
           of trees frame the LONG STONE ROAD leading to a distant 
           PALACE RIGHT OUT OF A FAIRY TALE: white marble 
           balustrades, gilded rooftops, grand terraces. 

           A WIZENED OLD MAN’S VOICE explains:

                                 JACOB (V.O.)
                        Once upon a time ...

           EXT. ROAD TO PALACE - AERIAL VIEW

           The road to the palace is packed with GLITTERING 
           CARRIAGES, each more elegant than the last. 

                                 JACOB (V.O.)
                        ... a parade of princesses were invited 
                        to seek the hand of a handsome prince.

           INT. EMERALD CARRIAGE

           Inside one, we see a beautiful scarlet-haired princess, 
           EDWINA, being fussed over by an ARMY OF HANDMAIDENS. They 
           cluster around her, putting the finishing touches on her 
           dress, her makeup, her updo.

           INT. PORCELAIN CARRIAGE

           Inside another, we see a beautiful ebony-haired princess, 
           LEONORA, practicing an operatic song. But when she tries 
           to hit a high note, her voice CURDLES AND SHE CHOKES.

           INT. SILVER CARRIAGE

           The sound of her trying again and again to hit the note 
           has drifted back to a beautiful golden-haired princess, 
           GENERICA, who smiles triumphantly and exclaims:

                                 GENERICA
                        Oh, what a marvelous day! 

           Her lady-in-waiting, WINNIFRED, who’s been staring out 
           the window, turns to her in irritation. An unkempt 
           brunette with coke-bottle glasses. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Who are you talking to when you do that?
                                 GENERICA
                        Why, to you, dear Winnifred.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You sound deranged.

           All at once, Generica drops her sweet demeanor. In a low, 
           threatening tone:

                                 GENERICA
                        Listen up. You’re here for one reason and 
                        one reason only: to help me land this 
                        walking bag of money. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        What a romantic sentiment. Is it from a 
                        poem?

                                 GENERICA
                        Spare me the attitude and concentrate on 
                        doing your job. And brush your hair.

           Resuming her previous saccharine tone:

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, how I’ll miss these moments between 
                        us when I’m Queen of Positania, and 
                        you’re stuck in an attic somewhere trying 
                        to spin straw into gold. With a dwarf.

           INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME

           PRESCOTT, the handsome, burly prince of every girl’s 
           dreams, stands in a line with his mother and father, KING 
           OGDEN and QUEEN ODELLA. His parents seem smug and 
           satisfied with what they see. But Prescott looks unsure.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You don’t think it’s sort of ... over-the-
                        top?

           We REVERSE to reveal an ENORMOUS GOLD THRONE. Its seat is 
           at least sixteen feet high, and its elaborately decorated 
           gold back, in which the family crest is surrounded by 
           intertwining vines, reaches to the vaulted ceiling above.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to need a ladder just to climb 
                        onto that thing.

           On cue, a SERVANT WHEELS A LADDER INTO FRAME.
                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        It makes a statement about who you are, 
                        darling. You’re not just any knave off 
                        the street. You’re Prince Prescott of 
                        Positania. Powerful. Masculine. 

                                 KING OGDEN
                        A born ruler! A god among men!

           Prescott grins, temporarily carried away by this notion 
           of himself, but quickly shakes it off, saying:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I know all that, of course. But I don’t 
                        want these girls to feel too intimidated 
                        by me to be themselves. 

           But neither of his parents seems to have heard this. As 
           if responding to a completely different statement:

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        You’re right, it is missing something.

                                 KING OGDEN
                                (snapping his fingers)
                        One of those things you hold.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Yes! Those balls on sticks!

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (annoyed)
                        A scepter?

                                 KING OGDEN
                        Exactly!

           EXT. ROAD TO PALACE - AERIAL VIEW

           The first of the traffic jam of coaches is approaching 
           the palace. MILES DOWN THE LINE we find Generica’s silver 
           carriage, still inching along slowly.

           INT. GENERICA’S CARRIAGE

           Generica launches a VOLLEY OF COMPLAINTS at Winnifred.

                                 GENERICA
                        This is taking too long. It’s too hot in 
                        here. My makeup is melting. And I don’t 
                        even want to think about my hair. 
           Generica pats her hair. Suddenly her EYES WIDEN.

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        Winnifred, where is my tiara?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I don’t know. You must’ve forgotten to 
                        put it on this morning. 

                                 GENERICA
                        And you didn’t notice? You’re supposed to 
                        be my mirror!

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’m supposed to be your lady-in-waiting. 

                                 GENERICA
                        Well, I’d rather have a mirror. Then I’d 
                        be looking at myself instead of ...
                                (gesturing at Winnifred)
                        ... whatever you’re doing over there.

           Her hysteria mounting rapidly now:

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, god, what will the prince think of me 
                        if I don’t even have a tiara?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Maybe he’ll like your personality. 

                                 GENERICA
                        Very funny. You’re fired.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Excuse me?

                                 GENERICA
                        I said you’re fired. Now get out of my 
                        carriage.

           Winnifred leaps to her feet, eyes ablaze.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You can’t fire me! I quit!

                                 GENERICA
                        Fine by me. Good luck at your next job 
                        hawking magic beans to dairy farmers. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Good luck impressing the prince. I hope 
                        he doesn’t ask you anything more 
                        complicated than your name. 
           EXT. ROAD TO PALACE

           Abruptly, Winnifred comes FLYING OUT OF THE MOVING 
           CARRIAGE, landing in a heap on the side of the road. 
           Within moments Generica’s carriage has disappeared over a 
           hill, leaving her alone on the desolate road.

           Pulling herself to her feet and dusting herself off:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        What now?

           She notices a GILDED SIGNPOST on the other side of the 
           road. Underneath an arrow pointed ahead, it reads:

           ROYAL PALACE OF POSITANIA          5 MILES
           FOREST FULL OF POSSIBILITIES       7 MILES

           Sure enough, just beyond the distant palace lies an 
           ENDLESS WILDERNESS of densely packed trees. Looking at 
           the other side of the sign, Winnifred sees an arrow 
           pointing in an opposite direction under the words:

           KINGDOM OF DALMANE                 53 MILES
           THE BORING LIFE YOU KNEW BEFORE    WHO CARES

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        This is a very opinionated sign.

           Turning back to the forest, Winnifred shields her eyes 
           from the sun and studies it, biting her lip in thought. 

           Then, with a shrug:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Forest it is, then.

           She starts down the road.

           INT. PRESCOTT’S SUITE - LATER

           Prescott, dressed in his formal regalia, is being tended 
           to by his devoted valet, NORWOOD, ancient and gnome-like, 
           who straightens his lapels, brushes lint from his arms.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I never thought I’d find a bride this 
                        way. I always thought I’d meet a damsel 
                        in distress on a heroic quest. Earn her 
                        hand by slaying a dragon, then live 
                        happily ever after. 

           With a wise sparkle in his eyes:
                                 NORWOOD
                        There’s still time, sire. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Is there? I’m ...
                                (as if it’s a horrible 
                                secret)
                        ... twenty-nine. If I don’t marry soon 
                        I’ll have to go live on top of a mountain 
                        somewhere and take up wizarding. Do you 
                        have any idea how stupid I’ll look? I 
                        can’t even grow a beard, the hair just 
                        comes in all patchy.  

                                 NORWOOD
                        Then I suppose you should make tonight 
                        count, sire. 

           Norwood places a HEAVY, GEM-STUDDED GOLD CROWN on 
           Prescott’s head, then hands him an EQUALLY RIDICULOUS 
           GOLD SCEPTER topped with an enormous ruby.

           INT. VESTIBULE OUTSIDE THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

           HUNDREDS OF PRINCESSES teem outside the closed, two-story 
           doors to the throne room. After a moment, we realize 
           they’re arrayed in an endless, snaking line delineated by 
           velvet ropes. At the front of the line is Generica.

           Suddenly the doors open a crack to let out a WEEPING 
           PRINCESS. She rushes past the line, devastated, and exits 
           the hall, her SOBS ECHOING BACK AT THEM.

            From inside, a HERALD’S VOICE ANNOUNCES:

                                 HERALD (O.S.)
                        Princess Generica of Dalmane!

           INT. THRONE ROOM

           Generica walks in mincing, self-conscious steps up an 
           endless red carpet. HUNDREDS OF COURTIERS cluster on 
           either side, watching as she approaches the throne, atop 
           which Prescott sits, holding a scepter and looking bored.

                                 GENERICA
                        Your highness.

           She curtsies deeply. 
                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        I am Princess Generica of Dalmane, 
                        daughter of Queen Homogenia, heiress to 
                        the realm of--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Why aren’t you wearing a tiara? 

           Generica turns BRIGHT RED, INFURIATED. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. PALACE ROAD - NIGHT

           Darkness has fallen as Winnifred limps toward the still-
           distant palace and the even more distant forest beyond. 
           She pauses to take off her high heels and TOSS THEM INTO 
           THE BUSHES before continuing.

           But she’s only made it a few steps when, with a MIGHTY 
           THUNDERCLAP, the skies open up, DELUGING HER IN RAIN.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Oh come on.

           INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME

           Prescott, still seated atop the throne, is arguing with 
           his parents, who stand below pleading with him.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Any of the three would be perfectly fine, 
                        dear. Just pick one.

                                 KING OGDEN
                        You know what might help? An ancient 
                        discernment spell taught to me by a 
                        mighty sorcerer. “Eenie, meenie, minie--”

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Don’t you think that if any of them were 
                        the one, I’d know?

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Oh, “the one.” What does that even mean? 
                        Do you know why your father and I got 
                        married? Because of all the men who tried 
                        to wake me from my hundred-year nap, he 
                        was the only one perverted enough to make 
                        out with a girl in a coma. 
                                 KING OGDEN
                        And it worked.

           INT. VESTIBULE OUTSIDE THRONE ROOM - SAME

           Generica, Leonora and Edwina wait in the empty vestibule, 
           eyeing each other with naked hostility. 

                                 EDWINA
                        Everyone knows men love redheads.

                                 LEONORA
                        No, men love music. 

           An ORCHESTRA SWELLS AS SHE BEGINS TO SING:

                                 LEONORA (CONT’D)
                        “I confess I’ve never met--”

                                 GENERICA
                        That’s right, stick to the lower octaves.

           The ORCHESTRA DEFLATES, FALLS SILENT.

           INT. THRONE ROOM 

           The argument continues:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        They’re all equally sweet and beautiful. 
                        How can I possibly decide?

           A silence falls. Then, with a flash of inspiration:

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        I know of a way!

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (hopeful)
                        You do?

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        First thing tomorrow, we’ll place a 
                        single pea under a stack of featherbeds, 
                        then have each of them lie on top.

           King Ogden claps his hands together, delighted.

                                 KING OGDEN
                        The old “princess and the pea” test! 
                        Classic. Why didn’t I think of that?
           He beams at Queen Odella. But Prescott is confused. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Are we going to make them ... clean the 
                        flattened pea off the floor? 

                                 KING OGDEN
                        A princess never cleans.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        So we’ll make them eat it? 

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        A princess never eats! 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I don’t understand.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                                (impatient)
                        A true princess is so delicate that she 
                        will feel the pea through the 
                        featherbeds, revealing herself to be the 
                        one most worthy of your hand. 

           Prescott furrows his brow. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        That doesn’t make any--

           But the King and Queen are already striding toward the 
           back of the room. Prescott goes to follow them--

           --and realizes that first he has to find a way out of his 
           chair. He calls out weakly to the empty space:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Anyone seen that ladder?

           At these words, a THUNDERBOLT CRACKS OUTSIDE.

           INT. PRESCOTT’S SUITE - LATE NIGHT

           Norwood is helping Prescott, now dressed in goofy 
           pajamas, to hang up his princely regalia. Outside, the 
           thunderstorm continues to RAGE LOUDLY. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I don’t understand this whole “princess 
                        and the pea” thing. Why would I want to 
                        marry the one who complains the most?
           Norwood nods sympathetically. Somewhere in the distance, 
           a repetitive BANGING can be heard.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Although I guess complaining would be 
                        easier to take than singing. 

           The BANGING RECURS. Louder this time. Tilting his head:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Is someone at the door?

           EXT. CASTLE - SAME

           Winnifred, drenched from head to toe, is still 
           FRANTICALLY BANGING on the door when it SWINGS INWARD, 
           sending her FLYING INSIDE.

           INT. ENTRY HALL

           Winnifred tumbles into a heap at Prescott’s feet. At the 
           sight of the sopping wet, barefoot girl, a hopeful 
           expression blossoms on his face. He extends a hand--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Here, let me help you.

           But Winnifred waves him away and pushes herself up. As 
           she raises her face for the first time:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’m okay, thanks. 

           Prescott tries not to flinch at what he sees. If he’d 
           been hoping for an unconventional beauty to be magically 
           dropped in his lap, those hopes were just dashed.

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I’m Winnifred.

           As she extends a hand for him to shake, she notices his 
           pajamas. Abruptly, she busts out laughing.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Nice PJs. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (defensive)
                        This castle can get very drafty at night.
                                 WINNIFRED
                        I bet. So do you work here, or ...

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No, I don’t work here. I live here. I’m 
                        Prince Prescott of Positania?

           Winnifred does a double take.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You’re the prince? The one everyone’s 
                        trying to lock down?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        “Lock down”?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Sorry. I meant, uh, lock ... eyes with. 
                        Across a crowded room. In order to 
                        experience the magic and wonder that is 
                        love at first sight.

           Prescott laughs.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Nice save.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        It was worth a shot. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Are you hungry? I can wake up the chef. 
                        He makes a mean coquilles St. Jacques.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Oh, no need to do that.
                                (beat)
                        But do you think anyone would mind if I 
                        made myself a sandwich?

           INT. KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

           Winnifred and Prescott sit next to one another on one of 
           the butcher-block counters, each wolfing down a massive 
           sandwich with tremendous relish. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        How’d you come to be wandering around in 
                        a thunderstorm? Barefoot?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I was a lady-in-waiting to one of the 
                        princesses. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WINNIFRED (CONT'D)
                        But I, uh, got separated from her in the 
                        storm. Carriage turned back into a 
                        pumpkin at midnight, lots of confusion, 
                        you know how it is. 

           She continues cheerfully:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        So, did you choose a bride?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s a little hard to know whether you 
                        want to spend the rest of your life with 
                        someone based on a two-minute interaction 
                        in front of hundreds of courtiers and 
                        your parents.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Oh, just get it over with and pick the 
                        prettiest one.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Excuse me?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        That’s what you’re going to do 
                        eventually, isn’t it? Be honest.

           Prescott is visibly offended by this. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        How do you know what I’m going to do?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        It’s not an insult. That’s just the kind 
                        of world we live in.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        If you’re so interested in honesty, then 
                        why don’t you tell me the truth?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        About what?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No loyal lady-in-waiting would allow 
                        herself to be separated from her princess 
                        so easily. 

           Winnifred hesitates a moment. Then:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Okay. I got fired. So I decided to go 
                        into the forest.
                                 PRESCOTT
                                (horrified)
                        The forest? Why?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        To look for an adventure.

           Prescott is confused by this for a moment. Then, seeming 
           to realize something, he nods. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Oh. I get it. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You do?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Sure. You’re thinking maybe you’ll meet a 
                        poor miller by a well, and then he’ll--

                                 WINNIFRED
                        --fall in love with me for my virtue and 
                        kindness, at which point he’ll reveal 
                        himself to secretly be a king? 
                                (laughing)
                        Come on. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        It could happen.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        But I’m not virtuous. And I’m definitely 
                        not kind. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Well, then you should try to be. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My whole life people have told me what to 
                        do. From now on, I do what I want.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You’ll never find a husband with that 
                        attitude.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Did it ever occur to you that maybe I 
                        don’t care whether I get married?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        How can you not care?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Like this.
           She takes a huge bite of her sandwich. Mouth full:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Mmmmm. Delicious. 

           INT. GRAND HALL - LATER

           As Prescott leads Winnifred through the palace’s grand 
           hall, he explains the meanings of the three-story 
           tapestries decorating its walls.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        This one here’s the story of how my great-
                        grandparents met.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Looks pretty complicated.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Oh, it was. See, my Nana accidentally 
                        dropped a gold ball into a pond, and a 
                        frog came hopping out. Of course she 
                        didn’t know he was my Pop-Pop, under a 
                        curse from a wicked witch. But he asked 
                        if he could sleep on her pillow, and out 
                        of kindness and compassion she agreed. In 
                        the morning, the curse had been lifted.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        And she had no idea he was a prince.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        None.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        In spite of the fact that he could talk.

           Prescott pauses, considering. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Okay, maybe she had some idea.

           Winnifred laughs, gestures at an upcoming panel.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        And this one?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        My grandma and grandpa. She lived in a 
                        distant fortress, and hundreds of men had 
                        already sought her hand in vain.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT'D)
                        When Grandpa arrived, he understood why, 
                        for Grandma looked to him like an old 
                        crone. But she explained--

                                 WINNIFRED
                        --that she was under some kind of spell, 
                        and if he could break it she’d reveal 
                        herself as the beauty she truly was?

           Prescott is genuinely astonished. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        How did you know that?

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (laughing)
                        Just a lucky guess. 

           INT. EAST WING

           Prescott has shown Winnifred to a bedroom in the castle’s 
           endless east wing. Holding the door open for her:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Well, good luck on your adventure.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Good luck choosing a bride.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Oh, I won’t need luck. I have peas.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        What?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Don’t worry about it.

           Winnifred steps inside. Smiles at him before saying:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Goodnight, Prince Prescott. Thanks for 
                        helping out a damsel in distress. 

           She shuts the door. Prescott stands there for a moment, 
           his face thoughtful. Suddenly a voice behind him says:

                                 NORWOOD (O.S.)
                        You like her.

           Prescott STARTLES, spins around to see Norwood standing 
           behind him.
                                 PRESCOTT
                        Have you been following me? That’s pretty 
                        creepy, Norwood.

                                 NORWOOD
                        It’s my job, sire.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I really don’t think it is. 

                                 NORWOOD
                                (ignoring this)
                        You like her, but you know the queen will 
                        never let you marry her. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Someone so unkempt, with so many of her 
                        own ideas? I’d be lucky if Mother didn’t 
                        throw her in the dungeon. 

           He sighs forlornly.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        If only there were some kind of magic 
                        wand we could wave to make her seem more 
                        like a princess ...

                                 NORWOOD
                        Indeed. If only.

           Prescott shrugs. Not picking up on Norwood’s portentous 
           tone or syntax. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Oh well. 

           He starts back down the hall, leaving Norwood alone. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. WINNIFRED’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Cheerful, lemony sunlight streams in through a massive 
           window framing a gorgeous view of Positania. 

           A tiny figure in the room’s massive, pillowy bed, 
           Winnifred wakes up slowly, stretching her arms over her 
           head and yawning. Turns toward the view and takes it in 
           with a sleepy, glazed expression.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON (O.S.)
                        Well, it’s about time.
           With a SHRIEK, Winnifred leaps out of bed to find a FAIRY 
           sitting in a chair in a corner. She has an unlined face 
           and silver hair, and is wearing a shimmering dress.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Who are you?

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        I thought you were supposed to be smart. 
                                (beat)
                        Look around. You’re a penniless servant 
                        with a crush on a prince--

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I don’t have a crush on him!

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Oh, okay, “you don’t have a crush on 
                        him.” I got you.

           She winks at Winnifred.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON (CONT’D)
                        But seriously, think about it for a 
                        second. I sparkle, I have a wand ...

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (eyes widening)
                        Are you my ... fairy godmother?

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Please. “Fairy godmother” is my mom. I’m 
                        a Fairy Hotperson. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        That doesn’t have much of a ring to it.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        The point is, I’m here to help you. Any 
                        wish you have, I can make come true.

           Winnifred squints her eyes and presses her fingers to her 
           temples as if deep in concentration.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I wish ... that you ... would disappear.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                                (not amused)
                        You know what I meant. Any wish related 
                        to clothes, shoes, your general 
                        appearance and availability for the 
                        prince or events related to the prince. 
                        Need a ballgown? Some earrings? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON (CONT'D)
                        An elaborate hairstyle that stays in 
                        place without products? I’m your girl. 

           By now Winnifred is pulling on her dress, trying to 
           finger-comb her hair, wiping smudges from her glasses 
           before replacing them firmly on the bridge of her nose.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I don’t really care about that kind of 
                        thing. And anyway, I’m leaving today. But 
                        if you could maybe conjure me some hiking 
                        boots, or a picnic?

           With an irritated sigh, Fairy Hotperson pulls a magic 
           wand from the sleeve of her dress and FLICKS IT AT 
           WINNIFRED, who WINCES AS IF SHE’S BEEN STRUCK.

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

           She quickly covers her eyes. 

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        You blinded me!

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                                (rolling her eyes)
                        Take off your glasses, you idiot.

           Winnifred obeys. Blinks once or twice. Realizes:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I can see.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        The words are “thank” and “you.”

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Thank you. This’ll be really helpful on 
                        my adventure.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Your adventure?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Yeah. I’m fleeing my lowly circumstances. 
                        Going into the forest to seek my destiny. 

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Oh, honey, no you aren’t.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        People do it all the time!
                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Sure, woodcutters’ sons, banished 
                        sorcerers, your occasional king in 
                        disguise planning to hang out around 
                        wells and wait for virtuous peasants to 
                        come by. But you’re a girl.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        That’s awfully old-fash--

           But before she can finish her sentence, Fairy Hotperson 
           has FLICKED THE WAND AT HER AGAIN. Her plain dress is 
           INSTANTLY TRANSFORMED into a corseted, brocaded, hoop-
           skirted and over-the-top BALLGOWN.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Can you breathe?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Sort of.

           She flicks the wand again. Winnifred GASPS as the gown 
           TIGHTENS. Barely able to choke out the words:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        I think I’m starting to understand why 
                        Generica’s so nasty all the time.  

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Just a couple finishing touches--

           She DANCES HER WAND THROUGH THE AIR and just like that, a 
           pair of GLASS SLIPPERS appear on Winnifred’s feet, 
           encasing them tightly like bugs in amber. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Are these ... glass shoes?

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        Trust me, they’re all the rage among 
                        working girls trying to land wealthy 
                        guys. Plus they make it impossible for 
                        you to move quickly.  

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Watch me. 

           She stumbles to the door and throws it open.

           INT. EAST WING HALLWAY

           Winnifred takes off as fast as she can for the Great 
           Hall, but only makes it a few steps before she STUMBLES.
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Stupid glass shoes.

           Picking herself up, she takes another few steps before 
           realizing she’s completely OUT OF BREATH. 

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                                (gasping for air)
                        Stupid ... corset ...

           She staggers down the hall, rounds a corner only to RUN 
           DIRECTLY INTO NORWOOD. Totally out of breath now:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Sorry ... looking for the door ...

           For a moment Norwood is too stunned by her transformation 
           to respond. Then, slowly, a triumphant smile spreads 
           across his face.

                                 NORWOOD
                        You’re not going anywhere, “Your 
                        Highness.”

           INT. BALLROOM 

           Generica, Edwina, and Leonora gaze upward at something 
           O.S., all looking equally intimidated.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Is everything all right, girls?

           We REVERSE to see a TOWERING STACK OF MATTRESSES in the 
           center of the room, a stepladder at their side.

                                 EDWINA
                        If I might, Your Majesty -- what is this?

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Well, our dear son the prince is quite 
                        taken with all of you. So we’ve set up a 
                        little test to help him decide.

                                 GENERICA
                        And what exactly is this test evaluating?

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Why, your delicacy, of course. For a true 
                        princess is nothing if not delicate.

           Abruptly, Edwina falls over. As the others turn to her in 
           alarm, she whimpers:
                                 EDWINA
                        I’m so sorry. I’d just been standing 
                        upright for far too long.

                                 LEONORA
                        What a load of-- 
                                (collecting herself)
                        I mean, I’d love to help you up, dear 
                        friend, but I’m afraid I lack the upper 
                        body strength. Also courage.

                                 GENERICA
                        And I weigh ninety-four pounds. Eighty-
                        four without my jewelry.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Edwina, dear, why don’t you go first.

           Tentatively, Edwina climbs the ladder, gaining confidence 
           with each step until finally she’s at the top. As she 
           rolls onto the uppermost mattress, she calls down:

                                 EDWINA
                        Surprisingly comfortable.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Is it.

                                 EDWINA
                        You know, normally I have trouble 
                        sleeping on a conventional mattress, 
                        being so delicate and all. But this is 
                        actually quite to my liking.

           In a QUICK CUT we see Leonora do the same routine:

                                 LEONORA
                        Oh, yes, so comfortable. Like sleeping on 
                        air. Why did I never think of this? Or 
                        should I say--
                                (launching into song again)
                        “I confess I’ve never seen--”

           Queen Odella hastily cuts her off.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Thank you, that will be all. Generica, 
                        why don’t you take a turn?

                                 NORWOOD (O.S.)
                        Wait!

           Everyone TURNS AT ONCE to see Norwood at the back of the 
           ballroom, holding open the door for someone. 
                                 NORWOOD (CONT’D)
                        I have one more contestant, Your Grace.

           Leonora, Edwina and Generica exchange baffled looks as 
           Norwood disappears through the door, only to reappear, 
           PUSHING IN FRONT OF HIM a very hesitant Winnifred, who 
           BLANCHES when she sees Generica standing there. The 
           princess’ JAW DROPS at the sight of her former servant.

                                 GENERICA
                        She’s not a princess! She’s a lady-in-
                        waiting I fired yesterday!

           Queen Odella squints at Winnifred.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        She looks like a princess to me.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        She’s right, I’m not--

           Quickly, Norwood grabs the back of Winnifred’s corset and 
           YANKS IT HARD, CHOKING HER into silence. 

                                 NORWOOD
                        The lady is here at the request of the 
                        prince. I hope you’re not implying that 
                        Prince Prescott is wrong about something.

           Seeing an opportunity, Leonora interjects:

                                 LEONORA
                        If the Prince wants her here, then far be 
                        it from me to go against his wishes.

                                 EDWINA
                        Yeah. Same. If there’s one thing I’m all 
                        about, it’s his wishes. 

           Norwood PUSHES WINNIFRED FORWARD until she’s standing in 
           front of the stack of mattresses. 

                                 GENERICA
                        This is ridiculous! 

           Winnifred opens her mouth to confess, but Generica speaks 
           first. In a threatening tone:

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        If you so much as touch that ladder--

           Winnifred’s expression changes to one of SHEER DEFIANCE 
           as she places a glass-slippered foot on the bottom rung.
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Don’t tell me what to do. 

           Her face determined, she begins to climb, slowly and 
           painstakingly, gasping for breath. Finally she reaches 
           the top and rolls onto the uppermost mattress, relieved.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                                (calling up)
                        Are you quite comfortable? 

           Winnifred rolls back and forth. Can’t seem to settle in. 
           The three princesses begin to TITTER AND WHISPER, all 
           convinced they’re the one who’s going to win. 

                                 QUEEN ODELLA (CONT’D)
                        Is anything wrong?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        No. No, I’m fine.

           But she keeps rolling back and forth. Queen Odella can’t 
           see it, but she’s scratching at her constrictive dress, 
           kicking its folds off her feet and legs. 

                                 GENERICA
                        I told you she didn’t belong here! 

           Winnifred continues to shift and turn, making the stack 
           of mattresses sway precipitously. 

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        Now get her down so I can win this thing. 

           On cue, the stack of mattresses TEETERS SHARPLY, THEN 
           FALLS, sending Winnifred TUMBLING TO THE GROUND with a 
           terrified YELP. A few of the mattresses BURST ON IMPACT, 
           filling the air with feathers. 

           Winnifred rises from the ground, her face SCARLET. But 
           she’s surprised to see that Queen Odella is ECSTATIC. 

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        At last, a maiden who is truly worthy!

           Looking around at the SNOWDRIFT OF FEATHERS:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Worthy of what?

                                 NORWOOD
                                (beaming)
                        Why, the prince’s hand, of course! 
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Hang on, I didn’t mean to-- 

           But she’s cut short by a CHORUS OF OUTRAGE from the 
           princesses, who ALL CRY OUT AT ONCE: 

                                 EDWINA
                        That’s it? It’s over? 

                                 LEONORA
                        What kind of test was that, anyway?

                                 GENERICA
                        Look at this mess she made!

                                 LEONORA
                        Can she even sing?

                                 EDWINA
                        I’m confused about the rules.

                                 GENERICA
                        This isn’t fair!

           Queen Odella turns to them disapprovingly. 

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        You ladies seem to have a lot of opinions 
                        all of a sudden. I’d hate for word to 
                        spread to any of the other eligible 
                        princes in the land. 

           At this all three princesses fall silent, sulking.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA (CONT’D)
                        Now go get dressed for tonight’s ball or 
                        I’ll see to it that none of you ever 
                        finds a husband. 

           Queen Odella STRIDES FROM THE BALLROOM. The three 
           princesses follow, although not without glancing back at 
           Winnifred resentfully. Generica’s last through the door, 
           looking back at Winnifred to mouth I’LL KILL YOU. 

           As soon as they’re gone, Norwood appears at Winnifred’s 
           elbow, grinning. 

                                 NORWOOD
                        I knew you could do it.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Do what?
                                 NORWOOD
                        Detect the lump made by a single pea 
                        through twenty featherbeds, of course.

           Winnifred lifts the bottom mattress off the ground. Sure 
           enough, a SINGLE GREEN PEA lies underneath, FLATTENED. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I didn’t know that was there!

           Soothingly, as he leads her toward the door:

                                 NORWOOD
                        Shhhh. 

           As they exit into the

           INT. HALLWAY

           Winnifred continues:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        And who said I wanted the hand of the 
                        prince in the first place?

           Norwood steers her rapidly toward her room. 

                                 NORWOOD
                        The lady must be exhausted, to babble on 
                        so. Perhaps she needs a rest.

           Norwood pushes her through the door to her bedroom, where 
           Fairy Hotperson is passed out on the bed, SNORING.

           INT. WINNIFRED’S BEDROOM

           As Norwood SLAMS THE DOOR, Fairy Hotperson jolts awake. 

                                 NORWOOD
                        I think the lady is in need of some 
                        additional lady-fying. 

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        No way. Not until I see the money. 

           Winnifred glances back and forth between them, alarmed.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Do you two ... know each other?

           Ignoring her, Norwood completely drops his submissive-
           servant demeanor as he hisses at Fairy Hotperson:
                                 NORWOOD
                        You said you’d done this before.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        I have! At least, I’ve seen it done, 
                        which is practically the same thing.

                                 NORWOOD
                        It’s not the same thing at all!

           Gesturing at Winnifred, who is attempting to unlace the 
           corset of her dress while hopping on one foot:

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON 
                        It’s not my fault it’s not working. 
                        Normally they want to be princesses.

                                 NORWOOD
                        So give her another zap. 

           Winnifred’s eyes widen at this. As Fairy Hotperson raises 
           her magic wand again:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Please, don’t--

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Among a CROWD OF COURTIERS, the King, Queen, Leonora and 
           Edwina look on as Prescott waltzes Generica around the 
           dance floor unenthusiastically.

                                 GENERICA
                        I don’t think what happened today was 
                        very fair. If you’d just let me take the 
                        mattress test--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Wow. That does not sound right.

           Just then, the ROOM FALLS SILENT. The chamber orchestra 
           stops playing mid-phrase, the dancing couples pause mid-
           step, even Generica is struck dumb. Prescott, confused, 
           turns around to see ...

           WINNIFRED. In a diaphanous pink gown that seems LIT FROM 
           WITHIN, she floats into the room. Somehow she’s gone from 
           frazzled oddball to angelic beauty in less than one day.
           Prescott’s jaw drops open as she drifts toward him, her 
           steps so smooth her head doesn’t bob an inch. A beatific 
           smile remains frozen on her face. In a new, demure voice:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My liege.

           She curtsies deeply. Prescott can barely stammer:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Wow. May I -- would you -- could we 
                        dance?

           She lifts her face, but keeps her eyes downcast.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I see my liege already has a dance 
                        partner. But I’ll gladly wait my turn.

           Practically shoving Generica away:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No, that’s all right, we can dance now.

           MOMENTS LATER

           All eyes are on Winnifred as she drifts around the dance 
           floor in Prescott’s arms. Except for the princesses, 
           everyone looks thrilled, not least Norwood, who stands 
           off to the side with a self-satisfied air. 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Hey, so I was thinking today about your 
                        adventure.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My what?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        The whole going off into the forest to 
                        seek your fate thing.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Why would I want to do that? Think of the 
                        dangers! The unknowns! The humidity!

           She pats at her hair. Prescott LAUGHS.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You do a great Generica.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Whatever do you mean?
                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s okay, you can drop the perfect 
                        princess act.

           But Winnifred’s not listening to him anymore as she 
           exclaims to no one in particular:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Oh, what a glorious evening! Would that 
                        this moment could last forever. 

           She twirls away from Prescott and begins to sing:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        “I never thought that I would be--”

           Leonora EAGERLY JOINS IN:

                                 LEONORA
                        “In the arms of such as he--”

           Prescott presses his hands to his ears and shouts:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Stop it, stop it, stop it!

           The room falls silent. Everyone stares, baffled, as he 
           waves a hand back in forth in front of Winnifred’s face.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What happened to you?

           When she doesn’t answer, just continues smiling vacantly, 
           he turns demandingly to Norwood and the King and Queen.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Yesterday she was the only girl I 
                        actually liked. Now she’s just like the 
                        rest of them!

                                 EDWINA
                        Hey! We haven’t done anything except try 
                        to be whatever you wanted us to be. 

                                 LEONORA
                        Yeah! If you don’t like us, maybe it’s 
                        because you’re being too hard to please!

           Generica shakes her head as she steps away from them. 

                                 GENERICA
                        Wow. I am so sorry, Your Highness. I 
                        don’t know why they think they can talk 
                        to you like that. Come on, let’s go.
           She tries to take his arm, but he shakes her off. Queen 
           Odella quickly approaches him and cajoles soothingly:

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Prescott, darling, I know you’re feeling 
                        overwhelmed by all of this. But this is 
                        the only maiden who proved herself worthy 
                        of your hand. Just look at her!

           Queen Odella gestures at Winnifred, who obediently drops 
           into a DEEP CURTSY.

                                 QUEEN ODELLA (CONT’D)
                        She’s perfect!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Not to me! I want her the way she was! 
                        What happened to her?

           Behind him, an embarrassed Norwood CLEARS HIS THROAT. 
           Everyone turns to him in surprise. In a small voice:

                                 NORWOOD
                        I think I might know.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. GRAND HALL - LATER

           The King, Queen, Prescott and Norwood stand in a FURIOUS 
           LINE in front of Fairy Hotperson, whose arms are crossed 
           over her chest defiantly. Winnifred stands to the side 
           with a vapid look on her face, like a switched-off robot.

                                 NORWOOD
                        I thought I was hiring a professional.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        I stand by my work. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Look at her! What kind of fairy godmother 
                        would do this to someone?

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        For the last time, I am not a fairy 
                        godmother, I am a Fairy Hotperson.

                                 KING OGDEN
                        I don’t think that’s a thing. 
                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        So she’s a little out of it. Big picture: 
                        she’s here, she looks great, and she’ll 
                        definitely marry you now.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Give me that.

           He reaches out to snatch the wand away from her, but the 
           moment he closes his fingers around it, it DISAPPEARS. 

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        It’s a magic wand, remember?

           She waves her other hand, in which the wand has 
           miraculously appeared.

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON (CONT’D)
                        And magic doesn’t go backwards.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        So you can’t reverse the spell? 

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        No returns or exchanges. Sorry. 

           A brief silence as everyone contemplates this. Then, 
           brazening on with forced conviviality:

                                 KING OGDEN
                        What a shame. I guess you’ll just have to 
                        marry her the way she is. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I don’t want to marry her the way she is.

                                 KING OGDEN 
                        Okay, then marry one of the others.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No!

           King Ogden leans toward Fairy Hotperson. In a low voice:

                                 KING OGDEN
                        I don’t suppose there’s anything you can 
                        do about him, is there?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Half the tapestries in this castle are 
                        about spells being reversed. There has to 
                        be some way. 

           A beat of silence. Then, sighing, Fairy Hotperson says:
                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        You’ll never find it. And even if you do, 
                        you’ll never find your way back. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Find what?

                                 FAIRY HOTPERSON
                        The Book of All Undoing. It contains the 
                        formula to break any spell. But it’s too 
                        far away -- across the Great Desert, 
                        beyond the Mighty Sea, beneath the shade 
                        of the Black Forest.

           Prescott considers this for a millisecond. Then he 
           STRAIGHTENS UP, STICKS OUT HIS CHEST heroically.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Norwood, get out my good armor. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. PALACE ENTRANCE - THE NEXT MORNING

           A CHEERING CROWD OF POSITANIANS have gathered on the 
           palace lawn as, with a FANFARE OF TRUMPETS, the 
           drawbridge is lowered to reveal the heroic sight of ...

           Prescott, STAGGERING AWKWARDLY under the weight of his 
           shiny, never-before-used armor as Winnifred GLIDES ALONG 
           NEXT TO HIM, looking lighter than air. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Why didn’t anyone warn me about how heavy 
                        this stuff was? 

           Queen Odella and King Ogden come rushing out after him. 

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        Are you sure about this, darling? You’ve 
                        never even been on a practice quest. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (loudly, to the crowd)
                        Yes. It’s my destiny to rescue this 
                        damsel in distress from the terrible 
                        curse that’s been placed upon her.

           Winnifred SMILES CHEERILY AT THE CROWD, WAVES. 
           EXT. ROAD THROUGH FOREST

           Winnifred and Prescott walk along the sun-dappled road 
           through the forest. Winnifred is wide-eyed, taking in 
           everything around her as if for the first time. Finally 
           Prescott attempts:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        So. Tell me a little about yourself.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Surely my liege’s own life story is of 
                        more interest.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Well, no, it isn’t, because I already 
                        know it. Having lived it and all. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My liege is so clever!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Will you cut it out with the “liege” 
                        stuff? I’m Prescott. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        As you like, My Prescott.

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (frustrated)
                        No, not “my,” just--

           But he falls silent as they emerge outside an

           EXT. BAVARIAN COTTAGE

           It’s a cottage right out of a fairy tale -- rough stone 
           walls, thatched roof, flower boxes under the windows. 
           Winnifred CRIES OUT DELIGHTEDLY:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My, what a charming cottage! 

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (hissing)
                        Shhhh! What if a wicked witch lives here?

           But it’s too late. From inside a voice calls out:

                                 FILTHY (O.S.)
                        Guys! They made it!
           The front door FLIES OPEN and the house’s inhabitants 
           come RUNNING OUT, tripping over one another in their 
           eagerness. They’re DWARVES. SEVEN OF THEM.

           As they line up in front of Prescott and Winnifred, the 
           dwarf in front introduces himself:

                                 FILTHY (CONT’D)
                        Greetings, Your Majesty. I’m Filthy, and 
                        these are my brothers Dirty, Grimy, 
                        Wormy, Germy, Mildew and Blotch. 

           As he names them, the other dwarves BOW ELABORATELY, 
           except for Blotch, who merely repeats:

                                 BLOTCH
                        Blooooootch. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        If you don’t mind my saying so, those are 
                        terrible names. 

           Filthy sighs impatiently.

                                 FILTHY
                        You think we don’t know that? That’s why 
                        we’re so happy you’re here.

           Prescott furrows his brow. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I think there’s been a misunderstanding.

                                 FILTHY
                        Yeah right. You think we don’t know a 
                        virtuous huntsman hiding a princess from 
                        an evil queen when we see one?

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (offended)
                        I am not a huntsman. 

                                 FILTHY
                        It’s all good, pal. Your part is over. 
                        She’s ours now.
                                (to Winnifred)
                        Look, it’s not like there’s nothing in it 
                        for you. You keep house for us for a few 
                        years, cook, make beds--

                                 MILDEW
                        Wash, sew, knit--
                                 WORMY
                        And generally just keep everything clean 
                        and orderly--

                                 FILTHY
                        And at the end of it all, we guarantee an 
                        introduction to a handsome prince. 
                                (beat)
                        You’re cool with being briefly poisoned 
                        by an apple, right?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Is it shiny?

           Prescott quickly steps in front of her. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Look, you’ve got the wrong people. I’ve 
                        never even heard of this evil queen. And 
                        I certainly don’t know why she’s going 
                        around poisoning people with fruit.

           Scratching his head, Filthy reluctantly admits:

                                 FILTHY
                        We were told the princess would have skin 
                        as white as snow, lips as red as blood 
                        and hair as black as ebony. 
                                (beat)
                        But beggars can’t be choosers. So we’ll 
                        take this one.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        She’s not an object. 

           Winnifred, who’s been standing quietly behind Prescott, 
           CLEARS HER THROAT DELICATELY.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My liege--

                                 FILTHY
                        We’d be doing you a favor. Do you know 
                        how hard princesses are to look after?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My liege ...

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You don’t understand. I’m trying to 
                        rescue her. This is a quest. 
                                 WINNIFRED
                                (irritated now)
                        My liege!

           As Prescott and Filthy turn to her, she quickly wipes the 
           annoyed expression off her face and says sweetly:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        I believe we know of an ebony-haired 
                        princess seeking to marry a prince. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (realizing)
                        That’s right, we do. 
                                (to Filthy)
                        I should warn you, though, she sings. 

                                 FILTHY
                        Of course she does! How else would she 
                        entice woodland creatures to help her 
                        with her chores?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Filthy takes notes as Prescott dictates.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You’ll find her at the Royal Palace of 
                        Positania, One Positania Lane, Positania. 

           The dwarves all BOW DEEPLY, except for Blotch, who merely 
           intones one last time:

                                 BLOTCH
                        Blooooootch.

           EXT. GRASSY HILLS - LATER

           As they walk along, Prescott turns to Winnifred and says:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Why’d you do that for Leonora?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Because every princess deserves her 
                        handsome prince, of course. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s funny you say that, since I’m pretty 
                        sure she would have stabbed you with her 
                        own tiara to keep you away from me. 
           Just then they crest a hill. From here, they can see the 
           Great Desert, a VAST, DESOLATE LANDSCAPE of cracked earth 
           that appears to go on forever, interrupted only by the 
           occasional black skeleton of a long-dead tree. 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        There it is. The Great Desert. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Not as great as my liege!

           Prescott sighs. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        This is going to be a long trip.

           EXT. DESERT - DAY

           Winnifred trudges along behind Prescott, looking as 
           miserable as he does. The sun beats down cruelly, 
           drenching both of them in sweat. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’m hot, my liege.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I heard you the first sixty-three times.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My discomfort is such that I fear I can’t 
                        go on. Oh! I’m fainting!

           She tumbles to the ground theatrically, the back of her 
           hand pressed to her forehead.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        If you were really fainting you wouldn’t 
                        be able to tell me.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (annoyed)
                        Nonetheless, I am mortally fatigued. Pay 
                        attention to me or I shall surely perish. 

           But Prescott’s eye is on something ahead.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Do you see that?

           Winnifred leaps to her feet eagerly, her mortal fatigue 
           forgotten. Sure enough, there’s something sparkling on 
           the horizon.
           EXT. OASIS - LATER

           The sun is setting by the time Winnifred and Prescott 
           stagger up to the BABBLING FOUNTAIN of an OASIS. A 
           gorgeous stone sculpture flowing with water, inexplicably 
           placed in the middle of nowhere. 

           They both run toward it eagerly and plunge their cupped 
           hands into the water, SCOOPING IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS. When 
           they’ve finally drunk their fill, they lie back on the 
           dirt next to the fountain, SATISFIED. 

           But just then a STENTORIAN MALE VOICE BOOMS:

                                 DJINNIE (O.S.)
                        Who has drunk from my fountain? 

           Winnifred and Prescott open their eyes to discover a 
           MASSIVE, ANGRY DJINN hovering over them. Barrel-chested 
           with blazing eyes.

           Winnifred cries out:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I have seen the face of my doom before 
                        me! Oh, would that I had never--

           Prescott quickly sits up, cutting her off.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I’ll handle this.
                                (to the Djinn)
                        We’re very sorry. We didn’t know this was 
                        your fountain. You should really think 
                        about putting up a sign, or something.

           He stands, extending a friendly hand.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’m Prescott.

           The Djinn ignores his hand, booming:

                                 DJINNIE
                        The lady was right. I am the face of your 
                        doom. For I am Djinnie of the Great 
                        Desert, and all who drink the magical 
                        water of my oasis must die by my hand. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Djinnie?

                                 DJINNIE
                        Yes.
                                 PRESCOTT
                        I think you mean Djinn.

                                 DJINNIE
                        I do not. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        But Djinnie is a girl’s name.

                                 DJINNIE
                        It is a very manly name. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Short for Jennifer.

                                 DJINNIE
                        Who are you, to drink the magical water 
                        of my fountain and then try to tell me 
                        what is and is not a man’s name, in my 
                        own desert?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Stop provoking him!

                                 DJINNIE
                        You are now my prisoners. I will take you 
                        to the deepest dungeon of my palace, 
                        where at daybreak you will die by--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        --your hand. Yeah. We got it.

           Djinnie SPRINKLES ALL THREE OF THEM with water from the 
           fountain, then WAVES A HAND IN THE AIR. 

                                 DJINNIE
                        To the dungeon!

           With a flash, they find themselves standing in

           INT. DJINNIE’S DUNGEON

           Lamplight flickers on the stone walls of the deep 
           dungeon. Prescott and Winnifred blink rapidly as they 
           discover that they are now standing inside the bars of a 
           cell, with Djinnie on the outside grinning at them.

                                 DJINNIE
                        I will return at first light to shepherd 
                        you to your fate.

           He waves another hand in the air and disappears. 
           Winnifred immediately SLAPS PRESCOTT ACROSS THE FACE.
                                 PRESCOTT
                        Hey!

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (tearful)
                        This is all your fault!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        My fault? We wouldn’t even be here if it 
                        weren’t for you and your curse! 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Why can’t you accept me as I am?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Because this isn’t you! And believe me, 
                        if you could be around you, you wouldn’t 
                        accept you for you either!

           Winnifred opens her mouth to retort, then falters.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My liege might need to explain the 
                        situation to me one more time. 

           Rolling his eyes, Prescott steps to the front of the 
           cell. Tries all the bars, but they’re FIRMLY ANCHORED. 
           Attempts to rattle the padlock, but it’s made of thick 
           black metal, so heavy he can barely move it. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Come on!

           He kicks one of the bars in frustration, then FALLS 
           BACKWARD, CLUTCHING HIS FOOT IN PAIN.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        OW!

           He falls to the ground next to Winnifred, who is calmly 
           sitting against one of the walls of the cell, wiping her 
           face clean with a handkerchief while looking into a 
           compact mirror.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing now?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Fixing my makeup.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You’re going to die in, like, six hours.
                                 WINNIFRED
                        That’s right. ‘Tis my last ever chance to 
                        be beautiful, thanks to you.

           She nonchalantly tips water from her canteen onto the 
           handkerchief, then continues dabbing at her face. 
           Prescott’s eyes widen as he realizes:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You didn’t have that water before.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Of course not.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        So where did it come from?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Why, the oasis, naturally. 

           He snatches the canteen from her hands, shakes it, hears 
           the last few drops of water sloshing inside. 

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        I need that to fix my face!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No, we need this to get out of here. It’s 
                        magical, remember?

           Before she can say anything else, he flicks water at her, 
           then at himself. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Hey!

           Prescott looks upward and says in a hopeful voice:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Um, magic? Could we go to the seaside, 
                        please?

           But nothing happens.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Perhaps my liege should be more specific.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I can’t. I’ve never been there. Where 
                        should I say we want to go?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’d be happy just to be on the other side 
                        of those bars. 
                                 PRESCOTT
                        No, wait--

           But it’s too late. In a flash, Winnifred and Prescott 
           reappear just outside the bars to their cell.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Now look what you did! We could have used 
                        that water to go anywhere!

           He shakes the canteen desperately, but there’s nothing 
           left inside. 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        You know what? This isn’t worth it!

           He HURLS THE CANTEEN AT THE WALL, where it hits with a 
           RESOUNDING CLANG, then stomps away from her, UNHOOKING 
           THE GAS LAMP FROM THE WALL and carrying it toward stairs 
           that curve upward into darkness. Desperate:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Surely my liege will not abandon me alone 
                        in the darkness!

           Prescott wheels around, furious.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        This is too hard! All I wanted was to be 
                        a hero, and now instead I’m going to be 
                        murdered by a genie with a girl’s name. 
                        How’s that going to look on my tapestry?

           Suddenly the Djinnie’s voice BOOMS FURIOUSLY:

                                 DJINNIE (O.S.)
                        IT IS NOT A GIRL’S NAME!

           He comes BOUNDING DOWN THE STAIRS, and in an instant is 
           LOOMING OVER THEM, ENRAGED. Spotting the canteen:

                                 DJINNIE (CONT’D)
                        You stole water from my oasis? Now you 
                        must surely die!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You said we had until dawn!

                                 DJINNIE
                        I changed my mind!

           He raises his hands, which now SPARKLE WITH ELECTRICITY.
                                 DJINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Prepare to meet your doom.

           The electricity in his hands forms FEARSOME, CRACKLING 
           SPHERES. He’s about to unleash them when, overcome:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Woe is me! For here we shall perish, and 
                        none shall ever know our fate!

           Djinnie pauses. The spheres of electricity vanish.

                                 DJINNIE
                        No one knows you came here?

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (cautious)
                        No ...

                                 DJINNIE
                        So the tale of my fearsome prowess will 
                        never reach your land?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I don’t know how it would, since we’ll be 
                        dead. 
                                (realizing)
                        Of course, if we were to narrowly escape 
                        with our lives, we’d warn everyone about 
                        you. And your fearsome prowess.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        In sooth we would indeed!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        The tale of your magical oasis would be 
                        told for generations. 

                                 DJINNIE
                        Keep talking.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        There would be no one who didn’t know 
                        your story. You’d be the stuff of legend. 
                        Little kids would check under their beds 
                        for you before falling asleep at night. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Maidens would cower at your very name!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Yes. Everyone will be afraid of the name 
                        ... Djinnie. 
           Djinnie thinks about this for a moment. Then:

                                 DJINNIE
                        I suppose I could turn my back for a few 
                        moments, during which time you two could 
                        run up the stairs, down the corridor, 
                        through the third door on the right, down 
                        another corridor and then through the 
                        fourth door on the left.

           A brief silence follows. Then, promptingly:

                                 DJINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I said, I suppose I could--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Right. Got it.

           He grabs Winnifred’s hand and pulls her to the stairs, 
           still carrying the LAMP to light their way. 

           EXT. DESERT OUTSIDE - NIGHT

           The djinn’s turreted palace is nestled among dark, 
           towering sand dunes that take gentle bites out of the 
           starry night sky. Suddenly Winnifred and Prescott come 
           BURSTING OUT OF A SIDE DOOR, gasping for breath. The 
           minute it swings shut behind them, the palace VANISHES.

           Looking around, unable to believe her eyes:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        We’re free! Using only his wit and 
                        cleverness, my liege has rescued us from 
                        the mighty djinn of the desert!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I kinda did, didn’t I?

           He extinguishes the lamp and stows it in his pack. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My liege is a great hero!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I like the sound of that.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (beginning to sing)
                        “When a hero I did need--”

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Okay, you can stop now. 
           EXT. SAND DUNES - MORNING

           The sun is rising as Winnifred and Prescott trudge up a 
           seemingly endless sand dune. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Does my liege have a map, or something?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        My navigation tutor failed me. Should I 
                        have mentioned that before now? 

           But just then, as she crests the top of the dune, 
           Winnifred shouts joyfully:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Look! The Mighty Sea! 

           Sure enough, ahead, beyond a shore studded with docks and 
           boats, an ENDLESS BLUE SEA stretches to the horizon. 

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        It’s even more glorious than I imagined! 
                        As blue as the most precious sapphire, as 
                        infinite as the most--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Calm down. 

           EXT. DOCKS - LATER

           Prescott negotiates with a wizened old SAILOR as 
           Winnifred stands on the edge of the dock, continuing:

                                 WINNIFRED (B.G.)
                        As sparkling as a thousand diamonds, as 
                        deep as the heart of a noble man ...

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Do we have a deal?

                                 WINNIFRED (B.G.)
                        As untamed as the spirit of the wind, as 
                        full of possibility as the dew of a 
                        winter’s eve ...

                                 SAILOR
                        I don’t know, kid. This old girl’s in 
                        pretty bad shape. 

           We REVERSE to see a row of stately ships, then PAN DOWN 
           until we find a TINY SAILBOAT knocking between two of 
           them. Its paint is peeling, its sail tattered.
                                 SAILOR (CONT’D)
                        You ever been out to sea before?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No. But my sailing tutor was the finest 
                        in all the land. He took me around the 
                        entire moat. Twice.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. SAILBOAT - LATER

           A VIOLENT STORM ROARS OVERHEAD as rogue waves LASH AT THE 
           BOAT, tossing it hither and fro. Winnifred is sobbing, 
           hysterical, as Prescott attempts in vain to control the 
           boat’s sail. Shouting to Winnifred:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I know you’re scared, but I need you to--

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’m not scared!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Then why are you crying?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Because my dress is ruined!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        We didn’t make it this far without 
                        killing each other just to give up now! 

           By now the sailboat is tilted to one side as a MASSIVE 
           WAVE BUILDS UNDERNEATH IT. 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Use the rudder! We gotta get ahead of the 
                        wave before it crests! 

           As if on cue, the sail RIPS FREE FROM ITS MOORINGS and 
           disappears on the wind. The wave SWEEPS THE BOAT UPWARD 
           until it’s nearly vertical. And then it comes CRASHING 
           DOWN, SMASHING THE BOAT TO SMITHEREENS.

           UNDERWATER

           The sounds of the storm are muted as Prescott and 
           Winnifred are PLUNGED INTO THE WATER. Both begin to sink 
           rapidly, weighed down by armor and skirts, respectively. 
           Hard as they both try, they can’t seem to push themselves 
           upward. Their terrified eyes meet as they sink ...
           ... and then everything goes BLACK.

           There’s the faint sound of WAVES LAPPING AT A SHORE. 
           WHISPERED VOICES, too faint to pick out any words.

           And then nothing.

                                                              FADE TO:

           EXT. BEACH - MORNING

           Prescott opens his eyes, then immediately rolls over, 
           COUGHING UP SEAWATER. When he’s finished, he realizes 
           he’s lying on the high-tide line of a deserted beach. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Winnifred?

           He looks up and down the beach. But there’s no sign of 
           her. He’s alone.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Winnifred!

           A SEDUCTIVE FEMALE VOICE REPLIES:

                                 OCEANA (O.S.)
                        You won’t find her.

           Prescott turns in the direction of the voice and is 
           shocked to see a BEAUTIFUL MERMAID perched on a rock 
           emerging from the waves. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Who are you?

                                 OCEANA
                        I am Oceana, Queen of the Sea. It was my 
                        royal guard that retrieved you and your 
                        princess from a watery grave.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Is she ... dead?

                                 OCEANA
                        I assure you, she is quite alive. But 
                        you’ll never see her again. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You took her prisoner!
                                 OCEANA
                        Don’t be ridiculous! What would we do 
                        with a human on our hands, keep her in an 
                        air bubble? No, we simply traded her.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        “Traded her”?

                                 OCEANA
                        Yes. You see, recently my youngest 
                        daughter announced she was in love with 
                        the prince of these shores. Of course the 
                        very idea was ridiculous. But you know 
                        how teenagers can be.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Sure.

                                 OCEANA
                        I managed to talk her out of it, but the 
                        prince was not so easy to persuade. He’s--

           She lowers her voice to a whisper, as if sharing a 
           terrible secret.

                                 OCEANA (CONT’D)
                        He’s twenty-nine, you know. 
                                (in her normal voice)
                        So, since he was determined to marry 
                        someone ...

           Prescott is horrified to realize:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You gave him Winnifred?

                                 OCEANA
                        The arrangement made everyone quite 
                        happy. And when she and the prince saw 
                        one another it was love at first sight.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You don’t understand. She’s cursed. She’d 
                        fall in love at first sight with a 
                        boulder if you slapped a crown on it. 

                                 OCEANA
                        You know what’s a curse? Daughters. 
                        Speaking of which, I’d better go before 
                        the little nitwit comes looking for me 
                        and decides she wants to marry you.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Can you just tell me where the palace is?
           Oceana points up the shore. 

                                 OCEANA
                        It’s that way. But you’ll have to really 
                        put those man-legs to work if you want to 
                        get there in time for the wedding. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        The wedding?! How long was I passed out?

                                 OCEANA
                        A couple of hours.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        They’re going to get married after 
                        knowing each other a couple of hours?

                                 OCEANA
                        Why are you grilling me about human 
                        behavior? You thought you could cross the 
                        Mighty Sea in a dinghy. Maybe you guys 
                        just aren’t that smart. 

           Prescott starts walking up the shore in the direction of 
           the palace. 

                                 OCEANA (CONT’D)
                        Wait!

           He turns back.

                                 OCEANA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you want your wisdom of the sea?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        My what now?

                                 OCEANA
                        When a human catches sight of a mermaid, 
                        the mermaid has to answer any question he 
                        asks. It’s part of the deal. 
                                (encouraging)
                        Go ahead. Ask me anything. Anything at 
                        all. 

           Prescott hesitates. Then:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Okay. About that girl you took. 

           Oceana sighs, irritated. 
                                 OCEANA
                        Why do people always ask me relationship 
                        questions? You think that’s the only 
                        thing I have wisdom about?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You said I could ask you anything!

                                 OCEANA
                        Would you ask a merman about 
                        relationships? No. You’d probably ask him 
                        something about shipbuilding, or, I don’t 
                        know, swords. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I don’t have any questions about swords.

                                 OCEANA
                        Sure you don’t. For your information, 
                        I’ve forgotten more about swords than 
                        you’ll ever know. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (sighing impatiently)
                        That girl is under a spell, and I need to 
                        find the Book of All Undoing to lift it.

                                 OCEANA
                        The one in the Black Forest? 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Do you know of two Books of All Undoing?

                                 OCEANA
                        The North Road from the palace will lead 
                        you to the forest. After that, you’re on 
                        your own. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You don’t know what the book looks like? 

                                 OCEANA
                        No one does. Everyone who’s ever laid 
                        eyes on it has been driven mad by what 
                        they saw. 
                                (beat)
                        Bet you wish you’d asked me about swords 
                        now, don’t you? 

           And then, with a backflip, she DISAPPEARS INTO THE SEA. 

           Prescott hesitates. Looks up the beach in the direction 
           of the castle. 
           Down the beach in the direction of giving up. Up and 
           down. Up and down. Finally he BELLOWS IN FRUSTRATION:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        AAAAARRRRRRRRGH!

           But the sound merely echoes back at him. After a moment, 
           he starts off toward the castle. 

           EXT. PALACE BY THE SEA - SUNSET

           The grand terrace of the palace by the sea is TEEMING 
           WITH WEDDING GUESTS, all trying to get a glimpse inside 
           the red velvet curtains of the balcony above. 

           Then, with the BLARING OF A HORN, the curtains part to 
           reveal Winnifred in a HUGE CUPCAKE OF A WEDDING DRESS, 
           holding hands with the devastatingly handsome, strong-
           jawed PRINCE MERRICK and blushing becomingly. As he 
           raises their hands to the sky:

                                 MERRICK
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to 
                        present to you your new queen-to-be!

           Everyone APPLAUDS RAUCOUSLY as a pompously dressed 
           CARDINAL appears between the two of them. Once the crowd 
           has quieted down:

                                 CARDINAL
                        We are gathered here at dusk to join in 
                        most sacred matrimony--

                                 PRESCOTT (O.S.)
                        Wait!

           Everyone turns and GASPS IN HORROR at the sight of 
           Prescott, his clothes in tatters, panting as he makes his 
           way down the aisle. Winnifred cries out in shock:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Prescott?

                                 MERRICK
                        You know this guy?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        He was once the great love of my life, 
                        until he was lost at sea. I waited an 
                        eternity hoping for his safe return--

           Prescott rolls his eyes. 
                                 MERRICK
                        Wait a minute. There was a great love of 
                        your life before me?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I thought him dead!

                         PRESCOTT
                                                     MERRICK
           Seriously? After a couple 
           of hours?
                                            So I was what, your 
                                            consolation prince?

           The crowd has begun to RUSTLE. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I’m prepared to duel for her, if you 
                        wouldn’t mind loaning me some ... 
                                (drawing a blank)
                        ... duel materials.

           Merrick hesitates. Looks out over the expectant crowd. 

                                 MERRICK
                        We’d better discuss this inside.

           INT. PALACE BY THE SEA - LATER

           Winnifred tries to comfort Merrick, whose head is in his 
           hands as Prescott stands in front of him.

                                 MERRICK
                        I just can’t believe this. First I lose 
                        my mermaid, then I find a new bride only 
                        to discover she’s already in love with 
                        someone else. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You can’t be totally surprised. You just 
                        met her this morning. 

                                 MERRICK 
                        I thought it was one of those love-at-
                        first-sight things.
                                (beat)
                        Although if I’m being totally honest with 
                        myself, maybe I was just excited to have 
                        a queen. I really hate being single. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        A prince as valiant and handsome as 
                        yourself will surely marry soon.
                                 MERRICK
                        In time for the holidays? I doubt it. And 
                        then it’s Valentine’s Day, then my 
                        birthday, then the questing season ... Do 
                        you know how depressing it is to return 
                        from a quest to an empty palace?

           Prescott nods sympathetically. 

                                 MERRICK (CONT’D)
                        I thought it was fate that had delivered 
                        her into my arms. But I guess it was just 
                        a tempest.

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (to Winnifred)
                        Into his arms? Did you-- 

           Winnifred blushes. 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Okay, well, it doesn’t count, because 
                        you’re cursed. 

           Hastily changing the subject: 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’m terribly sorry, fair Prince by the 
                        Sea. Would that I knew of a mermaid to 
                        take my place.

           Prescott’s eyes widen as he remembers:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You know, we don’t know any mermaids, but 
                        we do know a couple of princesses. 

           Merrick perks up at this. Gaining steam:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        We already promised somebody the ebony-
                        haired one, but there’s still a blonde 
                        and a redhead who are very eager to get 
                        married. Believe me. 

                                 MERRICK
                        My mermaid had red hair. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        There you go! Her name’s Edwina. If you 
                        sent a messenger tonight, you could 
                        probably have her here by next week. 

           Merrick grins.
           EXT. PALACE BY THE SEA - THE NEXT MORNING

           Winnifred, still wearing the cupcake dress, waves goodbye 
           to Merrick, who stands on the other side of a drawbridge, 
           his thick hair glistening in the sun.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        So long, fair Prince by the Sea!

           Merrick waves back as the drawbridge begins to raise. 
           Once he’s out of sight, Winnifred and Prescott, both 
           carrying brand-new overstuffed packs, turn to the road 
           and begin walking. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You know, someone probably could have 
                        found you something else to wear.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        What’s wrong with this?

           She bats her eyelashes at him innocently. Sighing:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Nothing. Never mind. 

           He shoulders her heavy pack for her, and off they go.

           EXT. ROAD THROUGH HILLS - LATER

           Prescott and Winnifred walk along in silence until 
           finally he turns to her and says:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I still can’t believe you were going to 
                        marry someone else.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Is my liege still talking about that? 
                        ‘Twas but a passing spell of insanity 
                        brought on by grief. I could never truly 
                        love another. For my liege is the 
                        greatest of men. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        When you keep saying that over and over, 
                        it starts to sound insincere-- 

           But the words die on his lips as he sees what’s around 
           the bend. Eyes wide: 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        The Black Forest.
           Sure enough, a DEEP, DARK WOODS LOOMS AHEAD, foreboding. 
           Prescott grabs Winnifred’s wrist and pulls her toward it:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let’s go!

           But she HOLDS HER GROUND, standing so firmly that 
           eventually he LOSES HIS GRIP AND FALLS BACKWARD. Pulling 
           himself back to his feet:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you? We’re almost 
                        there! This is where we’ll find the Book 
                        of All Undoing!

           Winnifred stares at her feet.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter?

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (small voice)
                        I’m frightened. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        There’s nothing to be afraid of.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I was told that everyone who sees the 
                        book is driven insane.  

                                 PRESCOTT
                        How’d you hear about that?
                                (beat, realizing)
                        You were with Merrick again last night, 
                        weren’t you?

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (coy)
                        He thought I had a right to know. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        He was trying to get you to stay!

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Because he actually loves me!

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (yelling now)
                        For the last time, this isn’t you!

           She recoils. Prescott continues in a lower, gentle voice:
                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        All we have to do is get in, find the 
                        book, undo the spell and get out. Then we 
                        can go back to Positania and be married.

           At the word “married,” Winnifred PERKS RIGHT UP. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        My liege is right. I should never have 
                        questioned him.

           EXT. BLACK FOREST - LATER

           Prescott and Winnifred have arrived at the OMINOUS 
           TREELINE of the Black Forest. THORNY VINES, wrist-thick, 
           form impenetrable walls between the MASSIVE BLACK TRUNKS 
           of ancient, towering trees. 

           There’s just one opening, a hole in the vines a few feet 
           high, through which nothing but DARKNESS can be seen. 
           Prescott is suddenly hesitant, intimidated.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Maybe we should rethink this plan.

           But Winnifred is already RUNNING TOWARD THE HOLE AT FULL 
           SPEED, shouting gleefully:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        We’re going to be married! I’m going to 
                        be a bride! I’m going to--

           As she passes into the darkness of the forest, her words 
           CUT OFF CLEANLY, as if sliced with a knife. Prescott is 
           left alone in an OMINOUS SILENCE.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I’m not scared. Why should I be scared? 

           The hole seems to YAWN LARGER as he stares it down.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’m Prince Prescott of Positania. 
                        Powerful. Masculine. A born ruler, a god 
                        among men ...

           He’s not especially convincing, even to himself. Finally, 
           with a DEEP BREATH, he musters enough courage to step 
           through the hole--
           INT. BLACK FOREST

           --and emerges into the SHADOWY DIMNESS of the Black 
           Forest. As he whips his head around frantically, he takes 
           in his surroundings:

           Bent, gnarled tree trunks HULKING LIKE TWISTED BODIES ...

           An impenetrable CANOPY OF DARK LEAVES OVERHEAD ...

           No sign of the entrance he just came through in any 
           direction, just TREES UPON TREES receding endlessly into 
           the shadows ...

           And NO SIGN OF WINNIFRED. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Where’d she go now? 

           But his voice merely ECHOES BACK AT HIM HAUNTINGLY.

           With another quick glance around to confirm that EVERY 
           DIRECTION LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME, Prescott tentatively 
           starts walking, pausing every few steps to call out:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Winnifred!

           But there’s no answer, just the FAINT STIRRING OF WIND in 
           the trees. To his terrified ears it sounds as if it’s 
           hissing Prescott, Prescott, Prescott.

           He starts to RUN, PANICKED, TRIPPING OVER ROOTS as he 
           stumbles forward. Who knows how much time passes as he 
           wanders the woods -- could be minutes, could be HOURS. 
           Finally, he spies something among the trees ahead: a 
           FAINT GOLDEN GLOW.

           EXT. CLEARING

           Prescott finds his way to a SMALL CLEARING in the trees. 
           As the GOLDEN GLOW ILLUMINATES HIS FACE, he stops, 
           completely in awe at what he sees there.

           It’s an ENORMOUS LEATHER-BOUND BOOK, at least ten feet 
           wide, open to its middle. The right-hand page is blank, 
           but the left-hand page is RAPIDLY FILLING with BEAUTIFUL 
           GOLDEN SCRIPT, as if written by an unseen hand. 

           And standing in front of it, hypnotized, reading rapidly, 
           is WINNIFRED.
                                 PRESCOTT
                        There you are!

           She turns to him with a bewildered expression.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Prescott? What are you doing here?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Have you just been sitting here this 
                        whole time?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        No, I woke up alone in a dark wood 
                        standing over an open book that writes 
                        itself, but decided to wait and see if 
                        you’d stumble along to read it to me. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You’re so sarcastic.

           A grin spreads across his face as he realizes:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        It worked! I don’t know how, but it 
                        worked! 

           He throws his arms around her. 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        The spell is lifted!

           Still piecing it together, Winnifred says slowly:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        The spell that turned me into a princess. 
                        That you escaped a djinn and rescued me 
                        from a prince to undo.

           Prescott lets her go, frowning in confusion. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        How do you know all that?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        It’s all here. 

           She flips a few pages back and begins to read aloud:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        “And so Prince Prescott and the enchanted 
                        Winnifred set out on their journey ...”

           She flips ahead, then continues:
                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        “The mighty djinn towered over him ...”
                                (flip)
                        “The prince by the sea was even more 
                        handsome than Prescott ...”
                                (flip)
                        “Who knows how long he stood before the 
                        entrance to the Black Forest, too 
                        terrified to enter ...”

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (defensive)
                        None of that is how I remember it.

           Winnifred has arrived on the last page. Reading the words 
           as they appear:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        “And although Prince Prescott did not yet 
                        know it ...”

                                 PRESCOTT
                        “He had arrived at the end of his quest.”

           The writing stops. The book lies silent and still in 
           front of them. 

           Prescott and Winnifred exchange a fearful glance. In a 
           voice loaded with dread:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What kind of book is this?

           From behind him, the same WIZENED VOICE we heard at the 
           outset of our story intones:

                                 JACOB (O.S.)
                        It’s the story of your life. And hers. 
                        And everyone else’s. 

           Prescott and Winnifred WHEEL AROUND to find themselves 
           facing a pair of MIDDLE-AGED MEN. With their pinched 
           faces and old-fashioned clothes, they certainly look the 
           part of EVIL CONJURERS.

                                 WILHELM
                        We’ve been wondering when you two would 
                        show up here. 

           Scared, but trying not to let it show, Winnifred steps 
           toward them and holds out a friendly hand.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’m Winnifred. What are your names?
           Jacob eyes her hand distastefully. 

                                 JACOB
                        We are the Brothers Grimm. I am Jacob, 
                        and this is Wilhelm. 

                                 WILHELM
                        Will for short.

           Turning to him, Jacob scolds:

                                 JACOB
                        Don’t make friends with them!

                                 WILHELM
                        I wasn’t, I was just--

                                 JACOB
                        You know what your problem is? You want 
                        everyone to like you. 

           Realizing Winnifred and Prescott are listening, Jacob 
           turns back to them, RESUMES HIS INTIMIDATING MANNER.

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        We are your creators. The authors of your 
                        very being. You exist solely within a 
                        series of tales we’ve written.

                                 WILHELM
                        We call them “fairy tales.”

                                 JACOB
                        I told you I hate the way that sounds. 

                                 WILHELM
                        Do you have a better idea?

                                 JACOB
                        I don’t know. Something grim, like us. 
                        “Scary tales”? No, that’s not good.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Let me get this straight. The reason 
                        everything we’ve done is in this book of 
                        yours is because we’re just ... 
                        characters in some story you wrote?

                                 WILHELM
                        It’s overwhelming, I know. Most people 
                        who find out simply can’t believe it. 

           Prescott’s eyes widen with the realization:
                                 PRESCOTT
                        That’s what Oceana meant when she said 
                        everyone who sees the book goes mad.

                                 JACOB
                        No. We drive them mad. With horrors.

                                 WILHELM
                        Oh, would you just drop it already? 
                        They’ve seen the book, they get it. The 
                        truth is scary enough without all your 
                        “Brothers Grimm” nonsense. 

           Winnifred is still struggling with all of this. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        It’s not possible. It doesn’t make sense. 
                        What kind of story ends with the 
                        characters finding out it’s a story?

                                 JACOB
                        The kind that’s been sabotaged. 
                                (beat)
                        By you two. You did the sabotaging, in 
                        case that wasn’t clear.

                                 WILHELM
                        And it’s not just this story you wrecked. 
                        You’ve been wreaking havoc all over the 
                        place.

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (genuinely baffled)
                        How?

                                 JACOB
                        That prince was supposed to marry the 
                        mermaid. There was a princess who was 
                        meant to go to work for those dwarves, 
                        but when she showed up she found out the 
                        position had already been filled. And 
                        that djinn? The day after you two 
                        stumbled in, he was scheduled to be 
                        imprisoned in a magic lamp.

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (eager)
                        You mean this lamp?

           He pulls it out of his pack and thrusts it at them. Jacob 
           BURIES HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS, exasperated.
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Out of curiosity, how was our story 
                        supposed to go?

                                 WILHELM
                        It was a simple, straightforward tale. 
                        One of our best.

                                 JACOB
                        I’ll tell it.

                                 WILHELM
                        Fine, go ahead. You’re so touchy.

                                 JACOB
                                (ignoring him)
                        It went something like this. “Once upon a 
                        time, a parade of maidens were invited to 
                        seek the hand of a handsome prince. When 
                        the prince was unable to decide, the king 
                        and queen proposed a test: each girl 
                        would sleep on a stack of featherbeds, 
                        and she who was delicate enough to feel 
                        the pea they placed underneath would be 
                        the one he should marry.”

                                 WINNIFRED
                        But I never felt the pea under the 
                        mattresses. They just thought I did.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Then who ...

           His eyes meet with Winnifred’s as they both realize:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Generica. She’s the one who was supposed 
                        to feel the pea.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        She would have, too. She’s incredibly 
                        high-maintenance.

                                 JACOB
                        But she didn’t get the chance, because of 
                        you. And now your world is on the verge 
                        of total destruction.

           Winnifred is still struggling to absorb all this. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I don’t understand. So we messed up a 
                        couple of your “fairy tales”--
                                 WILHELM
                                (to Jacob)
                        You’re right, we need a better name. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        --or whatever it is you want to call 
                        them. How exactly is that going to bring 
                        about the end of the world?

                                 WILHELM
                        We don’t just write these things for the 
                        sake of it. We write them to show people 
                        how to live. How to be. 

                                 JACOB
                        Wickedness is punished with imprisonment, 
                        birds pecking out your eyes, being forced 
                        to dance until you drop dead, that kind 
                        of thing. And goodness is rewarded with 
                        marriage.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (exasperated)
                        Why is everything always about marriage?

           Jacob GLARES AT HER, then continues:

                                 JACOB
                        But when the handsome prince refuses to 
                        marry the most deserving princess, when 
                        the evil genie goes free--

                                 WILHELM
                        When instead of following her heart, the 
                        little mermaid makes the practical choice 
                        and moves back in with her mother--

                                 JACOB
                        The very fabric of your universe 
                        unravels.

           Prescott and Winnifred look at Wilhelm expectantly.

                                 WILHELM
                        That’s true. He’s not just being scary 
                        for the sake of it. This time, anyway.  

                                 WINNIFRED
                        So what do we do? How can we fix it?

           A silence falls. Desperate now:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Nobody knows?
           Prescott clears his throat. Then, grandly:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I know. The hero has to save the day.

           Off Winnifred’s confusion:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That’s me. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Oh. Of course. 
                                (beat)
                        How, exactly?

           Prescott straightens up, puffs out his chest. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        By stepping up. Embracing my destiny. 
                        Doing what I want to do the least, in 
                        order to save the people I love the most--

                                 WINNIFRED
                        This build-up is wasting valuable time--

           Undeterred, he continues in the same grandiose tone:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        By going home ... and marrying Generica. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. GREEN FOREST - DAY

           Jacob and Wilhelm have shown Prescott and Winnifred to 
           the EDGE OF THE BLACK FOREST, where a much less 
           threatening REGULAR FOREST begins. 

           As they watch them cross over into the DAPPLED SUNLIGHT 
           of the green forest:

                                 WILHELM
                        Good luck!

                                 JACOB
                        Try not to screw everything up even worse 
                        than it already is!

           Then they turn back and DISAPPEAR AMONG THE SHADOWY 
           TREES. After a moment, Prescott and Winnifred head in the 
           opposite direction.
           EXT. FOREST - AFTERNOON

           Winnifred and Prescott walk through the forest in glum 
           silence. Finally:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        There’s something I still don’t 
                        understand: If you weren’t going to marry 
                        Generica when all this was over, who were 
                        you planning to marry?

           He turns to her in surprise.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You, of course.

           Winnifred laughs.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Good one. But seriously. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I was seriously going to marry you. Why 
                        do you think I did all this? For fun?

           Winnifred frowns. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Did it ever occur to you to wonder 
                        whether I wanted to marry you?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I’m Prince Prescott of Positania. 
                        Everyone wants to marry me. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Wow. Do you even hear yourself?

           Winnifred looks down at her dress. Her EYES WIDEN as she 
           realizes for the first time:

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Am I already wearing a wedding dress?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Technically that’s not my fault.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Unbelievable. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I rescued you! You should be thanking me!
                                 WINNIFRED
                        You didn’t rescue me for me, you rescued 
                        me for your tapestry! So you could be a 
                        “hero” like your dad and grandpa! 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You were different than the others. 
                        Better than them. And I was the only one 
                        who saw it. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        But you’re exactly the same! You thought 
                        you deserved something better than the 
                        usual boring princess. But you’re the 
                        usual boring prince. You’re rich and 
                        you’re handsome and you’re smug, and you 
                        think you should get to be a great hero 
                        just because of who you were born--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        And because I really, really want it!

           Winnifred is about to fire back when they emerge from the 
           trees and find themselves standing in the middle of a

           EXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS

           A SINGLE, TALL TOWER rises from the center of the 
           clearing. It’s made of stones fit smoothly and perfectly 
           together, and has no door or windows that they can see. 

           As they circle it cautiously:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Maybe whoever lives here really likes 
                        their privacy. 

           Just then, from the bushes, a SPOOKY MALE VOICE INTONES:

                                 DENLEY (O.S.)
                        Run. Run for your lives. 

           Winnifred and Prescott WHEEL AROUND, startled, but 
           there’s no sign of the voice’s owner.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Who’s there?

                                 DENLEY (O.S.)
                        Someone who knows the madness that 
                        resides within the doorless tower. Run 
                        while you still can!
           Suddenly, from above, a bell-like voice rings out:

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Denley, is that you? I knew you’d change 
                        your mind!

           From the bushes at the edge of the clearing steps out 
           PRINCE DENLEY, a gawky, tall, awkward-looking fellow in 
           fancy armor similar to Prescott’s. Tilting his head back 
           to address the woman in the tower:

                                 DENLEY 
                        I haven’t changed my mind, and I’m not 
                        going to!

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        But you said you loved me! What could I 
                        have done to drive you away?

                                 DENLEY
                        You’re clingy, you’re obsessive, you need 
                        male validation for everything you do--

           HYSTERICAL SOBBING is the only answer from above.

                                 DENLEY (CONT’D)
                        This is proving my point!

           He turns back to Prescott and Winnifred. In a low voice:

                                 DENLEY (CONT’D)
                        Stay away from her, man. She’s crazy.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Denley, please!

                                 DENLEY
                                (to Prescott and Winnifred)
                        I gotta go.

           He RUNS OFF INTO THE FOREST, his armor clanking in a not-
           especially-dignified way.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Denley? Are you still there?

           Unsure what to do, Prescott calls up:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Uh, Denley had to go to an ... 
                        appointment. We’re Prince Prescott of 
                        Positania and Winnifred.
                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Winnifred of ... ?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Of Winnifred. 

           There’s a silence as the unseen woman considers this. 
           Then, with a sigh of resignation:

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Come on up. 

           Something comes TUMBLING DOWN the smooth side of the 
           tower: a SLENDER, BRAIDED GOLDEN ROPE. Winnifred eyes it 
           skeptically before testing her weight. Although the rope 
           doesn’t look strong enough, it holds.

           With a shrug, Winnifred begins to climb, with Prescott 
           following a few feet behind her.

           Higher and higher they go, until they’re well above the 
           canopy of trees. Winnifred takes the opportunity to 
           glance around. They’re surrounded by IMPENETRABLE WOODS 
           in every direction. 

           INT. TOWER - SAME

           Winnifred puts one hand on the windowsill, then the 
           other. With one final GRUNT OF EXERTION she boosts 
           herself through the window, crash-landing at the 
           slippered, delicate feet of ...

           RAPUNZEL. She’s wearing a beautiful golden dress and 
           clutching the base of her beautiful golden braid, which 
           she has LOOPED AROUND A HOOK and thrown from the window.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (realizing)
                        That was your hair?

           Just then, Prescott comes FALLING THROUGH THE WINDOW. 
           With a sigh of relief, Rapunzel UNHOOKS HER BRAID, begins 
           winding it around her forearm like it’s a length of cord. 
           In a queenly, grandiose tone:

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Indeed. For I am Rapunzel, once the Crown 
                        Princess of Upriver, now the Perpetual 
                        Prisoner, the Disembodied Voice of the 
                        Doorless Tower, She of the Long Golden 
                        Hair Able to Bear the Weight of Five and 
                        Twenty Men. 
                                 WINNIFRED
                        That’s a mouthful.

           Rapunzel sighs. In a normal voice:

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I don’t meet a low of new people. So when 
                        I do I like to really enjoy it. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Why did you call yourself the Perpetual 
                        Prisoner? 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Does this look like somewhere I’d choose 
                        to live? The only way into or out of this 
                        tower is the way you just came. I was 
                        finally on the verge of being rescued, 
                        but ... but ...

           Her lower lip has begun to tremble, and there are tears 
           in her eyes.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        But I guess that’s over now. 

           Rapunzel BURSTS INTO TEARS. Winnifred puts her arm around 
           her comfortingly, but Rapunzel quickly shakes it off.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Please. I don’t want to talk about it.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Okay, if that’s what--

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        It all began a few weeks ago, when the 
                        handsome Prince Denley overheard me 
                        singing my song of woe. 
                                (quickly)
                        Don’t worry, I didn’t let him into my 
                        tower on the first date. I’m not that 
                        kind of princess. But he gradually gained 
                        my trust. He said he was building a 
                        ladder, adding one rung to it for each 
                        day he’d been in love with me, and that 
                        soon he’d use it to rescue me and make me 
                        his queen. But today ... today ...

           She DISSOLVES INTO SOBS YET AGAIN. It would be a 
           heartbreaking sight, if it weren’t so annoying.
                                 PRESCOTT
                                (impatient)
                        Today ...

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        He changed his mind. 

           Prescott and Winnifred exchange a worried glance. Uh-oh. 
           Tentatively:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Did he tell you why?

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        He said my hundred-foot braid made me 
                        look like a lunatic, and that I was 
                        probably psychologically damaged from 
                        living in a tower my whole life. So he’s 
                        going to look for a bride “better 
                        prepared for the realities of queendom.” 
                        Can you believe that? Since when do 
                        handsome princes care about reality?

           Winnifred and Prescott meet eyes again. Starting to 
           really panic now.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s like everything that used to matter 
                        in this world -- virtue, delicacy, 
                        blondeness -- is suddenly meaningless.

           Prescott looks at Winnifred as if to say do something. 
           She hastily blurts out:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Maybe ... maybe ... 
                                (inspired)
                        Maybe you’re better off without him.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        How could that be?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        To lead you on like that only to change 
                        his mind? He kind of sounds like the 
                        crazy one. Were you in love with him?

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Sure.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Really?
                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Close enough! It’s not like I had 
                        handsome princes lining up to rescue me, 
                        you know? I had to take what I could get.

           She narrows her eyes at Prescott, then smiles winningly.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t you say you’re a prince? Where’s 
                        your castle? I’d make a fantastic queen, 
                        I swear.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (hasty)
                        Maybe marriage isn’t the answer here.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        It’s always the answer.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        What about the kingdom you’re from? I’m 
                        sure they’d be thrilled to have their 
                        crown princess back. 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Really? That never occurred to me during 
                        the twenty years I’ve been stuck here.
                        But there’s only one way out of this 
                        tower. And it’s not as if I can climb 
                        down my own hair. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. TOWER - LATER

           Rapunzel squeezes her eyes shut as Winnifred positions a 
           pair of scissors at the base of her neck.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Three, two--

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Don’t count. Just do it.

           With a SINGLE SNIP, Winnifred cuts off the endless length 
           of braid. As she holds it out, Rapunzel’s EYES WIDEN.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Here it is. Your ticket out of here, your 
                        way back to--

           Rapunzel BURSTS INTO TEARS YET AGAIN. 
                                 PRESCOTT
                                (irritated)
                        What now?

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I’m sorry! It’s just ... I spent two 
                        decades waiting to be rescued. What do I 
                        do now that that’s never going to happen?

           Winnifred FORCEFULLY KNOTS one end of the braid over the 
           hook near the window. Holding out the opposite end:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You rescue yourself. 

           EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

           Prescott follows Winnifred and Rapunzel up a well-worn 
           path alongside a placid river. A look of left-out 
           irritation on his face as he listens to the two women 
           CHATTERING CHEERFULLY.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You’ve really seen a dragon?

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        You see a lot of things when you spend 
                        your whole life staring out a window.

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (eager to join in)
                        I’ve always wanted to slay a dragon. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (ignoring him)
                        What do they look like?

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Kind of like giant flying squirrels.

           Prescott shakes his head incredulously. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        That can’t be true. Everyone knows 
                        dragons are giant fire-breathing lizards 
                        with fearsome claws and fangs. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (to Rapunzel)
                        Don’t mind him. He’s just upset because 
                        now he’ll never be a real hero. 
                                 PRESCOTT
                        What are you talking about? I’m hero-ing 
                        right now, as we speak!

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Yes, I can already see it on your 
                        tapestry: “Prince Prescott of Positania, 
                        did exactly what his mommy told him to.”

           Prescott REDDENS, infuriated.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You know what your problem is? You don’t 
                        believe in anything. Maybe you’re right, 
                        maybe I am rich and handsome and smug, 
                        but you’re cynical. And that’s worse. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        How is that worse?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Because you don’t stand for anything!

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Yes I do! I stand for not being a prissy, 
                        idiotic, helpless--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You can’t just define yourself according 
                        to what you’re not! You can’t just stand 
                        on the sidelines of everyone else’s 
                        lives, mocking them and telling them why 
                        everything they care about is wrong! 

           Winnifred is so stunned by this outburst that she can 
           barely bring herself to stammer:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Why not?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Because it makes you empty!

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Guys ...

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (on the verge of tears)
                        I am not empty. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You don’t do anything. You don’t risk 
                        anything. You don’t care about anything 
                        or anyone--
                                 RAPUNZEL
                                (urgent)
                        Guys!

           Prescott halts his rant. 

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re here.

           Winnifred and Prescott look up to realize they’re facing 
           an IMPOSING STONE WALL that stretches endlessly in either 
           direction. A GRATE OF THICK STEEL bars an entrance that 
           straddles the river, allowing water to flow through.

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Who goes there?

           Rapunzel straightens, assumes a QUEENLY POSTURE.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        It is I, Rapunzel, your Crown Princess, 
                        formerly the Perpetual Prisoner, the No-
                        Longer-Disembodied Voice of the Doorless 
                        Tower, She of the Long Golden -- She of 
                        the Long -- She of the ... 

           Her voice trails off.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        ... of the Hair. 

           A beat of silence. Then:

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Who?

           A small section of the stone wall OPENS OUTWARD, 
           revealing itself to be a hidden door. The wary-looking 
           GUARD steps out, holding up a crossbow with an arrow 
           POISED TO SHOOT. 

           At the sight of it, Prescott quickly STEPS BEHIND 
           RAPUNZEL. Winnifred rolls her eyes.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                                (less confident)
                        I’m Rapunzel? I was the crown princess, 
                        until an evil witch took me captive and 
                        kept me hidden in a tower in the woods?

                                 GUARD
                        Oh. Yeah. I remember that. 

           The Guard lowers the crossbow. Prescott SIGHS IN RELIEF.
                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        This is kinda awkward. Thing is, we’re 
                        actually having the election right now.

           Rapunzel, Prescott and Winnifred exchange confused looks.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What’s an election?

           EXT. KINGDOM OF UPRIVER - MOMENTS LATER

           Our adventurers follow the Guard through the streets of 
           Upriver, past merchant stalls and thatch-roofed houses 
           all PLASTERED WITH SIGNS for the various candidates. 

                                 GUARD
                        The throne’s been sitting empty all these 
                        years. It’s been chaos. And then it 
                        finally hit all of us -- why not just 
                        have anyone who wants to share their best 
                        ideas for running the kingdom, and we’ll 
                        all vote on who we like most?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Kings are born, not voted on. I should 
                        know; I’m going to be one someday.

                                 GUARD
                        Uh-huh. And how’ve you been preparing for 
                        the job, if I might ask?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I’m on a very heroic quest right now. I 
                        un-enchanted this maiden here and rescued 
                        this princess--

           Winnifred COUGHS POINTEDLY, but Prescott persists:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        --rescued this princess, and I also had a 
                        lot of very prestigious tutors growing up 
                        who taught me how to ride and fence, and, 
                        uh, I’m handsome, and--

                                 GUARD
                        Let me tell you what I’m hearing: you 
                        like pretty girls and you have a horse. 
                        But the same could be said of me. Well, 
                        minus the horse.

           They pass a sign for BLACKSMITH BILL: CHANGE UPRIVER CAN 
           BELIEVE IN.
                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        My money’s on Blacksmith Bill. He’s the 
                        kind of guy you feel like you could share 
                        a mead with, you know?

           They round a corner to find themselves in front of the

           EXT. PALACE OF UPRIVER 

           A rustic but grand palace. A MASSIVE CROWD OF CITIZENS 
           stands outside awaiting the verdict of the vote. Over the 
           entrance, a banner has been hung reading, “UPRIVER 
           GENERAL ELECTION TODAY!”

           Just then, a SQUIRE appears on a terrace above. He 
           unravels a roll of parchment, then reads:

                                 SQUIRE
                        Citizens of the Free Kingdom of Upriver, 
                        it is my honor to introduce to you your 
                        first-ever King-Elect ...

           He pauses dramatically. The crowd is rapt, waiting.

                                 SQUIRE (CONT’D)
                        William Smith!

           RAUCOUS CHEERING FILLS THE SQUARE as a HANDSOME MAN in a 
           peasant’s plain sackcloth appears on the terrace.

                                 GUARD
                        There he is!

           BLACKSMITH BILL smiles and waves to the cheering crowd.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                                (to Winnifred)
                        He’s handsome, isn’t he? Maybe I should 
                        try to marry him. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Or maybe you should try to be him.
                                (off Rapunzel’s confusion)
                        Spend the next four years learning 
                        everything you can about being a leader, 
                        and then they’ll elect you.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                                (confused)
                        But who will I marry?
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Anybody you want! Or nobody at all! Don’t 
                        you see? You don’t need to be married to 
                        be Queen-Elect of Upriver. 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        It never occurred to me that I could do 
                        things without a man.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You already have. You rescued yourself 
                        from a doorless tower. Imagine what else 
                        you can do! 

           Prescott glares at Winnifred. But Rapunzel is thrilled, 
           her cheeks flushed and eyes alight.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. UPRIVER GATES - MORNING

           Prescott and Winnifred, cleaned up and rested, throw the 
           last of their things into a WOODEN CANOE. They’re about 
           to push off when Rapunzel comes RUSHING OUT.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Wait! I have something for you!

           Breathless, she hands something to Winnifred: the rope 
           made from her golden hair, neatly coiled. 

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have any use for it anymore. And 
                        who knows, maybe someday you’ll need it.

           Nodding, Winnifred tucks the rope inside her pack. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Okay. Thanks.

           Rapunzel unties their boat from the dock, then pushes it 
           into the current, calling out after them: 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Come see me in four years. We’ll make a 
                        treaty or something. And by then I’ll 
                        actually know what that means!

           She waves goodbye as the current QUICKLY CARRIES THE 
           CANOE away from the gate, then around a bend.

           The second Rapunzel is out of sight, Prescott leans over 
           and PUNCHES WINNIFRED IN THE ARM, HARD.
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Ow!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What was that? She was supposed to get 
                        married and live happily ever after, not 
                        get caught up in some half-baked 
                        political revolution! 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Maybe this is her happily ever after. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You didn’t do this to help her. You did 
                        it to spite me.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You’re right. The only reason anyone does 
                        anything is you. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I can’t believe I went through all of 
                        that to get you un-enchanted just so you 
                        could turn around and be mean to me. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        It’s ironic, isn’t it? You were stuck 
                        with the perfect princess. Now I’m stuck 
                        with the perfect prince. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Maybe we just shouldn’t talk anymore.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Fine.

           She lies back in the canoe and shuts her eyes to sleep. 
           After a moment, Prescott does the same.

           HOURS LATER

           Winnifred wakes up slowly. Gentle sunlight dapples her 
           face as the boat continues to DRIFT. Smiling, she tilts 
           her face upward toward the sun.

           And then she SITS STRAIGHT UP, ALARMED. 

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Prescott. Prescott!

           She shakes his arm, jolting him awake so suddenly that he 
           LIFTS HIS HEAD AND BUMPS IT ON THE SEAT.
                                 PRESCOTT
                        Ow! What?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Look.

           As she points upward, we REVERSE to reveal what she’s 
           staring at: the leaves of the trees overhead and the sky 
           have turned the same UNIFORM GRAY. Almost as if all the 
           color has been leached out of them. 

           As the two of them look around, they realize EVERYTHING 
           AROUND THEM HAS GONE GRAY: the grass on the riverbank, 
           the water, even the boat. They are the only two spots of 
           color in a COMPLETELY MONOCHROMATIC LANDSCAPE. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What happened?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I don’t know.

           Prescott cocks his head to the side. Distantly, a MAN’S 
           VOICE CAN BE HEARD calling something over and over.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I think it’s coming from around the bend.

           As the canoe rounds the curve, they see up ahead an

           EXT. WOODEN DOCK

           With a discouraged-looking MERCHANT perched on it. Laid 
           out on blankets around him are a variety of DULL-LOOKING 
           OBJECTS, and he’s not doing much to enliven them as he 
           calls out in a monotone:

                                 MERCHANT
                        Items here, get your items. All kinds of 
                        objects of all different origins. 

           Prescott and Winnifred STEER THE CANOE TOWARD HIM. As 
           Prescott reaches out to grab hold of the dock, the 
           Merchant stands up to help him. Eager:

                                 MERCHANT (CONT’D)
                        You folks in the market for some items?

           He ties up the canoe, then gives each of them a hand as 
           they CLAMBER ONTO THE DOCK. 
                                 MERCHANT (CONT’D)
                        As you can see, I got items, objects, 
                        notions and sundries.

           Winnifred picks up what looks like a bunch of rough-edged 
           pebbles on a string.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        What’s this?

                                 MERCHANT
                        Used to be an enchanted necklace. Matter 
                        of fact, everything you see here was once 
                        magical in nature.

           Prescott lifts a RUSTY SWORD. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        This sword was magical?

                                 MERCHANT
                        Oh yeah. A chosen one pulled it out of a 
                        stone and everything. You want it? I’ll 
                        throw in the necklace for free.  

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I don’t know. It’s in pretty bad shape.

                                 MERCHANT
                        Think of it as rustic.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I think you mean rusty.

                                 MERCHANT
                        Fine line, isn’t it? 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Maybe you’re in the wrong field. I can’t 
                        imagine there’s much of a market for 
                        previously enchanted goods.

                                 MERCHANT
                                (rolling eyes)
                        Thanks for that insight. For your 
                        information, they were all enchanted when 
                        I got them. That sword right there? It 
                        shone like the sun. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Did you leave it out in the rain? I did 
                        that to a sword once. My fencing tutor 
                        was furious. 
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Please stop bringing up your tutors. 

                                 MERCHANT
                        It got this way all on its own. It’s like 
                        the magic somehow ... drained out of it.

           Winnifred and Prescott meet eyes.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        When exactly did this happen?

                                 MERCHANT
                        Earlier today. I’ve never seen anything 
                        like it. One minute I had the finest 
                        wares in all the land. The next all I had 
                        was a bunch of ugly junk-- 
                                (catching himself)
                        I mean, a bunch of antiques. You sure I 
                        can’t interest you folks in anything?

           Holding up a TARNISHED AND CRACKED HAND MIRROR:

                                 MERCHANT (CONT’D)
                        Magic mirror?

           Indicating a SPHERE OF ROUGH CONCRETE:

                                 MERCHANT (CONT’D)
                        Crystal ball?

           With a glance in Prescott’s direction:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        We’ll take the sword. It’s the least we 
                        can do.

                                 MERCHANT
                        Don’t forget this.

           He holds out the string of pebbles as if presenting a 
           diamond necklace. With a wink at Prescott:

                                 MERCHANT (CONT’D)
                        Ladies love their gemstones. 

           EXT. CANOE - LATER

           The grey river is moving MUCH MORE SWIFTLY NOW. Prescott 
           now wears the rusty sword; Winnifred wears the pebbles; 
           and they both wear identical expressions of anxiety.

           Finally, trying to lighten the mood:
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Maybe it’s all just a weird coincidence.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s not a coincidence. The world is 
                        falling apart, just like those Grimm 
                        Brothers said it would.
                                (glum)
                        I kinda feel like it’s my fault.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        That’s probably because it is. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What? It’s your fault!

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Then why’d you say it was yours?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        To get you to admit it! Think about it. 
                        If you’d never showed up at my castle in 
                        the middle of the night none of this 
                        would have happened. Generica would have 
                        passed the mattress test--

                                 WINNIFRED
                        That does not sound right.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        --and I would have married her. Case 
                        closed. Kingdom complete. World saved.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        So you do remember the night we met.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Of course.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Then maybe you also remember me saying a 
                        little something about not wanting to get 
                        married. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Let me make sure I have all this 
                        straight. Where are you from?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Dalmane.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        And where were you planning to go?
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Into the forest.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        And where were you when you first 
                        realized you liked me?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        In your kitchen.

           She CLAPS HER HANDS over her mouth, turns BRIGHT RED.

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (smug)
                        That’s what I thought.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Wait a minute. Do you hear something?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Don’t try to change the subject. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I’m serious. It sounds like--

           Just then, they round a bend to see, up ahead, the 
           WHITEWATER RAPIDS that lead to an ENORMOUS WATERFALL. 

           EXT. MASSIVE WATERFALL - AERIAL VIEW

           Prescott and Winnifred’s little boat is a MERE SPECK in 
           the NOW-RAGING WATERS of the river. They carry it swiftly 
           toward the lip of the waterfall, which plummets HUNDREDS 
           OF FEET to the rest of the river below. 

           EXT. CANOE

           Winnifred and Prescott both begin PADDLING DESPERATELY, 
           trying to reverse the canoe’s course. But the water’s 
           moving too fast. Realizing what’s about to happen, 
           Prescott PULLS HIS SHIRT OFF OVER HIS HEAD.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (shielding her eyes)
                        Hey! Easy!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What?
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Next time maybe give me a warning before 
                        forcing me to look at your, you know, 
                        chest and muscles and everything.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You’d better undress too.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Excuse me?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You can’t go under in all your clothes. 
                        They’ll get soaked and drag you down. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Let me guess: you had a swimming tutor. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No. My parents let him go. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Why?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Because I was afraid of the water. I 
                        never once went in. 

           The boulder-studded edge of the waterfall is FAST-
           APPROACHING NOW. They have to SHOUT to hear each other 
           over the ROARING WATER.

           Spotting an especially flat rock up ahead:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        If we jump onto that boulder we might 
                        have a chance!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        We won’t be close enough!

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Help me paddle!

           They resume PADDLING DESPERATELY, but as they RACE TOWARD 
           THE EDGE it’s clear: they’re not going to make it. 

           And then Prescott does something surprising: he stands up 
           in the boat and PLANTS HIS OAR OVER THE SIDE.

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                                (horrified)
                        What are you doing?
                                 PRESCOTT
                        Giving you a push!

           And just like that, he POLE-VAULTS OVER THE OAR, 
           disappearing instantly into the ROILING WATER.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Prescott!

           Her body JOLTS as the boat FLIES BACKWARD from the force 
           of the push and HITS THE BOULDER. She has just a few 
           seconds to jump ship before the boat goes over the edge.

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Prescott!

           But there’s no sign of him. The boat is MOVING PAST THE 
           BOULDER NOW. With seconds to spare, Winnifred LEAPS ONTO 
           IT AND GRABS HOLD, scrabbling at the wet surface with 
           both hands, as the little canoe DISAPPEARS OVER THE EDGE.

           Pulling herself to her feet, Winnifred finally spots 
           Prescott CLINGING WEAKLY to a small, jagged rock. As his 
           TERRIFIED EYES MEET HERS--

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Hold on! I’m coming!

           Panicked, she searches for a path among the boulders. But 
           just then the OAR Prescott dropped comes RUSHING BY AND 
           KNOCKS HIM IN THE CHEST, forcing him to LET GO.

           Time seems to slow. For one long moment, Prescott appears 
           SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR, his arms and legs flailing--

           --and then, just like that, he’s GONE.

           Winnifred runs to the edge of the rock, hoping to spot 
           him in the CHURNING WATER FAR BELOW. But all she sees is 
           the WRECKAGE OF THE CANOE. It’s been bashed to bits. 

                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Come on, come on ...

           But Prescott doesn’t resurface.

           Winnifred stands a moment longer, watching, waiting ...

           And then, when he still doesn’t come up, she KICKS OFF 
           HER SHOES. Her face is a mask of determination as she 
           strips down to her slip.

           Squeezing her eyes shut:
                                 WINNIFRED (CONT’D)
                        Three, two--
                                (beat)
                        Don’t count, just do it!

           She hesitates a moment longer.

           And then she DIVES. 

           Hands in a perfect “V” over her head, she PLUMMETS DOWN 
           THE FRONT OF THE WATERFALL, a small bright shape against 
           the steely gray water. 

           WINNIFRED’S POV -- The white caps of the waves below RUSH 
           UP TO MEET HER, occasionally clearing to give little 
           peaks of the DEEP DARK WATER BENEATH--

           And then, without so much as a splash, she PLUNGES IN.

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Eyes open, Winnifred PUSHES THROUGH THE WATER, swiveling 
           her head from side to side. No sign of Prescott. She 
           swims forward a few strokes before resurfacing--

           EXT. RIVER

           --takes a deep breath, then plunges back in--

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           --and spots him up ahead, SINKING FAST. Winnifred pushes 
           toward him, grabs him under the arms, KICKS DESPERATELY 
           toward the surface--

           EXT. RIVERBANK

           --and finally emerges in the shallow water near the 
           riverbank. She stands, dragging Prescott through the 
           shallow water and onto the sand, then COLLAPSES NEXT TO 
           HIM, gasping for air as he COUGHS UP WATER.

           Turning to her weakly, Prescott croaks out:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Who was your swimming tutor?

           Winnifred laughs.
                                 WINNIFRED
                        I taught myself, believe it or not. I can 
                        teach you too, if you want.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Thanks. But I’m never getting in the 
                        water ever again. 

           He studies her face. Nervous now:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        What?

           He leans in toward her, his face inches from hers. Her 
           heart pounding, she shuts her eyes, ready for the kiss 
           she’s sure is coming--

           --then opens them again when she feels him pulling 
           something from her hair. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Seaweed. 

           He brushes a piece of kelp off on the grass. Trying to 
           hide her disappointment:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        So. Any idea where we are now?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Yes. We’re home.

           He points across the water, where, in the hazy distance, 
           the Royal Palace of Positania can just be seen above the 
           once-grassy, now-grey hills. 

           They retrieve their things from the wreckage that’s 
           washed up on the shore, then set off toward the castle. 

           EXT. ROAD TO PALACE - LATER

           Prescott and Winnifred straggle up the road to the 
           palace, taking in the bare trees and dull colors of the 
           COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED LANDSCAPE. Even the palace is 
           changed. Its once-gilded rooftops are now CORRODED AND 
           BLACK, its marble balustrades CRUMBLING.

           As they approach the drawbridge, a voice from inside 
           calls out:

                                 NORWOOD (O.S.)
                        Who goes there?
                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s me! Prescott!

           Near the bottom of the drawbridge, a small strip of iron 
           SLIDES ASIDE to reveal a pair of SKEPTICAL EYES. Suddenly 
           the eyes widen.

                                 NORWOOD (O.S.)
                        Lower the bridge!

           GRINDING AND CLANKING SOUND as the drawbridge is hastily 
           lowered over the moat. Norwood comes running out, his 
           eyes filled with tears.

                                 NORWOOD (CONT’D)
                        We’d all but given up hope.

           Eying Winnifred:

                                 NORWOOD (CONT’D)
                        I assume from the lady’s ... imperfect 
                        state that your quest was a success. 

           Winnifred and Prescott glance at one another.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Well, not exactly.

           INT. GRAND HALL 

           Norwood strides ahead as Prescott and Winnifred look 
           around, wide-eyed. Cobwebbed and dusty, the palace now 
           resembles nothing so much as a haunted house.

                                 NORWOOD
                        All the servants have gone. They suddenly 
                        wanted money in return for their work -- 
                        can you imagine? As if being in the 
                        hallowed presence of the royal family 
                        wasn’t payment enough! The Queen was so 
                        shocked she took to her chambers for a 
                        week. And when she finally came out, she 
                        announced she was leaving the King.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What?!

                                 NORWOOD
                        She said she wanted to “find her bliss,” 
                        whatever that means.

           Prescott reels. 
                                 PRESCOTT
                        So my mother is ... gone?

           Now they’re traveling past the GALLERY OF TAPESTRIES, all 
           of which are LITERALLY UNRAVELING as they go by.

                                 NORWOOD
                        Well, no. When your father quite rightly 
                        pointed out that the only women over 
                        thirty living on their own in Positania 
                        are witches and wicked stepmothers, she 
                        decided to stay. But they’ve been 
                        fighting ever since. 

           He turns around to look at Prescott, his eyes shining 
           with tears of happiness.

                                 NORWOOD (CONT’D)
                        But now that you’re back, surely 
                        everything will return to normal.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        That’s the idea, anyway. 

           INT. DINING HALL - LATER

           The whole gang is gathered around a table HEAPED WITH 
           FOOD. The King and Queen, Norwood and Generica all wear 
           identical expressions of bewilderment as they struggle to 
           understand what Winnifred and Prescott are telling them.

           Queen Odella is the first to speak:

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        So after going to all that trouble for 
                        her, you’re not even going to marry her?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I have to marry Generica, Mother. It’s 
                        the way the story was supposed to go. 

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        This is very unorthodox. 

                                 KING OGDEN
                        As unorthodox as a queen leaving her 
                        husband to go off by herself and do 
                        nothing all day?

                                 QUEEN ODELLA
                        I was going to make candles!
           The King and Queen sink into a RESENTFUL SILENCE, glaring 
           at each other. Prescott hastily jumps in:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        See? Everything’s falling apart, and 
                        there’s only one way to fix it. 

           He turns to Generica and adds:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That is, if you’re okay with all of this. 

           Generica smiles triumphantly.

                                 GENERICA
                        I always wanted a storybook wedding. 

           Turning back to the rest of the table:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I know it was a lot to go through for the 
                        wrong girl. But my quest taught me 
                        something I really needed to learn.
                                (beat)
                        Sometimes you have to put other peoples’ 
                        happily-ever-afters ahead of your own. 
                        That’s being a real hero. 

           There’s a silence as everyone absorbs this. Then, 
           approvingly:

                                 KING OGDEN
                        Well said, son. That quote will look 
                        great on the bottom of your tapestry.

           Generica CLAPS HER HANDS WITH EXCITEMENT.

                                 GENERICA
                        I’m going to be on a tapestry! What am I 
                        going to wear? Winnifred!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Actually, Winnifred won’t be your lady-in-
                        waiting anymore. Instead, I’m going to 
                        make her a Knight of Positania. 

                                 GENERICA
                        Then I’ll need a new lady-in-waiting. 
                        There’s so much to think about!

           Everyone begins CHATTERING EXCITEDLY ABOUT THE UPCOMING 
           WEDDING. Turning to Prescott, in a low voice:
                                 WINNIFRED
                        Thank you. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No, thank you.

           He reaches out and takes her hand one last time. Squeezes 
           it as they smile at one another.

           INT. PALACE - SUNDOWN - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Generica stands near the doorway to the terrace, grinning 
           with giddy excitement. In her voluminous white dress, her 
           golden hair cascading down her back, she is every inch 
           the perfect princess, ready for her perfect, end-of-
           princess-movie wedding.

           At the sound of a CACOPHONY OF OUT-OF-TUNE TRUMPETS, she 
           readies herself to step out onto the terrace, when out of 
           nowhere she hears:

                                 WINNIFRED (V.O.)
                        Generica! Wait!

           Winnifred comes RUNNING UP, dressed in her new knight’s 
           armor and holding something behind her back.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You can’t marry him.

           Generica’s eyes flash as she fires back:

                                 GENERICA
                        I’m not going to let you sabotage me 
                        again. It’s over, Winnifred. And I won.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (patient)
                        That’s not what I meant. I meant, you 
                        can’t marry him without this.

           She holds out what she’s been hiding: her filthy pack 
           from the quest. Generica looks inside, frowning.

                                 GENERICA
                        A bag of wet hair?

           Winnifred pushes aside Rapunzel’s rope to reveal her real 
           gift: a beautiful GOLDEN TIARA, studded with diamonds.

           Generica’s eyes fill with tears. She’s genuinely touched.
                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        It’s even more beautiful than the one I 
                        had! How did you get it?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        A handsome prince gave it to me when he 
                        thought I was going to marry him.

                                 GENERICA
                        How on earth did you get two princes to 
                        want to marry you?
                                (beat)
                        Sorry. What I meant to say is thank you.

           Winnifred positions the tiara on Generica’s head, then 
           takes a step back, smiling.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You look perfect. 

           Generica wipes at her eyes. 

                                 GENERICA
                        Tell the truth: you did this on purpose 
                        to ruin my makeup.

           Winnifred laughs.

           EXT. TERRACE - SAME

           The people of Positania have TURNED OUT IN DROVES to 
           watch from the dead grass of the palace lawn as Prescott 
           finally, at long last, takes a bride. 

           It’s sundown, but the sky is colorless and grim, a match 
           for Prescott’s mood as he stands at the front of the 
           terrace in FULL ROYAL REGALIA, including an ENORMOUS 
           SILVER CROWN. Off to the side, Winnifred scurries out and 
           takes her place among a RETINUE OF ROYAL KNIGHTS.

           In a dutiful, not-exactly-enthusiastic tone:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Fair citizens of Positania, I present to 
                        you your new queen, Generica of Dalmane.

           Generica emerges onto the terrace, tiara perfectly in 
           place. Taking small, bridal-march steps, she walks toward 
           Prescott, GRINNING TRIUMPHANTLY.

           But then she sees something in the distance that WIPES 
           THE SMILE OFF HER FACE. 
           Noticing:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Generica? Are you all right?

                                 GENERICA
                        Is that ... a giant squirrel?

           Everyone turns at once in time to see a MASSIVE FLYING 
           SQUIRREL HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                                (realizing)
                        No. It’s a dragon.

           At the sound of the word “dragon,” the crowd below 
           SCREAMS IN TERROR, dissipates quickly as the dragon 
           CLOSES IN. But it’s not interested in them. It’s only 
           interested in one thing:

                                 DRAGON
                        Prince Prescott of Positania, I presume? 

           The dragon LANDS ON THE TERRACE. As it flicks its fluffy 
           tail, the guests on the terrace all SCATTER OUT OF THE 
           WAY, YELLING AND SHOUTING as they go. 

           In all the hysteria, Generica’s been completely 
           forgotten. She STANDS ALONE, an island in the stream of 
           people running inward, until Winnifred GRABS HER BY THE 
           ARM and pulls her toward the tall oaken doors to the 
           terrace, calling over her shoulder:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Prescott, come on!

           Generica STUMBLES AND FALLS, TEARING HER DRESS. Winnifred 
           pulls her back to her feet. But as they approach the 
           castle someone inside shouts hysterically:

                                 WEDDING GUEST
                        Bar the doors! 

           Prescott watches in horror as the doors SLAM IN WINNIFRED 
           AND GENERICA’S FACES. Winnifred POUNDS ON THEM WITH HER 
           FISTS, but to no avail: they’re shut tight.

           Now it’s just Prescott, Winnifred and Generica alone on 
           the terrace. With the dragon. Which, in spite of its 
           squirrel-like appearance, is PRETTY DAMN TERRIFYING.

                                 DRAGON
                        I’ve been searching for you. 
           Its low, raspy voice is reminiscent of James Spader’s: 
           authoritative and menacing at the same time. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I think you have the wrong person. 

                                 DRAGON
                        Are you Prince Prescott?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Yes ...

                                 DRAGON
                        The same Prince Prescott who screwed up 
                        all the stories?

           Prescott BLANCHES.  

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        And this must be the princess and the 
                        pauper. I hope they were worth it. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I didn’t mean any harm, I swear. 

                                 DRAGON
                        Would you call this harm?

           It turns so they can see the side of its body. Generica 
           GASPS IN HORROR: whole tufts of fur are missing, 
           revealing SHINY GREEN SCALES UNDERNEATH. 

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        We were a peaceful species. We had no 
                        problem with your kind. But ever since 
                        you started with your meddling, we’ve 
                        been losing our fur, growing hideous 
                        scales and claws and teeth. We used to be 
                        magical. Now, like everything else in 
                        this world, we’ve turned mean and ugly. 
                                (beat)
                        And someone has to pay.

           Prescott tries to stand tall and look tough as he says:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Don’t worry. I’m the hero of this tale. 
                        And I’ve figured out a way to make 
                        everything the way it was.

                                 DRAGON
                        I have a better way. 

           Its eyes FLASH VICIOUSLY.
                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        All three of you must die. 

           Shaking from fear, but trying not to show it, Prescott 
           turns and calls to Winnifred:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Stay back!

           Winnifred steps protectively in front of Generica. But 
           her eyes betray the fact that she’s just as terrified as 
           everyone else. 

           Turning back to the dragon, Prescott pulls the RUSTY 
           SWORD from its sheath and holds it aloft menacingly.

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve always wanted to slay a dragon. 

           But the dragon merely CHUCKLES. 

                                 DRAGON
                        You’ll need a better weapon than some 
                        sword you left out in the rain. 

           Lunging forward, the dragon SWIPES AT PRESCOTT with its 
           front claws, but the prince DUCKS just in time. 
           Infuriated, the dragon rears its head back and ROARS 
           FIRE. As the flames SWEEP TOWARD HIM:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Here, take this!

           She slides him something across the marble floor: her 
           SHIELD. He grabs it just in time, manages to HIDE BENEATH 
           IT as the dragon’s flame passes over him. Its eyes 
           sparkle with grudging admiration as it hisses:

                                 DRAGON
                        Very tricky. Unfortunately for you, I 
                        still have my tail. 

           Before Prescott can react, the dragon SWEEPS ITS MASSIVE 
           SQUIRREL TAIL ACROSS THE BALCONY, knocking the sword and 
           shield from his hands and SENDING THEM FLYING.

           As the dragon INHALES DEEPLY, preparing to breathe fire 
           again, Prescott glances around desperately for something, 
           anything that can help him. But there’s nothing. 

           The dragon ROARS, FLAMES LEAPING FROM ITS MOUTH. Prescott 
           RUNS FROM THE WHITE-HOT FIRE AT HIS HEELS, but stops 
           short when he hits the edge of the terrace. He’s TRAPPED.
           The dragon’s fire SWEEPS OVER PRESCOTT. As Winnifred and 
           Generica watch in horror, his clothes BURST INTO FLAME.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (anguished)
                        Prescott!

           But it’s too late. Prescott’s flaming figure TIPS 
           BACKWARD over the edge of the terrace. And then, just 
           like that, he’s gone. 

           Winnifred clamps her hands to her mouth, devastated. But 
           there’s no time to grieve. Like a cat stalking its prey, 
           the dragon is already SLOWLY ADVANCING on her and 
           Generica, grinning with all of its teeth.

                                 DRAGON
                        That was easier than I thought.

           EXT. MOAT - UNDERWATER

           The dark, murky water of the moat is disrupted by a 
           splash as the fiery figure of Prescott PLUNGES IN. His 
           clothes immediately extinguish as he SWALLOWS WATER, 
           COUGHING AND THRASHING WILDLY. 

           EXT. TERRACE

           As the dragon closes in on Winnifred and Generica:

                                 GENERICA
                        Winnifred! Do something!

           In desperation, Winnifred LAUNCHES HERSELF AT THE DRAGON, 
           grabbing it around the neck and holding on tight. As it 
           desperately SNAPS ITS HEAD BACK AND FORTH, trying to 
           shake her off:

                                 DRAGON
                        Let go!

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (gritted teeth)
                        Don’t tell me what to do. 

           She SWINGS HERSELF AROUND until she’s straddling the 
           dragon’s back. 

                                 DRAGON
                        Very well. You leave me no choice. 
           The dragon LIFTS OFF FROM THE BALCONY, Winnifred still 
           clinging to the fur of its back. The small figure of 
           Generica, AGAPE WITH HORROR, rapidly shrinks as the 
           dragon ACCELERATES UPWARD with terrifying speed.

           EXT. MOAT - UNDERWATER

           Air bubbles STREAM FROM PRESCOTT’S MOUTH as he 
           desperately tries to propel himself forward with his 
           arms. We can see from his panicked expression that he’s 
           running out of air. 

           EXT. MIDAIR 

           The dragon LAUNCHES INTO A SERIES OF BARREL ROLLS 
           intended to throw Winnifred off. But she hangs on 
           tightly, even as her face turns green from nausea. 

           EXT. MOAT - UNDERWATER

           Finally Prescott finds what he’s been looking for: an 
           UNDERWATER GRATE blocking a passage into the palace. With 
           the last of his strength he WRENCHES IT FROM ITS 
           MOORINGS, then swims through--

           INT. BASEMENT

           --and finally RESURFACES, GASPING FOR AIR, in a channel 
           of water running through the palace basement. Shivering, 
           he pulls himself out, then COLLAPSES ON THE FLOOR, 
           exhausted, coughing up water.

           EXT. TERRACE

           Generica watches in horror as the dragon PLUMMETS BACK 
           TOWARD THE BALCONY, WHOOPING WITH SINISTER GLEE.

           EXT. MIDAIR

           As the dragon DIVES, Winnifred’s right hand FLIES LOOSE 
           FROM ITS BACK. Her eyes widen in fear as she sees that 
           the clump of fur she’d been holding has FALLEN OUT, 
           revealing slimy-looking scales underneath. 

           The dragon SWOOPS LOW OVER THE PALACE. As the fur in 
           Winnifred’s left hand begins to loosen, the dragon 
           readies itself to shoot upward once again, and she 
           squeezes her eyes shut, sure this is going to be the end--
           And then, with a JOLT, Winnifred and the dragon are 
           YANKED DOWNWARD by some invisible force. The dragon lands 
           on the terrace with a THUD just as Winnifred’s left hand 
           loses its grip, sending her ROLLING OFF THE DRAGON’S BACK 
           to land on the marble floor. 

           As she pulls herself to her feet, confused, the notices 
           something unfamiliar looped around the dragon’s neck. 
           It’s a ROPE.

           A GOLDEN ONE. 

           Following it with her eyes, she’s ecstatic to see 
           PRESCOTT FRAMED IN THE TERRACE DOORWAY, the other end of 
           Rapunzel’s braid in his hand. Even sopping wet, with his 
           eyebrows and hair singed, he looks just like a hero. 

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You’re alive! 

           She runs toward him, wiping tears from her eyes. In a 
           tone that betrays how cool he thinks this line is:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        This is my house. And nobody threatens a 
                        maiden in my house. Because I live in it. 

           Throwing her arms around him, Winnifred says tearfully:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        That line needs work.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You can’t help yourself, can you?

           But he’s smiling. She smiles back before tucking her head 
           under his chin. But as her eyes fall to his hand, her 
           expression quickly fades to one of panic as she realizes:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Did you tie that rope around your wrist?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Yeah. Why?

           But she doesn’t need to explain, because right then the 
           dragon, who has taken advantage of their reunion to seize 
           the lasso in its mouth, YANKS HARD ON THE ROPE, KNOCKING 
           THEM BOTH TO THE GROUND.

           In a flash, the dragon WHIPS ITS HEAD AROUND, wrapping 
           them tightly in the rope as it pulls them in close. It 
           LOOMS OVER THEM as they struggle to free themselves, 
           FLAMES FLICKERING FROM ITS MOUTH as it says:
                                 DRAGON
                        I believe this is the part referred to in 
                        the story as “the end.”

           The dragon REARS BACK, EYES GLEAMING, ABOUT TO STRIKE--

           --and then, out of nowhere:

                                 GENERICA
                        Not. So. Fast.

           Prescott, Winnifred and the dragon all turn at once to 
           see Generica standing there in her shredded wedding 
           dress, Prescott’s rusty sword CLUTCHED IN HER HANDS.

           Except it’s not rusty anymore. As Generica STEPS BETWEEN 
           HER FRIENDS AND THE DRAGON, her eyes defiant, a PULSE OF 
           LIGHT travels up the sword from the handle. Before their 
           very eyes, it changes from dull and tarnished to RAZOR-
           SHARP AND SHINY.

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        Let them go.

           The dragon ROARS FLAMES at Generica, but stops short when 
           the magical sword merely REPELS THEM, sending them FLYING 
           BACK IN ITS FACE. Its eyes widen as it realizes:

                                 DRAGON
                        Is that sword ... magical?

                                 GENERICA
                        Come get a closer look. I dare you.

           Behind her, Prescott and Winnifred have finally untangled 
           themselves and risen to their feet. 

                                 DRAGON
                        But all the magic’s gone out of 
                        everything. Everyone knows that.

           Generica advances on the dragon, all the determination 
           she once brought to being a perfect princess channeled 
           into this.

           Now it’s the dragon’s turn to beg as it backs away:

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        Please. All I wanted was to make things 
                        the way they were. 

                                 GENERICA
                        I’m tired of the way things were.
                                 DRAGON
                        You and I, we’re victims in all of this!

                                 GENERICA
                        I am not a victim. I’m a princess.

                                 DRAGON
                        They’re the same thing!

           Generica raises the sword. 

                                 GENERICA
                        Not anymore.

           She CHARGES THE DRAGON, the sword aimed right between its 
           TERRIFIED EYES. But just as she’s about to strike:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Wait!

           Generica freezes, turns to Prescott in surprise. 

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Killing each other isn’t going to change 
                        anything. 

                                 DRAGON
                        Then what is?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        This sword somehow got its magic back. 
                        And it’s not the only thing.

           He reaches under Winnifred’s armor and pulls out the 
           necklace. Everyone GASPS IN SHOCK: what was moments ago 
           just a bunch of pebbles on a string has transformed into 
           a SLENDER GOLD CHAIN STUDDED WITH GEMSTONES.

                                 WINNIFRED
                                (confused)
                        That wasn’t like that earlier.

                                 GENERICA
                        If it was I would’ve stolen it. 
                                (beat)
                        I mean, asked to borrow it.  

                                 DRAGON
                        This isn’t fair. I need magic to survive 
                        and you people are wasting it on your 
                        accessories.
                                 PRESCOTT
                        We’re not doing it on purpose. But we 
                        must be doing something. 
                                (beat)
                        Generica, what were you thinking when you 
                        picked up that sword?

           Generica glances at Winnifred. Then:

                                 GENERICA
                        I’d rather not say. 

                         PRESCOTT
           Oh come on!
                                                      DRAGON
                                            This is not a good time to 
                                            be coy.

           Generica looks at Winnifred as if asking for permission.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        It’s okay, Generica. Whatever it is, we 
                        can take it.

           Generica swallows. Then:

                                 GENERICA
                        I was thinking you’re in love with him. 

           Winnifred goes BEET-RED as Generica turns to Prescott.

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        And you’re in love with her, too. 

           Prescott and Winnifred are suddenly both very interested 
           in their shoes as she continues:

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        You can pretend you’re not, but I know 
                        you are. I think I knew it all along, I 
                        just didn’t want to know it until now. 

           She drops the sword to the ground in a resigned gesture. 

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        This is hard for me to say. My whole life 
                        I’ve been training for this moment. I ran 
                        relay races in high heels. Survived on a 
                        hundred calories a day so my waist would 
                        be thinner than my neck. I was determined 
                        to be the one who married the handsome 
                        prince on the terrace at sunset. But I 
                        can’t be the one who keeps apart two 
                        people in love.

           The dragon’s eyes widen.
                                 DRAGON
                        That’s why the necklace changed. 

           It points at Winnifred.

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        Because you realized it too. 

           Now everyone’s staring at Winnifred, who is blushing 
           furiously. Trying desperately to change the subject:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        But in the story--

                                 GENERICA
                                (exasperated)
                        I’m done with the story! I want to write 
                        a new, better story. One where princesses 
                        like me don’t have to get our makeup 
                        tattooed on our faces so princes like him 
                        will think we wake up looking like this -- 
                        how dumb are you guys? -- and where girls 
                        like you can be knights or queens or both 
                        at the same time, and where people can 
                        fall in love with whoever they want--

           The dragon clears its throat. Rolling her eyes:

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        And where dragons are cute and cuddly and 
                        have all their fur.

                                 DRAGON
                        Thank you.

           Indicating the shreds of her wedding dress:

                                 GENERICA
                        Isn’t that supposed to be the point of 
                        all this? Love? Not what love is like in 
                        some story, but real, actual love?

           Prescott turns to look at Winnifred. Can’t help but grin 
           giddily. As a smile spreads over her face:

                                 WINNIFRED
                        Don’t make me say it.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I love you too.

           He leans in to kiss her, but is interrupted by Generica 
           crying out excitedly:
                                 GENERICA
                        Look! Under your feet!

           Prescott and Winnifred look down to see TWO POOLS OF 
           COLOR growing underneath both of them. Bit by bit, the 
           circles widen, transforming the cracked stone back to 
           GLEAMING MARBLE.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        What is that?

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I don’t know.

           Moving quickly now, the circles of color join, then SWEEP 
           OVER THE TERRACE, restoring it to its former beauty in 
           mere moments.

           And that’s not all that’s changed. As the dragon CRANES 
           ITS NECK to see its side, it realizes:

                                 DRAGON
                        My scales are gone!

           The dragon’s squirrel-fir is FULL, LUSTROUS, practically 
           shimmering in the light. No sign of its scales.

           The line of color can be seen RACING TOWARD THE HORIZON 
           NOW, transforming everything in its path. Grass SPRINGS 
           UP from the ground, trees BURST INTO FLOWER as bit by 
           bit, the entire world REGAINS THE COLOR IT LOST. If 
           possible, it looks even more LUSH than before.

           For a moment all the four of them can do is STARE IN 
           SHOCK. The dragon is the first to speak:

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        It’s the magic. It’s back. 

           The dragon LIFTS OFF FROM THE TERRACE, grinning joyfully.

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        I’m healed!

           As the last light of the setting sun turns orange, 
           casting a GOLDEN GLOW over everything:

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about the whole wanting to kill you 
                        thing. If you ever come to Draconia, I 
                        promise to make it up to you. I’m in the 
                        book under Dragon. Actually we all are. 
                        It gets pretty confusing, but you’ll 
                        figure it out.
           And then, with a final GUST, the dragon FLIES OFF TOWARD 
           THE SUNSET, leaving the three of them alone. 

           They watch it go in silence for a moment. Then:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You know what I just realized? I just 
                        rescued not one, but two maidens from a 
                        dragon. Eat that, tapestry.

                                 WINNIFRED
                        You had a little help. 

                                 GENERICA
                        Who did what isn’t important.
                                (beat)
                        Although I did play a pretty big part. 

                                 NORWOOD (O.S.)
                        What’s happening out there?

           They turn to see Norwood tentatively peeking his head 
           around the doorway.

                                 NORWOOD (CONT’D)
                        Is it gone?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s gone.

                                 NORWOOD
                        Will there still be a wedding?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No.

           Turning to Winnifred with a smile:

                                 PRESCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But there will be an adventure.

                                                              FADE TO:

           EXT. CASTLE LAWN - DAY

           The same CROWD OF POSITANIANS we saw before the wedding 
           has turned out to see Prescott and Winnifred off on their 
           first quest. 
           INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME

           Prescott and Winnifred wait in the shade of the entry 
           hall. They’re about to step through the doors when--

                                 GENERICA (O.S.)
                        Wait, wait, wait!

           Generica runs up to them and launches into a FLURRY OF 
           ACTIVITY, arranging Winnifred’s hair so that it’s just 
           so, rubbing out smudges on their shiny armor, then 
           SLAPPING PRESCOTT ON THE BACK SO HE STANDS UP STRAIGHT.

                                 GENERICA (CONT’D)
                        What did we just talk about? Posture!

                                 PRESCOTT
                        But--

                                 GENERICA
                        But nothing. This is why you hired me. 
                        Now go on, while you still look vaguely 
                        like future rulers.

           Prescott turns to Winnifred. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Do you want to decide which direction to 
                        take? You know how I am with maps.  

                                 WINNIFRED
                        I have a feeling adventure will find us 
                        no matter where we go. 

           Prescott and Winnifred smile at each other before, hand 
           in hand, they STEP OUT INTO THE LIGHT.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. BLACK FOREST

           An illustration in the Grimms’ book depicts the same 
           scene in gold. 

                                 WILHELM (V.O.)
                        So here’s how the story ends.

                                 JACOB (V.O.)
                                (irritated)
                        I’ll finish it.

                                 WILHELM (V.O.)
                        Fine. Go ahead.
           REVEAL Wilhelm and Jacob standing over the book, watching 
           as the unseen hand finishes writing the story.

                                 JACOB
                                (reading)
                        “Each girl would sleep on a stack of 
                        featherbeds, and she who was delicate 
                        enough to feel the pea they placed 
                        underneath would be the one he should 
                        marry. Sure enough, only one maiden 
                        passed the test, and it was she who won 
                        the heart of the prince.” 

                                 WILHELM
                        Of course a lot of other stuff happened 
                        along the way. Stuff that didn’t quite 
                        fit the usual fairy tale mold.

                                 JACOB
                        But that’s what makes it a good story. 

                                 WILHELM
                        One of our best. 

           The pen finishes with those immortal words:

           And they both lived happily ever after. 

                                       THE END
