           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           CLOSE ON a TRIPLE SPIRAL incised in stone -- a TRISKELE. 

           It hangs around the neck of BOUDICCA (35), her eyes closed, 
           face streaked with cerulean paint, on her back in the snow. 

           She could be an angel ascending to Heaven, when --

           Her eyes fly open, as if waking from a dream, in time to see 
           a pilum (javelin) HURLING toward her from that very Heaven --

           She rolls over. The spear PLUNGES into the snow, inches from 
           her head --

                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK, WHITE TEXT:

           In the first century AD...

           Like a vacuum, a primal SCREAM draws us back to --

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RESUME

           Boudicca scrambles to her feet, YANKS her spear from the 
           stomach of a DEAD ROMAN SOLDIER and turns to face --

           A beastly battle and macabre phantasmagoria: CELTIC WARRIORS 
           with tattoos that spare little flesh, some wearing ANIMAL 
           HEADS, versus armored ROMAN LEGIONARIES.

           A ROMAN SOLDIER careens toward Boudicca, sword raised. They 
           CLASH, steel against wood -- 

                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK, WHITE TEXT:

           Rome invaded Briton.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RESUME

           In a sequence of QUICK CUTS, Boudicca disarms the Roman, 
           brandishes a curved blade falcata and CLEAVES his helmet in 
           two. Off the fireworks of BLOOD and BRAINS --

                                                    CUT TO BLACK.
           OVER BLACK, WHITE TEXT:

           Led by a woman...

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RESUME

           Boudicca looks over her shoulder, blood melting off her 
           animal fat-greased face.

           The carnage around her reaches an operatic crescendo, flesh 
           SIZZLES, blood escapes like folds of red silk, bodies arch, 
           slump, whirl and fall, like a stirring, frenetic ballet.

           Boudicca hikes her weapons and rushes headlong into the fray.

                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK, WHITE TEXT:

           Briton rebelled.

                                                         FADE TO:

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           A CHILD’s bare feet move through underbrush. CLOSE ON her 
           face, the feral eyes we know. This is BOUDICCA, age eight. 

                                                          CUT TO:

           We watch Boudicca from the cover of a tree trunk, as she 
           walks, clutching berries. We start moving toward her, when --

           Boudicca stops. Turns. She drops her berries and scrambles 
           for a STICK, at which point we see --

           ÁEDÁN (”Aidan”) (10) -- if the blue eyes won’t kill you, what 
           he’s holding will. A STICK-FIGHT ensues. Boudicca’s 
           aggressive, scrappy. Áedán spares no mercy. THWAP! Boudicca 
           renders Áedán weaponless. He takes off into the trees.

           Boudicca catches her breath, then jogs in pursuit. She hears 
           rustling and slows, creeps toward a tree trunk. She prepares 
           to give Áedán a fright, when --

           A MAN stumbles out, an arrow through his neck.

           He opens his mouth to speak. Blood SPRAYS on Boudicca’s face -
           - she SCREAMS. The man falls. His body is covered in the same 
           curvilinear tattoos of the Celtic warriors from our opening.

           Áedán JUMPS out of a nearby tree, races to Boudicca. They 
           exchange equally harrowed looks, then take off. Find them --
           EXT. HILLCREST - DAY

           At a crest overlooking a village, which is under Roman siege. 

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ve got to go down.

           Boudicca starts, but Áedán grabs her arm, stops her.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Not you.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        What do you think you’ll do that I 
                        can’t?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        It’s not I think you can’t, just 
                        don’t want to see you dead.

           This pisses Boudicca off, but it’s kind of romantic.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Go on, then.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Thought you’d say you don’t want to 
                        see me dead, either.

           Boudicca pushes past Áedán. He follows. Below, thick smoke 
           from the burning dwellings mercifully occludes the carnage. 
           So we plunge into it --

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - DAY

           A Roman spatha SEVERS the head of an ICENI VILLAGER. Others 
           are HACKED with axes and stabbed with pugiones. FLAMING 
           ARROWS pierce the ROUNDHOUSES and send them up in flames. 

           The Iceni wear wool or linen tunics, armor-less against the 
           chain-mailed Romans.

           INT. ICENI ROUNDHOUSE

           BOUDICCA’S FATHER (40) distributes weapons to ICENI MEN. 

                                 BOUDICCA’S FATHER
                        Consecrate my sword and strengthen 
                        the arm that wields it. Make fear a 
                        stranger and bless me as you send 
                        my soul to battle.

           At his nod, the Iceni pour out of the dwelling --
           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE

           Boudicca’s Father HACKS a RIDER’s leg in two, RIDER tumbles.

           Boudicca and Áedán creep through the chaos, ducking behind 
           dwellings. Boudicca spots her Father through the smoke, 
           SEVERING a Roman’s head. Two Romans descend upon him. 

           Boudicca DASHES for her Father. Áedán sees a Roman riding for 
           Boudicca and RACES after her. The Roman raises his sword --

           Boudicca stops and watches, as her Father is SPEARED through 
           the stomach. He falls to his knees. The other Roman circles 
           him, brings his bowstring to her Father’s hairline and RAKES 
           it across her Father’s skull, SCALPING him.

           The noise DROPS OUT and we hold on Boudicca’s face, blood-
           spattered, imprinting the grisly image, as the violence plays 
           out in ethereal SLOW MOTION around her.

           Her Father falls, cheek to the mud. With the final flicker of 
           life in his eyes, he bids his daughter farewell.

           SMASH BACK to real time. Áedán TACKLES Boudicca, right as the 
           Roman brings down his sword -- into nothing. The force of the 
           blow sends the Roman FLYING over his horse’s head.

           Áedán SHOVES Boudicca behind a dead horse. They huddle, as 
           the screams of the fearful fade to the moans of the dying.

           EXT. ICENI BURIAL SITE - MORNING

           Boudicca stands beside her MOTHER. Her eyes are diaphanous, 
           vacant, reflecting FLAMES. She’s staring at a PYRE atop which 
           her Father’s body burns. Across the field, there are dozens.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                        A strong hand ends up dead as a 
                        weak one, just sooner.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He were brave.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                        He were prideful, lass. There’s a 
                        difference.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He hadn’t a choice but to fight. 
                        Saw it with my own eyes.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                        See these men.

           Boudicca looks out at the numerous SURVIVING ICENI MEN.
                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        All they did was raise their hands. 
                        And mercy they were granted.

           Boudicca sheds a tear.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        There, I knew you had a soft heart.

           INT. BOUDICCA’S CHILDHOOD DWELLING - NIGHT

           Boudicca lies next to her snoring mother, her eyes closed.

           Above her head is a cutout WINDOW, through which a TWIG 
           emerges. The twig is released and falls on Boudicca’s face --

           Her eyes open -- she catches the twig, lightening reflexes.

           Attached to the twig is a scrap of LINEN bound by a piece of 
           grass. She opens the scrap. It’s a drawing of a YEW TREE.

           EXT. BOUDICCA’S CHILDHOOD DWELLING - MOMENTS LATER

           Boudicca makes a dash through the slumbering village.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ICENI VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Boudicca arrives at a YEW TREE, its branches tangled like a 
           Gordian knot. She looks around. Silence. Then --

           Áedán descends from the tree -- Boudicca instinctively HITS 
           him -- hard. He staggers, clutching his head.

           Boudicca LAUGHS, covers her mouth. Áedán shrugs it off.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (in my defense)
                        A lass couldn’t tell if you want to 
                        kiss or kill her.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Want neither from a lass with an 
                        arm like that.

           Boudicca’s mouth puckers in a tiny pout. Áedán approaches, 
           extends his hand and unfurls a stone with a triskele carved 
           in it -- the one around Boudicca’s neck in our opening.

           Boudicca takes the stone and admires it. She lifts her eyes 
           to Áedán and curls her fingers around the stone.
           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - MONTHS LATER

           The triskele is fashioned into a necklace on Boudicca. She’s 
           washing furs beside her Mother, who’s stringing them up.

           Suddenly, an arrow SEVERS the clothes line. The furs fall. 
           Mother spins around, sees Áedán, a ways off, with a bow and 
           arrow. She storms after him. Boudicca grins.

           Áedán scampers up the roof of a dwelling and hops off the 
           ledge, evading Mother at every turn, until he reaches 
           Boudicca. He grabs her hand, and they run straight into --

           Two horses carrying the ICENI CHIEF and his son, PRASUTAGUS 
           (15). Boudicca’s Mother catches up, grabs Boudicca by the 
           ear. Prasutagus, an anemic, awkward boy, stares at Boudicca.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                        They'll be out of your way, Chief.

                                 ICENI CHIEF
                        Just the boy. We were lookin’ for 
                        the girl.

           Mother releases Boudicca, grabs Áedán by the ear instead.

                                 ICENI CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        What’re you called, lass?

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                          (off silence)
                        Boudicca.

                                 ICENI CHIEF
                        This is my son, Prasutagus. He’s 
                        just come of age. He needs a wife.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                        A princess, then?

                                 ICENI CHIEF
                        Aye. And a queen in time.

           Boudicca’s Mother brushes the hair from Boudicca’s face.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                        Sweet girl, is she. 
                          (re: Áedán)
                        This one brings out the worst in 
                        her. Go on then, this don’t concern 
                        you.

           She SWATS Áedan. He jogs off.

                                 ICENI CHIEF
                        My son would be honored to take 
                        your daughter as his wife.
                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER
                        My daughter would be honored to 
                        serve him. Wouldn’t you, lass?

           Boudicca’s watching Áedán. Her Mother forcibly turns her 
           head. Prasutagus offers a smile. Boudicca doesn’t return it.

                                 BOUDICCA’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        All in time.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. COAST OF BRITON - DAY

           A bare foot discerns a foothold on crumbling rocks. The 
           muscles of a sinuous arm contract as the climber ascends a 
           monolithic precipice rising out of turquoise water.

           Atop the cliff, a white STALLION paces haughtily.

           The climber is the Boudicca of our opening (35). Around her 
           neck are three GOLD RINGS, the sign of royalty.

           The stallion freezes, eyes translucent, ears cocked.

           Boudicca pulls herself over the ledge. She approaches 
           gingerly, extends her hand before the stallion’s nose.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        There...

           She grabs the reins and draws them over his head, absolving 
           the horse of his fear, then MOUNTS. Suddenly --

           The CAW of an EAGLE overhead rings out. The horse SPOOKS, 
           backs up. Rocks skitter off. His hooves tempt the abyss. 

           Boudicca rubs his neck with a hand, as she watches the eagle 
           circle, her eyes telling us, this is somehow meaningful.

           She digs her heels. He LURCHES forward, and they’re off.

           ESTABLISHING - ICENI VILLAGE - DAY

           The village has grown. More roundhouse dwellings, more 
           people. Horses, big and small, graze on the feathery grass. 

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE

           Boudicca rides through the village, observing the 
           industrious, jovial people. She halts the stallion. It REARS.

           Boudicca clings to the horse’s neck. He comes back to earth. 
           Boudicca looks up, finds the source of his bravado: a MARE.
                                 ÁEDÁN (O.S.)
                        Don’t deny the man.

           Boudicca sees Áedán, now 37, who has grown into a wickedly 
           handsome, roguish man. He’s covered in tattoos.

                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        She’s a beauty.

           He mounts the mare.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Denial makes a man dutiful.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        And what of a man’s duty?

           Áedán WHISTLES. From inside his roundhouse emerges a DARK-
           HAIRED WOMAN, covering her naked body in a fur.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I see you’re branching out.

           Boudicca rides off. Áedán watches her go, and his cocky smile 
           turns into a look of pain. He’s still in love with her.

                                 DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
                        Where you goin’?

           Áedán ignores the Woman, gallops off.

           EXT. ELSHA’S ROUNDHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Boudicca dismounts. A lithe boy called JUDOC (16), a servant, 
           takes the horse by the reins and bows.

                                 JUDOC
                        Another fine stud, my Queen. 
                        What’ll you call him?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Pain in my arse.

           Also outside the dwelling is a man we’ll learn is ELSHA’S 
           HUSBAND, pacing, a response to agonizing MOANS from inside.

                                 ELSHA’S HUSBAND
                        I’ve heard men die in more peace’n 
                        that.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Best your wife don’t hear you say 
                        that.

           Boudicca enters the roundhouse, where:
           INT. ELSHA’S ROUNDHOUSE

           ELSHA (25), tall, fair, has just given birth to a BOY.

                                 ELSHA
                        You better be a decent man, ‘cause 
                        I’m never doin’ that again.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Head that big, I reckon he’s 
                        cleared a channel. Next one’ll fall 
                        right out.

           The MIDWIFE cleans the baby. Boudicca moves to Elsha’s side.

                                 ELSHA
                        Be lucky my husband can find 
                        pleasure enough in a channel to 
                        make one.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        A man’ll find pleasure in a sheep, 
                        you tell him it’ll bear him a son.

                                 ELSHA
                        Still tryin’ for one yourself?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        The Chief’s illness makes it hard. 
                        Not in a good way.
                          (facile smile)
                        All in time.

           The Midwife hands Elsha her baby. Boudicca gazes upon the 
           union, reminiscing on her own...

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE - EVENING

           Boudicca removes her necklaces and places them in a box. She 
           brushes past the triskele necklace, goes to touch it, when --

                                 CLÍONA (O.S.)
                        Hair’s gettin’ dry, Mum. Brush it 
                        like that, you tear it loose.

           Boudicca shuts the box.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Can’t have you bald, can we?

           She grabs a comb and works through her daughter CLÍONA (10)’s 
           hair. MÁIRE (15) is plaiting her own. 

                                 MÁIRE
                        I’ll not have any left myself, that 
                        servant boy keeps tuggin’ at it.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        You know what that means, don’t 
                        you?

                                 MÁIRE
                        That he’s stupid.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Means he’s keen on you.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Then he ought to kiss me.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You’re a bit young to be kissin’.

                                 MÁIRE
                        One to talk, you married Da when 
                        you were younger’n me.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Married don’t mean you’re kissin’.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Then what’s the point of doin’ it?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Sometimes you haven’t a choice.

                                 MÁIRE
                        You didn’t choose to marry Da?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He chose to marry me. And that’s 
                        how it should be.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Do you love him?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Love him dearly.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Then why aren’t you kissin’?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He’s not well, your Da, and kissin’ 
                        takes strength. Saves all his for 
                        the pair of you.

           Máire smiles, reassured. Boudicca sighs, dodged a bullet. She 
           notices Clíona is playing with a COIN.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Who gave you that?

                                 CLÍONA
                        Máire did.
           Máire turns sharply.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Fool, that was a secret!

           Boudicca takes the coin.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Where’d you find this, Máire?

                                 MÁIRE
                        Ways out.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        How far?

                                 MÁIRE
                        Be cross if I tell you.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I will not, promise. Done far worse 
                        at your age.

                                 MÁIRE
                          (beat)
                        By the mountains.

           Off Boudicca, this news concerning, we find her:

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Boudicca takes a seat on the bed beside her feeble husband 
           Prasutagus, now 42. A hybrid WOLFDOG is curled at his feet.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Máire found this today.

                                 PRASUTAGUS
                        Roman, is it?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        What’re they doin’ here? Thought 
                        you made a deal with ‘em.

                                 PRASUTAGUS
                        I did. We pay tithes in exchange 
                        for our peace. Must be another 
                        tribe they’re visitin’. Not all 
                        have submitted.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        They haven’t submitted, it’s a 
                        wonder they’re still standin’.

                                 PRASUTAGUS
                        Claudius has softened in his age.
           Boudicca crawls into bed, at a distance from her husband.

           INT. ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE - NIGHT

           EMPEROR CLAUDIUS (64) sits beside AGRIPPINA (45), a sovereign 
           beauty, watching a theatre performance on a stage below.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        This is my favorite part.

           He squeezes Agrippina’s hand. On the stage below, the ACTORS 
           begin cavorting. Claudius smiles like a child.

           Agrippina responds synthetically, turns a porcelain cheek.

           A SERVANT arrives with two GOLDEN CHALICES, hands one to 
           Agrippina, one to Claudius. Claudius takes a sip.

           Moments later, he starts COUGHING. He drops his chalice. His 
           hand moves to his throat. His eyes bulge. He’s choking.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        The servant! Get that servant! 

           Blood pours from Claudius’s mouth, nose and eyes. Agrippina 
           puts Claudius’s head in her lap and watches helplessly, as 
           the life drains from her husband’s eyes.

           INT. FORUM ROMANUM - DAY

           TIGHT ON a MASK (an imagine), Claudius’s face immortalized.

           In the front row of the audience, Agrippina is stoic. Behind 
           her, thousands of ROMANS are packed in the marketplace.

           HIRED MOURNERS wail and tear at their hair. CLOWNS in lurid 
           makeup or avian masks are rendered humorless.

           NERO (17) ascends to the speaker’s platform. He bows 
           reverently over the body, then turns to address the crowd:

                                 NERO
                        Woe’s me, that all goodness should 
                        be so short-lived.

           In the audience, a slight smile crawls across Agrippina’s 
           lips, as she gazes upon her son, at last, Emperor.

           INT. DOMUS NERO - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Nero sits at the head of a table, feet resting on it, picking 
           at a WOOL BALL. To Nero’s left is SENECA (60), his tutor.

                                 AGRIPPINA (O.S.)
                        Darling.
           Agrippina brings Nero’s attention to seven ADVISORS seated.

                                 AGRIPPINA (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you have an opinion on the 
                        plans for your Empire’s conquest.

           Nero swings his legs down, lurches forward.

                                 NERO
                        What lands are mine?

           The CHIEF ADVISOR proffers a map of Rome’s territory.

                                 CHIEF ADVISOR
                        To the north, our border is the 
                        Rhine. East, the Euphrates River, 
                        South, we’re nearly to Arabia, and 
                        West, we are working our way 
                        through Briton. If I may suggest--

                                 NERO
                        Which costs the most? 

                                 TREASURER
                        It’s hard to say, but--

                                 NERO
                        If your job is too hard for you, I 
                        will find someone else to do it.

                                 TREASURER
                        West.

                                 NERO
                        The conquest of Briton is most 
                        costly?

                                 TREASURER
                        Yes.

                                 NERO
                        Abandon it.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        He speaks uninformed. 
                          (to Nero)
                        My son, to abandon the conquest of 
                        Briton would be naive. There is 
                        great wealth to be had from a 
                        kingdom on the water.

           On top of the table, Agrippina reaches for her son’s hand. 
           Under the table, she rubs her foot sensually against a leg -- 
           a leg she thinks is Nero’s, but is Seneca’s. He says nothing.

                                 NERO
                        I have much to learn.
                                 AGRIPPINA
                        May I suggest redoubled efforts in 
                        the conquest of Briton?

                                 NERO
                        Yes.

                                 TREASURER
                        My Lady, there is simply not 
                        enough...

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        You heard the Emperor.

           The Treasurer bites his tongue, nods.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Boudicca slips through the forest. She arrives at the trunk 
           of a thick tree and starts climbing, reaching a TREEHOUSE.

           EXT./INT. DRUIDESS TREEHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Boudicca KNOCKS. Moments later, a DRUIDESS (70) opens. She 
           smiles, creasing wrinkles as deep and thick as bark.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        That’s a face I love to see.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s a wonder you can.

           True enough, her lids almost cover her eyes.

           Boudicca follows the Druidess, in a cape of feathers with 
           whole, DEAD BIRDS adorning each shoulder, into her hovel.

           Decrepit candles and jars of curious elixirs occupy the 
           shelves. A hanging cauldron bubbles over a fire. Bundles of 
           herbs dangle from the ceiling. Boudicca wafts SMOKE.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        So, who is he?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Who?

                                 DRUIDESS
                        The man you’re in love with.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Did I say there was one?

                                 DRUIDESS
                        Didn’t have to, the lines on your 
                        face did.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        Then surely you mean my husband.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        He’s not dead yet?

           The Druidess selects a jar of dark liquid from a shelf and 
           hands it to Boudicca. Boudicca sniffs it. Not bad. She sits.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Nearly.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        So you’ve come to hear what you’ll 
                        do when he’s gone.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Saw an eagle today.

           The Druidess nods. This is meaningful.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        Bow your head.

           Boudicca obliges. The Druidess reaches forward and RIPS a 
           chunk of Boudicca’s hair from her head.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Are you mad?!

                                 DRUIDESS
                        So they tell me.

           She places the hair under a STONE and closes her eyes, 
           receiving a series of impressionistic FLASHES:

           A WOMAN giving birth to a SNAKE.

           TWO FIGURES, one tall, one short, ON FIRE.

           HANDS bound in a strip of white cloth.

           Boudicca’s blood-crusted triskele necklace falling in SLOW 
           MOTION. It hits the snow, imprinting.

           The Druidess opens her eyes, looks shaken.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        So?

                                 DRUIDESS
                        They weren’t clear.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You’ll try again, then, won’t you?
                                 DRUIDESS
                        One mustn’t ask for more’n they’re 
                        given. The images will lie.

           Boudicca chugs the last of her drink, reaching the bottom, 
           then SPITS it everywhere. Inside is a DEAD RAT.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Mad you are, crone!

           Boudicca can’t help but laugh.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        Look like your father when you 
                        laugh.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Then I don’t need rat juice to put 
                        hair on my chest.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        No, that you don’t.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        What’ll I do about the bird?

                                 DRUIDESS
                        Patience.

           Boudicca rises.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I haven’t any of that.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        More’n you know. There are things 
                        you want, you’re waitin’ to claim.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Got two healthy girls and a husband 
                        who loves me. Deep as I can feel, I 
                        want for nothin’.

           Boudicca gives the Druidess a kiss on the head and leaves.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        If only we were all so ignorant.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Áedán pounds a nail into the axle of a wheel affixed to a 
           CHARIOT. Boudicca’s daughter Máire watches from her PONY.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        She’s ready for you.
           Máire dismounts. Áedán rigs the pony to the chariot and holds 
           him still, while Máire climbs aboard.

                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        You promise your mother gave her 
                        blessin’?

                                 MÁIRE
                        She didn’t have to, ‘cause I didn’t 
                        tell her.

           Máire CLUCKS and waves the reins. The pony takes off. Áedán 
           watches, as Máire TEARS across the field.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Just like her, too.

           Áedán’s eyes shift to the horizon, where an ominous line has 
           formed. He WHISTLES, but Máire can’t hear through her WHOOPS.

           The darkness materializes as a mass of SOLDIERS on horseback.

           Áedán mounts his horse and gallops after Máire. Neck and 
           neck, Máire dons a challenging grin and SURGES ahead. 

           Áedán has no choice -- he cuts in front of Máire’s pony, 
           which SKIDS to a halt -- Máire lurches forward.

                                 MÁIRE
                        When I tell Mum you nearly killed 
                        me, she’ll have your head.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Not before she has yours for racin’ 
                        a chariot without askin’. Let’s go.

           Máire sees the soldiers, intuits the urgency, follows Áedán.

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE - DAY

           Boudicca skins a strung up RABBIT. Through the window, she 
           sees Áedán and Máire. She smooths her tunic, her hair.

           Moments later, they enter. Boudicca looks surprised.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Need to see the Chief.

           Boudicca hides her disappointment and shows Áedán to the 
           bedroom, where Prasutagus is in bed, dog curled at his feet.

                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        The Romans are comin’.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        To collect the tithe, as they do.
                                 PRASUTAGUS
                        They’re not due for a fortnight...
                          (then)
                        But we’ve done as they wished. 
                        There’s nothin’ to fear. Greet them 
                        as you would our own.

           Áedán nods, shows himself out. Boudicca catches up.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        How many?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Maybe half a legion.
                          (reading the fear)
                        As your husband said, we’ve done 
                        nothin’ to rattle the cage.

           Áedán leaves. Boudicca’s alone with Máire.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Find your sister, and stay inside.

           Boudicca chases after Áedán, arriving outside in time to see:

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE

           The Romans, led by Governor GAIUS SUETONIUS PAULINAS (40), 
           frigid, blue eyes and black hair, enter the village. 

                                 SUETONIUS
                        I’m looking for Chief Prasutagus.

           Suetonius dismounts. Boudicca steps forward.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He’s ill. Bound to his back.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Who are you?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        His queen.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        In a tunic. Our ladies would sooner 
                        have their own heads.

           Soldiers trade impish smiles. Boudicca stays quiet.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Matters not. Those I’ve come for 
                        are the able-bodied. 
                          (then, for all to hear)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Any and all men able to perform 
                        military duties, are hereby 
                        conscripted into the Roman army, by 
                        order of the Emperor Nero.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We pay you to leave us be.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        There’s a new arse on the throne, 
                        and he wants yours as his men. 
                        Consider it an honor.

                                 ELSHA’S HUSBAND (O.S.)
                        We’ll forego the honor for our 
                        independence.

           The new mother Elsha’s husband steps forward. Elsha stands 
           behind him, holding their baby.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        It’s not a choice.

                                 ELSHA’S HUSBAND
                        Then you’ll have to drag us in 
                        chains.

           Suetonius smiles, then nods to the two SOLDIERS flanking him. 
           They restrain Elsha’s husband. Elsha cuts Boudicca a look. 
           Boudicca gives a subtle motion with her hand, be calm.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        They give us their service, or 
                        their lives.

           Elsha’s husband SPITS on Suetonius. Suetonius draws a DAGGER 
           and THROWS IT into the husband’s forehead. Elsha SCREAMS. 

           Boudicca takes the baby. Elsha sinks to her dying husband.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Find the suitable soldiers.

           The Romans set out, marking the suitable men by dumping WHITE 
           POWDER on their heads, discarding the ELDERLY or HANDICAPPED. 

           A PREGNANT WOMAN fights for a last touch of her HUSBAND.

           Boudicca searches for Áedán. She finds him, just as he’s 
           dusted white. They share a protracted look, until a Roman 
           CLUBS Áedán in the stomach. He willingly walks.

           Off Boudicca, watching the fissure of her tribe, we find:
           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - DAY

           A pair of ROMAN SOLDIERS riding through the village. The 
           Iceni’s new reality is constant surveillance.

           The Romans eye furtively the ICENI WOMEN at work. Boudicca, 
           who’s hanging clothes, avoids eye contact.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Armed with a BOW AND ARROW and a SPEAR, Boudicca rides in 
           front of her daughters, Máire and Clíona.

           In the distance, we see a new addition to the landscape, a 
           ROMAN MILITARY OUTPOST.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Boudicca inserts an arrow in the bow and draws, aimed at a 
           grazing DEER. Máire and Clíona suppress laughter.

           Boudicca releases -- THWAP! Hits a tree. The deer bounds off.

                                 MÁIRE
                        It’s not right, you with a bow.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You’re right, it’s not.

           Boudicca casts down the bow and arrow and picks up the spear. 
           She sets off through the trees. Her daughters stay.

                                 CLÍONA
                        I feel badly for her.

                                 MÁIRE
                        You won’t when we’re starvin’.

           We follow Boudicca through the woods. She finds the deer 
           again, stops, aims her spear...

           Moments later, WITH MÁIRE AND CLÍONA, Boudicca approaches 
           with the deer, dead, slung over her shoulder.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Was always better with a spear.

           LATER

           They make their way back through the woods.

                                 CLÍONA
                        How’d you learn to do that?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        My Da.
                                 CLÍONA
                        How come our Da didn’t show us?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Your Da believes in peace. Knew if 
                        he kept it, there’d never come a 
                        day when his girls had to fend for 
                        themselves.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Then he’s failed in keepin’ it?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He’s a good man, your Da, but good 
                        don’t always work against bad.

           Ahead, Boudicca notices two ROMANS approaching. Their names 
           are LUCIUS (20s, leader) and PRISTUS (20s, follower).

                                 LUCIUS
                        A woman that can hunt?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Took our men, what’d you expect us 
                        to do.

                                 PRISTUS
                        Starve?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Got more will than you thought.

           Lucius eyes Máire lecherously.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Are these your daughters?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Aye. And I’d like to get ‘em home 
                        ‘fore nightfall. If you’ll let us, 
                        we’ll be on our way.

           Boudicca starts. Lucius bars her with his sword to her neck.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Leave the girl or the deer. Your 
                        choice.

           Boudicca slumps the deer on the ground, grabs her girls and 
           takes off, as the haunting harmony of a BONE FLUTE rises...

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Boudicca kneels beside the bed where Prasutagus lies. He’s a 
           husk of a man, withering with each breath.
                                 PRASUTAGUS
                        You’re good.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Only as good as the man I stand 
                        beside.

                                 PRASUTAGUS
                        You’re good to have married me 
                        though you loved another.

           This breaks Boudicca’s heart to hear. She takes his hand.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Love can be learned.

                                 PRASUTAGUS
                        See that our girls are strong and 
                        safe.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Don’t act like you’re not stayin’ 
                        ‘round to help me...

           Alas, Prasutagus takes a final breath. Boudicca pulls the 
           lids over his eyes, lingers on the lifeless visage, then 
           rises to her feet, grabs a candle and pets the dog.

           We follow Boudicca out of the room and into the kitchen, 
           where a SERVANT is cleaning.

                                 SERVANT
                        How’s he farin’?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ll prepare the body in the 
                        mornin’.

           The Servant struggles for words.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        It’s a better place he’s headed.

           Boudicca grabs a bladder of koumiss and heads outside --

           EXT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT

           Where the bone flute melody continues. Boudicca follows the 
           music to its source -- a MANHOLE with a hatch cover. 

           She peers inside at ÓENGUS (”Angus”) (50s), the resident 
           criminal, playing the flute, hands and feet shackled.

           Óengus, his face still in shadow, lowers the flute and 
           shuffles out of sight. Boudicca takes a seat.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        I won’t bite.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        I will.

           Morbidly intrigued, Boudicca dangles the bladder of koumiss 
           in the hatch. Moments later, it’s SNATCHED.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Must be lonely down there.

           Boudicca lowers her face through the hatch to get a look, 
           sees nothing but black. Then --

           Óengus’s face appears -- wild, blue eyes, gnarled, black 
           teeth, and long, matted hair -- brandishing a DAGGER -- he 
           SPITS koumiss through the hatch, spraying Boudicca --

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Be tough to make friends like that.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        We all die alone.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        ‘Spose I’d be as bleak livin’ 
                        underground. 

                                 ÓENGUS
                        What do you want from me?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        An ear.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        It’ll cost you an arm.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        To listen. Women like to chew the 
                        fat.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        It is the best part...

                                 BOUDICCA
                        How long have you been shackled?

                                 ÓENGUS
                        ‘Fore you were a spark in your 
                        father’s eye.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Then you’ve seen the Romans come.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        Aye. And our freedom go.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        My husband’s tried hard to keep it. 
                        It’s the only thing worth livin’ 
                        for.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        It’s whether you’ll die for it, 
                        that means anythin’.

           Off Boudicca, considering these words...

           EXT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE - MORNING

           The sun ripens, bathing the landscape in a red-gold haze.

           Boudicca exits with Prasutagus’s dog on a rope. She leads him 
           around back, kneels, pets his head, then furnishes a KNIFE.

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE

           The harsh light skewers Clíona’s eyes. They flicker open. 
           We’ll notice one is brown and one is blue. She looks out the 
           window, sees Boudicca with the dog and SPRINGS out of bed --

           EXT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE

           She races around back, finds Boudicca with the knife poised. 
           Clíona CASTS herself between Boudicca and the dog. Boudicca 
           GASPS, having nearly stabbed her child.

                                 CLÍONA
                        You can’t kill him.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Someone’s got to keep your Da 
                        company. ‘Less you want to go 
                        yourself.

                                 CLÍONA
                        You’re a savage.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’m a Celt, same’s you. And if you 
                        don’t like that, the Romans would 
                        be happy to have you.

           Clíona strokes the dog’s head, tears welling in her eyes. 
           Boudicca watches, losing her nerve. She holsters the knife.

           EXT. ICENI BURIAL SITE - DAY

           Prasutagus’s shrouded body lies atop a funeral pyre.
           Boudicca ushers Clíona forward. She lays a STRAW DOG at 
           Prasutagus’s feet. Boudicca lights the straw, steps back.

           Boudicca grabs a hand of each of her girls, and in a familiar 
           scene, mother and daughters watch the pyre go up in flames.

           INT. ICENI MEETING ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT

           A BLIND MAN with cloudy eyes presides over a tribal council.

           The villagers part for Boudicca to pass. The Druidess recedes 
           into the crowd. Boudicca makes her way to the front.

                                 BLIND MAN
                        Our hearts are with you, my Queen.

           Boudicca nods, accepting the condolences.

                                 BLIND MAN (CONT’D)
                        As our leader, what’s your course?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I think we’ve all yet lost enough. 
                        Best keep our hands raised and our 
                        heads down, try to live in peace.

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - EVENING

           The Druidess pursues Boudicca.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        That’s not the course.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You said they weren’t clear, the 
                        images.

           The Druidess falls quiet.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        What is it you saw me doin’?

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - DAY

           CORNFLOWERS hang from roundhouses. Children and adults dance 
           to the beat of tree-stump drums and ebullient pan flutes. 

           The servant boy Judoc approaches Máire. She takes off, finds 
           Boudicca, who’s holding Elsha’s baby, looking contemplative.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Boy tuggin’ your hair again?

                                 MÁIRE
                        Won’t let him close enough.
           Boudicca nods toward the dancing crowd.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He’ll be fine without you.

           Máire looks to see Judoc dancing with another YOUNG GIRL.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Traitor.

           Máire finds another YOUNG BOY, drags him into the dance.

                                 ELSHA
                        Even a widow, I don’t miss that.

           Boudicca gazes wistfully at her daughter. She does.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (to Elsha’s baby)
                        Have mercy on the fickleness of 
                        women.

           She hands the baby back to Elsha, then sees:

           Governor Suetonius and two dozen ROMAN SOLDIERS, including 
           the men who took Boudicca’s deer in the forest, Lucius and 
           Pristus, ride through the village.

           Boudicca moves into the dancing crowd and interrupts Máire.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Get your sister and go to the 
                        Druidess.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Can you see I’m dancin’?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Now.

           Máire sees the urgency, obeys. Boudicca confronts Suetonius.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Governor.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        I suppose I can’t say “queen,” 
                        considering your king is no more.
                        I bring the condolences of the 
                        Emperor.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’m humbled to be in his thoughts.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        He has sent me to ensure the 
                        transition is comfortable.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ve had chiefs die before. Burn 
                        the body, crown a new one.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        This will be different. The death 
                        of a client-king ends the 
                        relationship. The client-king’s 
                        property is handed over to the 
                        client. In this case, the Emperor.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        My husband left his kingdom to his 
                        daughters.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Roman law forbids a woman to 
                        inherit. As citizens of property 
                        now owned by the Roman Empire, you 
                        are subject to those laws.

           Suetonius motions with his hand. 

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Take everything.

           His soldiers disperse, entering dwellings, exiting with 
           armfuls of belongings -- WEAPONS, SHIELDS, POTTERY, BRONZE 
           ARTWORK -- they load the loot into wagons.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        What good’s a subject if he hasn’t 
                        the means to survive?

                                 SUETONIUS
                        A barbarian is resourceful. You’ll 
                        start new.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        So you can strip us again?

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Silence her.

           Two SOLDIERS restrain Boudicca. She struggles, gets BASHED in 
           the ribs, doubles over.

           BEHIND BOUDICCA’S DWELLING

           Máire and Clíona mount Máire’s pony and set off.

           WITH BOUDICCA

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (to Suetonius)
                        Another man moves your hand. What’s 
                        your wife think of that?
           The Soldier SOCKS Boudicca in the jaw. She spits blood.

           We follow another Roman into:

           INT. ICENI ROUNDHOUSE

           A Soldier unfastens his pants and advances toward the 
           Pregnant Woman whose husband was taken from her. She grabs a 
           chalice and THROWS IT at his head. The Roman draws a dagger.

           OUTSIDE -- a harrowing SCREAM.

           INT. MANHOLE

           Óengus, the shackled criminal, listens to the chaos unfolding 
           above. He moves underneath the hatch and waits, until a ROMAN 
           SOLDIER treads right on top of the hatch -- 

           Óengus SEIZES the Roman’s foot and JERKS his leg through the 
           hatch hole. He starts GNAWING at the leg like a lamb shank.

           The Roman SCREAMS. Óengus shoves the leg back through the 
           hatch, his mouth filled with flesh, face dripping with blood, 
           as ABOVE GROUND, the Roman LIMPS off, terrified.

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE

           Lucius and Pristus are looting. Prasutagus’s dog follows, 
           BARKING. Lucius STABS the dog in the neck. He WHIMPERS, 
           slinks off to die, when --

           Pristus alerts Lucius to the window, through which we see: 
           the horse galloping off with Máire and Clíona.

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE

           Boudicca is battered, greasy with blood, eyes barely open. 
           The Soldiers cast her to the ground. 

           Boudicca slowly draws a DAGGER from her tunic. She FLIPS 
           OVER, STABS Suetonius’s leg -- he staggers. The Soldiers 
           return and KICK THE SHIT out of her.

           Lucius and Pristus drag Máire and Clíona before Suetonius. 

                                 LUCIUS
                        Her daughters.

           We’ll notice a moment’s hesitation in Suetonius, before evil 
           eclipses any shred of a conscience.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Proceed.
           The Soldiers drag Boudicca to her feet, as Máire and Clíona 
           are fastened to STAKES.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Take it all, but please, take mercy 
                        on my kin.

           A Roman forces Boudicca’s swollen eyes open, to watch, as:

           Lucius and Pristus brandish FLAGELLA and FLOG Máire and 
           Clíona repeatedly.

           Boudicca THRASHES, SCREAMING with notes she’s never used. 

           Tears crest her swollen cheekbone, carve channels through the 
           blood and slip into the crease of her lips. The tears pool in 
           the crease, then trickle onto her chin, down her throat. Her 
           neck vibrates, as another harrowing SCREAM sprays blood.

           The girls’ tunics are stained red. Clíona’s head is hung, 
           she’s barely breathing.

           Suetonius crouches before Boudicca.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        It’s a good thing Da wasn’t here to 
                        see this.

           He stands, summons his soldiers and the wagons.

           As the Romans retreat, Iceni villagers emerge from their 
           roundhouses in a stupor and survey the damage. 

           Boudicca scrambles toward her daughters and tears at Clíona’s 
           restraints until she falls into Boudicca’s arms.

           Boudicca holds Clíona’s head in her lap, fighting the 
           imminence of her daughter’s death with gentle rocks and 
           strokes. At last, Clíona fades. Boudicca’s refusal to believe 
           lingers, a mother’s desperation, until --

           Máire kneels before Boudicca, forces her to meet her gaze. 
           Boudicca stares vacantly through Máire, cradling Cliona’s 
           head, in a place beyond grief, her eyes a hollow cast.

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE - MORNING

           A SERIES OF CUTS IN SLOW MOTION:

           Boudicca removes her gold necklaces.

           Boudicca slips the triskele necklace over her head.

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - MORNING

           Boudicca, barefoot, walks through the village, a ghost-town.
           She climbs atop the meeting roundhouse. Villagers alert each 
           other. She begins, shakily:

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Last I stood before you, I ordered 
                        the course I’ve long been told was 
                        right. Today I stand before you, to 
                        say it’s not the one I’ll take.
                          (beat)
                        I do not stand before you a queen.
                        I do not stand before you a willin’ 
                        subject, nor even a subject willin’ 
                        to compromise to survive. I stand 
                        before you a woman, my body cut by 
                        the lash of a tyrant, my heart sick 
                        from the injury to my people, and 
                        my soul crushed by the loss of our 
                        freedom. 
                          (beat)
                        We’re worthy of livin’ as we are, 
                        and to do that, we’ll fight. I call 
                        upon you, to show the Romans we 
                        don’t accept them as our leaders, 
                        and we won’t live under their yoke. 
                        I ask you to join me, in reclaimin’ 
                        what they’ve taken and makin’ so 
                        fearful the idea of tryin’ again, 
                        that they run back to Rome in a 
                        trail of piss and tears, ruein’ the 
                        day they brandished a sword against 
                        a Celt.

           Silence. Then, slowly, a chant of “Boudicca” begins. Another 
           voice joins. And another, until --

           It’s a thunderous echo, honoring Boudicca as the Celts’ new 
           leader and rebellion against the Romans as their fight.

           EXT. ROCKY OVERPASS - DAY

           Boudicca and Elsha pick their way down a rocky mountain on 
           horseback. Elsha’s baby is strapped to her back.

                                 ELSHA
                        You know how the last meetin’ we 
                        had with this tribe ended?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We need numbers.

                                 ELSHA
                        Numbers that’ll kill you sort of 
                        cancel the numbers out, don’t they?
                                 BOUDICCA
                        It was men we sent. Women have a 
                        way of makin’ people more 
                        agreeable.

                                 ELSHA
                        Plan to bed the Chief, do you?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        That’s what I brought you for.

           The landscape opens up to reveal hundreds of PYRES burning.

           EXT. TRINOVANTES VILLAGE - DAY

           Boudicca and Elsha enter the decimated village. TRINOVANTES 
           VILLAGERS move mechanically, almost trance-like, until they 
           see the intruders. They alert each other. 

           Boudicca and Elsha raise their hands. A Trinovantes elder, 
           ULA (50), her face as creased as a turtle, missing teeth, 
           approaches. Boudicca and Elsha dismount.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’ve come to speak to your Chief.

                                 ULA
                        He’s dead. Who are you?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        The leader of the Iceni.

                                 ULA
                        I’d cut you down, but I haven’t any 
                        axe to do it.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        They’ve done to us what they’ve 
                        done to you. 

           Ula regards Boudicca’s bruised face.

                                 ULA
                        If you’ve come for pity, you have 
                        it.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’ve come for help. I’m fightin’ 
                        the Romans, and I need numbers. 

                                 ULA
                        Even if I was willin’ to sacrifice 
                        my people to your cause, they’ve 
                        taken all my able warriors. 

           Boudicca regards the dozens of TRINOVANTES WOMEN.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        I see plenty.

                                 ULA
                        They couldn’t swing an axe to save 
                        their life, let alone take one.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Won’t be swingin’ what we haven’t 
                        any left of.

           Boudicca picks up a ROCK.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Name me a woman who hasn’t thrown 
                        one of these at her husband.

           The Trinovantes Women stifle laughter. Ula holds a stoic 
           face. Off Boudicca’s smile, undeniable --

           EXT. CATUVELLAUNI VILLAGE - DAY

           The CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF (40) gazes from a distance at Boudicca 
           and Elsha approaching. (Note: each tribe has a defining 
           pattern and color of tattoos.)

           Behind him, the village is bustling. Dwellings are intact. 
           Crop fields stretch for acres. GOATS and SHEEP graze freely. 
           SILVER MINES are in full operation, producing ROMAN COINS, 
           like the one Clíona had.

           This tribe has been untouched by the Romans.

           The Chief hands his DAUGHTER (5) to his WIFE and summons a 
           fellow CATUVELLAUNI WARRIOR. They mount horses.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF CATUVELLAUNI VILLAGE

           Boudicca and Elsha halt. The Chief circles Boudicca.

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF
                        What do you want?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        To speak of our common enemy.

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF
                        Our only enemy is the savage who 
                        threatens Rome.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        What’ve they threatened you with to 
                        say that?

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF
                        Money.
                                 ELSHA
                        They’re tradin’ for the Romans.

           Elsha nods to the crop fields.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        They’re slaves.

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF
                        A slave’ll live to see his children 
                        grown.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        And grown, they'll see their father 
                        isn’t a man, but a coward.

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF
                        Usin’ reason don’t make a man a 
                        coward. But then, as a woman, what 
                        would you know about reason?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s ‘cause you’re a man you fear 
                        the shame of failin’. As a mother, 
                        you haven’t the choice.

           Boudicca spurs her horse.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        When you change your mind, come 
                        find me. Name’s Boudicca.

           Boudicca wheels her horse around, Elsha follows. The Chief 
           watches them go.

                                 OTHER CATUVELLAUNI
                        Who is she?

           The Catuvellauni Chief spits, shrugs.

           ESTABLISHING - ROMAN MILITARY OUTPOST - DAY

           A lanky, square, stick-framed outpost. Towers rise from each 
           of the four corners. Each is armed with TOWER GUARDS. 

           EXT. ROMAN MILITARY OUTPOST

           A Tower Guard holds a scope to his eye, sees:

           A WAGON driven by Elsha, filled with six “VIRGINS” (18-20) 
           and Boudicca, whose hands are raised in surrender.

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE - INTERCUT

           Boudicca sits with Elsha and the Virgins, addresses them:
                                 BOUDICCA
                        My Da once showed me...

           INT. BOUDICCA’S CHILDHOOD DWELLING - FLASHBACK

           Boudicca helps her mother knead bread, when she sees her 
           Father, hiding behind a corner, summoning her in secret.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I have to wee.

           Mother tosses her head, go. Father disappears. Boudicca 
           follows. Behind the corner, Father furnishes a LEATHER 
           SCROLL. He lets Boudicca untie and unroll it, revealing -- 

           A territory MAP, with shapes and lines and arrows.

                                 BOUDICCA (V.O.)
                         Romans make pictures of our land.

           EXT. ROMAN MILITARY OUTPOST - RESUME

           The Tower Guards raise bows. ENTRY GUARDS raise swords.

                                 ENTRY GUARD 1
                        Approach on foot.

           Boudicca dismounts and approaches, her hands still raised.

                                 ENTRY GUARD 1 (CONT’D)
                        Kneel and bow your head.

           Boudicca obeys.

                                 BOUDICCA (V.O.)
                        He called it a map.

           ENTRY GUARD 2 studies Boudicca --

                                 ENTRY GUARD 2
                        It’s the one who stabbed the 
                        Governor.

                                 ENTRY GUARD 1
                        What is your business?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I bring an apology for the trouble 
                        I caused. 
                          (points behind her)
                        Virgins.

           The Guards trade a look and a nod.

                                 ENTRY GUARD 1
                        Rise.
           Boudicca boards the wagon. They’re permitted through, into --

           INT. ROMAN MILITARY OUTPOST

           An open-air fortress with TENTS lining the walls.

                                 BOUDICCA (V.O.)
                        We’ll need one, to show us what 
                        they’ve claimed...

           Boudicca and Elsha ride into the clearing and halt.

           ROMAN SOLDIERS LEER, lick their lips. Boudicca climbs out and 
           walks around the back, as we notice --

           The virgins discreetly affixing lead pebbles in SLINGSHOTS.

           Boudicca opens the wagon hatch, gives a look to the virgins.

                                 BOUDICCA (V.O.)
                        And what we’re takin’ back.

           BING! BING! The slingshots start firing. A pebble embeds 
           between a Tower Guard’s eyes. His armor glints in the sun, as 
           he cartwheels to his death.

           The ground soldiers take up arms. Others emerge from tents.

           Elsha whips the horses. They surge, FLY around the square, 
           the virgins WHIPPING soldiers, clothes-lining them with logs.

           In the cover of the chaos, Boudicca creeps through a corridor 
           formed by the tents, when SOLDIERS appear from another one --

           Boudicca DUCKS behind another. The soldiers pass.

           She moves on, passing tents with the silhouettes of figures, 
           until she finds an empty one and slips inside. She rummages 
           through the belongings, nothing of interest. Then --

           From outside, she hears:

                                 ROMAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Yes, Commander.

           Boudicca peers out, sees the tent the soldier emerged from. 
           Boudicca waits a beat, then makes a dash for it.

           THE COMMANDER’S TENT

           The COMMANDER hastily stashes valuables in a box. Boudicca 
           appears at the entry -- he sees her, brandishes a DAGGER --

           Boudicca furnishes an ANTLER and approaches. A table 
           separates them. Behind Boudicca, from the entry --
           ANOTHER ROMAN SOLDIER appears, sees the stand-off --

           Boudicca turns sideways, an eye on each threat, as the Roman 
           closes in on her, also wielding a dagger. He RUSHES her --

           She DIVES under the table --

           The Roman’s force LAUNCHES him over the table -- the 
           Commander side-steps, but --

           UNDERNEATH THE TABLE, Boudicca has PIERCED his Achilles 
           tendon with the antler like a knitting needle. She YANKS it 
           toward her -- the Commander TRIPS forward --

           The other Roman FLIPS over the table -- a manual struggle 
           ensues --

           Meanwhile, the Commander grasps for his dagger --

           Boudicca wrangles the Roman’s dagger from his grip, when --

           The Commander gets to his knees, raises the dagger to bury it 
           in Boudicca’s back -- his arm comes down like a hammer, as --

           Boudicca HEAVES the Roman on top of her, trading places -- 
           the Commander’s knife sinks into the Roman’s back.

           Boudicca casts the Roman off her, scrambles to her feet -- 
           the Commander starts crawling away -- Boudicca pursues, STABS 
           him in the haunch -- he drops to his stomach --

           She retracts the antler, then stabs him again, between the 
           shoulder blades. He keeps trying to crawl, Boudicca keeps 
           stabbing, until he gives out, dead.

           Boudicca opens the box and pulls out a SCROLL. She unrolls 
           it, indeed, a MAP, when she hears --

                                 ROMAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Commander!

           Boudicca rolls the scroll and stashes it in her cleavage.

           IN THE CORRIDOR

           Soldiers advance toward the Commander’s tent. They FLING open 
           the flap and find him dead on the floor. No Boudicca.

           INT. ROMAN MILITARY OUTPOST

           Boudicca slips down another corridor, while, elsewhere --

           Elsha spots ANOTHER GUARD ascending the steps to the top of 
           the wall. A virgin takes the reins of the horses, Elsha LEAPS 
           onto the wall like a frog and starts scaling it. 

           An ARCHER starts firing at her. ZING! ZING! Just missing. 
           Boudicca waits for the wagon to pass and LEAPS aboard. She 
           directs the steering virgin toward the ARCHER gunning for 
           Elsha. The horses charge -- the Archer starts to flee --

           Boudicca LASSOES him with a rope -- he falls -- the horses 
           TRAMPLE the Archer -- SQUISH! A hoof makes pie of his face.

           ON THE WALL

           The Guard surfaces and starts pulling the gates closed, 
           trapping the Celts inside the outpost.

           Elsha surfaces and makes a dash for the Guard. They fight 
           hand-to-hand atop the narrow wall, until --

           Elsha SHOVES the Guard off. She slackens the rope until the 
           gates hang open. Boudicca guns it for the exit --

           Once through the gates, Elsha JUMPS off the ledge --

           In the wagon below, the virgins make room --

           Elsha lands SMACK in the middle of it. A few wooden beams 
           splinter, but it’s intact. Off they ride.

                                 ELSHA
                        How much time before they come for 
                        us?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ll leave by dark.

           INT. DRUIDESS TREEHOUSE - EVENING

           Boudicca unrolls the map across a tree stump table. The 
           Druidess studies it by the light of a moribund candle.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        They've claimed most of the 
                        southern and eastern land. This is 
                        their capital, Camulodunum. And 
                        this, Londinium, see all them lines 
                        goin’ to the sea? It looks to be 
                        the center of trade.

           Boudicca takes the map, kisses the Druidess’s head.

                                 DRUIDESS (CONT’D)
                        Have you a plan?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Sack those cities and claim our 
                        freedom.

           As the Druidess watches Boudicca go, she gets a QUICK FLASH:

           Blood spills from between Boudicca’s lips.
           She shakes the image, deeply troubled. She runs outside, only 
           to find -- Boudicca is long gone into the night.

           INT. BOUDICCA’S ROUNDHOUSE - EVENING

           Boudicca and her daughter Máire dine by candlelight.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Someone must be growin’.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Gettin’ strong for battle.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Only battle you’ll be seein’s with 
                        your shadow, keep eatin’ like that.

                                 MÁIRE
                        I’ll kill the bastards who’ve done 
                        this to us.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You’re not killin’ anyone.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Bit of a hypocrite, you are.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’m a woman, you’re a child.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Not anymore, I’m not.

           Grief surfaces as rage --

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Already lost one child to the 
                        Romans, I won’t lose the pair of 
                        you.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Then I’m to live in Clíona’s 
                        shadow.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Better that, than to die in it.

                                 MÁIRE
                        That’s what you’re askin’ of the 
                        rest, isn’t it? 
                          (then)
                        Be a quick fight, all you have.

           Máire pushes the bowl across the table, cuts Boudicca a 
           searing, defiant look and leaves. Boudicca hangs her head.
           INT./EXT. MANHOLE - EVENING

           Óengus is carving drawings in the rock wall, adding to an 
           impressive tableau depicting a cannibalistic paradise.

           He hears a WHISTLE, turns, sees Boudicca crouched above.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        The dagger you sprung at my throat.

           Óengus keeps carving, ignores her. Boudicca tosses down a 
           bladder of koumiss as a bribe. No response.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Got here a leg of lass.

           Moments later, the blade appears through the hatch. Boudicca 
           reaches gingerly, snatches it.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 ÓENGUS
                        Where’s the lass?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You’ll work for the lass. Where’d 
                        you get the dagger?

                                 ÓENGUS
                          (annoyed)
                        Made it.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s iron.

                                 ÓENGUS
                          (duh)
                        Made it from iron. Got more if you 
                        want, just lower the lass.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Where’d you get the iron?

           Óengus, impatient, lights a TORCH and illuminates for 
           Boudicca an expansive MINE, the walls embedded with IRON ORE.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Thought we’d no more sources on our 
                        land. Why didn’t you say somethin’?

                                 ÓENGUS
                        You’d have moved me.

           Boudicca smiles, seeing major opportunity.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Have you an axe?
           Moments later, an AXE appears through the hatch. Boudicca 
           grabs it, raises it and SMASHES the hatch lock. She opens it.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        You’re movin’, anyhow.

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - NIGHT

           The Iceni are joined by the Trinovantes, led by the Elder we 
           met, Ula, with what few belongings they have in hide sacks. 

           CHARIOTS and WAGONS are being loaded with IRON ORE. Horses 
           stamp their feet impatiently. Everyone’s waiting...

           For Boudicca. She appears with Óengus on a leash.

                                 ELSHA
                        You’re mad...

           Óengus looks around, more a frightened animal than a 
           dangerous man. Boudicca loads Óengus in a CAGE atop a WAGON 
           and mounts her horse. Elsha looks at Boudicca, agape.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Let’s go.

           Boudicca digs her heels into her horse’s sides, and they’re 
           off. The convoy follows Boudicca into the night.

           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A band of vengeful ROMANS bearing weapons and torches BLAZE 
           toward the Iceni village, only to find it devoured by flames.

           EXT. CELTIC CAMP - MORNING

           Animal hides are stretched between the gnarled arms of yew 
           trees, forming canopies under which fur beds are stretched. 

           Battle preparations are underway:

           Celts are SKINNING rabbits, deer and pigs, then bleeding them 
           into BLADDERS. Children tie bladders and scrape skins.

           Others carve sticks into spears and rocks into arrowheads, 
           then hand them off to others, who assemble weapons. 

           Still others harvest RED SAP that looks like BLOOD from the 
           bark of the yew trees. The arrowheads are dipped in the sap.

           In a CAGE, Óengus pours LIQUID IRON ORE into clay DAGGER and 
           AXE molds lined with animal fat.

           Máire struggles to carry a bucket. Servant boy Judoc watches.
                                 MÁIRE
                        You gonna help me, or what?

           Judoc grins, jogs over, takes the bucket.

                                 JUDOC
                        Was hopin’ you’d ask.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Shouldn’t have to. You’re a 
                        servant.

                                 JUDOC
                        And a willin’ one. But I want to be 
                        thanked. A kiss’ll do.

           Máire grabs back the bucket and attempts to haul it herself. 
           Judoc waits a beat, then catches up with her.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Don’t need you.

                                 JUDOC
                        You’d never need a man, but you 
                        might find you want one.

           Máire drops the bucket.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Come on then, kiss me already.

           Judoc plants a gentle kiss on Máire’s cheek. She’s 
           speechless. Judoc takes the bucket, leaves Máire blushing.

           Boudicca speaks with the Trinovantes elder Ula over the map.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (re: Camulodunum)
                        We’ll take their capital first.

                                 ULA
                        Was our land ‘fore they drove us 
                        out, you know. Saw what they built. 
                        An eyesore. Got stone walls. I 
                        don’t see us gettin’ past ‘em.

           Boudicca studies the map, points --

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Is this a river runnin’ by it? 

                                 ULA
                        Aye.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’ve heard of wheels bringin’ water 
                        into Roman cities.
                                 ULA
                        So?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        So the water must go under the 
                        ground to get to the city.

                                 ULA
                        ‘Spose.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Then so will we.

           Boudicca WHISTLES. From his cage, Óengus looks over.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        That flute, did you make it?

           Óengus nods.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Can you make enough for an army?

                                 ÓENGUS
                        Best bones are human.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Good try.

           Elsha approaches, hands and tunic covered in ANIMAL BLOOD.

                                 ELSHA
                          (re: óengus)
                        I maintain you’re not right in the 
                        head.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        And you? Bravest of men’ll run from 
                        a bleedin’ woman.

                                 ELSHA
                        We’ve enough to drown the city. 
                        What’s your plan for it?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        They think we’re savages, we’ll 
                        give ‘em savage.

           EXT. RIVER - PRE-DAWN

           Boudicca and her army SWIM down a turgid river flanked by 
           woods. Torches beg mercy of the Stygian blackness.
           ESTABLISHING - CAMULODUNUM - MORNING

           Monolithic stone walls encircle the city. A ditch surrounds 
           the walls and a river flows past, making it impenetrable.

           EXT. CAMULODUNUM MARKETPLACE

           VENDORS set up stalls in the cobblestone square, peddling 
           spices, fruits, tapestries. CIVILIANS peruse the selections. 

           SOLDIERS from the ROMAN HOME ARMY patrol. Some have Celtic 
           tattoos. These are the conscripted Celts -- AUXILIARY FORCES.

           EXT. CAMULODUNUM

           ROMAN WORKERS lumber off to work, tools in hand. Furtive 
           GUARDS are perched on the walls, but they fail to notice:

           EXT. RIVER

           The tips of HUNDREDS of HOLLOW BONES (snorkels) are just 
           visible above the water, moving with the current, downstream. 

           UNDERWATER 

           The Celts swim, clutching inflated BLADDERS and SPEARS.

           EXT. RIVER

           The bones round a bend, where there’s a giant Ferris wheel-
           like AQUEDUCT, churning the river water.

           UNDERWATER

           Boudicca moves past the submerged base of the aqueduct, which 
           is directing the water through a TUNNEL. She finds the 
           entrance to the tunnel and swims in. Her army follows.

           EXT. CAMULODUNUM MARKETPLACE

           An AUXILIARY SOLDIER purchases a pomegranate from an ARABIC 
           VENDOR. He extends his hand for the fruit, and we notice 
           FAMILIAR TATTOOS. It’s Áedán.

           INT. AQUEDUCT TUNNEL

           Boudicca and her army emerge like crocodiles, with just 
           enough headroom to breathe. They wade through the stone 
           tunnel, crawling with RATS. Elsha SWATS one.

           Boudicca cups a handful of water and slurps it down.
           EXT. CAMULODUNUM MARKETPLACE

           From the floral patterns incised in the city’s MANHOLE 
           covers, BLOOD starts running, trickling through the channels 
           between the cobblestones. FOUNTAINS spew blood.

           Civilians start noticing and alerting each other. LADIES gasp 
           in horror. Others utter PRAYERS. SOLDIERS go for weapons.

           The manhole covers lift and Celts BURST out! They climb 
           through and commence a vigorous assault --

           Within seconds, Boudicca drops two Romans. Elsha is a dirty 
           fighter, stabbing, biting.

           Boudicca whirls around to see she’s facing Áedán. They both 
           freeze a moment, then Boudicca SWINGS her axe at Áedán --

           He blocks her. She tries again. He blocks. She keeps at it. 
           Áedán defends the blows with a slightly amused smile, which 
           only fuels Boudicca’s fire, retribution for betrayal -- 

           Finally, Áedán’s had enough -- he wrangles Boudicca’s back 
           against his chest, his blade pressed to her throat. He draws 
           blood. She doesn’t move, daring him to kill her --

           He slackens. Boudicca seizes the opportunity, draws her own 
           dagger and STABS Áedán in the thigh. Áedán drops his blade 
           and staggers back. Boudicca watches, merciless, when --

           Áedán alerts her to a threat from behind. She turns, faces 
           another AUXILIARY hurling at her with raised sword. She 
           DUCKS, he BARREL ROLLS over her back. She POUNCES on his 
           prone body and buries her dagger in his heart. 

           Boudicca turns to re-engage Áedán, but he’s gone.

           Elsha strikes a piece of flint against a cobblestone until it 
           sparks, then sets fire to bundles of straw in vendors’ carts. 
           POOF! The flames devour the carts --

           The Romans scramble to extinguish them with fountain water.

           INT. QUAESTOR’S CHAMBER

           The QUAESTOR (45) watches from his window the carnage below.

                                 COMPANION (O.S.)
                        Quaestor--

           The Quaestor turns, regards his COMPANION.

                                 COMPANION (CONT’D)
                        In the Governor’s absence, military 
                        orders fall to you.
           Just then, something FLIES through the window. The Quaestor 
           finds it on the floor -- a HUMAN HEART, still beating.

           He moves to the window, sees the Trinovantes elder Ula 
           crouched over a heart-less Roman, snarling, her hand bloody.

                                 QUAESTOR
                        Abandon it.

           EXT. CAMULODUNUM MARKETPLACE

           Romans and Auxiliaries lie slaughtered. The square is nearly 
           circled in flames, smoke obfuscating the enemy.

           Boudicca sees Ula on the ground, injured -- she fights her 
           way toward her, as the entrance to the city is SMEARED with 
           flames, leaving no way out.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (to Ula)
                        Get on.

           Boudicca gets down on all fours. Ula scrapes herself onto 
           Boudicca’s back. Elsha joins. Boudicca regards a DEAD ROMAN.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Take the feet.

           Elsha grabs the man’s feet, Boudicca his shoulders. They lift 
           him and stagger to the entrance, a wall of flames.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        On three.

           Boudicca initiates the swinging of the body. One, two --

           They FLING the dead body into the entrance, bisecting the 
           flames, creating a temporary bridge. Elsha ushers Boudicca 
           out first, Ula clinging round her neck, then follows.

           They emerge --

           EXT. CAMULODUNUM

           As the city EXPLODES. Many Celts are already outside, having 
           chased fleeing Romans. Surviving Romans surrender their arms.

           EXT. RIVER - LATER

           The Celtic army retreats across the river, with scores of 
           ROMAN PRISONERS OF WAR on leashes. 

           The sky rains ASH. In their wake, Camulodunum burns. PRELAP 
           the sound of CELTIC MUSIC --
           EXT. CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           The Celts celebrate, dancing, singing, drinking. The wounded 
           are mended, as they’re liquored up and given leaves to smoke.

           A giant WICKER MAN contains a writhing mass of Roman POWS, 
           arms protruding like snakes, clawing each other’s faces.

           Ula lights the wicker with a torch and snickers. Roman limbs 
           and hair catch fire, pitiful SCREAMS fill the night.

           Elsewhere, DECAPITATED ROMANS have STRAW stuffed in their 
           necks. The straw is on fire, making human ROMAN CANDLES.

           Óengus is huddled in the corner of his CAGE, face in knees, 
           covering his ears with his hands.

           Boudicca humbly receives praise from her people, when she 
           sees Máire, sitting alone, excuses herself and joins her. 

                                 MÁIRE
                        How many men did you kill?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s not somethin’ to regale.

           Máire regards the celebration.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Seem pretty pleased to me.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        No matter what was taken from you, 
                        it’s never easy to take a life. 
                        When it gets that way, you’ve lost 
                        the point of vengeance.

                                 MÁIRE
                        ‘Spose you’d never know, you never 
                        got the chance to try.

           Máire crosses her arms, stubborn. Off Boudicca, watching the 
           wicker man burn, fearing her own caution...

           EXT. DOMUS NERO - AGRIPPINA’S ROOM - DAY

           Agrippina swipes charcoal across her lash line. KNOCKS at the 
           door unsteady her hand.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Not now.

           The door opens. In saunters Nero, sweaty, SWORD in hand.

                                 AGRIPPINA (CONT’D)
                        Is your tutor now a swordsman?
                                 NERO
                        I’ve an idea.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Then we’ll call a meeting--

                                 NERO
                        A new residence.

           Nero removes his shirt and takes a seat in a chair, knees 
           spread. Agrippina resumes her makeup, stealing glimpses in 
           the mirror of her son’s glistening torso.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        What of the one your father left 
                        you? 

                                 NERO
                        A man forced to adopt his wife’s 
                        child does not a father to that 
                        child make.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Is the child’s crown not enough to 
                        assuage his grief?

                                 NERO
                        He who wears the crown deserves to 
                        be housed like a human being. Plans 
                        for my Golden House are underway.

           More KNOCKS at the door.

                                 NERO (CONT’D)
                        Come in.

           Agrippina cuts her son a look, this isn’t your room. The door 
           opens, and a sprightly messenger called FAUSTUS enters.

                                 FAUSTUS
                        News from Briton, Emperor. The 
                        capital has been decimated by a 
                        band of barbarians.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        A band of barbarians.

                                 FAUSTUS
                        Yes, my Lady. Led by a woman.

                                 NERO
                        I’d like to meet this woman.

                                 FAUSTUS
                        Boudicca is her name--

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Leave.
           Faustus bows, leaves. Agrippina paces, then halts facing the 
           mirror, back to Nero, burning with jealousy. She lifts her 
           eyes to her reflection, sizing herself up in comparison --

           She turns to her son with an entirely different demeanor. She 
           kneels between his legs and takes his hands in hers.

                                 AGRIPPINA (CONT’D)
                        Forgive me. I burn at the insult to 
                        my son, who I love more dearly than 
                        anyone, or anything.

           She guides his hands to her breasts. Nero closes his eyes.

                                 AGRIPPINA (CONT’D)
                        Look at me.

           He opens them. She’s wildly seductive. He’s in her grasp. She 
           moves his hands off her breasts. He shudders.

                                 AGRIPPINA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll order the Governor to find 
                        this woman and kill her.

                                 NERO
                        Yes, mother.

           EXT. CELTIC CAMP - EARLY MORNING

           Boudicca appears to be sleeping, as a SNAKE slithers up the 
           length of her arm and over her neck. Boudicca’s eyes open.

           She stays still, watching the serpent’s body caress her neck, 
           its tongue flickering. It glides along her outstretched arm, 
           then wraps itself around her wrist, doubling back.

           With her other hand, Boudicca brandishes a dagger and PINS 
           the snake’s head with its point, mere hairs from her arm. 

           She exhales, retrieves her knife, then grabs the snake and 
           goes outside, where she sees Máire sitting by Óengus’s cage.

           Boudicca casts the snake on a fire to cook and approaches.

           WITH MÁIRE

           She chats to Óengus while sharpening a SPEAR.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Did you eat all of him? Like, every 
                        bit?

                                 ÓENGUS
                        Well, not everythin’. Pluck the 
                        nails off the fingers, else they 
                        catch in your throat. 
           Boudicca appears.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I don’t s’pose he told you little 
                        lasses were his favorite?

           Máire looks to Óengus for confirmation. He shrugs, guilty.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                          (re: spear)
                        And what’s your plan for that?

                                 MÁIRE
                        Killin’ Romans.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’ve got one for you.

                                 MÁIRE
                        It’s not funny.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’m glad you agree.

           Boudicca stands.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Come on, then.

           Máire hesitates, this is all happening very fast, but she’s a 
           proud girl, so she rises and follows Boudicca.

           EXT. SHIP/ISLE OF MONA - MORNING

           SHIPS are docked at the beach. ROMAN LEGIONARIES, including 
           those who flogged Boudicca’s daughters, Lucius and Pristus, 
           board it. Lucius glances back --

           Slaughtered druids, women and men in black robes, hair like 
           Furies, are strewn across the sand -- like the Hell panel of 
           Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights.

           Suetonius is still on the island, surveying his work. He 
           comes across a DRUIDIC ROCK ALTAR -- in it, is etched a 
           TRISKELE. He hears, faintly:

                                 DYING DRUID (O.S.)
                        Yesu...

           Suetonius looks around, sees a DRUID slumped against a YEW 
           TREE, bleeding out.

                                 DYING DRUID (CONT’D)
                        Yesu will come...
           Suetonius finishes the Druid off. Then, from the yew’s bark, 
           oozes sticky RED SAP. To anyone but a Celt, it would appear 
           the tree is BLEEDING. Suetonius watches, disturbed...

           EXT. CELTIC CAMP - MORNING

           Elsha stands before six ROMAN PRISONERS OF WAR, tied up. Her 
           baby is strapped to her back. 

           She scoops a heap of slop in front of each. They scramble to 
           their knees and eat from the ground like dogs.

           Elsha stops before the last POW, VARUS (30s), olive skin and 
           piercing blue eyes. She serves him and starts off, when --

           The baby starts GIGGLING. Elsha stops. Turns. They're all 
           still eating. She starts off again, and we catch Varus making 
           a funny face. The baby lapses into another giggle fit.

                                 VARUS
                        He’ll need his humor. It’s a dark 
                        place we find ourselves.

           Just then, Boudicca appears with Máire.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Máire wants to kill a Roman.
                          (to Máire)
                        Take your pick.

           Máire scans her options.

                                 ELSHA
                        It’s cruel to make her choose.

           Elsha grabs a POW by the arm, drags him to his feet and casts 
           him before Máire. Elsha trades a fleeting glance with Varus.

                                 ELSHA (CONT’D)
                        This one eats too much, anyway.

           Boudicca looks to Máire for approval.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Well?

           Máire nods. Boudicca drags the POW off. Máire follows.

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Boudicca shoves the POW against a tree, crouches before him.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Feelin’ merciful, you cut his 
                        throat.
           She mimes a throat cutting.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Want to draw it out...

           She mimes a slit to the abdomen.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Bit messy, all comes tumblin’ out.

           Boudicca rises, hands Máire the knife. Máire grips the 
           handle, resolved, approaches the POW. Boudicca watches.

           Máire kneels, looks the POW in the eyes.

                                 ROMAN POW
                        Please. I beg you, girl.

           Máire closes her eyes, adjusts her grip. She raises it to his 
           throat, presses the blade against his skin -- 

           Boudicca looks on, sangfroid, when --

           Máire lowers the knife. Boudicca steps in, takes it from her. 
           Máire runs away.

           The POW sighs, relieved. Boudicca watches Máire until she 
           disappears, then swiftly SLITS the POW’s throat.

           Through the trees, there’s RUSTLING. Boudicca stands, alert. 
           The bushes shake, giving way to a BABY WOLF. Boudicca sheaths 
           her dagger and crouches down.

           The wolf takes some steps forward, then pauses dubiously. 
           Boudicca beckons it with her arms. The wolf proceeds. As it 
           nears, we see its eyes -- one brown, one blue, like Clíona’s.

           Boudicca smiles, eyes brimming with tears, as she beholds the 
           incarnation of her daughter.

           Just then, the MOTHER WOLF appears. Boudicca raises her hands 
           in surrender. The baby runs to its mother. Both disappear.

           Boudicca watches them go and lowers her hands. 

           EXT. CAMULODUNUM - DAY

           Governor Suetonius stalks the remains of the city, which are 
           covered in a thick layer of ASH. Blood has stained the 
           cobblestones. The dead are piled in carts, awaiting burial.

           The remaining ROMAN HOME ARMY and AUXILIARY SOLDIERS, 
           including Áedán, stand by. The Quaestor keeps his head bowed.

           Suetonius’s LEGIONARIES observe the carnage scornfully. 
           Suetonius crouches over a slain CELT and studies the eyes, 
           even dead, burning with conviction.

                                 ROMAN HOME ARMY SOLDIER
                        Even the ground was bleeding, sir. 
                        I’ve never seen anything like it.

           Privately, Suetonius’s face shows he’s troubled. He stands.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        The tremendous victory I just 
                        incurred does little to abate my 
                        humiliation, that men who bear the 
                        standard of the eagle cannot be 
                        trusted to defend the empire that 
                        lends them the honor!
                          (off silence)
                        Who seeks redemption?

           Roman hands shoot up. Suetonius combs the line of options, 
           nodding his selection of one, two, three soldiers, eventually 
           coming to Áedán, whose hand is also raised. 

           He moves right past Áedán, selects two more Romans.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Bring her to me. Alive.

           Suetonius makes like he’s leaving, when we hear:

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        It’ll take a savage to find one.

           Suetonius stops. 

                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        We know the land.

           Off Suetonius, considering...

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - DAY

           Boudicca brings a slab of gristly MEAT to Óengus’s cage. She 
           throws it through the bars. He eyes it, doesn’t move.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Aren’t you hungry?

                                 ÓENGUS
                        I don’t eat animals.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You don’t eat animals.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        Nay.
           Boudicca turns to go.

                                 ÓENGUS (CONT’D)
                        Be proud, your father saw you now.

           Boudicca gives a weak smile, sets off again, when --

                                 ÓENGUS (CONT’D)
                        The day he died, I was locked away. 
                          (then)
                        I’ve heard the screams of hundreds 
                        dyin’. I want to fight.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (beat)
                        I can’t trust you not to hurt your 
                        own. I’m sorry, Óengus.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Áedán and six ROMAN SCOUTS ride.

                                 FAT SCOUT
                        Why does a woman make a better 
                        soldier than a man?
                          (beat)
                        She can bleed for a week and still 
                        not die!

           LAUGHTER from all but Áedán. The SKINNY SCOUT notices.

                                 SKINNY SCOUT
                        Come on then, have a go.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        It’s ill luck to chide your enemy.

           THROUGH THE TREES, Áedán sees SMOKE.

                                 FAT SCOUT
                        Sounds like a savage superstition, 
                        doesn’t it?

           Áedán ignores this, as they come upon --

           EXT. CELTIC CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           WOLVES and RAVENS pick through the strewn corpses. The Romans 
           cover their noses, as they gaze upon the wickerwork frame 
           filled with incinerated Romans, their corpses still smoking.

                                 FAT SCOUT
                        We should give them proper burials.

                                 SKINNY SCOUT
                        We haven’t the time.
                                 FAT SCOUT
                        It’s asking for bad fortune.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        And I’m superstitious?

           The Romans shoot Áedán looks of contempt.

                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a proper Celtic send-off.

                                 FAT SCOUT
                        Where’s it sending a Roman?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Celtic spirits shed a tear for any 
                        brave man.

           INT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Suetonius sits opposite his wife, MARTINA (30s), and their 
           two DAUGHTERS (8 and 12). They eat in rigid silence. 

                                 MARTINA
                          (to the girls)
                        Wash up.

           The girls leave. Martina intuits her husband’s anxiety.

                                 MARTINA (CONT’D)
                        You must trust your men will find 
                        Boudicca.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        I do.

                                 MARTINA
                        Then what troubles you?

           A long beat, then:

                                 SUETONIUS
                        They summon blood from trees and 
                        stones.

                                 MARTINA
                        My husband fears a pagan savage.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        But are they...?

                                 MARTINA
                        You don’t really think...

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Before the druid died, he said, 
                        “Yesu will come.”
                                 MARTINA
                        A dying man speaks nonsense.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        That prophet whose head we crowned 
                        with thorns...

                                 MARTINA
                        Yeshua. 

                                 SUETONIUS
                        He, too, said he would return. 
                          (then)
                        How can it be, that two peoples who 
                        have never had contact, nor 
                        anything else common, came to 
                        believe the same man would return 
                        to save them?

                                 MARTINA
                        You fear they speak the truth.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Why else would we kill their 
                        prophet?

                                 MARTINA
                        You would be wise to confine these 
                        thoughts to this table.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        A man may muse.

           Off Martina, not convinced...

           INT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - MARTINA’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           A bathtub sits under a vaulted marble ceiling. Hundreds of 
           tallow candles flicker from ledges incised in the walls. 

           Martina’s HANDMAIDEN washes her.

                                 MARTINA
                        “A man may muse...” Indeed, a woman 
                        would be stoned for musing.
                          (beat, sighs)
                        I envy her.

                                 MARTINA’S HANDMAIDEN
                        Who, my Lady?

                                 MARTINA
                        Boudicca.
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The Romans sleep. Áedán sits by a dwindling fire, his gaze 
           far-off, contemplative.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           Boudicca sits by a fire, donning a similarly far-off gaze, 
           the only one in the camp still awake, or so it seems...

           Elsha approaches, rocking her baby. She takes a seat.

                                 ELSHA
                        His Da used to rock him right to 
                        sleep. Me, I don’t know what I’m 
                        doin’.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’m not the mother to be givin’ 
                        counsel.

                                 ELSHA
                        Raised two strong lasses, that’s as 
                        good a mother as any.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        A good mother don’t see her lass 
                        die young.

                                 ELSHA
                        She makes an army in her honor.

           Boudicca smiles feebly.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Ferment your milk, puts ‘em right 
                        to sleep.

                                 ELSHA
                        Got your babes drunk? Good 
                        mother... I take that back.

           Boudicca shrugs, told you.

           EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The Fat Scout SNORES, exhaling frosty breath. Suddenly --

           His eyes fly open. BLOOD gurgles from his mouth. A hand 
           muffles his groans. It’s Áedán. He waits until the Fat 
           Scout’s dead, then moves to the Tall Scout, slits his throat.

           The Skinny Scout awakens, grabs his own knife, clambers to 
           his feet. A manual fight ensues, weapons are skittered. Áedán 
           gets the upper hand and CHOKES the Skinny Scout to death.
           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           In his cage, Óengus is GNAWING at his wrist. CRUNCH! A tooth 
           comes loose. He spits it out and starts in again...

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           A Celtic NIGHT WATCHMAN stands guard in the dark. He hears 
           RUSTLING through the trees and readies a SLING-SHOT.

           Through the trees, materializes a man in Roman military garb. 
           The Night Watchman fires a stone -- the man dodges it by a 
           hair -- the Night Watchman reloads, when he sees --

           The man’s hands are up in surrender. He’s holding a HEAD.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           Boudicca awakens to noise in the camp. She slips out, sees 
           the Night Watchman DRAGGING a man through the camp.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        Caught this one sneakin’ up.

           Boudicca removes the cloak and sees, it’s Áedán. 

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN (CONT’D)
                        He brought this.

           The Night Watchman furnishes the decapitated head.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        It’s a Roman.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        As are you.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        Shall I kill him?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Nay. That would be merciful.

           The Watchman drags Áedán off. Boudicca watches, impassive.

           MORNING

           Áedán is strung from a tree by bound wrists. He attempts to 
           heave his legs up to the branch, no dice.

           Boudicca sits on a nearby log, carving meat off a rabbit.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Cut me down, I’ll tell you what 
                        they're plannin’.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        Tell me, I’ll cut you down.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        I see why the Chief wouldn’t die. 
                        You must’ve ordered him to keep 
                        breathin’.

           Boudicca THROWS her dagger like a dart, into Áedán’s thigh. 
           He GROANS. Boudicca tears into the rabbit with her teeth.

                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        Just sayin’, you always seemed 
                        better suited to a man who wouldn’t 
                        take your orders.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You’re one to judge a coward.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Takes one to know one, is typically 
                        how it works.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        And why should I let a coward among 
                        my ranks?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        ‘Cause this one loves you.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Why would I want the love of a 
                        coward?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        ‘Cause you love him, too.

           Boudicca approaches. She extracts her knife, then strokes 
           Áedán’s face with the flat side of the blade.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        A druid claims love shows in the 
                        lines of the face. Can you see 
                        mine?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Settin’ me up to fail with that.

           Boudicca presses the sharp side of the blade to his throat, 
           forcing an answer --

                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        I still see a little girl carryin’ 
                        berries through the trees.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        A little girl, you say.
                          (off nod)
                        You’re sick.

           Boudicca leaves. Áedán sighs, tests his restraints. Futile.

           WITH ELSHA

           Elsha distributes another feed to the Roman POWs. Varus nods 
           his thanks, when:

                                 ROMAN POW
                        I have to shit.

                                 ELSHA
                        No one’s stoppin’ you.

                                 ROMAN POW
                        Please, let me shit with dignity.

           Elsha balances her baby in the crook of one arm and grabs the 
           POW with the other arm.

                                 VARUS
                        I’ll watch your boy. I’m not going 
                        anywhere.

           Elsha regards the offer skeptically, then hands him her baby. 
           Varus bounces the boy in his lap. Elsha hauls the POW off.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           Boudicca hangs furs to dry, repressing something. Máire, 
           who’s helping her mother, notices.

                                 MÁIRE
                        He did come back to us.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s like apologizing to a man once 
                        you’ve buried your axe in his 
                        chest.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Well, that’s a bit dramatic.
                          (off silence)
                        Would you rather he stayed by us 
                        when the Romans came and got killed 
                        for it?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        The only useful coward’s a dead 
                        one.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Then why haven’t you killed him?
           Boudicca’s stymied.

                                 MÁIRE (CONT’D)
                        And why are you still wearin’ his 
                        necklace?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Enough.

                                 MÁIRE
                          (a beat)
                        He built my chariot.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 MÁIRE
                        Thought it’d make you feel bad for 
                        Da.

           Boudicca shakes a fur, doesn’t know what to say.

                                 MÁIRE (CONT’D)
                        He’s a good man. And he loves you.

           Boudicca turns to Máire, looks surprised.

                                 MÁIRE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, please. I weren’t born 
                        yesterday either.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Nearly.

           WITH ÁEDÁN

           Boudicca approaches with the knife.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        I’ve been thinkin’--

           Boudicca raises the knife above Áedán’s head and swiftly CUTS 
           the rope. He collapses to the ground.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Get up.

           Áedán looks up at Boudicca from all fours.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - LATER

           Áedán awaits treatment for the stab wound on his leg. Máire 
           sits with him.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Thank your mother for it.
                                 MÁIRE
                        Really?

           Both cast glances at Boudicca, the picture of sweetness and 
           femininity, chatting to a TRINOVANTES WOMAN.

           The Blind Man who led the tribal council approaches, bearing 
           a piece of SMOLDERING IRON. He feels his way to Áedán.

                                 MÁIRE (CONT’D)
                        He’ll fix you right up.

           Máire pats Áedán’s shoulder, leaves. The Blind Man feels his 
           way up Áedán’s leg to the suppurating slit.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Have you done this before?

                                 BLIND MAN
                        Aye, before I lost my sight.

           Before Áedán can protest, the Blind Man CAUTERIZES the wound. 
           Off the sizzling flesh, we are:

           ESTABLISHING - MOUNTAINS - DAY

           ROMAN SOLDIERS escort a convoy of ROMAN MERCHANTS, their 
           wagons filled to the brim with FOOD, WEAPONS and SLAVES.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - INTERCUT

           Boudicca consults the map with Áedán and Elsha. 

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        It’ll be some nights march to 
                        Londinium.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        They'll be fortifyin’ their army 
                        while we grow weary marchin’.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Is that defeat I hear?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s reality. But then, you’ve 
                        never lived in it.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        It takes the same time to build 
                        problems and opportunities.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Is that what they teach you in the 
                        Roman army?
           Áedán traces a line connecting LONDINIUM with the coast.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Here’s how they bring the goods 
                        from the sea to Londinium.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I know how to read it.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        By goods, I mean weapons.

                                 ELSHA
                        Weapons they'll use against us.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Fine place for us to strike.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Us? Oh, lad, we’re not there yet.

           EXT. TRAIL - DAY

           The Roman convoy threads a narrow trail choked by high-
           stacked, sun-scorched boulders.

           Bringing up the rear, a MERCHANT pulling a wagon of AFRICAN 
           SLAVES hums to himself.

           A SLAVE, shackled hands and feet, stares listlessly, 
           jostling, when something blocks the sun from his eyes --

           He looks up to see something CAREENING through the air, 
           headed right toward him. He raises his hands, CATCHES IT. In 
           his hands he holds the severed head of the Skinny Scout. 

           He looks up, sees ANOTHER HEAD flying through the air --

           It EXPLODES upon impact in a SPICE WAGON, sending plumes of 
           vibrant colors into the air, clinging to brains and blood.

           Romans take up bows and arrows, look around frantically for 
           the source, but it’s nowhere to be seen, because --

           EXT. OVERPASS RIDGE

           Boudicca and her army are concealed behind the boulders 
           crowning the overpass. ROPES are tied around their waists.

           They observe below, the Romans in baffled disarray. The Celts 
           wait in silence, then, at Boudicca’s command, they start 
           heaving BOULDERS off the overpass --

           The boulders SMASH the wagons, SNAP the yokes of the horses, 
           they whirl in panic --
           The Romans fire up at the Celts -- half the Celts move, 
           leaping from rock to rock, dodging a profusion of arrows, 
           while the other half descend the gorge with the ropes around 
           their waists, tied to trees.

           EXT. TRAIL

           The Romans struggle to move in the occluded trail. The Celts 
           hop deftly from ground to wagon to horse rump, SPEARING and 
           STABBING and HATCHETING Romans. Meanwhile --

           EXT. OVERPASS RIDGE

           The other Celts get ahead of the convoy, set fire to bundles 
           of straw weighted with rocks and HURL them down on the wagons 
           -- POOF! They go up in flames --

           EXT. TRAIL

           Boudicca LEAPS onto the slave cart and addresses the slaves, 
           who are watching this unfold with a kind of amusement.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Us or them.

           The Slave holds out his shackled hands. Boudicca SEVERS the 
           chains, hands him the sword of a slain Roman, then moves on.

           A SINGLE ROMAN escapes in the fracas, but it goes unnoticed 
           in the flurry of sand, stone and steel.

           At last, every other Roman is dead. Boudicca stands atop a 
           wagon brimming with WEAPONRY and initiates a piercing, savage 
           CRY, which is echoed by her army.

           EXT. LONDINIUM COLUMBARIA - DAY

           Suetonius is in a cavernous vault, its walls like honeycomb. 
           Niches house the cremated remains of nobility, marked by 
           PLAQUES and funerary masks like we saw on Claudius.

           Suetonius is KNEELING, clutching his vertical SWORD. With the 
           horizontal handle, it could almost pass for a cross.

           Martina appears in the doorway, watching, until Suetonius is 
           finished. He stands, turns, sees her.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        How long have you been there?

           Suetonius returns his sword to his sheath.

                                 MARTINA
                        I just arrived.
                                 SUETONIUS
                        Do you bring a message?

                                 MARTINA
                        Is it impossible to believe I’d 
                        come of my own desire?
                          (conceding)
                        A merchant convoy was ambushed on 
                        its way here. Boudicca.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Then my scouts have not yet found 
                        her.

                                 MARTINA
                        She flung their heads at the 
                        wagons.

           Suetonius paces.

                                 MARTINA (CONT’D)
                        What will you do?

                                 SUETONIUS
                        I’ll extend a peace offering.

                                 MARTINA
                        I think that’s wise.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        ...Which will serve as bait.

           Suetonius walks past Martina.

           Martina’s eyes drift past the various masks, until she comes 
           upon the slot reserved for her husband: GAIUS SUETONIUS 
           PAULINUS. His mask has already been prepared.

           She runs her fingers over the features of his face.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - DAY

           The Celts ride into camp with their newly acquired slaves, 
           wagons piled high with their own DEAD and WOUNDED.

           The children, elderly and handicapped gather round to welcome 
           the army. Boudicca dismounts.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (to all, re: the slaves)
                        You’ll welcome our new brothers.

           Áedán approaches Boudicca, takes her aside.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        We haven’t the food for ourselves, 
                        let alone more mouths. 
                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ve lost enough. It evens out.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        As was, we were fixin’ to starve 
                        come winter.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Take from the land we left behind, 
                        before it freezes over.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        You want to steal from the Romans?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s not stealin’ if we never gave 
                        it up. 
                          (then, re: the Slave)
                        Take him with you. New mouths can 
                        work for their keep.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                          (loud)
                        What do you say to Máire comin’?

           Máire alights.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Please, mum. It’s not fightin’.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        She’s pretty good with that 
                        chariot. Can pile it up with grain.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        She returns with a scratch, I’ll 
                        kill you.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Best not bring her back, then.

           Áedán grins. Máire takes his hand, ecstatic. Boudicca watches 
           them go... Until suddenly, it’s as if she’s reliving the pain 
           of losing Clíona. She runs after Máire.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Máire.

                                 MÁIRE
                        What?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I... I just wanted a kiss.

           Embarrassed, Máire capitulates. Áedán watches, moved by 
           Boudicca’s vulnerability. Boudicca waves them off.
           EXT. DOMUS NERO - GARDEN - DAY

           Nero strolls through a brick path lined by Italian Cypress 
           trees, bougainvillea dripping from a vaulted arch overhead.

           Seneca trails, reading from a book:

                                 SENECA
                        “It’s easy to believe that you’ve 
                        felt Cupid’s arrows. See the traces 
                        of your battles in me! If she asks 
                        how I am, say, I live in hope at 
                        night...”

                                 NERO
                        What a desperate cow.

                                 SENECA
                        This is love, Emperor.

                                 NERO
                        If love so weakens a man, I hope it 
                        never befalls me.

                                 SENECA
                        One cannot control the beat of the 
                        heart.

                                 NERO
                        Sure he can. Ask my mother.

           Nero plucks a WHITE FLOWER, considers it.

                                 NERO (CONT’D)
                        No white in the new garden. Make 
                        note of that.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Áedán rides ride, Máire drives the chariot with the Slave.

                                 MÁIRE
                        He’s sweet, but he’s a servant.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        How’s your mum feel about that?

                                 MÁIRE
                        She doesn’t care. Says you love who 
                        you love.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Was always better at givin’ advice 
                        than takin’ it.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Is that why she didn’t marry you?
           Áedán hesitates, how to preserve her illusion of her father?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Nay. She loved your father.

           Máire smiles, satisfied. A beat, then --

                                 MÁIRE
                        So I let him kiss me, now what?

           The Slave darts Áedán a look, good luck, buddy.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Now you make him work for your 
                        heart.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           Elsha distributes smaller rations to the remaining POWs. She 
           starts to go, when --

                                 VARUS
                        Could I wash? I feel ashamed to let 
                        you near me.

                                 ELSHA
                        I relish the smell of a rotting 
                        Roman.

                                 VARUS
                        Why are you keeping us alive?

                                 ELSHA
                        For food, when we’re starvin’.

                                 VARUS
                        Then you’ll really want to let me 
                        wash.

           He proffers his arm, a spot of BLACKENING FLESH.

                                 VARUS (CONT’D)
                        Unless you fancy the taste of a 
                        rotting Roman, as well, which 
                        wouldn’t surprise me.

           Elsha waits a stubborn beat, then concedes. She helps Varus 
           to his feet and guides him, as he shuffles in restraints.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           Boudicca walks among the cluster of sick, weak, injured, and 
           dying, of which there are many.

           Among them, the once feisty Trinovantes elder, Ula. Boudicca 
           crouches beside her, takes the old woman’s hands in hers.
                                 ULA
                        Carry on without us.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I won’t.

                                 ULA
                        You will.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I leave you here, they'll find you.

                                 ULA
                        We’re dyin’ already. Let us die 
                        fightin’.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ll stay until you’re well enough 
                        to move, and then you’ll die 
                        fightin’ beside us.

           EXT. STREAM - NIGHT

           Elsha guides Varus to the stream. He hesitates to step in.

                                 VARUS
                        I’ll freeze in wet clothes.

           Elsha unties his wrist restraints, slips off his tunic, 
           avoiding eye contact, then re-fastens the wrists.

                                 VARUS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t mean to make you blush.

                                 ELSHA
                        It’s nothin’ special.

           Varus stifles a grin.

                                 ELSHA (CONT’D)
                        Somethin’ funny?

            Elsha shoves Varus in the water.

                                 VARUS
                        A Roman woman would never be so 
                        honest.

                                 ELSHA
                        ‘Spose I wouldn’t be, I were 
                        leanin’ on a man for survival.

                                 VARUS
                          (beat)
                        What of your son’s father?
                                 ELSHA
                        Dead.

                                 VARUS
                        Sorry to hear that.

                                 ELSHA
                        Can thank your brothers.

           Varus stands in the water, wrists bound.

                                 VARUS
                        Do you mind helping?

           Elsha wades in, splashes water on Varus’s back. She turns him 
           around to wash his chest. For a moment, they meet eyes.

                                 VARUS (CONT’D)
                        I have one, too. A boy.

                                 ELSHA
                        What of his mother?

                                 VARUS
                        Rome. Him, too.

                                 ELSHA
                        You must long for him.
                          (finishing)
                        ‘Spose that’s as clean as a Roman--

           Varus leans in and KISSES Elsha. She pulls back, aghast, a 
           beat -- then dives back in. They fall into the water, kissing 
           with the passion of desperation, grief and stifled desire --

           INT. DOMUS NERO - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           We glide down the center of a long table, past the profiles 
           of ROMAN OFFICIALS shoveling food in their mouths, to the end 
           of the table, where sits Nero. To his left, Seneca. At the 
           opposite end of the table, Agrippina.

           Nero’s not eating, but observing with satisfaction the 
           gluttony of his officials. Suddenly, he ERUPTS:

                                 NERO
                        Swine!!

           Utensils are lowered. Open mouths sealed. Food swallowed.

                                 NERO (CONT’D)
                        Rome exhausts her wealth claiming 
                        new land to bring glory to you, her 
                        citizens, while you feast like pigs 
                        with parasites.
                                 AGRIPPINA
                        As it’s here before them, they're 
                        seeing that it doesn’t go to waste--

                                 NERO
                        Shh!

           Agrippina burns at the humiliation, but compensates with 
           sympathetic smiles to the officials.

           Nero WHISTLES. SERVANTS flood the room with trays of 
           elaborate DESSERTS.

                                 NERO (CONT’D)
                        Tonight, you will feast, such that 
                        you never need to eat again. That’s 
                        an order.

           Cautiously, the officials start helping themselves to 
           dessert. Nero watches with a manic grin.

           Seneca motions to a SERVANT by the door. Moments later, the 
           Servant returns with a beautiful, Asiatic woman. This is 
           CLAUDIA ACTE (17). She starts to sing. 

           For Nero, the world stops. Agrippina notices. Seneca smiles, 
           his plan is working.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           A ROMAN MESSENGER is thrust before Boudicca, his hands raised 
           in surrender. He’s taken a good beating.

                                 ROMAN MESSENGER
                        I bring a peace offering from 
                        Governor Suetonius.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Kill him.

                                 ELSHA
                        Shouldn’t we hear the offer?

                                 BOUDICCA
                        There’s no peace to be made with 
                        tyrants.

                                 ELSHA
                        If not peace, a compromise.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        A compromise admits they're 
                        entitled to any part of what 
                        they're doin’. Takin’ our land, 
                        killin’ our people. They've no 
                        right. Just greed.
           Just then, Áedán and Máire arrive. Starving Celts clamber to 
           the chariot for a look at the spoils. It’s empty.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        They've burned our farms.

           Boudicca seethes, turns to Elsha.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Kill the captives and butcher the 
                        meat.

           Off Elsha, now deeply conflicted by this order...

           EXT. WOODS - TIME LAPSE

           The Messenger is tied to a tree. In a TIME LAPSE of night to 
           morning, WOLVES THRASH at his limbs, RIP his face off.

           EXT. STREAM BANK - MORNING

           Spectral light filters through the trees. Boudicca wraps her 
           tunic and wrings her wet hair.

                                 ÁEDÁN (O.S.)
                        Londinium’s a tall order.

           Boudicca doesn’t turn, keeps dressing. Áedán is leaning 
           against a tree, watching Boudicca.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s the heart of their holdings.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        You do know the way to a heart.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Aye. Through the ribs.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        He’ll have two legions, maybe 
                        three.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ll need catapults. Were good 
                        with that chariot, I trust you’ll 
                        see to their makin’.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        One legion’s more’n double your 
                        numbers.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (wry)
                        Our numbers.
                                 ÁEDÁN
                        The city’s spread. We’ll have 
                        Romans to fight in every corner.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        If you know it so well, you’ll know 
                        how best to make it fall.

           Boudicca moves past Áedán.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        I wouldn’t have killed you.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I wouldn’t have let you.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Can’t let someone else kill you 
                        either.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Can see to that myself.

           Áedán pursues Boudicca, grabs her arm. She stops, turns to 
           face him. They linger on the sight of each other, when --

                                 BLIND MAN (O.S.)
                        Boudicca.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Can you see I’m busy?

           Áedán nods toward the Blind Man. Boudicca turns.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        ‘Course you can’t.

                                 BLIND MAN
                        You’ll want to see this.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - MORNING

           Two dozen of the sick and wounded form a triskele shape with 
           their corpses. At the center is Ula. Boudicca examines a few 
           of the bodies. No external wounds.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Poisoned themselves.

                                 BLIND MAN
                        Knew you wouldn’t leave without 
                        ‘em, so they killed themselves to 
                        free you to fight.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Bring the bodies. I’m not leavin’ 
                        ‘em here for the Romans to find.
                                 BLIND MAN
                        We haven’t the room--

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Make it.

           INT. DOMUS NERO - NERO’S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

           Nero stares at his reflection in the mirror. A lanky BARBER 
           trims his hair into a neat, curved line across his forehead.

                                 NERO
                        Trim the beard.

           The Barber hesitates -- a few wispy hairs don’t a beard make, 
           but he nods, and kindly makes a meal out of snipping them.

           In the mirror we see Agrippina, sitting on Nero’s bed, 
           wearing a sumptuous, red velvet dress.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Do you remember your first match?

                                 NERO
                        I have a feeling I’m to be given 
                        the story regardless. Go on.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        I covered your eyes when the man 
                        was speared.

                                 NERO
                        How things have changed.

           The Barber finishes, removes Nero’s bib and bows. Nero rises, 
           moves to his closet and peruses his options.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Perhaps red, to match your mother.

                                 NERO
                        I’ll not outshine the Christian 
                        blood.

           Nero selects a PURPLE cape.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Then you’ve replaced the barbarian 
                        gladiators with Christians?

                                 NERO
                        Even in bloodshed is there 
                        monotony.
                                 AGRIPPINA
                        A Christian death will be 
                        celebrated by fellow Christians as 
                        a noble sacrifice. It will seem to 
                        your people you’ve abandoned your 
                        conquest of the barbarians in favor 
                        of persecuting Christians.

                                 NERO
                        The Christian unafraid to die for 
                        his cause is a greater threat than 
                        the barbarian who will fight for 
                        his. You see, conquest is made by 
                        instilling fear in those to be 
                        conquered. He who has no fear of 
                        life on earth, will never be 
                        conquered.
                          (beat)
                        This Christian plague must be 
                        stopped before it spreads. There is 
                        only one man before whom Romans 
                        will prostrate themselves, and his 
                        heart still beats violently in his 
                        chest. 

           Nero opens a drawer, pulls out a RUBY NECKLACE.

                                 NERO (CONT’D)
                        Please leave. I’m expecting 
                        company.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        You speak to your mother as a 
                        subject.

                                 NERO
                        Are you not also my subject?

           Agrippina kneels before Nero, teases the waist of his pants.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        I serve you at your will.

                                 NERO
                        Stand up.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        This whore has changed you.

                                 NERO
                        She’s not a whore.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        A slave.

                                 NERO
                        She’s a freedwoman. And she is my 
                        partner. She gives sound council.
                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Then she’s the one diverting you 
                        from Briton to the Christians.

           KNOCKS at the door.

                                 NERO
                        Leave.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        If you take your eyes off Briton, 
                        Boudicca will prevail. Do you dare 
                        to let that be your legacy?

                                 NERO
                        A legacy is many years made, and 
                        I’m only getting started, mother. 
                        It’s yours you fear. But fear not, 
                        a woman has none to leave.

           Agrippina collects herself and leaves. Opening the door, she 
           passes Seneca and Claudia and lacerates both with a look.

           EXT. NEW CELTIC CAMP - MORNING

           Boudicca tools up. The Celts strike camp in the background. 
           Elsha approaches Boudicca with meat dangling from a stick.

                                 ELSHA
                        The useful parts of a man are few.

           Boudicca clocks something off -- Elsha’s nervous.

                                 ELSHA (CONT’D)
                        But dead, more’n the one when he’s 
                        breathin’, eh?

           A shrill SCREAM makes Boudicca and Elsha turn to see --

           A WOMAN RUNS from Óengus’s cage. One of his wrists is 
           shackled, the other shackle dangles free.

           Óengus waves his other hand, a BLOODY STUMP, at Boudicca, and 
           he grins, revealing all of his visible teeth are missing.

           Elsha looks on in horror. Boudicca stifles a laugh, waves.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (to Elsha, admit...)
                        It’s clever.

           Boudicca approaches Óengus.

                                 ÓENGUS
                        So, can I fight?
                                 BOUDICCA
                        Planned to let you, anyhow.

           Óengus’s face falls. All that for nothing.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        I’m jokin’. But you could’ve done 
                        without the hand. I mean, with it.

                                 ÓENGUS
                          (shrugs)
                        Was a good feed.

           EXT. CATUVELLAUNI VILLAGE - CHIEF’S ROUNDHOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE ON a DOLL made of twigs in a cloth tunic, with dark 
           HORSE HAIR streaming from the head, being moved by a hand. 

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF’S WIFE (O.S.)
                        Time to eat, lass.

           The Chief’s Daughter ignores her mother. Moments later, the 
           Chief appears, his face eye-level with the doll. (We’ll 
           remember he’s the one who denied Boudicca’s invitation.)

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF
                        Heard your mum?

           His eyes shift focus to the doll. The Daughter drops it, 
           stands. The Chief lingers on the doll, then picks it up.

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF’S DAUGHTER
                        Boudicca.

           The Daughter sits down to eat. The Chief looks between his 
           Daughter and the source of her idolatry in his hand.

           EXT. MARSHLAND - MORNING

           Gelid fog tumbles over the horizon. From the haze emerges the 
           CELTIC ARMY, on foot, on horses and in chariots.

           Boudicca rides at the front, Elsha on one side, Áedán on the 
           other. Máire drives her chariot. Óengus walks free.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Horse legs splash through a shallow river. Boudicca’s 
           stallion bounds ashore. Áedán rides to catch up to Boudicca.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Been thinkin’.
                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s a nice change from actin’.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        That comes next.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Can hardly wait.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        I’d like you to marry me.
                          (beat)
                        But then, I’ve known that since I 
                        was a lad. I’ve been wrestlin’ with 
                        the question, if I want to marry 
                        you.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        That’s a lot of assumin’ you’re 
                        doin’.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Never said I think you want to 
                        marry me. Just that I hope you do.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You want to know if I want to marry 
                        you, without havin’ to say if you 
                        want to marry me. Is that right?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        That’s right.

           Boudicca rolls her eyes.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Mist webs the trees, giving the illusion they're floating. 
           Steam spews from the horses’ noses like pistons.

           Suddenly, a SHADOW cuts through the mist ahead. Boudicca 
           holds up a hand, her army halts. A beat. She lowers her hand, 
           they carry on. Moments later, she sees:

           A blue EYEBALL floating in the mist. She BLINKS. The eyeball 
           is gone. But this is a woman who knows her eyes do not 
           deceive her. With a discreet hand, she motions to Áedán.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (softly)
                        Take take the children, and ride as 
                        fast as you can away. Tell the 
                        others to prepare to fight.

           Áedán peels off. Boudicca reaches for her spear and rides 
           calmly into the mist, while --
           Áedán rides up to Maire.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        We’re turning back.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Why?

           From the grey, materialize the shiny breastplates of HUNDREDS 
           of ROMAN SOLDIERS.

           Roman BATTLE CRIES shatter the fog. The Romans CHARGE. The 
           Celts scramble for their weapons. The children break off.

           Boudicca spurs her horse, enters the fight. The Celts fan out 
           in a line, blocking the Romans from chasing the children. 
           Dozens are slaughtered at first contact.

           Boudicca sees, through the mass of bodies, a familiar face --

           Varus, the POW, very much alive. Boudicca whirls around to 
           find Elsha -- she’s nowhere in sight. Boudicca’s heart sinks 
           at the betrayal, and the distraction costs her --

           She’s been CIRCLED by Romans. Her horse backs up, then surges 
           forward, nervous, as the Romans close in. Boudicca raises her 
           axe. She’s met with derisive GRINS.

                                 ROMAN SOLDIER
                        Go on. Give us a whack.

           Boudicca whirls her horse in the claustrophobic circle. The 
           Romans creep closer, until they're arms distance. Boudicca 
           tugs on her horse’s reins, he REARS -- his front legs CLOBBER 
           a Roman, SPOOKING the others’ horses --

           The circle opens up -- Boudicca makes a break for the gap, 
           narrowly escapes --

           IN A TREE is an AUXILIARY SOLDIER watching Boudicca, poised 
           to jump. He waits until she’s nearly to him, then SPRINGS off 
           the branch -- 

           Boudicca CUTS LEFT -- nearly dodges the hurling Auxiliary, 
           but he grabs hold of her tunic and YANKS her off her horse, 
           onto the ground. Her weapons scatter.

           Boudicca grabs the Auxiliary by his ratty hair and SMASHES 
           his head into a rock. She looks up and notices --

           A Roman approaching with a CLUB. She turns -- there’s another 
           Roman. To the left, another. To the right, another. She’s 
           surrounded -- this time, horseless and weaponless. 

           The Roman raises the club and SWINGS -- Boudicca DUCKS. The 
           others brandish clubs, and they all start swinging. Boudicca 
           keeps dodging, a mouse in the grip of vicious cats, until --
           A CRACK to her leg sends her to her knees, and a subsequent 
           WHACK to the head dims her lights.

           In her waning POV, she’s slumped over the withers of a horse. 
           The trees BLUR and finally, we...

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. PLAINS - DAY

           We’re looking through the bars of a cage at the spooling 
           landscape. Chains RATTLE. We realize the cage is on wheels, 
           and it’s part of a massive convoy of ROMAN SOLDIERS.

           Our POV is that of Boudicca, her face battered, hair matted 
           with blood, now a captive of the Romans.

           INT. DOMUS NERO - CORRIDOR - DAY

           We follow Agrippina down a corridor. Approaching from the 
           other direction is the songbird Claudia. She curtsies.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        My Lady...

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Good day.

           Agrippina keeps walking.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        If you’re looking for Nero, he’s 
                        resting.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        I have a message he’ll wake to 
                        hear.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        If it’s of Boudicca’s capture, I’ve 
                        already relayed it.

           Agrippina stops. She might be ready to choke a bitch...

           Behind her, Claudia smiles, relishing the power she holds 
           over Agrippina. Agrippina sets her jaw and carries on.

           EXT. THIRD CELTIC CAMP - DAY

           The remaining Celts have made temporary camp of a clearing, 
           one side protected by a large rock wall.

           All hands on deck help the numerous wounded. Buckets of blood 
           and blood-soaked cloths are discarded like a factory line.
                                 MÁIRE
                        They'll kill her, won’t they?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        No one’s killin’ your mum without 
                        her say.

           Áedán wipes a tear from Máire’s face. She smiles weakly and 
           wraps her arms around Áedán. He hugs her back, but his face 
           betrays his worry.

           INT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - MARTINA’S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

           Martina helps her younger daughter dress. The elder daughter 
           appears from a curtain in a dress exposing budding cleavage.

                                 MARTINA
                        What is that?

                                 ELDER DAUGHTER
                        My body.

                                 YOUNGER DAUGHTER
                        Mum, look. Do you think it’s her?

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, Martina sees the ROMAN ARMY approaching.

           INT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - DAY

           Suetonius strides down a marble corridor, flanked by GUARDS.

           INT. LONDINIUM PRISON

           Suetonius descends a stone staircase flanked by glistering 
           sconces, into the bowels of the estate.  

           An IRON GATE grinds open. Suetonius enters. A row of dank 
           PRISON CELLS await him. He walks past the recalcitrant 
           PRISONERS, trapped in varying degrees of deranged minds.

           He stops at the final cell, so small and dark, the contents 
           aren’t visible.

           A GUARD inserts key in lock and heaves open the cell door. 
           ANOTHER GUARD lights a torch from a sconce and hands it to 
           Suetonius. He steps inside and holds out the torch to see:

           Nothing. Suddenly --

           He’s TACKLED from behind. Boudicca sinks her teeth into 
           Suetonius’s neck. Suetonius SHAKES Boudicca to the ground. 

           The Guards jump in, seize Boudicca, and with a CRACK to the 
           jaw, they subdue her.
                                 SUETONIUS
                        That’s enough.

           Suetonius straightens up, as Boudicca is chained to the wall. 
           She devours him with a look like a rabid wolf with its jaws.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        It’s good to see there’s fight left 
                        in you. You’ll need it.

           Suetonius motions to the Guards.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Have your way. Just make sure she’s 
                        able to stand by morning.

           The Guards descend, lascivious. Suetonius leaves, Boudicca’s 
           fierce protests playing him out...

           LATER

           Boudicca is inanimate. A Guard closes his trousers. Another 
           enters with a KNIFE. Boudicca regards it dispassionately.

           They grab her by the hair and force her to sit, her hands 
           chained to the wall. The Guard begins SLICING through 
           Boudicca’s hair. Long swathes fall. She doesn’t look, doesn’t 
           fight, dead in the eyes.

           INT. LONDINIUM CIRCUS - DAY

           The stadium is packed with CHEERING, bloodthirsty PATRONS.

           Lightly-armed RETIARII lie slain in the dirt, as their 
           heavily-armed opponents, the MURMILLONES, gloat, victorious.

           And that was just the opening number.

           Suetonius and Martina settle in their seats.

           The slain are cleared from the arena. HORNS sound. An 
           anticipatory hush falls on the crowd. After a moment --

           A LION tears out of the stadium, blood streaming from between 
           his shoulder blades. Then --

           Boudicca emerges, ravaged from a hellish night, her hair 
           choppily shorn, armed with a SPEAR.

           Martina moves to the edge of her seat.

           Boudicca creeps toward the tiger, when a ROCK is hurled from 
           obscurity, hitting the lion. He sees Boudicca, GROWLS --

           Suetonius watches, unmoved, as --
           The lion CHARGES Boudicca. She stands her ground until the 
           last second, then cuts left and tosses her spear -- THWAP!

           It embeds between the lion’s shoulders. He stumbles. Boudicca 
           draws from her thigh sheath a DAGGER.

           The lion tosses his head, trying to shake the spear. As 
           Boudicca nears, he ROARS. Just then --

           A TIGER comes BARRELING out of the stadium, heading straight 
           for Boudicca. It looks like curtains for Boudicca --

           Martina closes her eyes, when --

           Boudicca JUMPS over the tiger’s head and lands on its back, 
           clinging, as the tiger tears around the arena. She STABS it 
           repeatedly in the neck.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Impossible...

           Martina opens her eyes. 

           The tiger wanes, his crisp, orange stripes now a sticky smear 
           of rust. Boudicca climbs off. The tiger collapses. 

           Boudicca moves to his head and strokes it, then buries her 
           dagger in his heart.

           The lion wanders over. Boudicca backs off. The lion TEARS a 
           chunk out of the tiger’s side. LAUGHTER from the audience.

           Suetonius CURSES under his breath, storms off.

           A HORN summons silence. All eyes on Suetonius’s seat, empty. 
           Martina stands in her husband’s stead. She locks eyes with 
           Boudicca, nods.

           Boudicca erects her spear, victorious. JEERS rattle the 
           stadium, as Boudicca is dragged out.

           INT. LONDINIUM PRISON - NIGHT

           Boudicca is slumped against the corner of the cell, 
           motionless, but awake, the whites of her eyes stark.

           FOOTSTEPS echo down the hall, approaching. Moments later --

           A key inserts in Boudicca’s cell’s lock. The door grinds 
           open. A VISITOR steps in. The Visitor lights a MATCH, locates 
           Boudicca, illuminates his own face --

           The funerary mask of Suetonius. The Visitor removes the mask 
           and pulls down a cloak to reveal:

           Martina. She beholds Boudicca in a kind of curious awe.
           Boudicca is silent. Martina furnishes a piece of FRUIT. She 
           hands it to Boudicca, who promptly THROWS IT at the wall.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’ll take a violent death before 
                        thousands, over a merciful death 
                        alone.

                                 MARTINA
                        It wasn’t poisoned.

           Martina scrapes the remaining fruit from the floor, eats it.

                                 MARTINA (CONT’D)
                        Then you know you face death.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Bet you’ve never been this close to 
                        a barbarian. Go on, get a good 
                        look.

                                 MARTINA
                        I’m here to release you.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Why?

                                 MARTINA
                        A Roman woman has no rights. You 
                        give me hope yet for freedom.

           A beat as Boudicca digests the idolatry.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I’ve checked every brick for a 
                        tunnel. There’s no way out ‘cept 
                        through the bars, and there’s no 
                        doin’ that so long as those Guards 
                        are there.

                                 MARTINA
                        I put them to sleep.

           Martina coaxes Boudicca to the bars to look. Boudicca crawls, 
           skeptically, and sees, down the aisle --

           The three Guards are passed out on the floor.

           Martina furnishes a bag of little CAKES.

                                 MARTINA (CONT’D)
                        This is the poison.
           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - NIGHT

           Boudicca and Martina emerge from the ground by way of a hole 
           in the ground, into falling snow. Boudicca looks back -- the 
           estate is far in the distance.

                                 MARTINA
                        The way out, in case of a fire.

           Martina directs Boudicca to a tree, where a HORSE awaits. 
           Boudicca mounts. Martina gives Boudicca her cape for warmth.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        How can I repay you?

                                 MARTINA
                        Please spare my husband.

           Boudicca spurs her horse and is off. Martina watches her go.

           EXT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - SUETONIUS’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

           Martina enters quietly and creeps around the bed. Suetonius 
           appears to be sleeping, when --

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Where have you been?

                                 MARTINA
                        I fell asleep with Julia.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        I stopped in her room before I came 
                        to bed. I didn’t see you.

                                 MARTINA
                        Not our daughter, Julia. The whore.

           Martina glides to Suetonius’s side and strokes his face. 
           Suetonius SEIZES Martina’s wrist.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Where was my invitation?

           Martina climbs to a straddle over her husband, imbued with a 
           newfound power.

                                 MARTINA
                        I was feeling greedy.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        What’s got into you?

                                 MARTINA
                        Just her fingers. I’m ready for 
                        more.
           Suetonius ignites, pulls Martina in for a kiss...

           EXT. THIRD CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           Somnolent woods. Thick snow blankets the ground and trees. 
           Skeletal limbs SNAP under the weight. 

           The Celts are bundled in furs around fires.

           The mood is subdued, lethargic, almost hopeless. So much so, 
           that no one notices, when a horse rides into camp with 
           Boudicca atop it --

           Her limbs are bare, fingers frostbitten. A cloak conceals her 
           head. She dismounts and immediately collapses to her knees.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Mum!

           Máire rushes over, bringing everyone’s attention to their 
           weary queen. Elsha sees, and her face drains. Áedán sees, and 
           his harrow is eclipsed by the most genuine of smiles.

           Máire flings her own fur on her mother’s shoulders and wraps 
           her arms around her in a vehement embrace. Over Máire’s 
           shoulder, Boudicca locks eyes with Elsha.

           Máire releases Boudicca and helps her to her feet. Elsha 
           starts walking away.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Elsha.

           Elsha stops, a quiet panic.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        We’ll have a word.

           Elsha turns, trudges through the snow, all eyes on her, until 
           she’s standing before Boudicca.

                                 ELSHA
                        Yes, my Queen.

           Boudicca PUNCHES Elsha in the face. Elsha staggers, hand to 
           her mouth. Boudicca approaches and SOCKS Elsha again, then 
           SHOVES her to the ground. She circles her curled body.

                                 BOUDICCA
                          (to the Celts)
                        This woman is a traitor. She freed 
                        a Roman prisoner, who gave our 
                        plans to the very man who’s been 
                        tasked with seein’ to our death. If 
                        you’re angry for your losses in the 
                        forest, grab a stone and have your 
                        way.
           Celts crouch in unison, start digging in the snow for ROCKS.

           Elsha scrapes herself to her knees. Boudicca KICKS Elsha in 
           the stomach -- she collapses.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you do it?

           Boudicca drops down on all fours, her ear to Elsha’s mouth.

                                 ELSHA
                        Swear I didn’t know he’d tell ‘em. 
                        Planned to meet him in Londinium.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        And then what?

                                 ELSHA
                        We’d marry. My boy would have a 
                        father.

           Boudicca fixes on Elsha, wanting to hate. Instead, she sees 
           the sincerity. And as a mother and a woman, she empathizes.

           Boudicca rises to her feet. The Celts ready their rocks. 
           Boudicca holds up a barring hand.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        She’s offered to bring a message of 
                        ours to the Romans.

           Elsha looks up at Boudicca, grateful.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve accepted.

           LATER

           Máire evens Boudicca’s choppy haircut with a knife.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Lucky your head’s a good shape.

           Boudicca looks at her reflection in the water. She’s now 
           completely bald. She regards the image, impassivity 
           concealing deep humiliation.

                                 BOUDICCAag
                        Got all yours, must’ve kissed that 
                        boy.

                                 MÁIRE
                        He kissed me.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Good lad.
                                 MÁIRE
                          (beat)
                        There’s a lad been waitin’ for you.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He should’ve come for me.

                                 MÁIRE
                        He wouldn’t leave me alone.

           Boudicca considers the sweetness of those words to herself.

                                 MÁIRE (CONT’D)
                        Won’t you marry him already? If not 
                        for any reason than to shut him up. 
                        Been pinin’ for you long’s you been 
                        away. Everyone’s sick of hearin’.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        He’s not asked me proper.

                                 MÁIRE
                        He’s scared you’ll say no.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        What do I want with a man who’s 
                        scared of me?

                                 MÁIRE
                        The man you want don’t exist, and 
                        you’ve made it that way on purpose. 
                        That man loves you more’n anyone’s 
                        ever loved another. Just sayin’.

           Off Boudicca, stubbornly considering the truth here...

           EXT. THIRD CELTIC CAMP - NIGHT

           Boudicca sits with Áedán by the light of a fire, her head 
           still covered. She prods the flames with a stick.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        If you don’t tell me, I’ll assume 
                        the worst.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        And if you’re right, am I sullied 
                        goods?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        If you think that’s how I’d feel, 
                        you don’t know me from a boar. 

           Áedán stands.
                                 ÁEDÁN (CONT’D)
                        I’m real sorry for what happened, 
                        but I won’t be treated like this.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Like how?

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Like I’m foolish to love you, when 
                        lovin’ you makes sense of why I’m 
                        even here.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        People die. Ought to find a more 
                        lasting reason to justify your 
                        existence.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Love transcends life. So, I don’t 
                        need one.

           Áedán starts walking away.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        I do love you.

           Áedán turns around.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Then let me kiss you.

           Boudicca lingers in uncertainty. Áedán takes the invitation, 
           rushes back to Boudicca, cradles her face with both hands and 
           slips the cloak from her head. 

           She closes her eyes, humiliated. Áedán takes her in, rendered 
           silent by her beauty, then pulls her in for a kiss.

           INT. LONDINIUM PRISON - MORNING

           Suetonius stands before Boudicca’s empty cell. The Guards 
           cower in the corridor. Suetonius’s PERSONAL GUARDS flank him.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        You saw nothing?

           Nervous nods from the Prison Guards.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        As if to say she had a cloak that 
                        made her invisible, such that she 
                        slipped right by you, unnoticed.

           Half-hearted nods. SNICKERS from prisoners. Suetonius’s 
           Guards descend with clubs, BASHING hands gripping bars.
                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                          (to the prisoners)
                        If any of you have something to 
                        offer, I will delay your execution. 

                                 PRISONER
                        It’s a better offer to kill us 
                        today.

           Suetonius turns back to the Guards.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Perhaps you fell asleep? An honest 
                        mistake...

           The Guards struggle to recall. They shake their heads.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you were pleasuring 
                        yourselves?
                          (off head shakes)
                        Help me understand.

           GUARD 1 looks troubled, like he’s receiving a vision.

                                 GUARD 2
                        We can’t remember anything, 
                        Governor.

           QUICK FLASH: Blurry, the death mask moving down the corridor.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        You. What is it?

                                 GUARD 1
                        ...A dead person.

           Suetonius is deadpan. Can’t believe this shit.

                                 SUETONIUS
                          (to his Guards)
                        Have them replaced.
                          (beat)
                        Killed, then replaced.

           Suetonius starts back through the corridor, while in the 
           background, his Guards make quick work of SLITTING THE 
           THROATS of the Prison Guards. 

           As Suetonius passes through the iron gates, his eyes narrow. 
           He turns, sees the three bleeding out on the floor, races 
           back to Guard 1 and seizes him by the collar.

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Who was he? The dead man. Think. A 
                        face you remembered living.

           Guard 1’s mouth spews blood, and with it:
                                 GUARD 1
                        Y-you...

           His eyes roll back in his head. He’s dead. Suetonius lets go.

           EXT. THIRD CELTIC CAMP - EVENING

           Candles are strung from twine between snowy trees. Smoke from 
           a roasting PIG clouds and perfumes the dusk.

           The sound of the bone flute, courtesy of Óengus, rises over 
           the tempest of crackling fat, a primitive, but ethereal 
           wonderland, host to --

           A marriage ceremony. Boudicca and Áedán stand beneath the 
           bough of a pine. The Blind Man presides. The rest of the 
           tribe is gathered to witness. The Blind Man nods to Máire.

           Máire brings an OATHING STONE, places it atop a CAIRN.

                                 BLIND MAN
                        May this stone bring the wisdom of 
                        the land and the blessin’ of the 
                        spirits of our ancestors to the 
                        start of your new life together.
                          (then)
                        Will the lovers join hands.

           Áedán takes Boudicca’s hands in his. The Blind Man binds them 
           with cloth, the third-to-last of the Druidess’s visions.

                                 BLIND MAN (CONT’D)
                        You are blood of my blood and bone 
                        of my bone.

                       BOUDICCA
           You are the blood of my blood 
           and bone of my bone.
                                                    ÁEDÁN
                                         You are the blood of my blood 
                                         and bone of my bone.

                                 BLIND MAN (CONT’D)
                        I give you my body, that we two 
                        might be one.

                       BOUDICCA
           I give you my body, that we 
           two might be one.
                                                    ÁEDÁN
                                         I give you my body, that we 
                                         two might be one.

                                 BLIND MAN (CONT’D)
                        I give you my spirit, ‘til our life 
                        shall be done.

                       BOUDICCA
                                                    ÁEDÁN
           I give you my spirit, ‘til 
           our life shall be done.
                                         I give you my spirit, ‘til 
                                         our life shall be done.

                                 BLIND MAN (CONT’D)
                        May kiss your bride.
           Áedán pulls Boudicca in for a kiss. The Celts WHOOP and 
           CHEER. Celebratory music and dancing begins.

           Áedán SCOOPS Boudicca in his arms and carries her off.

           Máire beams upon the union, finds Judoc flashing a grin in 
           her direction. She blushes. He holds out a bent arm.

           Máire hooks her arm in his and off they go, stomping, 
           whirling, and off this unencumbered gaiety, we --

                                                         FADE TO:

           INT. DOMUS NERO - NERO’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

           Nero sits at his desk, engrossed in an architect’s plans for 
           his grand Golden House, when KNOCKS arrive at the door.

                                 NERO
                        Enter.

           The door opens and Agrippina enters, wearing a sheer robe. 
           Nero looks, momentarily enraptured by her visible curves...

                                 NERO (CONT’D)
                        I’m occupied.

           He looks back at his plans.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        What consumes you?

           Agrippina leans over Nero, the neck of her robe exposing the 
           curve of her breast. Nero fights the urge to look.

                                 NERO
                        It’s not finished. They'll need to 
                        expand my bedchamber, widen the 
                        corridors, and in the garden, I’ll 
                        need lights...

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Fit for a man as noble as my son.

           Nero pushes himself away from the desk, stands, a blatant 
           rejection -- and paces, in deep consideration of his plans. 

           Agrippina’s frustration mounts at her failed seduction.

                                 AGRIPPINA (CONT’D)
                        The truth is that Rome cannot 
                        afford to demolish the existing 
                        residences on the Palatine Hill, to 
                        build your vision.

                                 NERO
                        Says...?
                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Your Treasurer. And your council of 
                        advisors, of which there are seven 
                        eager to speak with you. But it 
                        appears a slave girl and a palace 
                        are priorities over the expansion 
                        of your Empire.

                                 NERO
                        You killed your own husband and 
                        installed me on the throne because 
                        you saw power for yourself. I have 
                        news for you, mother, you will 
                        never be Boudicca.

           Faustus enters, catches the tail end of this.

                                 FAUSTUS
                        Apologies, Emperor, I bring dire 
                        news.

                                 NERO
                        Then why waste time with an 
                        introduction!?

                                 FAUSTUS
                        Boudicca has escaped from 
                        Londinium.

           Faustus bows, scurries out. Agrippina SLAPS Nero. Her ring 
           catches his skin. His lip bleeds... DRIP, DRIP, onto his 
           plans. Agrippina straightens up, reclaiming power.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Tell the Governor to recapture 
                        Boudicca, or his family will be 
                        killed.

           Agrippina leaves. Nero stares at his blood-splattered plans, 
           delirious. After a moment, he SMEARS the blood with his hand, 
           his eyes lit with inspiration...

           EXT. THIRD CELTIC CAMP - MORNING

           Boudicca’s army is lined up. She moves among the rows, 
           surmising the strength. Frostbitten extremities, bandaged 
           heads and hands, sunken eyes and cavernous cheeks. Not good. 

           She glances at the rest of the tribe, the ELDERLY, the 
           HANDICAPPED and the YOUNG, as if contemplating how morally 
           abhorrent it would be to recruit them to fight. 

           She moves off the idea. But then --

                                 JUDOC (O.S.)
                        Let us fight with you.
           Judoc steps forward. Others follow.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Please.

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Let us.

           The Blind Man steps forward.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        You can’t even see.

                                 BLIND MAN
                        No eyes, no fear.

           And then, among the crowd appears the GHOST of Clíona, 
           delicate as an angel in a white tunic. She smiles. Boudicca 
           is struck. She reaches out her hand -- Clíona disappears.

           Máire steps forward and meets her mother’s eyes with 
           uncompromising steel.

           INT. LONDINIUM COLUMBARIA - DAY

           Suetonius enters the chamber. With a torch, he illuminates 
           the memorial plaques and masks of the deceased.

           Suetonius scans for his slot. The mask is missing. The “T” in 
           his name has been made into a CROSS in BLOOD...

           EXT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - COURTYARD - DAY

           Suetonius moves through the courtyard, harrowed, when he’s 
           intercepted by SOLDIERS dragging a battered Elsha in chains.

           One of the soldiers holds her baby, who’s WAILING.

                                 ROMAN SOLDIER
                        From Boudicca’s camp. She has a 
                        message. Boudicca proposes a battle 
                        at the Midlands.

                                 SUETONIUS
                          (beat)
                        Accept.

           Suetonius starts off, when he hears:

                                 ELSHA
                        Take me to Varus. Please.

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Of course.
                          (to Soldiers)
                        See that she’s taken to Varus.
           EXT. THIRD CELTIC CAMP - DAY

           Battle preparations are underway in the background. The young 
           men, including Judoc, receive their first WARRIOR TATTOOS.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           She receives a beautiful new falcata from Óengus, when --

           Áedán WHISTLES from atop a horse. Boudicca kisses Óengus on 
           the cheek. He blushes. Boudicca runs to Áedán.

                                 ÁEDÁN
                        Get on.

           Boudicca mounts behind, and they take off through the trees.

           EXT. EDGE OF WOODS

           The open plains reveal a mass of men riding toward the Celts. 

                                 BOUDICCA
                        We’ll fight with what we have.

           Áedán doesn’t budge, keeps his eyes narrowed on the horizon.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        You plan to take ‘em alone?

           As the riders near, they materialize as lithe, armor-less, 
           heavily tattooed bodies -- fellow Celts. Closer yet, the 
           rider at the front is clearly, the Catuvellauni Chief.

           He rides up to face Boudicca and Áedán.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        Changed your mind, then?

                                 CATUVELLAUNI CHIEF
                        A coward’s no pride anyway.

           Off mutual smiles --

           INT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - BATHROOM - EVENING

           A HANDMAIDEN helps Elsha into a GOWN. Elsha looks in the 
           mirror, smiles. Her baby sits on a chair nearby.

                                 HANDMAIDEN
                        I’ll watch your boy.

           Elsha gives her son a kiss. The Handmaiden opens the door, 
           where a GUARD waits. Elsha follows the Guard, through the 
           estate, until RAUCOUSNESS from the dining room can be heard.
           The Guard opens the door. Elsha hesitates, nervous, excited, 
           smooths her gown, then walks through the door, into --

           INT. SUETONIUS’S ESTATE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Two dozen of Suetonius’s LEGIONARIES are seated at the long 
           table, including Lucius, Pristus and the former POW Varus. 

           CELTIC WHORES in Roman garb are dripping from the shoulders 
           of the soldiers, dangling grapes in their mouths. 

           Elsha finds Varus, sucking wine out of the cleavage of one of 
           the whores. Her heart sinks.

                                 ROMAN SOLDIER
                        You. Come here.

           Elsha attempts a break for the exit, but the Guard subdues 
           her. Tears erupt, as she’s dragged to the Soldier.

           INT. DOMUS NERO - AGRIPPINA’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

           Agrippina sits by her window, gazing out at the splendor of 
           Rome from atop Palatine Hill. She sips wine.

           The door opens. She doesn’t look, but holds out her glass.

           After a beat, she looks over her shoulder, and sees --

           Three MEN dressed in black, holding CLUBS: ASSASSINS.

                                 AGRIPPINA
                        Won’t you join me for a drink?

           The Assassins advance. Agrippina sets down the glass and 
           calmly, seductively, unpins her hair.

                                 AGRIPPINA (CONT’D)
                        He always liked it loose.

           The Assassins descend, Agrippina’s fate sealed, and we --

                                                          CUT TO:

           EXT. PLAINS - DAY

           CAW! An EAGLE soars across the leaden sky. The Celtic Army, 
           faces blue and greasy with animal fat, hair white with lime 
           mead, or wearing ANIMAL HEADS, march through heavy sleet.
           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           The Roman Army, led by Suetonius, marches in neat columns, 
           their numbers TRIPLE those of the Celtic Army. An AQUILIFER 
           carries a pole, atop which is mounted a BRONZE EAGLE.

           EXT. MIDLANDS - DAY

           The Celts line up, the woods to their back, some bearing 
           TORCHES. Across a thick blanket of snow, are the Romans.

           WITH THE ROMANS

           The Romans wait in formation, ARCHERS kneeling in front, 
           INFANTRY with pila (javelins) behind them, and CAVALRY behind 
           them. Many among the ranks are Celts (Auxiliaries).

           Suetonius is in front, atop a sleek, black, decorated horse. 
           He wheels the horse around to face the Celts and SHOUTS --

                                 SUETONIUS
                        Surrender now and everyone walks 
                        away with life!

           WITH THE CELTS

           Boudicca hears Suetonius and ignores him. She rides across 
           the line of Celts, as THUNDER rattles the glowering sky.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Heaven’s on the side of a righteous 
                        vengeance. 
                          (beat)
                        Do not be disheartened when you see 
                        the glint of the Roman armor and 
                        the sharpness of their steel, for 
                        it’s not the strength of the weapon 
                        that makes a man a warrior, it’s 
                        the strength of his soul. Let us 
                        show the Romans that a heart that 
                        beats for freedom is stronger than 
                        a heart that beats for greed.
                          (beat)
                        I called for this battle, knowin’ 
                        it’d be all or nothin’ for our 
                        cause. Victory or defeat, if at the 
                        end of this battle, the snow is 
                        stained with Celtic blood, we’ve 
                        returned to our rightful place. But 
                        first, let us fight for it.

           The Celts bow their heads in unison.

                                 CELTIC WARRIORS
                          (in chorus)
                        Consecrate my sword, and strengthen 
                        the arm that wields it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CELTIC WARRIORS (CONT'D)
                        Make fear a stranger, and bless me 
                        as you send my soul to battle.

           With that, Judoc erects the CARNYX, a bronze horse head with 
           an open mouth, mounted on a long pole. He blows into the 
           bottom of the pole, and from the horse’s mouth bellows --

           WITH THE ROMANS

           A deep, haunting sound, followed by a chorus of belligerent 
           CRIES. As the familiar noise hits their ears, the 
           Auxiliaries’ faces betray their conflicted loyalty. 

                                 SUETONIUS
                        This barbarian represents an 
                        affront to Rome’s honor, to Rome’s 
                        benevolence and to Rome’s 
                        sovereignty. Let her fate be an 
                        example to all those who dare spit 
                        in the face of so mighty, so 
                        glorious an Empire.

           Another CRACK of THUNDER. Suetonius regards the Heavens, 
           uneasy. He raises his arm. Archers poise their bows --

           WITH THE CELTS

           The Celts duck and hold their wooden shields above their 
           heads. Silence, then ARROWS WHIR on approach and THWAP into 
           the wood, some into horses’ necks, others into Celts’ limbs.

           The Celts emerge and CHEER, weapons raised. Boudicca raises 
           her spear, and at that, they CHARGE, the light of torches 
           RIPPING through the grey --

           Halfway across the field, a volley of JAVELINS set sail. The 
           Celts mount the shields on their backs like turtles and keep 
           charging, HURLING through the snow --

           But the javelins EMBED in the shields --

           From the Celtic side, catapults hurl heavy stones --

           WITH THE ROMANS

           They duck under shields -- the boulders BEND or RUPTURE the 
           steel. Suetonius gives the signal for another volley.

           WITH THE CELTS

           They struggle to remove the javelins from their shields. 
           Áedán STOMPS on a few, breaking them in half, when --

           A second barrage careens toward them. SCHICK! THWAP! Warriors 
           and horses are impaled, many fall.

           Boudicca raises her spear again. The Celts advance. Snow 
           falls harder, the fog so thick, it’s viscous --
           WITH THE ROMANS

           Suetonius signals the infantry and cavalry.

           ON THE BATTLEFIELD

           The distance between the Celts and the Romans closes, each 
           side running at full tilt, until --

           The forces CLASH, melting into one malignant mass, as 
           torrents of blood SLOSH on the snow and the middle collapses 
           like a buckling bridge, a staggering number dead instantly.

           Steel sparks fly. Heads are SMASHED by hooves.

           Óengus SLITS a gut, YANKS the bowels and TWIRLS like a 
           dancer, wrapping the entrails around himself as they unravel. 

           The Blind Man hurls an axe wildly, no eyes, no fear -- Celts 
           duck from his warpath, Romans succumb to his blade, until --

           A flying axe slices his head off -- his head rotates several 
           times, long hair WHIPPING in circles, and in his suspended 
           POV, we see a SLOW MOTION, 360 view of the battle, then --

           SMASH BACK to REAL TIME, WITH BOUDICCA

           Her white horse is splattered red. She spots a familiar face -
           - Pristus, the man who killed Clíona -- and rides like hell.

           As she nears, Pristus sees Boudicca and drops his reins. She 
           drives her spear right through his stomach, rides past, grabs 
           the spear from its exit point and YANKS it out --

           Meanwhile, Máire deftly navigates the chariot with the Slave 
           inside -- he HACKS Romans as they fly past.

           But Lucius has spotted her. Máire sees him --

                                 MÁIRE
                          (to the Slave)
                        Hold on!

           The Slave braces. Máire VEERS her pony to the side, evading 
           Lucius. The Slave takes an ARROW to the back.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           Her horse takes a SPEAR to the chest. He REARS. Boudicca rubs 
           his neck gently with her hand, as he collapses to his knees.

           Boudicca dismounts. An Auxiliary rushes her, wielding an AXE.

           Áedán sees this from afar, poises an arrow in his bow and --
           SHICK! Pierces the axe-wielding Roman’s eye. 
           Áedán jogs to Boudicca. Behind him, she sees a Roman 
           galloping. She brandishes a dagger, THROWS it -- it rotates 
           just past Áedán’s head and embeds in the Roman’s throat.

           They linger a moment, both reluctant to admit gratitude -- 
           weak smiles suffice. They each turn and face new opponents. 
           Boudicca takes two at once, fells both at the same time --

           CHOP! Áedán severs a Roman’s spine. The Roman convulses.

           Boudicca throws her spear at a sprinting Roman -- it 
           punctures his belly -- he falls --

           She races to retrieve her spear and gets SIDE-SWIPED by a 
           Roman horse. The metal of the stirrup SMASHES her temple -- 
           she falls, out cold, Áedán nowhere in sight.

           WITH LUCIUS

           He aims a bow and fires an arrow at the axle of Máire’s 
           wheel, which SNAPS the arrow. He fires another. This time, 
           the wheel’s disabled --

           Máire’s pony screeches to a halt -- he spins and SNAPS his 
           yoke -- the chariot FLIPS and ejects Máire.

           WITH ÓENGUS

           He grabs a Roman by the tunic, goes to town with a dagger, 
           RUPTURES the carotid -- it SPURTS -- Óengus drinks the blood 
           like water from a fountain. 

           Óengus casts the Roman to the ground and turns, his face 
           dripping red, sees --

           Lucius riding hell for leather toward Máire --

           WITH MÁIRE

           Lucius SEIZES Máire by the hair, drags her to her feet.

           Óengus races in pursuit. Lucius HURLS an axe at Óengus, who 
           dodges, gains on Lucius, but --

           An arrow pierces his back. He stumbles, keeps running. 
           Another arrow. He slows, staggers, watching helplessly, as 
           Lucius makes off with Máire. 

           At last, he falls to his knees in the snow.

           IN THE TREES

           Lucius starts taking down his pants. Máire THRASHES, BITES 
           and SCREAMS -- 

           Lucius WHACKS her in the head with a STONE. She falls 
           unconscious. He hikes up her tunic, then --
           His body tenses. Behind him we see Judoc. A spear is embedded 
           in Lucius’s back. 

           Lucius lets go of Máire and staggers to his feet to fight. 
           Judoc grabs a LOG and WHACKS Lucius in the head.

           Judoc runs to Máire’s side and moves her head to his lap. 

                                 JUDOC
                        Máire. Do you hear me?

           Doesn’t appear so. For lack of a better idea, he KISSES her 
           lips. She doesn’t stir. It seems he was too late...

           But then, her eyes open. Judoc grins.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           (The following sequence is an echo of our opening.)

           Her eyes are closed, countenance peaceful. She’s on her back. 
           She could be an angel ascending to Heaven, when --

           Her eyes fly open, as if waking from a dream, in time to see 
           a pilum HURLING toward her from that very Heaven --

           She rolls over. The spear PLUNGES into the snow, inches from 
           her head. Boudicca scrambles to her feet, YANKS her spear 
           from the stomach of the dead Roman and turns to face --

           Another SOLDIER careening toward her, sword raised. They 
           CLASH, steel against wood. In a sequence of QUICK CUTS, she 
           disarms him, brandishes a falcata and CLEAVES his helmet in 
           two -- fireworks of BLOOD and BRAINS --

           Boudicca looks over her shoulder, blood melting off her 
           animal fat-greased face, as --

           The carnage around her reaches an operatic crescendo, flesh 
           SIZZLES from fire, blood escapes from a neck like folds of 
           red silk, bodies arch and slump and whirl and fall, like a 
           stirring, frenetic ballet, when --

           A Roman sword grazes her neck, SLICING her necklace -- 

           In SLOW MOTION, the triskele falls -- BAM! Imprinting in the 
           snow -- the penultimate of the Druidess’s visions.

           In REAL TIME, Boudicca dodges another attempt, drops to her 
           knees and recovers the triskele.

           She stands up, sees the number of Celts standing are few. The 
           Roman numbers are still vast.

           Through her eyes, we descend into --
           EXT. ICENI VILLAGE - EVENING - FLASHBACK

           The Druidess pursues Boudicca.

                                 DRUIDESS
                        That’s not the course.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        Said they weren’t clear, the 
                        images.

           The Druidess falls quiet.

                                 BOUDICCA (CONT’D)
                        What is it you saw me doin’?

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RESUME

           Boudicca has her charge. Resolved, she turns to see --

           Máire is running toward her. Together, they fall to their 
           knees. Boudicca presses the triskele in Máire’s hands.

           She pulls Máire’s head to her bosom and lingers in a kiss on 
           Máire’s head. She releases Máire and stands.

                                 MÁIRE
                        Mum, don’t go.

                                 BOUDICCA
                        It’s not far I’m goin’.

           Boudicca swings herself on a horse and rides across the 
           battlefield, toward the Roman side. Máire watches --

                                 MÁIRE
                        No!

           Boudicca gallops through a veil of falling snow, a falcata in 
           one hand, a spear in the other --

           WITH SUETONIUS

           He smirks upon the slaughter, raises an arm to send another 
           barrage of CAVALRY out for the death blow, when --

           Through the snow he sees Boudicca, galloping full speed 
           toward him -- her horse’s legs pumping to his chest, as he 
           barrels through the deep snow --

           Boudicca’s mouth is open, a MUTED SCREAM --

           Suetonius sobers, brandishes a SWORD.

           SOLDIERS tool up, an ARCHER raises a bow -- forty-odd Romans 
           bracing for the wrath of a single woman --
                                 SUETONIUS
                        Hold.

           WITH ÁEDÁN

           He sees Boudicca, starts fighting his way toward her --

           WITH SUETONIUS

           He watches Boudicca SLASHING and IMPALING passing Romans. 
           Hell hath no fury like this. The Archer looks to Suetonius 
           for permission to fire --

           INTERCUT WITH BOUDICCA

           THWAP! She takes an arrow to the shoulder, keeps riding.

           The Archer readies another arrow -- SLING!

           She takes another arrow to the stomach, keeps riding --

           Suetonius watches Boudicca, undeterred --

                                 SUETONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Surrender!

           Boudicca presses on. Suetonius orders a third strike.

           The Archer poises his bow, the CREAK of the sinew stretching, 
           as he perfects his aim --

           The third arrow pierces Boudicca’s heart. She drops her 
           weapons. Her horse keeps galloping, Boudicca stays astride, 
           her arms limp, until --

           Two Roman Soldiers SEIZE her and DRAG her from her horse.

           WITH MÁIRE

           Judoc restrains her from running.

                                 MÁIRE
                        She’s lettin’ ‘em kill her.

                                 JUDOC
                        Aye. To spare us.

           Suetonius stalks toward his prey and sizes her up. Blood 
           trickles from Boudicca’s mouth -- the Druidess’s final image.

           Suetonius crouches before her, relishing her struggle for 
           air. After a moment, he motions to the TRUMPET PLAYER.

           WITH ÁEDÁN

           He fights with savage lust, advancing on another Roman, when 
           the echo of the Roman trumpet abrades the sulking sky.
           The Roman backs off. Áedán lowers his weapon.

           WITH ÓENGUS

           His bone flute is on a string around his neck, buried in the 
           snow. He looks to be dead. But hearing the trumpet, he lifts 
           the flute to this lips and with his dying breath, he BLOWS.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           The feeble melody reaches her ears and provokes a slight 
           smile, blood coating her teeth.

           Suetonius grips the arrow pinning Boudicca’s heart. With the 
           last of her strength, she wraps her hand around his and helps 
           him push it deeper. Her eyes stay open, evanescent --

           WITH ÁEDÁN

           The Romans retreat to their side. The surviving Celts recede 
           in a reluctant promenade. Áedán stays put, watching --

           A flock of BIRDS make an arc across the sky.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           Suetonius extracts the arrow. Boudicca falls forward, cheek 
           to the snow. Nearby, a faint apparition --

           Boudicca, age eight, her face blood-spattered, the way she 
           watched her Father die -- now watching herself succumb.

           WITH ÁEDÁN

           He watches the birds disappear through a hole in the clouds, 
           into a ray of celestial light.

           WITH BOUDICCA

           Lifeless. Her soul has fled her body.

                                                         FADE TO:

           INT. FORUM ROMANUM - DAY

           CLOSE ON Agrippina’s funerary mask. Nero stands over the 
           pyre, gazing upon his mother’s wax visage.

           He descends the steps. Faustus intercepts him.

                                 FAUSTUS
                        Emperor, news from Briton. Boudicca 
                        has been defeated.
                                 NERO
                        Do you hear that, Mother?
                          (to Faustus, re: 
                           Agrippina)
                        She was beautiful.

           Nero takes a seat beside Claudia, as a SPEAKER ascends the 
           platform. Claudia reaches for Nero’s hand.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        She did not want for enemies.

           Her reassurance fails to offset eyes that betray her guilt.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           HORSE HOOVES stomp and scrape the mud.

           Máire rides before a group of CELTIC WARRIORS, their bodies 
           scarred, hair matted, faces painted.

                                 MÁIRE
                        My mother wouldn’t have us mourn.

           Among the warriors, Judoc, Áedán, the Catuvellauni Chief...

                                 MÁIRE (CONT’D)
                        She’d have us fight.

           CHEERS from the Celts morph into a chant, clear as day:

                                 CELTIC WARRIORS
                        Boudicca! Boudicca! Boudicca!

           A SUBTITLE tells us that Boudicca’s name means “VICTORY”

           Off a raise of Máire’s spear and the roar of a carnyx, we:

                                                   SMASH TO BLACK.

           QUICK FLASHES:

           Fair-featured GOTHS wearing BOAR’S HEADS raise CLUBS and 
           BATTLE-AXES --

                                 GOTHS
                          (in native language, with 
                           English subtitle)
                        Victory!

           Swarthy, bare-chested FRANKS wield SPEARS and SHIELDS --

                                 FRANKS
                          (in native language, with 
                           English subtitle)
                        Victory!
           Milk-skinned GAULS in bronze helmets raise HUMAN HEADS --

                                 GAULS
                          (in native language, with 
                           English subtitle)
                        Victory!

                                                   SMASH TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK, WHITE TEXT FADES IN AND OUT:

           Nero set fire to Rome, decimating a large part of the city to 
           clear room for his “Golden House.” He blamed the fire on the 
           Christians.

           Not long after its completion, Nero committed suicide.

           Boudicca’s rebellion inspired indigenous peoples across 
           Europe to rise up against the tyranny of the Romans.

           It would be several centuries before Briton claimed its 
           independence from Rome, but not long after, Rome fell at the 
           hands of barbarians.

                                                        FADE OUT.

           THE END.
