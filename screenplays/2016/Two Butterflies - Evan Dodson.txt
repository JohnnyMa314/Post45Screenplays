           EXT. MONASTERY AVE - DAY - 1975

           SUPER: ATLANTA, GEORGIA 1975.

           Crisp cerulean sky overhead. No cloud in sight. 

           Sun rays blast down into every nook-and-cranny of this inner-
           city, Atlanta, street. It looks how it smells. Like shit.

           Cicadas endlessly CHIRP. Row houses are squeezed together, 
           lining the streets. If houses could sweat, these would pour. 

           PEOPLE lifelessly mill about. They fan their faces and drink 
           from hoses. They’re quiet. It’s too scorching to talk to one 
           another. Too hot to make a sound. UNTIL--

           A thunderous CRACK - in the distance. 

           Everyone turns.

           A WOMAN (50s), the type everyone calls “Mama” --

                                 WOMAN
                        The hell was that?

           Another CRACK. Distant SCREAMS. 

           They hesitantly run towards the sound. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Somebody call the police...

           They arrive at a corner row house, slowly inching closer-- 
           like walking on glass.

           Mama, from before, with horror in her eyes pushes her way 
           through the crowd.

           They halt to watch the now silent house.

           She looks at “2792 Monastery Ave” metal address tiles that 
           are nailed to the rotting house siding.

           The wooden door has a jagged, smoking hole blasted into it. 

           Through the hole we can see it’s dark inside. 

           The people outside stand silently. Eyes dart back and forth. 
           Sweat drips. Adults SHOO children away. 

           They’re waiting for--

           A shotgun EXPLOSION. A window SHATTERS
           They disperse, SCREAMING. Mama stands; horrified. 

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                            (shouting)
                        Where’s Berta! Where the fuck is 
                        Berta!

           INT. ROWHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           FRANTIC FOOTSTEPS. A BABY’S CRY is hushed. A CLICK of a lock.

           Through the hole in the door, stark light beams through 
           scraggy openings. Dust particles dance in the rays. This 
           illuminates the legs of-- 

           WILLIE DENNIS, (40s), African American, belligerently drunk, 
           bull-like and brawny, seething and sweating like a madman. 
           He’s panting heavily and wielding a shotgun. 

           We don’t see his face. Only his back. He stands in the torn-
           to-shreds house in front of--

           KYM MURRELL, (15), African American, drenched in sweat. Her 
           gushing eyes are closed and she bites her lip, praying to 
           God. Next to her, her brother MARK MURRELL, (20), African, 
           American, arm clenched around her. His eyes shake but don’t, 
           for one second, leave Willie.

                                 WILLIE
                            (drunkenly)
                        Where. Is. My. Wife.

                                 MARK
                            (through tears)
                        Uncle Willie... We told you she 
                        ain’t here. Please.

           Silence. He cocks the gun. Mark shields Kym with a hug. 

           Willie slowly raises the gun. They clinch tighter.

           He pulls the trigger. EXPLOSION. Mark pushes Kym to the side. 
           Bullets tear him apart, raining into his back. 

           Willie is thrown back against the wall by the kickback. He 
           drunkenly drops the gun.

           Kym runs to a closed door and yanks it open. Out of a coat 
           closet ANITA MURRELL, (42), African American, panicked, 
           holding a crying baby, ERIC (3). She bolts out quickly 
           grabbing Kym’s hand.

           Willie staggers around, tries to get up, and get his gun.
           Anita and Kym jet past Willie and Mark’s dead body, quickly 
           making their way to a hallway. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Willie violently runs through the hall, bouncing from wall to 
           wall.

           Anita and Kym are at the back end of the hallway. They reach 
           a staircase. Still holding Kym’s hand, Anita hastily tries to 
           hoist them both up the steps.  

           INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Just then, Willie gets to the stair threshold. With shotgun 
           in one hand, he extends the other to grab Kym’s leg.

           Anita and Willie both try to pull Kym. She screams.

                                 WILLIE
                        You take mine! I take yours!

                                 KYM
                        Mama go go go! Just take Eric.

           Anita pulls harder but Kym lets go on her own. Kym falls down 
           the steps and into Willie, knocking the gun out of his hand. 
           Kym runs back towards the front room.

           Anita runs up the stairs holding Eric and gets to the 
           upstairs--

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           --hallway. She’s running. Sweating. Panicked

                                 ANITA
                            (shouting)
                        Get out of the house Kym! Don’t go 
                        hidin’ no where. Just go straight 
                        ou--

           EXPLOSION. A shot gun goes off. Anita freezes. 

           The house falls silent. The sound of the gun echoes through 
           the empty house.

           Anita cries to herself and slides down the wall.

           Downstairs, the sound of a body HITS the floor. Casings DROP. 
           Eric lets out a huge SCREAM. 
           Anita quickly hushes him. She looks around.

           Police SIRENS quietly fade in.

           The shot gun COCKS once more. Heavy FOOTSTEPS animalisticly 
           run towards Anita’s direction. Down the hall and up the 
           stairs. Anita gets up and runs towards an--

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           --empty bedroom. She runs to the closet and locks herself and 
           Eric inside. She burrows between hanging clothes. She covers 
           Eric’s mouth, hushing his breath. She tries to calm her own. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Willie is busting down door after door.

                                 WILLIE
                        I know Berta came to you, Anita. 
                        You’re hiding her ass in here 
                        somewhere.

           With each door he breaks, he gets more and more frustrated 
           because she’s not here. 

           He’s hysterical, eyes bulging, sweat dropping, gun CLANGING 
           against objects he runs into. 

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                            (to himself; rushed)
                        Where is she, where is she, where 
                        is she!

           He runs to the last room and stops. He walks over to the 
           closet. Slowly. 

           INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Anita presses Eric’s head against her chest. She whispers a 
           PRAYER. It’s dark. Venetian shadows cast over her face in 
           between cracks of clothes.

           She hears Willie’s FOOTSTEPS get closer. 

           The door swings open.

           Anita closes her eyes. SIRENS blare right outside of the 
           house. 

           She opens her eyes. He looks her in the face. 
                                 WILLIE
                            (shaken)
                        Berta ain’t coming back... is she? 
                            (he screams)
                        Is she!
                            (beat)
                        Tell your sister I love her.

           Anita can’t find any words. He raises the shotgun to his 
           mouth and BLOWS his brains out.

           Eric CRIES. Anita stands in horror as she watches Willie’s 
           bloody body fall. The shot RINGS. POLICE FOOTSTEPS march up 
           the stairs.

           She tightly closes her eyes.

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. ERIC’S HOME - NIGHT - 2000

           SUPER: BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 2000.

           The POP of a balloon sounds. CHILDREN run away, giggling.

           Anita, now (68), jumps at the sound. She’s cold and hardened, 
           but draped in beautiful butterfly apparel. Butterfly 
           necklace, butterfly earrings, and a butterfly blouse. They’re 
           effervescent. However, she’s everything but.

                                 ANITA
                        Now didn’t I tell y’all to stop 
                        playing around this house!

           She stands in the back of the room, away from everyone, next 
           to an in-home bar stacked with alcohol.

           Next to her, are 3 opened and drained beer bottles.

           Standing on her tiptoes, she tries to reach the top shelf of 
           the bar, to no avail. Atop, there is a pack of beer.

           Around her, a huge party is underway. Children pitter-patter, 
           TWO YOUNG COUSINS gossip in the corner, PEOPLE are LAUGHING. 
           No one takes notices to Anita in the back. 

           Still not being able to reach, she eyes a small ottoman. 
           Slyly, she takes it from in front of the couch and brings it 
           over to the bar, attracting no attention.

           As she drunkenly steps up on it, she stumbles just a little 
           bit, CLANGING against the metal shelves of the bar. Everyone 
           looks at her. She pretends as if she’s up to nothing.
           When everyone turns away she tries once more until--

           ERIN (25) young and sweet, outfit too tight and youthful for 
           her age. She holds onto a cellphone as she approaches. She 
           doesn’t look up while speaking.

                                 ERIN
                        Auntie Nita, want any food?

           Anita waves her hand - “No” and gets back to her beer quest.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        You sure? I can make you a plate to 
                        take home.

                                 ANITA
                        I’m fine. 

                                 ERIN
                            (jokingly)
                        You should really eat something 
                        before adding any more to the 
                        collection.

           She points to the beer bottles.

           Anita takes one final leap and jostles the beer off of the 
           top shelf and into her hands. 

           She gets off of the ottoman and pulls her keys out of her 
           pocket. On them, a very used bottle opener. 

           She cracks the beer bottle open and flings the cap across the 
           bar top. She takes a huge swig.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh, so you got jokes, huh? Lemme 
                        tell you somethin’ girl. I been 
                        drinking more years than you been 
                        on this earth so if you think 3 
                        beers is somethin’, you really are 
                        as simple as you look.

                                 ERIN
                            (shocked)
                        Excuse me?!

                                 ANITA
                        And maybe if you popped up from 
                        that phone screen, you’d notice 
                        that I’m okay now and I’ll be okay 
                        three beers from now. 

           Anita takes another huge swig.
                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        These get me where I wanna be when 
                        I’m somewhere I’m not. And all of 
                        this right here is exactly that. 

           Erin begins to walk away until--

                                 ERIN
                            (embarrassed)
                        They’re about to sing happycake.

                                 ANITA
                            (through laughter)
                        I’m good right in here. 

           Erin walks to the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Eric, now (29), African American, pretty boy clenching onto 
           youth, sits at the head of the table. Everyone gathers.

           Lights are off as candles flicker. They begin to SING.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Happy Birthday to you! Happy 
                        Birthday dear Eric. Happy Birthday 
                        to you!

           Just as they start the second verse--

                                 ERIC
                            (shouting to her)
                        Mama! Are you coming in here?

                                 ANITA (O.S.)
                        No.

                                 ERIC
                        Too drunk to move, huh?

           Everyone chuckles. She doesn’t answer.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        You want us to slice you a piece?

           Still no response.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Somebody’s gonna have to take Mama 
                        home again! She’s Disney done.

           LAUGHTER is heard from the kitchen.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh shut up! I told you I’m fine! I 
                        drink. I don’t get drunk. 

           She slumps onto the couch, downing the bottle of beer. She 
           sets her other, used, bottles onto the table. She scowls.

           The singing resumes from the kitchen.

                                 EVERYONE (O.S.)
                            (muddled)
                        How old are you now, Eric!?

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        I’m twenty-seven. Damn!

           Everyone cheers. She finishes her drink. Upset that it’s 
           over, she notices the tiniest bit of alcohol at the bottom. 
           She tries her hardest to suck it clean out.

           Nothing.

           Anita picks up the other bottles and with everything she has, 
           tries to suck the last bit out of each one.

           There’s nothing coming out. She raises the last bottle above 
           her eye and just as she looks down the mouth, a tiny drop 
           falls into her eye. She winces.

                                 ANITA
                            (bitterly)
                        Congratulations to me.

           Everyone cheers from the other room once again, finishing the 
           song.

           She stares forward. Alone.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           A lit sign that reads “Catholic Charities Senior Living” sits 
           surrounded by manicured bushes and vibrant yellow roses.

           A speeding and swerving 1994, faded and dented, sun stained, 
           CHRYSLER NEON barrels into the parking lot. 
           It weaves through the cars and makes its way to the very 
           farthest spot, away from any and every car. It’s completely 
           alone.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Anita sits behind the driver’s seat, barely peeking above the 
           steering wheel. 

           Intoxicatedly, she doesn’t notice THE CHECK ENGINE light on 
           the dashboard.

           A BUTTERFLY MOBILE swings crazily, back and forth, from the 
           rearview mirror. Anita grabs the mobile and stops it from 
           swinging. She holds onto the mobile for a moment.

           The clock reads “11:27pm.” 

           She takes a moment, gathers herself, and gets out.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Anita slides in between and past cars.

           The drunkenness sets in. This is all a game to her now.

                                 ANITA
                            (drunken mumbles)
                        Take mama home my ass! I’m doing 
                        just fine. Yep, doing just fine.

           She struggles to put one foot in front of the other and when 
           she can’t get it quite right, she giggles. 

           Just then, she trips and a car catches her balance, hard. 

           The ALARM goes off. 

           Anita jumps up as fast as a drunken old woman can.

           She puts both hands over her mouth, tickled that she caused 
           this noise. She laughs and makes her way towards the front 
           door of the building, alarm still BLARING.

           In the distance, at the front door, two, old, white women, 
           sit in rocking chairs. They are SUZIE and BERNICE.

                                 SUZIE
                        Another late night, Anita? 

           Anita doesn’t look at them.
                                 BERNICE 
                        I see you fell into Ronnie’s car... 
                        again.

           The two chuckle. Anita looks at them -- dagger eyes. Anita 
           finally nears the door and reaches inside her purse for keys.

                                 ANITA
                        All you two do is sit out here 
                        waiting for me, huh?

                                 BERNICE
                        Well someone has to make sure you 
                        don’t pass out on the stoop... 
                        AGAIN.

                                 SUZIE
                        And you wonder why nobody ever 
                        comes by to see you. You really 
                        should get better with your... 
                        “thirst.”
                            (smugly)
                        I’m just saying what everyone’s 
                        thinking, dear. To help, is all.

                                 ANITA
                        Well thank you Burt and Ernie, for 
                        the wonderful read up. I’ll be sure 
                        to add it to the list of opinions 
                        I’ll drink away when I’m “thirsty.” 
                            (beat)
                        Y’all have a “blessed” night.

           Bernice and Suzie roll their eyes and rock once more.

           Anita goes to put her keys in the lock but drops them. 
           Drunkenness wins again. 

           Suzie and Bernice get the last laugh. 

           As she picks them up, NEON LIGHTS glisten from across the 
           street in the nearby strip mall. 

           Anita looks over to the light, longingly and familiarly. 

           It’s a liquor store.

           Suzie and Bernice wince at Anita. Anita scowls back.

           INT. ANITA’S APARTMENT - AFTER MIDNIGHT

           Anita teeters through the door.
           In one hand she holds her purse. In the other, a new case of 
           beer. A receipt and loose change spill out onto the carpet.

           She cares not to pick it up. 

           It’s a small, one bedroom apartment. She slags into the dark 
           kitchen. 

           When she opens the fridge, the light takes her by surprise 
           and blinds her. She falls backs and slips on a rug.

           She drops the pack of beer and each glass SHATTERS inside the 
           case. Beer is RUSHING onto the ground as she fumbles around 
           the dark kitchen.

           Next to her on a table is a BLINKING house phone. “One missed 
           message.” She, in haste, presses the button.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        You have one missed message. Press 
                        “1” for message review.

           While juggling between cleaning up the floor, Anita presses 
           one.

           A BEEP. She’s on the floor mopping up the spilled beer with a 
           paper towel.

                                 ERIC (V.O.)
                        Hey ma. I’m just calling to make 
                        sure you got home okay. It’s past 
                        11 so you should’ve gotten in by 
                        now. Call me so I know you got 
                        this. Love you.

           A BEEP. Anita stands up, finishing cleaning up the mess.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE

           Anita presses a button.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Message deleted. End of new

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On the walls are African Art, bible quotes, pictures torn 
           from national geographic magazine put into makeshift frames. 
           But most noticeably there are Butterflies.

           Beautiful specimen are incased on the walls. Paintings of 
           butterflies sit against the furniture, waiting to be hung. 

           Anita drags around to her vanity mirror. In front is a hand-
           upholstered stool.

           She sits, removing her make up slowly. Her eyes are red and 
           yellowed. Her irises have a ring of blue around deep brown 
           pools. The bags under her eyes weigh down her face. 

           Her skin is spotless, but sagging. Her eyebrows and eyelashes 
           are barely there. 

           When she takes off her lipstick, she reveals tired and 
           cracked lips.

           She somberly removes a wig and places it on the counter in 
           front of her. Grey, thick, disheveled hair sits pinned atop 
           her head. She stares.

           She turns around and gets up to find the remote. 

           Turning on the TV, she flips through channels. Paid 
           Programming. CLICK. The 700 Club. CLICK. Spanish shows. 
           CLICK. 

           She lands on a replay of the “7 o’clock local nightly news.”

           She leaves it on and goes to her closet to take off her 
           clothes. She puts back her butterfly shirt next to what seems 
           to be an endless supply of butterfly clothing.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        ...marking the 300th homicide in 
                        Baltimore this year.

           Anita swiftly turns around to get the remote.

                                 TV REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Officials say--

           CLICK. She shuts the TV off.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           An OLD RADIO quietly plays MUSIC.

           Anita brushes her teeth in a white robe. Her hair is wet.

           She finishes up and lifts her robe to sit on the toilet. As 
           she sits down she looks at the radio beside her feet.
           She picks it up. As it plays, she smiles into it. Once she 
           notices her own happiness, her face returns to a sneer.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Anita walks back into the bathroom holding a glass of water 
           and the radio in the other hand. 

           She places the radio on her bedside table and lays down.

                                 RADIO
                            (in tune)
                        104.9 Light FM. Baltimore 
                        Radioooooo. You’re listening to the 
                        classics Quietstorm radio.
                            (beat)
                        This is “No One Can Love More” by 
                        Phyllis Hyman -- only on the 
                        Quietstorm.

           The radio reads “12:40am.” Anita CLICKS off the lamp and 
           plugs in a butterfly night-light.

           Above the playing radio, dimly lit, is a PHOTO of two people 
           standing on the step of an old row-house. It’s Anita’s dead 
           children, Mark and Kym, on the steps of their old home.

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - 1975

           The photo rests on a stand. PULL BACK to see that it sits in 
           between two caskets. One is visibly larger than the other.

           A pastor stands at a podium, addressing a sullen crowd. 

                                 PASTOR
                        I wish not to mince words. Forgive 
                        me but I am not here to enlighten 
                        you... to tell you to lift your 
                        spirits... To tell you that 
                        everything is going to be okay.

           Anita, in all black, sits with a seat separating her from 
           everyone. Baby Eric sleeps on her lap. She rocks him.
                                 PASTOR (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        We are not too proud to acknowledge 
                        that we have come here today 
                        trusting that God would speak to 
                        our hearts, calm our minds, and 
                        give us strength as we continue to 
                        walk with him. Even when we want to 
                        leave him. We can admit this. 

           Anita looks over to a MAN on the opposite side of the 
           congregation. He looks up to her but can barely keep eye 
           contact. Just then, another WOMAN grabs his hand, kisses his 
           cheek, and rubs his shoulder.

           He quickly looks away from Anita.

                                 PASTOR (CONT’D)
                            (obligatorily)
                        Proverbs 3:5 says Trust in the lord 
                        with all thine hear; and lean not 
                        unto thine own understanding. So 
                        Ms. Murrell... Mr. Murrell. Trust 
                        that God’s Love and Will may not be 
                        understood... Trust in him even if, 
                        for right now, your trust in 
                        anything is shattered. 
                            (beat)
                        Would you like to say anything?

           Anita sits there for a moment. Everyone is silent.

           She says nothing but gets up. She’s languid.

           The Pastor gets down from the podium. 

           Anita hands Eric to the Pastor and slowly walks in between 
           the two caskets.

           She touches both caskets, gently.

           She looks at them like she can see the faces inside. She 
           smiles with each stroke and wipes tears off of them.

           Just then, she notices TWO BUTTERFLIES, each landing on one 
           casket right beside her hands. 

           She fixates on them but to everyone else, she looks like 
           she’s staring into space. 

           They won’t move, resting calmly there, as if they’re staring 
           right back at Anita. She moves her hands closer to each one.

                                 PASTOR (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Murrell...
           She doesn’t answer. He looks to the crowd for help. The Man 
           from before, who was her husband, CURTIS COLLINS (43), 
           African American, thin, not as upset, in a suit comes up.

                                 CURTIS
                        Excuse me, everybody.

           As he passes the caskets the two butterflies flutter away. 

           Anita, distraught, pushes past him to see the butterflies go 
           out of sight. She looks back down at the caskets. Tears form. 
           She looks at the photo of her children.

           He pulls Anita past the caskets, out of ear shot of the 
           congregation. 

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        Come here. Look at me. I’m here 
                        with you, alright?
                            (beat)
                        We’ll get through this together. 
                        You can’t do it alone.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh Curtis please.

                                 CURTIS
                        They were my kids too.

           Anita looks at him in the eyes. She can’t believe he has said 
           that. 

           She looks over to the woman who kissed Curtis and then back 
           to him. He looks ashamed, unable to meet her gaze. Tears form 
           as she stares straight through him.

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        Anita.

           He attempts to hold her.

                                 ANITA
                            (exhausted)
                        Please, don’t touch me.

           Just then.

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                            (shakily)
                        He ain’t the one you’re mad at, 
                        Anita. 
           Anita whips her head around to see BERTA MURRELL, (33), 
           African American, emotionally destroyed, a plain black dress, 
           tiptoes down the isle.

                                 BERTA
                        Anita... Please.

           She gets closer. She’s done this thousands of times.

           She reaches Anita and gets down on her knees, literally 
           groveling, clenching Anita’s pant leg.

           Head held down, she shakes and cries. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know this would happen. 
                        Please Anita. I left him for a 
                        reason. I was doing what you said. 
                        I always do what you say! How could 
                        I have known he’d do this, huh?

           The entire funeral party falls silent. 

           Berta looks up to Anita and--

           SLAP. 

           Anita delivers Berta the quickest and fiercest blow. It 
           reverberates throughout the cemetery.

           Some close their eyes. Some SHRIEK. They’re speechless.

           Berta gasps for air. The slap took it out of her. She holds 
           her swollen red face in the grass.

           Anita stands up and steps directly over Berta, never looking 
           her in the face again.

           She slowly walks over to the Pastor and takes Eric back.

           When she does so, she walks down the isle, leaving the 
           unfinished funeral. Everyone watches as she exits.

           Berta remains in the center of the pathway, crying on the 
           dirt, clenching her face.

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 2000

           Berta, (57), grey-haired, drooping faced, in a hospital gown, 
           is tucked into sheets tightly. On a beeping heart monitor, 
           the time reads “12:50am”
           A dim, cold blue light shines across her sleeping face. She’s 
           motionless.

           A DOCTOR and a NURSE stand over Berta, checking her chart. 
           They stare at each other, worried.

           The two leave the bedside to go to the doorway threshold.

           The DOCTOR motions over to the RECEPTIONIST. He gets up and 
           joins the two.

                                 DOCTOR
                        See if there are any open spots at 
                        Emory’s Alzheimer’s care. We can’t 
                        hold her anymore and I need the bed 
                        tonight.

           The receptionist runs back over to the desk. He gets on the 
           phone.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Emory has space but it’s limited. 
                        There is a 2 day window in which 
                        the patient would need to arrive.

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s plenty of time to get there. 

                                 NURSE
                        Not with no one to take her.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Actually, there is one last name 
                        listed on her file.

           The Doctor and the Nurse look over to the receptionist. They 
           then look back at Berta.

           INT. ANITA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The apartment is dark. Anita SNORES loudly. 

           The phone RINGS but Anita doesn’t wake up.

           A BEEP.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE

           EXT. ERIC’S HOUSE - DAY

           It’s a modest two story home now that we can see it in the 
           daylight. It’s the quintessential suburbs.

           It’s the type of house that any mother would be proud to see 
           their child own.

           INT. ERIC’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Anita stands in his kitchen, fervently cleaning up from the 
           night before. She looks worried.

           She stops, stares down at the water, pondering. She picks up 
           a plate but it slips out of her hand, CLANGING back into the 
           pile of dishes in the sink.

           Eric, in a sleepy daze, stumbles down the steps.

                                 ERIC
                        The hell are you doing in my house?

                                 ANITA
                            (without missing a beat)
                        Because I birthed you. Anything 
                        that’s yours is mine. 

           She cleans again, obviously plagued by something.

           Eric notices. 

                                 ERIC
                        You don’t have to clean up, Ma. Go 
                        sit down somewhere.

           Eric cleans, his back to Anita, as she sits down at the 
           kitchen table. Plates litter the counter top.

           Unfinished food sits in dishes atop a make-shift buffet table 
           that rests along a wall.

           Half of Eric’s birthday cake remains on the table. 

           She sits at the table, thumbing through the cake without a 
           plate. She takes large bites, dropping crumbs everywhere.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        So did you have fun last night?

                                 ANITA
                            (chewing)
                        Mhmm.
                                 ERIC
                        Do you remember last night?

                                 ANITA
                        Shut up.

           Eric laughs. Anita eyes a wine rack beside the buffet. She 
           gets up slyly and walks over to it.

           She sifts through the bottles while Eric talks

                                 ERIC
                            (through laughter)
                        I don’t know, Ma! When you didn’t 
                        call me back I thought something 
                        had happened to you.
                            (beat)
                        Before I toss any of this. Do you 
                        want any food to take h--

           He turns around to see Anita struggling to open a bottle.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Ma!

           He rushes over to snatch it out of her hand, bumping into the 
           table, causing a CLANGING.

                                 ANITA
                        Now see there, you almost “Oh 
                        Darlened” the whole damn table, 
                        being all in somebody else’s 
                        business!

                                 ERIC
                        Somebody else’s business?! It’s my 
                        wine! And it’s only 10 am!

                                 ANITA
                        They say the best cure for a 
                        hangover is fuck you give me back 
                        my drink.

           She laughs, and gives Eric a wink. 

           He rolls his eyes and sits opposite her at the table. 

           He places a plate in front of her.

                                 ERIC
                        Here. You’re adding more crumbs all 
                        over my table.
           He smiles. She plops a piece of cake onto the plate, giving 
           Eric a face that says “you happy now?”

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        As much as I enjoy watching you eat 
                        my food and drink my shit, and as 
                        frequently as you do it, I know 
                        that’s not why you’re back over 
                        here so soon. 
                            (beat)
                        So what is it this time?

           Anita, at a loss for words, puts down her fork.

                                 ANITA
                        I need you to do something for me.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah?

                        I don’t even know how to put this 
                        and don’t go acting all stupid on 
                        me, hear? You always ask a bunch of 
                        stuff ain’t nobody got time for. I 
                        told you about that-

                        Ma!

           Beat.

                        You know your... your umm, Aunt 
                        Berta.

                                 ERIC
                        Haven’t heard that name in years... 

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah well I got this call last 
                        night. On the machine, this 
                        morning, and apparently she’s been 
                        in a hospital for some time.

                                 ERIC
                        For what?

                        Point is, they left a message 
                        saying she needs to be moved from 
                        Hopkins all the way down to 
                        Atlanta. And I can’t do any of

                        “Closest Facility. Best care” bull. 
                        They probably needed to take care 
                        of people with actual problems.

                        Oh my God. Why didn’t you tell

                                 ANITA
                        Because she ain’t mine and it 
                        didn’t concern me or anyone of you. 
                        Whatever. Can you do it? They need 
                        to get her there in the next two 
                        days or something.

                        days. I’m your mother!

           He gets up and cleans again, brushing her off.
           She gets up to follow.

                        Then she stays there.

                        Ma, she can’t stay there. That’s 
                        why they called you.

           Anita walks back over to the wine rack.

           Eric gets frustrated. Unfiltered, he blurts--

                        You’re just gonna have to get over

           The room is silent. Anita walks over and gets in his face. He 
           looks genuinely afraid.

           Anita looks at Eric hesitantly. He looks back. He’s firm. 

           She gets up from the table and picks up her coat.

           She walks to the front door.

                                 ANITA
                        I can use the radio just fine, 
                        thank you.
                            (beat)
                        Oh! And if you ever snatch wine 
                        from me again, boy, I’ll break your 
                        hands.
           She shoots him a grin that says “I love you even if I can’t 
           say it aloud.” 

           Eric smiles right back.

                                 ERIC
                        Love you too, Ma.

           INT. ANITA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Outside of Eric’s house, Anita sits in her car fiddling with 
           the radio. Angrily she smacks the console. 

           She picks up one of Eric’s mixed CDs and puts it in.

           The song “Rock Around The Clock” comes on. She looks at the 
           radio and then up to God and then back to the radio.

                                 ANITA
                            (under her breath)
                        Real subtle.

           She starts her car and pulls off.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           A sterile and perfectly manicured hospital forefront. Each 
           window on the building has nary a smudge. 

           PATIENTS file throughout the building, never a moments rest.

           Anita, wearing butterfly designed clothes, stands beside her 
           beat up CHRYSLER NEON in the patient pick up line. 

           She parks haphazardly, making it difficult for anyone to fit 
           in the line as well. 

           She looks around, disgusted by the scene.

           Just then, the hospital doors open to reveal Berta, in a 
           wheelchair, with the Nurse and Doctor at the check out desk.

           The Doctor turns her head and notices Anita standing in the 
           hospital driveway. The Doctor exits towards Anita.

                                 DOCTOR
                            (overly friendly)
                        Hello... Are you Ms. Murrell? Here 
                        for Roberta?

                                 ANITA
                        Mhmm.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Great! We’re just getting her 
                        processed and she’ll be all set.

           Anita doesn’t respond. She doesn’t care what the Doctor says.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                            (tentatively)
                        I’d like to point out that 
                        Roberta’s currently in an fog. So, 
                        she may not recognize you or 
                        remember anything about you besides 
                        what she learns starting today.

                                 ANITA
                        Fine with me.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Also, I know Berta’s daughter 
                        passed away. I’m sorry for your 
                        family’s loss.

                                 ANITA
                        She wasn’t my family. That’s 
                        Berta’s family. It don’t bother me.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Okay...
                            (beat)
                        Well, I can’t stress this enough. 
                        If, by the chance she does remember 
                        you and your past--

                                 ANITA
                        What do you think you know about me 
                        and my past, huh?

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s just... I know whenever she 
                        was lucid and you came up, all of 
                        the memories were too much for her. 
                        She just loses it.

           An awkward silence drifts in. 

           The nurse finally rolls Berta out. The Doctor puts on a 
           cheerful show. Anita cares not for pleasantries.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Alrighty, Ms. Berta! Looks like 
                        it’s time for you to go!
                                 BERTA
                        Sorry I wasn’t much help with the 
                        all that insurance stuff. I’ll give 
                        my daughter a call and she’ll 
                        handle it. She always does.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s nothing to worry about Ms. 
                        Murrell. Everything’s taken care 
                        of! You just worry about that long 
                        drive, alright! 

           Anita, over it all, walks to the driver’s side of the car. 
           The Nurse wheels Berta over to the passenger seat, helps her 
           in, and closes the door. 

           Just as Anita gets in--

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to mention Berta has this 
                        comfort device. A lot of patients 
                        use them.
                            (beat)
                        Hers is a cell phone. It doesn’t 
                        work anymore but she thinks it 
                        does. 

           Anita doesn’t respond.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Remember, she has to be there in 
                        two days or she loses her spot. 7 
                        am sharp.

           The Doctor hands her a piece of paper. Anita rolls her eyes.

                                 NURSE
                        Your sister really shouldn’t be too 
                        stressed physically. If she is, her 
                        memory goes quicker. So, it’s best 
                        she stay relaxed and pushed in the 
                        wheelchair at all times.

                                 ANITA
                        Is she deaf, dumb, or stupid?

                                 NURSE
                        N...No.

                                 ANITA
                        Then she can push her own self.

                                 NURSE
                        Bu--
                                 ANITA
                        Can she walk?

                                 NURSE
                        Medically speaking, yes. Bu--

                                 ANITA
                        Well then, you ain’t gonna baby a 
                        grown woman. If her legs aren’t the 
                        problem, let her walk.

           Anita hops in, leaving the Doctor and Nurse speechless.

           She starts her rickety car, billowing smoke from it’s 
           undercarriage. She drives off, swerving out of the lot. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Anita drives, staring straight ahead. She’s going 
           considerably fast for the residential streets.

                                 BERTA
                        You specifically work for the 
                        hospital as a driver or...?

           Anita says nothing.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        I think it’s admirable, really. 
                        Helping people. It’s easy to get 
                        left in those types of places, with 
                        the doctors and machines and the 
                        beeping, with no one to give a 
                        damn. It’s nice to see that there 
                        are some people that help, just for 
                        the sake. 

           Anita continues ahead, picking up speed.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        You know you could stop choking the 
                        pedal a little. Unless you’re 
                        trying to give me a heart attack.

           Anita reluctantly slows down.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        So what’s your name, Ms. Driver?

           Anita doesn’t answer.
                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Hellooo. I ain’t talkin’ to myself.
                            (beat)
                        Nothing... Ain’t part of the job to 
                        speak? Can’t get to know nobody? We 
                        are stuck in here together.

           Nothing.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (under her breath)
                        You just a evil somebody, huh?

           Anita continues to ignore Berta.

           Berta digs in her purse and pulls out an old flip phone and 
           dials. The phone makes a loud WAAH WAAH WAAH sound. 
           Disconnected number. Berta talks anyway.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (whispering to the phone)
                        Hey...Yeah so I got stuck with the 
                        worst driver they could find...

                                 ANITA
                            (annoyed)
                        You’ve got to be kidding.

           The BLARING continues, driving Anita crazy.

                                 BERTA
                        She’s driving this beat up, old--

                                 ANITA
                        Hey, uh-uh. I can deal with your 
                        voice but not that damn noise.

           Berta looks at Anita and then gets back to her call.

                                 BERTA
                        Beat up old car!

                                 ANITA
                        WAAH WAAH WAAH, you hear that! 
                        WAAAAAAAH!!! That means it’s 
                        disconnected. It don’t work. 
                        There’s nobody there. Hang up the 
                        phone!

           Berta is stunned by Anita’s outburst.

                                 BERTA
                        I’ll have to call you back.
                                 ANITA
                            (smugly)
                        Have fun calling nobody back.

                                 BERTA
                        If you really hate your job this 
                        much, you should find something 
                        else to do. I can get my daughter 
                        to do the rest of the trip. They 
                        shoulda called her in the first 
                        place anyway. 

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah well, you can’t call a dead 
                        woman.

           Berta is taken aback.

                                 BERTA
                        What is your problem?

                                 ANITA
                        It’s the truth. Not like you’ll 
                        remember it in the next twenty 
                        minutes anyway or however long it 
                        is you people remember stuff.

                                 BERTA
                        You’re the devil.

                                 ANITA
                        You’re simple.

                                 BERTA
                        Why not just let me out right here?

           Berta and Anita silence until Berta notices a check engine 
           light on Anita’s dashboard.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        If your job is to drive people from 
                        place to place, you might want to 
                        make sure your car is in shape to 
                        do so. I’m just saying.

                                 ANITA
                        My car is just fine.

                                 BERTA
                        Maybe try looking down.

           Anita, trying to keep her eyes on the road, looks down at her 
           check engine light. 
                                 ANITA
                        Son of a bitch.

           EXT. REPAIR SHOP - DAY

           Anita and Berta, still in the car, sit in the dilapidated 
           repair shop parking lot. 

           A REPAIR MAN stands at the hood of the car, looking inside. 
           He’s screws something tighter and really works up a sweat. He 
           finishes and walks over to the driver’s side window.

                                 REPAIR MAN
                        Your battery cables a little frayed 
                        but that ain’t the main issue. You 
                        should be fine with that. What will 
                        give you an issue is the right side 
                        cell connector. It’s got some 
                        corrosion. That’ll heat up your 
                        engine right quick.

                                 ANITA
                        Look you ain’t sayin’ nothin more 
                        than words to me. I don’t know what 
                        any of that means. I just need to

                        I put in a replacement, but I 
                        wouldn’t chance it.

                        AAA and insurance are for people 
                        who have accidents. I ain’t never

                        for nothing. All I need is to get 
                        to Atlanta and get her the hell up 
                        out of here.

                        Y’all got maps in there?

           The Repair Man ponders.

                                 REPAIR MAN
                        Not one to give you. But inside, up 
                        on the wall, we have a huge map of 
                        the U.S. highways, streets and 
                        interstates. Pretty much everything 
                        you need.

           Anita gets out of the car, slamming the door behind her.

                                 ANITA
                            (mumbling)

                        What, you just gonna leave me in 
                        here?

                        I can’t push myself across the 
                        parking lot!

                                 ANITA
                        I told you that you can either push

                        walk, like I know you can; or, you 
                        can sit there looking stupid 
                        because I’m not pushing you. 

           Anita walks across the parking lot and into the shop.

           The Repair Man looks at Berta and then back at Anita.

           INT. REPAIR SHOP - DAY

           The doorbell DINGS.

           As the Repair Man pushes Berta through the doors, Anita 
           stands at the wall in front of a massive, glass encased map. 

           The shop is empty. It’s riddled with papers all over the 
           counter. An old fan BLOWS in the corner and a TV PLAYS 
           infomercials.

           He wheels Berta next to the waiting chairs and rushes over to 
           the water cooler.

                                 REPAIR MAN
                        Water?

                                 BERTA
                        That’d be nice, thank you.

           Anita says nothing. She just stares at the map. Her eyes 
           follow the highway from Baltimore to Atlanta. The Repair Man 
           hands Berta the water and walks over to Anita.

                                 REPAIR MAN
                        It’s a pretty straight shot if you 
                        look at it. It’s just the exits 
                        here and the exits there that you 
                        gotta remember.

           Anita looks at the route. It’s familiar to her.

                        Why y’all going all the way down to

                        makes you think we can pay an

                        Give me a pen and paper.

           The Repair Man quickly looks through sheets of paper to find 
           a blank one. He searches for a pen but can’t find one.

           Anita rolls her eyes.

                                 BERTA
                            (digging in her purse)
                        I have one.

                                 ANITA
                        Give it to me.

                                 BERTA
                        No, I got it.

           Berta takes the paper from the Repair Man as he walks over to 
           the map. He points out the exits. 

           Berta squints while writing.

                        the way down. Don’t get off of it

                        We ready to go?

           The Repair Man pushes Berta pass Anita and out of the door. 
           Before Anita follows behind them, she stares at the word 
           “Atlanta” on the board.

                                                             FADE TO:

           EXT. MONASTERY AVE - DAY - 1975

           Anita packs her car to the brim with anything she can carry.

           Her two other sisters WANDA, (43), and BARBARA, (44), stand 
           on the sidewalk, watching her. 
           Baby Eric sleeps in the passenger seat. Anita picks up a 
           RADIO from the grass, turns down the MUSIC that plays, and 
           gently nestles it next to Eric. He smiles in his sleep, 
           noticing the music.

                                 WANDA
                        You don’t want to stay in this

                        can come stay with me.

                                 BARBARA
                        Or me!

                                 WANDA
                        You and Eric can sleep in my bed. 
                        I’ll share a room with Erin, I’m 
                        used to it.

                                 ANITA
                        I can’t do that. You just got her 
                        sleeping alone. Besides, we don’t 
                        need two babies under one roof.

                                 BARBARA
                        Well, what about at my place? 
                        Walter and I can make some room!

                        be looking for husband number 
                        three.

                        Well we want you to stay.

                                 ANITA
                        Well Barbara, we always can’t 
                        always get what we want, can we?
                        I can’t stomach being in this city, 
                        let alone on this street.
                            (to barbara)
                        And Kym looked just like you. I’ll 
                        be looking at her that face every 
                        day, only it’s not hers. I don’t 
                        need that.

           They are taken aback. Just then, a car slowly approaches. 
           Anita turns to look, and then back angrily at her sisters.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Who told her?
           Anita hastily moves towards her car door. Berta jumps out, 
           trying to cut her off.

                                 BERTA
                            (shouting)
                        Come on, Anita! Wait!

           Anita gets inside her car and slams the door, just as Berta 
           gets to her.

           She talks through the closed window.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (exasperated)
                        You weren’t even going to tell me!

           She pulls at the car door. Locked.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Open the door and talk to me!

           Anita starts the car, silently staring ahead.

                                 ANITA
                        Ain’t got much else to say to you.

                                 BERTA
                        You’ve said nothing! How many times 
                        do I have to apologize.

           Anita rolls down the window and looks straight through her.

                                 ANITA
                        Lower your voice. My child is

                        My only child.

           That stuns Berta.

                                 BERTA
                        So you’re just going to leave then, 
                        huh? Run away...
                            (beat)
                        You’ve always been good at it.

                                 ANITA
                            (angered whisper)
                        Are you kidding me. Right now. You 
                        think you can say that to me?!

                                 BERTA
                        Yes! Because no one else will. 
                                 ANITA
                        How can you expect me to be happy, 
                        here? 

                                 BERTA
                        Just be patient!

           Anita looks at her, silent, almost understanding. She snaps 
           out of it and looks forward, determined.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Well fine then! Do what you’re best 
                        at and just leave. Leave us h--

                                 ANITA
                        Maybe I can’t always deal with 
                        protecting you! Clearly I can’t 
                        protect my own.
                            (beat)
                        So yes, I’ll go if it means not 
                        always having to take care of you. 
                        Because right now, I can’t! I have 
                        him and I only have him.

                                 BERTA
                        Dammit, Anita! 

           Berta somehow yanks the door open. Eric begins to wake up in 
           a fit. Anita notices, and grabs the door handle. She looks at 
           Berta with angered and piercing eyes and SLAMS the door shut.

           Berta backs off.

           Anita angrily straps Eric’s car-seat in and then herself. She 
           yanks the gear shift into drive.

           She looks over to Barbara and Wanda who are still on the 
           sidewalk.

                                 ANITA
                            (motioning to Berta)
                        Thanks a lot!

           Anita slams on the pedal, leaving them al in the smoke. Berta 
           stares at her other two sisters. They are equally shocked.

           Berta, watching Anita pull off, makes a quick decision. She 
           wipes the tears from her eyes, runs over to her car, hops in 
           the driver’s seat and pulls off -- right behind Anita.

                                                             FADE TO:
           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON - 2000

           It’s bumper to bumper and they’re getting nowhere fast. Anita 
           is antsy. She taps her foot and jolts her eyes from the road 
           to the clock.

           Berta sits in the passenger seat, rummaging through her 
           purse.

                                 ANITA
                        What’s the next exit?

                                 BERTA
                            (to herself)
                        I’m lookin’ for the paper.
                            (beat)
                        Just keep going straight. I don’t 
                        remember anything out of the 
                        ordinary comin’ up.

           Anita scoffs.

                                 ANITA
                            (looking to God)
                        That’s just too easy.

                                 BERTA
                        What?

           Anita doesn’t answer. She only grins smugly.

           She looks over into Berta’s purse, taking her eyes off of the 
           road. Berta notices.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Keep your eyes ahead! I got this.

                                 ANITA
                        If you kept you stuff together and 
                        neat, we wouldn’t be having this 
                        problem. Always been a mess. 
                        Clearly, always will be!

                                 BERTA
                        You don’t know nothing about me! I 
                        ain’t no mess.

           Anita rolls her eyes. They come to a stop in the traffic.

                                 ANITA
                        Just find the directions!
                                 BERTA
                        Not like we going anywhere. Plus if 
                        you keep interrupting me, the more 
                        I get distracted and the longer it 
                        takes me to find!

           Anita holds her tongue. 

           In a haste, Anita switches over to another lane that seems 
           like it’s moving.

           Just as she settles herself in it, the line stalls and the 
           previous lane she was in, begins to pick up.

                                 ANITA
                        Why does this always happen to me?

           Berta giggles.

                                 BERTA
                        Why don’t you try being patient.

           Anita sharply glares at Berta.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Tapping your foot, watching the 
                        clock, yelling about the 
                        directions! Look up there. Ain’t 
                        nothing going anywhere any time 
                        soon. Sit back and relax. All that 
                        worryin’ will age you faster than 
                        time ever can.

           Berta looks over to Anita, who’s looking straight ahead at 
           the back of a car.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        How old are you? 83?

           Anita whips her head over to a laughing Berta.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        See what I’m talking about! 

                                 ANITA
                        Just find the directions, please.

                                 BERTA
                        Oooo, we got a please this time! 
                        That’s some progress huh?

           Berta picks up her purse and dumps everything into her lap. 
           Items scatter onto the floor of the car as well. 
                                 ANITA
                        Not all over my car!

                                 BERTA
                        It’ll be easier to find this way.

           Anita and Berta pick things off of the floor, one by one, 
           trash after trash but can’t find the directions.

           Just then, Anita picks up a picture of Berta’s daughter. 
           Berta also notices. Anita looks at it for a moment until 
           Berta takes it from her.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t lose that.

           She puts it on the dashboard.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (not even looking up)
                        Ain’t she beautiful! People think 
                        we’re sisters. She hates that.

           Anita sits back in her seat placing both hands back on the 
           steering wheel, leaving Berta to do all the searching by 
           herself. Anita looks forward, paying attention only to the 
           road.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Well that was quick, wasn’t it. 
                        Filled your “being helpful” quota 
                        for the year, huh?

           Anita doesn’t answer.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Okay then...
                            (beat)
                        Got any kids of your own?

           Anita remains quiet.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Women of our era don’t have “no 
                        kids” so I know you got some.

                                 ANITA
                        One.

                                 BERTA
                        One what?

                                 ANITA
                        I got one kid.
                                 BERTA
                        Only one!? How did you manage that. 
                        See me, I only had one because the 
                        doctor told me I couldn’t have no 
                        more. If it was up to me, I woulda 
                        had a whole slew of em!

           Anita tenses.

                                 ANITA
                            (somberly)
                        Yeah well, I just got the one...

           Berta notices the butterfly mobile hanging from the rearview 
           mirror. She touches them gently.

                                 BERTA
                        These are beautiful. Where’d you 
                        get them from?

                                 ANITA
                        I’m trying to pay attention to the 
                        road.

                                 BERTA
                        For what? We’re barely moving! 

                                 ANITA
                        I got them a while ago. I can’t 
                        remember. 

                                 BERTA
                        This might be the only good thing 
                        about this car, I’ll tell you that.

           Berta looks Anita up and down.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        You really like butterflies huh?

                                 ANITA
                            (examining herself)
                        They... they have wings.

                                 BERTA
                        Meaning?

                                 ANITA
                        They can fly away from whatever 
                        they want to.
                            (beat)
                        Kind of like what I wish I could do 
                        right now.
                                 BERTA
                        Well no matter how rude you just 
                        was, they look good on you!
                            (beat)
                        See that’s a compliment. Even your 
                        evil ass could use one, once in a 
                        while. Now you try and give me one.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh come on.

           Berta shovels through the rest of her trash until--

                                 BERTA
                        You sound like a damn parrot.
                            (excitedly)
                        Nah see, I knew I had it!

                                 ANITA
                            (extending her hand)
                        Give em’ to me.

                                 BERTA
                            (pulling back)
                        Uh-uh, I got it!

                                 ANITA
                            (lunging)
                        That’s what you said last time.

                                 BERTA
                        Hands on the wheel!

                                 ANITA
                        Give me the--

                                 BERTA
                        I’ll give them to you!

           Anita pulls back.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give them to you... if we...
                            (looking at an exit)
                        If we can stop at...
                            (struggling to see the 
                             title)
                        Stop at... “Cameron’s Diner.” I’m 
                        hungry as hell.

                                 ANITA
                        We don’t have time to stop!
                                 BERTA
                        Then I guess you don’t “have time” 
                        to get these directions. 

           Berta opens the window and holds the paper outside of the 
           car, dangling it in the wind.

                                 ANITA
                        Would you stop acting like a damn 
                        child.

           Berta lifts it farther out of the window, giggling. Anita 
           can’t reach. She sighs heavily.

           EXT. CAMERON’S DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Anita and Berta pull into a parking space, the engine 
           temperature of the car is elevated.

                                 BERTA
                        Car’s getting a little hot. 
                        Should’ve paid the man full price.

           Anita ignores her.

           The lot is filled with cars of the century, making Anita’s 
           look even more out of place.

           Neon lights shine across the storefront and an animated 
           dancing pig gyrates in the window. 

           Anita gets out of the car. She walks towards the entrance 
           until Berta KNOCKS on the window. 

           Berta CRANKS the window down.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        You not gonna help me?

           Anita chuckles and keeps moving forward.

           Berta, annoyed, rolls the window back up, very slowly gets 
           out of the car, and pulls her wheelchair out of the back.

           Sitting in the chair, out of breath, she rolls herself to the 
           door.

           INT. CAMERON’S DINER - CONTINUOUS

           It’s crowded. PEOPLE walk about, FAMILIES loudly laugh, and 
           WAITERS hustle by. 
           Anita and Berta, both in bifocals, looking exactly alike, sit 
           across from each other staring at menus.

           A WAITER comes over.

                                 WAITER
                        Y’all ladies know what you want?

           Anita doesn’t look up. Berta, waits for Anita to answer--

                                 BERTA
                        Give us a minute?

           He smiles and walks off. Anita picks up the alcohol menu.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        It’s only... 2 o’clock.

                                 ANITA
                        Mind your own.

                                 BERTA
                        You have to drive.

                                 ANITA
                        One drink ain’t never killed 
                        nobody.

                                 BERTA
                        I just don’t think it’s a good 
                        idea, is all.

                                 ANITA
                        Good thing I didn’t ask.

           The waiter jumps back over.

                                 WAITER
                            (jokingly)
                        Minutes over!

           Anita looks at him with disgust.

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah... Give me uh... give me a 
                        cheese burger, no pickles, one 
                        tomato with a side of mashed 
                        potatoes instead of fries. And one 
                        Sam Adams draft.

                                 BERTA
                        I’m still thinking.
                                 WAITER
                        No problem at all.
                            (to Anita)
                        Ma’am, I’ll have your Sam Adams 
                        when I get back!

           Anita doesn’t say anything.

                                 BERTA
                        She says thank you.

                                 ANITA
                        Don’t speak for me.

           He smiles at Berta and makes awkward eye contact with Anita. 
           He walks off.

                                 BERTA
                        Doing it anyway, huh?

           Anita, reading a magazine, pays her no mind.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        I can never make up my mind at 
                        restaurants. 

           Anita doesn’t answer so they sit in silence. 

           Anita scans the room, observing all of the happy families 
           around. Berta, silently, examines the menu, looking back and 
           forth between items as if she’s having an inner debate.

           Anita looks at her, as if she is about to smile but annoyance 
           creeps back in and her face falls. She rolls her eyes again.

           Just then the waiter pops back over.

                                 WAITER
                        One Sam Adams Draft. And have you 
                        decided yet?

                                 BERTA
                            (hesitating)
                        Yeah... Uh... Can I get the ummm... 
                        The ummm--

                                 ANITA
                            (annoyed)
                        Just give her the grilled chicken 
                        salad. No sesame dressing because 
                        she’s allergic to the seeds. Just 
                        give her ranch or something.

           Berta is stunned. Anita hands the Waiter Berta’s menu
                                 WAITER
                            (to Berta)
                        Is... that alright ma’am?

           Berta slowly nods her head. The Waiter walks off. Anita reads 
           her magazine.

                                 BERTA
                        I’m allergic to sesame seeds? The 
                        doctor tell you that or something?

           Anita looks up to Berta.

                                 ANITA
                        A lot of people are.

                                 BERTA
                            (nervously laughing)
                        And my sister... she used to do 
                        this thing, because I could never 
                        decide what to get... She’d just 
                        order my food, real quick like. She 
                        always got me a salad because... 
                        because I could never make up my 
                        mind and it’s just something I 
                        wouldn’t complain about.

           Anita looks down, back into her magazine. Berta, pushing her 
           glasses farther down her face, looks at Anita in the face.

           As she stares, you can see the gears turning in Berta’s head. 
           She looks around the restaurant and then back at Anita. She 
           looks down at her things, beginning to panic. She leans 
           forward, trying to get a closer look at Anita’s face. She 
           stares so intently, almost reaching out to touch Anita’s 
           face.

           After a silence, Berta violently gasps.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        My God! Oh my God, Anita!

           Anita looks up, stunned by Berta calling out her name. Berta 
           is shell-shocked by her environment. She grasps onto 
           everything around her, confused and horrified. Tears swell 
           into her eyes.

           Anita looks at her like she’s crazy. Berta tries to grasp for 
           air and words. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (getting louder)
                        Anita, my God, My sister Anita its-

                            (beat)
                        Where the hell are we?

           Anita scrambles.

                                 ANITA
                            (hushing her)
                        Calm down... I’m not who you think 
                        I am.

                                 BERTA
                        You think I don’t know my own 
                        sister!?

                                 ANITA
                            (sternly)
                        Calm down, Berta.

           People stare at the scene. A STRANGER, from a nearby table, 
           reaches out her hand in attempts to console Berta.

                                 BERTA
                            (screaming)
                        No! Don’t touch me! This isn’t 
                        happening.

                                 ANITA
                        Ber-

           The Waiter rushes over.

                                 WAITER
                        Is everything alright.

           He startles Berta.

                                 ANITA
                        Everything is fine!

                                 WAITER
                        Should you take her somewhere?

           Anita, embarrassed by it all, ignores her sister.

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Do you need me to help you to the 
                        bathroom, ma’am. 

           He tries to help Berta into her wheelchair.

                                 BERTA
                        Get your hands off of m--

                        Berta! Go get yourself together. 
                        You’re embarrassing yourself! We’ll 
                        talk when you get back. Now get!

           Berta, tears flowing, looks Anita in the eyes. They’re cold 
           and dark.

           Berta reluctantly gets into the wheelchair. As the Waiter 
           pushes her away, Berta extends a hand, trying to grab 
           Anita’s. Anita pulls away.

           The diner is silent and everyone looks at Anita.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Y’all can go back to minding your 
                        own now! Shows over!

           Everyone slowly turns around.

           Anita sits there, by herself, trying to occupy her time. 
           She’s anxious.  

           She checks the clock. TICK. TICK. TICK. It’s been minutes.

           She taps her foot, pushes up her glasses, and quickly eats 
           her food. The Waiter from before walks by Anita and gives her 
           an awkward smile as he goes to take another order.

           She checks the clock again. TICK. TICK. TICK. Minutes seem 
           like hours.

           After she finishes her burger Anita stares at Berta’s purse 
           that’s left on the table. It’s a worrisome stare.

           Just then, Anita realizes that Berta’s been gone for a long 
           time. She looks around the diner, Berta no where in sight.

           Anita gets up to get a better look around. Nothing.

           Curiously, she walks towards the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a cheaply designed, crappy music playing, one woman 
           stall bathroom. 

           Anita inches in.

                                 ANITA
                        Berta!
           Anita goes all the way in and stands outside of the stall.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (annoyed)
                        Would you get your ass out here. We 
                        don’t have all the time in the 
                        world.

           Nothing.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (pushing on the door)
                        Berta!

           Anita, confused, opens the stall. 

           Empty. 

           INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Anita rushes through the bathroom door to a crowd who is 
           paying no attention. She sweats.  

           She hastily looks around, no Berta of sight. 

           She hustles back over to her seat and quickly grabs her 
           things, still looking around. Just as she collects her 
           belongings, the waiter walks past.

                                 ANITA
                            (grabbing his arm)
                        Hey! Hey! Where did you take her?!

                                 WAITER
                        To the bathroom.

                            (getting louder)
                        She ain’t there! 

                                 WAITER
                        I only pushed her in the door 
                        ma’am. I didn’t stay to make sure 
                        she used it.

                                 ANITA
                        You saw how she was actin’, you 
                        shoulda been watching her. Don’t 
                        you know how to take care of 
                        somebody?!
                            (beat)
                        Just move out of my damn way.
           Anita pushes past and grabs Berta’s belongings. 

           Anita CLAPS loudly, garnering everyone’s attention.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me for a moment! Everybody

                        been. I don’t know. 

           No one says anything.

                        door!?

           People turn back to their food and families. 

           Anita gets angrier. 

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Well fine! Continue to worry about 
                        your damn selves!

           She hastily exits, pushing past the Waiter. She bumps into 
           people’s chairs purposely.

           EXT. DINER - EVENING

           Anita barrels out of front door and into the parking lot. She 
           looks around for any trace of Berta. She gets more and more 
           nervous as each moment passes.
                                 ANITA
                        Berta! Where the hell are you.

           She begins to circle the lot. Anita checks each side of the 
           diner. All she sees is dark woods in back and the reflection 
           of neon lights across the lot.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        I will leave you here. Keep 
                        playing! 

           Anita walks over to her car. She checks the front and back 
           seat over and over again. Clearly she’s not there.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (to herself)
                        Too damn old for this. Feels like 
                        I’m baby-sitting a child!

           Anita leans up from the driver’s seat. She takes one final 
           worrisome look around. She’s checked everywhere. 

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (screaming at the top of 
                             her lungs)
                        Berta!!!!

           Just then, a bus drives by and HONKS at a screaming Anita. 

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (yelling)
                        Same to you!!

           Just as the bus goes out of sight, into the distance, it 
           drives and stops at a Gas Station.

           Anita squints her eyes, looking in the distance. She sees a 
           figure, sitting under a light. It’s Berta. Just then, she 
           hops on the bus and pulls off into the night.

           Anita’s eyes widen in horror. Anita scrambles around the 
           parking lot looking for her car. She scrambles through her 
           bag, looking for her keys.

           She finally finds them, fumbling with them as she gets into 
           the car.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anita starts the car, trying not to panic. She yanks into 
           gear and flies out onto the road.
           As she drives down the dark road, she doesn’t see the bus. 
           She picks up speed, barreling through the street. As she 
           passes an intersection, to the right, she sees what seems 
           like the bus.

           Almost missing the turn, Anita skids around the corner, 
           SCREECHING car and all. Almost hitting a parked car, Anita 
           maneuvers into her lane.

           Picking up speed, chasing behind the bus, Anita pulls up next 
           to the bus, on the opposite side of the street. As she tries 
           to make her way next to the driver, she motions for him to 
           pull over. She HONKS. 

                                 ANITA
                            (shouting)
                        Hey!!! Hey!! Pull over!

           He doesn’t hear or see her. She speeds up and tries again, 
           flailing her arms while trying to control her car.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Pull Over!!

           He finally sees Anita but just then, he notices a CAR coming 
           straight for her. He waves his hands ardently and motions to 
           the oncoming car. Anita finally notices and swerves out of 
           the way, into the grass, just in time. 

           As she whips back around, the bus is farther in the distance. 
           She slams on the pedal and pulls in front of the bus. 

           INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

           The DRIVER and passengers watch, confused while Berta sleeps.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Anita jets in front of the bus and slams on the brakes. The 
           Bus Driver, trying not to hit her, SCREECHES to a halt. All 
           of the passengers jolt forward.

           Anita gets out of her car, runs to the Bus, and knocks on the 
           door. He opens it.

           INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

           They all stare at Anita, confused. Anita’s out of breath.
                                 ANITA
                            (to the driver)
                        I know you heard me honking!

                                 DRIVER
                        What in the hell are you doing?

           Anita looks around the bus and sees Berta asleep. She walks 
           over to her and nudges her awake. Berta’s groggy.

                                 BERTA
                        Can I help you?

                                 ANITA
                        Come on, lets go!

           Anita grabs Berta’s arm to get up.

                                 BERTA
                        Hey don’t go grabbin’ me. You don’t 
                        know me like that.

                                 ANITA
                        How I wish that were true. 
                            (beat)
                        Let’s go “Mrs. Murrell.”

                                 BERTA
                        How do you know my name.

           Anita rolls her eyes and escorts her off of the bus.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

                                 ANITA
                        Go on, get in.

                                 BERTA
                        I ain’t--

                                 ANITA
                        Berta! 
                            (beat)
                        Get in the car!

           Berta hesitantly gets in. Anita follows suit, starts the car, 
           and their off.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

                                 BERTA
                        Where are we going?
                                 ANITA
                        To pick up your pieces, as usual.

                                 BERTA
                        What?

                                 ANITA
                        To get your wheelchair. You left it 
                        at a gas station and I won’t be the 
                        one to pay for it if it’s gone.

                                 BERTA
                        You don’t owe me nothing.

           They come to a red light.

           Anita looks over to Berta, somewhat guiltily.

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah well, I’m the one who has to 
                        get you to Atlanta in one piece.

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - DAY - 1975 

           Anita, tears in her eyes, sits at a red light behind another 
           driver. She looks back into her rearview mirror to see Berta 
           right behind her.

           Anita pounds the HORN. The DRIVER in front of her can’t move - 
           It’s a red light. 

           Anita looks in the rearview mirror again. Berta motions “pull 
           over.”

           As soon as the light turns green, Anita whips around the car 
           in front of her. She creates a commotion of HORNS and YELPS. 

           She pulls into an adjacent gas station, slams on the breaks, 
           turns off the car.

           EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Berta pulls into the station, right behind Anita. Berta 
           quickly turns off the car and gets out. She waits for Anita 
           to do the same. 

           Anita composes herself and gets out. They stare eye to eye 
           like a standoff.

           PEOPLE stop and watch the scene. Berta approaches.
                                 BERTA
                        I’ll never stop chasing you. You 
                        know that! 

           Anita says nothing.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (coming closer)
                        We’re both stubborn. Mama always 
                        said it.

           Still, nothing. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Only ones who deal with us was each 
                        other. 

           Berta shows her wrist. On it, an aged bronze BRACELET with 
           STICK FIGURES AND THE LETTERS “A & B”sheepishly carved in it. 

           She hands it to Anita.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        See. 

           Anita examines it and with one swoop, tosses it into the gas 
           station lot. Berta stands shocked.

           Anita gets into the car, starts it, and pulls off.

           Berta, stunned, walks over to pick up the bracelet. After 
           contemplating giving up, she puts back on the bracelet and 
           gets in the car. 

           Just as quickly as Anita, Berta storms out of the lot, right 
           on Anita’s trail.

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT - 2000

           Anita pulls up, brakes SCREECHING. She stops the car.

                                 ANITA
                        Go on. Go get it.

           Berta gets out to retrieve the chair. As she does so, Anita 
           just stares at Berta and grins. She looks around, almost 
           laughing at the situation but just as she notices her ease, a 
           scowl returns to her face, not letting herself be happy for 
           one instance.
           Anita reaches over to the passenger side window and cranks it 
           down. 

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Come on! It’s late!

                                 BERTA
                        Quit your yelling!

           Berta walks over to the car, pushing the wheelchair. 

                                 ANITA
                        Put it in the back seat.

                                 BERTA
                        So bossy.

           Berta tries to open the door. It’s locked.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Well, how am I supposed to put it 
                        in if it’s locked!

                                 ANITA
                        I ain’t gonna let you in until you 
                        remember who I am. I ain’t gonna be 
                        explaining everything to you for 
                        the rest of the trip. Who am I?

                                 BERTA
                        Some woman who kidnapped me from a 
                        bus?

                                 ANITA
                        Come on now!

                                 BERTA
                        I know who you are! Can we go.

                                 ANITA
                        I’m your driver, remember? JUST 
                        your driver... from the hospital.

                                 BERTA
                        I said I know!

                                 ANITA
                        Say it!

           Berta scoffs.

                                 BERTA
                        Your my driver! From the hospital. 
           She doesn’t fully understand but she’s too tired to care.

                                 ANITA
                        You mean that or you just saying?

                                 BERTA
                        I mean it.

                                 ANITA
                        How do you know?

                                 BERTA
                        Because that’s what you told me.

                                 ANITA
                        You just believe everything 
                        somebody tells you?

                                 BERTA
                        You seem believable. Are we there 
                        yet?

                                 ANITA
                        Does it look like it? 
                            (beat)
                        I’m taking you to Emory, remember?

           Berta looks around, confused.

                                 BERTA
                        You smell like booze.

                                 ANITA
                        And your wig is crooked but we 
                        ain’t got time for observations. We 
                        gotta get back on the road.

           Anita unlocks the car. Berta puts the wheelchair in the 
           backseat and gets in the front. 

                                 BERTA
                        Uh-uh, I’m tired.

                                 ANITA
                        You can sleep in the car, let’s go-

                                 BERTA
                        I can’t sleep in no car! Find 
                        somewhere to sleep or something.

                                 ANITA
                        We lost time because of you!
                                 BERTA
                        Because of me? What did I do?

                                 ANITA
                        It would take me longer to explain 
                        it to your crazy ass then it would 
                        to get to Emory so just get in and 
                        enjoy the ride.

                                 BERTA
                        If you don’t get me a bed soon, I 
                        swear.

                                 ANITA
                        Would you stop your complaining. 
                            (beat)
                        We are driving!

                                 BERTA
                        Ain’t you tired too!

           Anita looks at the clock. It’s around 1am. She looks in the 
           rearview mirror. She looks like a tired wreck.

           Anita starts the car and they’re off.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Anita jiggles the rickety doorknob, CREAKING through. The 
           two, Anita in front of a chair-bound Berta, stand in the 
           threshold. They look at the disgusting room, mouths agape. 

           It’s old. Wallpaper is peeling. Lamps have different colored 
           bulbs. The ceiling has water spots. The two twin-beds have 
           hideous comforters and the beds have one pillow each.

           You really get what you pay for and they know it. 

           They slowly enter. They clean off the beds with a wipe Berta 
           pulls from her bag.

                                 BERTA
                        Of all the places?

                                 ANITA
                        I didn’t see you put not one nickel 
                        in this dime so shut it. You needed 
                        a bed, now you got one.

           Berta rolls over to the bed closest to the window and places 
           her things on the bedside table.
                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 BERTA
                        Going to bed. 

                                 ANITA
                        Not over there. I always sleep next 
                        to the window.

                                 BERTA
                        Well so do I!

                                 ANITA
                        You ain’t never slept next to no 
                        window, now move!

                                 BERTA
                        Excuse me?

                                 ANITA
                        Move!

                                 BERTA
                        Do you just argue with everyone, 
                        constantly? How can people stand to 
                        be around you when you make it this 
                        difficult? Keep acting like that, 
                        after I’m gone you’ll truly be 
                        alone. You want the damn bed, take 
                        it. I’m too tired for this.

           Berta wheels over to the other bed, gets up, takes her 
           clothes off, and gets in. 

           She CLICKS off the light and faces away from Anita who is now 
           in her underwear.

           Anita, who sits on the edge of the bed, stares at Berta, 
           guiltily. 

           Anita looks around the room. She takes in her surroundings 
           and sees an old RADIO on the dresser. She gets up, CLICKING 
           off her bedside table light.

           In the darkness, she scoots to the dresser and picks up the 
           radio. Then she goes to the mini-fridge, opens it, and grabs 
           a handful of mini-vodka bottles. Juggling everything, she 
           takes it all into the bathroom and shuts the door.
           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Anita stands in front of the mirror looking at herself. With 
           a wet paper-towel, she wipes the make-up off of her face. 

           As she goes through her ritual, she gets more anxious. 

           She pops open one bottle. Two bottles. Three bottles.

           Downing each like a shot, she goes back to her face. She 
           still can’t focus. Tears forming in her eyes, she reaches 
           over for the radio and turns it up. 

           SMOOTH and QUIET JAZZ PLAYS. Staring at it, she begins to 
           breath heavily through her teeth, trying to hold back tears.

                                 ANITA
                        Come on. Come on. Come on.

           After she finishes rinsing, she takes her head out of the 
           sink and bumps it on the faucet.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (whispered)
                        Shit! 

           Anita slides down against the tub, holding her head. As she’s 
           down there she sits and contemplates. 

           She looks at the radio, grabs it, and holds it close. She 
           stares ahead as tears roll down her face. She turns it up and 
           closes her eyes.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           BANG BANG BANG on the door.

           Anita sprawls across the bathroom floor, neck contorted 
           against the dirty porcelain tub.

           Anita bolts up. She notices her surroundings. She fell asleep 
           on the bathroom floor. She kicks around the mini bottles of 
           alcohol.

           She massages her neck and wipes the drool from her cheek. 

           BANG BANG BANG.

                                 ANITA
                        I’m up! I’m up!
           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           They quickly drive down the highway. They don’t talk to each 
           other until--

                                 BERTA
                        How much longer?

           Anita doesn’t know. She looks around for a sign but doesn’t 
           see anything.

                                 ANITA
                        I don’t know for sure. We just have 
                        to be there by tomorrow morning 
                        which is plenty of time. All you 
                        have to do is just sit back.

                                 BERTA
                        Well you slept until two.

                                 ANITA
                        Excuse me for being a little tired 
                        after what you put me through!

                                 BERTA
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah, I bet.

                                 BERTA
                        Who are you again?

                                 ANITA
                        Dammit, Berta. I’m driving you to 
                        the hospital.

           Nothing.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to keep doing this 
                        with you.

                                 BERTA
                        That’s right. Now I remember. The 
                        evil lady.

           Beat.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Imma get you this trip.
                                 ANITA
                        Get me to do what?

                                 BERTA
                        To lighten up. Smile. Laugh. Do 
                        somethin’ other than just mope 
                        around all the time.

                                 ANITA
                            (annoyed)
                        I am lightened. 

                                 BERTA
                            (laughing)
                        That ain’t even a word.

                                 ANITA
                        Since when isn’t that a word?!
                            (beat)
                        Look you sure think you know so 
                        much for somebody whose losing her 
                        mind.

                                 BERTA
                        Ain’t nobody losing nothing! I know 
                        a lot more than you think!

           They sit in silence for a bit. It gets awkward as Berta looks 
           over to Anita.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        You wanna play a game.

                                 ANITA
                        No.

                                 BERTA
                        It’s easy.

                                 ANITA
                        No.

                                 BERTA
                        Ever hear of the alphabet game?

           Anita looks over. Of course she’s heard of it.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        You gotta find words that start 
                        with each letter of the alphabet, 
                        starting with A all the way to Z. 
                        They gotta be real words too, not 
                        no--
                                 ANITA
                        No car types or made up words. I 
                        know.

                                 BERTA
                        Ohhh so you do have fun in you 
                        somewhere?
                            (beat)
                        My sisters and I used to play this 
                        game on our walk to school. Never 
                        won too much. Wasn’t that 
                        competitive either.

           A silence. They drive past a sign with a bunch of food 
           locations on them. “Arby’s” “McDonald’s” “Subway” “Wendy’s”

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        A! Arby’s!

                                 ANITA
                        No no no. You just said you can’t 
                        use fake words. 

                                 BERTA
                        I was just testing you. But you 
                        just said you weren’t playing.

                                 ANITA
                        I’m not!

           Berta silences. 

           They drive farther down the road until they see a billboard 
           advertisement for “Animal Planet.” 

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (excitedly)
                        A! Animal! Ha! See.

                                 BERTA
                        Nah see, nah see!!! That ain’t 
                        fair! I would’ve had that one if I 
                        woulda known you were playinh!

                                 ANITA
                            (laughing)
                        Competitions aren’t always fair!

                                 BERTA
                        Okay. Okay. I got you!

           Berta looks around, head moving swiftly from side to side. 
           She sees Anita trying to do the same.
                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Uh-uh, keep your eyes on the road! 
                        You ain’t about to kill us both!

                                 ANITA
                        How else am I supposed to see 
                        anything!

                                 BERTA
                        Competitions ain’t always fair, now 
                        are they?

           They both look. Just then, Berta jokingly covers Anita’s eyes 
           with her hands.

                                 ANITA
                        What the hell, are you crazy!?!

                                 BERTA
                        Ah ah ah, don’t take your hands off 
                        the wheel, now.

           Anita shakes Berta’s hands loose and just as she does--

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Ha! Bank of America! Bank!

                                 ANITA
                        Cheating hussy!

           Berta laughs!

           The two look for more words on signs. A billboard for 
           “Carfax” passes by!

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        C! Car-

                                 BERTA
                            (giggling)
                        Fax! Carfax, you can’t use that!

                                 ANITA
                        Car is a word!

                                 BERTA
                        But it’s a part of Carfax!

                                 ANITA
                            (fighting a smile)
                        Oh, what do you know!

           They try to look for more signs but it’s nothing but open 
           road. It’s silent.
                                 BERTA
                        Do you have any music?

                                 ANITA
                        Turn on the radio.

           Berta tries to figure out the radio but she can’t

                                 BERTA
                        It ain’t working.

                                 ANITA
                        I think I got some CDs but don’t 
                        turn them up too damn loud. I need 
                        to focus. 

           Berta opens it to find the blank CDs.

                                 BERTA
                        Which one?

                                 ANITA
                        How the hell am I supposed to 
                        know?! Just pick one.

           Berta inserts a CD and presses play. First SONG that comes on 
           - Chuck Berry’s “Rock and Roll Music.” Berta’s not feeling 
           it. Next.

           Then, “Unchained Melody.” Next. “Sixteen Tons.” Next. 

           “Rock Around the Clock.” Anita looks over to Berta, 
           recognizing the song.

                                 BERTA
                        Oooooo this was my jam! When I was 
                        younger me and my sister had this 
                        dance to this! Boy, it was 
                        something! 

           She tries to do a hand jive motion, two slaps on her thighs, 
           and a stomp on the floor. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Shit I can’t remember.
                            (beat)
                        Over under, two slaps, stomp?

           Berta tries again, it doesn’t quite work. Anita watches and 
           smiles.

           Berta tries again. She’s still not on beat.
                                 ANITA
                            (calmly)
                        Try over under, one slap, two 
                        stomps.

           Berta does so. It’s perfectly on beat.

                                 BERTA
                        Okay! Okay!

           She does it again. She’s getting the hang of it. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (singing full out)
                        Put your glad rags on and join me 
                        hon/We’ll have some fun when the 
                        clock strikes one/We’re gonna rock 
                        around the clock tonight. Your 
                        turn!

           Berta points to Anita. Anita looks at her like she’s crazy 
           and misses the verse.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Ohhh Boo You! When the clock 
                        strikes two, three and four/If the 
                        band slows down we’ll yell for 
                        more. Go!

           She points to Anita who misses the verse again.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        One more time! When the chimes ring 
                        five, six, and seven/We’ll be right 
                        in seventh heaven.

           She points to Anita. Through a begrudged tone--

                                 ANITA
                        We’re gonna... something something 
                        something, till broad daylight.

                                 BERTA
                        Woooo there she is!!
                            (beat)
                        Last time I had this much fun in 
                        damn car was when me and my sister 
                        stole the neighbor’s old Cadillac. 
                        She could hotwire the hell out of 
                        anything! 

           Berta turns up the MUSIC and cranks down her window, sticking 
           her head out, holding onto her wig. Anita looks at her.
                                 ANITA
                        Get your head back in here and tell 
                        me the next direction! We’re coming 
                        up on an exit and I don’t know if 
                        it’s ours!

           Berta plops back down and begins to dig through her purse. 
           She finds the directions and starts to read.

           She looks up, squinting, and back down to her paper.

                                 BERTA
                        I can’t tell if I wrote US-78N or 
                        US-78S!

                                 ANITA
                            (sharply)
                        What do you mean you can’t tell! N 
                        and S are two damn different 
                        letters!

                                 BERTA
                        Well pull over, I can’t tell with 
                        all this bumping!

           Anita makes her way over to the shoulder of the road, brakes 
           SQUEAKING. When she comes to stop, the engine temperature is 
           even higher than before. She looks worried but quickly 
           diverts her attention to Berta.

                                 ANITA
                        Well??

                                 BERTA
                        I can’t make it out.

                                 ANITA
                        Give it to me.

           She snatches it from Berta and tries to read it as well. She 
           can’t.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        The one thing you had to do and you 
                        went and messed it all up.

                                 BERTA
                        The rest looks fine!

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah well we don’t need the rest, 
                        right now, do we? We need this 
                        part.

                            (beat)
                        I’m keeping this the rest of way.

           Anita puts the directions in her pocket.

                                 BERTA
                        Well which way are we going to go?

           Anita looks at both signs.

                                 ANITA
                        South. We goin to Atlanta right? 
                        That’s the south.

                                 BERTA
                        That ain’t how that works.

                                 ANITA
                        Shut up!

           Anita starts the car again and REVS the engine.

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON - 1975

           Anita waits at a red light. She REVS the engine. 

           She’s anxious. She looks in her rearview mirror to see Berta 
           swerving through cars. Cars HONK their horns.

           Eric begins to wake up, CRYING. Anita holds her head - a 
           headache. 

           The light turns green. Anita speeds through the intersection 
           passing by other cars, changing lanes and all.

           It’s a residential street so she dodges cars, coming way too 
           close to them.

           As she makes her way down the street, she checks the rearview 
           mirror constantly. Berta is not too far behind.

                                 ANITA
                            (screaming)
                        Leave me the fuck alone, God 
                        dammit!

           Eric CRIES louder.

           Anita cuts a corner hard, jolting everything inside the car. 
           She places one hand on Eric and slams on the breaks. They’re 
           at another light. 
           Berta, through the rearview mirror, motions to Anita to “Pull 
           Over!”

           Anita gets more anxious.

           Berta HONKS her horn. Once. Twice. Three Times and holds it. 
           Anita HONKS back. The person in front of Anita, thinks she’s 
           honking at them. HE puts his head out of the window and gives 
           her the finger. 

           Traffic moves again. Anita picks up speed, desperately 
           wanting to make the next light.

           Berta is right behind her.

           The light turns red. Anita’s not there yet but she slams the 
           pedal even harder, closing her eyes. HONKING increases. 

           She opens her eyes, just making the light. As she opens her 
           eyes and looks into the rearview mirror. She sees Berta in 
           the intersection until--

           CRASH. Berta is T-boned by another, speeding car. Glass flies 
           everywhere. The car, like a toy, is tossed to the side of the 
           street.

           Everything stops.

           Anita lets up on the throttle, still going forward while she 
           stares backwards. She finally stops.

           PEOPLE surround Berta’s car.

           EXT. STREET INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

           Anita slowly gets out, mouth agape, stunned completely. She 
           walks towards the scene, in a daze. Everything around her is 
           slow. SOUNDS are muted. There’s a RINGING.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                            (shouting)
                        Someone call an ambulance! 

           People run to the car side while Anita approaches, like 
           walking to the gallows. 

           She gets to the side of Berta’s crushed car. She looks inside 
           and sees Berta, unconscious, bleeding from the head. 

           People look at Anita. They recognize Berta was chasing Anita.

           Anita backs up, afraid, tears rushing from her face. 
                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you know her?

           Anita says nothing and stumbles backwards, staggering towards 
           her car. She flees the scene. 

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anita hops in, shaken up. Eric still CRIES. She puts her head 
           in her hands, tapping her leg vigorously. She looks over to 
           Eric--

                                 ANITA
                            (shouting)
                        Please... Be quiet. Be quiet! SHUT 
                        UP! 

           Eric continues to CRY.

           Anita, wipes her face off, looks in the mirror, and falsely 
           composes herself.

           She starts the car, clears her throat, and stares at the 
           scene unfold in her rear view mirror.

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - EVENING - 2000

           Close on Anita’s face. She’s content.

           Anita and Berta drive along. It’s quiet in a serene way. 
           There’s a sense of familiarity and comfort in the car.

                                 BERTA
                        So how close are we anyway?

           Anita looks around to a sign. 

                                 ANITA
                        Well we in Georgia so I’m thinking 
                        not too far ahead.

                                 BERTA
                        Need me to check the directions?

           Anita looks at Berta with a grin.

                                 ANITA
                        Not this time.
                            (looking around)
                        I should be good now. 
                                 BERTA
                        You sure?

                                 ANITA
                            (unconvincingly)
                        Yeah, yeah. Besides I used to live 
                        down here. I think I remember a few 
                        streets. 

                                 BERTA
                        Get outta here! I did too!

           Anita, eyes straight ahead, smiles. She knows.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Lived on Alemeda! Heard of it?

                                 ANITA
                        Sounds familiar.

                                 BERTA
                        Me and my husband lived there.

                                 ANITA
                            (sharply)
                        Change the subject.

                                 BERTA
                        You have a husband?

                                 ANITA
                        I said change the subject, didn’t 
                        I?

                                 BERTA
                        Listen, you gonna stop talking to 
                        me like that, alright? 

           Silence.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        I had my daughter on the Alemeda.

           Anita rolls her eyes.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        You got any kids?

                                 ANITA
                        You already asked me that.
                                 BERTA
                        Damn, did I?
                            (beat)
                        What’d you say?

                                 ANITA
                        Yes.

                                 BERTA
                        Yes, what?

                                 ANITA
                        Yes, dammit, I got some kids!

                                 BERTA
                        You gotta say somethin’ more than 
                        just one word answers then! 

                                 ANITA
                        What don’t you understand about the 
                        word yes!?

                                 BERTA
                        How many?

                                 ANITA
                            (annoyed)
                        I told you that too!

                                 BERTA
                        Well guess what. Surprise! I don’t 
                        remember. Now, how many?

           A beat.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        What you don’t know how many kids 
                        you got? This is a time where a one 
                        word answer would be nice!

                                 ANITA
                            (quietly)
                        Three.

                                 BERTA
                        Well where are they? What do they 
                        do? How much money they make?

           Berta giggles. Anita doesn’t say anything. She looks forward, 
           straight at the road.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Silent treatment again, huh?
           Beat.

                                 ANITA
                        My youngest lives back up in 
                        Maryland. He does some TV thing, I 
                        don’t know exactly.

                                 BERTA
                        Good money?

           Anita doesn’t answer.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        What about the other two?

                                 ANITA
                        They don’t do anything.

                                 BERTA
                        Why the hell not? They grown adults 
                        ain’t they?! They should be doing 
                        something.

                                 ANITA
                            (deflecting)
                        Well you can’t do nothing if you’re 
                        dead, now can you.

           Berta looks at Anita, shocked. Anita keeps her eyes forward.

                                 BERTA
                        I uh... I’m sorry. Losing a child 
                        must be tough. I know I couldn’t 
                        imagine losing mine.

           Anita looks over to Berta. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        They loved you.

           Anita nods.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Is that why you moved to Baltimore?

                                 ANITA
                        Atlanta’s a shit place.

                                 BERTA
                        Then why are we going there? 

                                 ANITA
                        Look, I told you I can’t keep doing 
                        this with you.
           They drive over a rough bumpy patch in the road. The car 
           shakes and as it does, the Butterfly Mobile falls from the 
           rearview mirror and into Berta’s foot-space.

           Anita tries to look for it while keeping her eyes ahead.

                                 BERTA
                        I got it, I got it. Keep your eyes 
                        forward.

                                 ANITA
                        Be careful with that!

           Berta picks it up and gently places it back onto the rearview 
           mirror.

           She looks at Anita, again, noticing her butterfly attire.

                                 BERTA
                        You really love butterflies.

                                 ANITA
                        You’ve said that before too.

                                 BERTA
                        My sister loved butterflies. 

           Anita complacently nods.

           Berta looks to Anita, who is dressed in all Butterfly attire.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        But probably not as much.

           Smoke begins to billow from the car hood.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Ummmm, what’s going on?

                                 ANITA
                        That’s the car in front of me.

                                 BERTA
                        No it ain’t. It’s you!

           The smoke builds. Anita looks down at her engine temperature 
           gauge. It’s skyrocketed. More smoke comes out of the hood. It 
           blocks her line of sight.

                                 ANITA
                        Son of a bitch!
                                 BERTA
                            (starting to panic)
                        Lord Jesus, we’re going to burn 
                        alive on the way to... where are we 
                        going again?

                                 ANITA
                        Be quiet, I can’t think!

           Anita speeds up.

                                 BERTA
                        Why are you going faster?!

                                 ANITA
                        To blow the smoke out of th--

           BANG!

           They rear-end a car in the middle of the highway. They 
           weren’t going that fast so it’s a tiny scratch.

           Anita and Berta sit, silently, mouth wide open. Anita, still 
           stunned, turns the car off.

           An OLD MAN, (70s), White, gets out of his car and walks to 
           the back bumper. He’s in a state of “what the fuck?!”

           Anita gets out and approaches him. Berta rolls down her 
           window.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

                                 MAN
                        Yeah, you think?!

                                 ANITA
                        My car is--

                                 MAN
                        Is shit. I can see that!

                                 ANITA
                        Hey now, wait a minute.

                                 MAN
                        You’re paying big for this.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh it’s just a scratch! I can get 
                        this out.
           Anita walks over to the car, licks her thumb, and tries to 
           wipe it clean. Nothing.

                                 MAN
                        A scratch you’re paying for.

                                 ANITA
                        Look, I ain’t got no money.

                                 MAN
                        I can wait!

                                 ANITA
                        You’ll be waitin’ forever.

                                 MAN
                        Well you’ll owe me...

                                 ANITA
                        I ain’t got anything to give you.

           He looks her up and down. He skeevishly smiles.

                                 MAN
                        What about dinner.

                                 ANITA
                        Excuse me?

                                 MAN
                        A fine, Afro-American woman like 
                        yourself I’m sure could use a good 
                        meal every once in a while.

                                 BERTA
                        Did he say dinner? I’m starving.

                                 MAN
                        There’s room for you too. The more 
                        the merrier.

           He creepily smiles at her. 

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        So what do you say? You ain’t got 
                        much of another option.

                                 ANITA
                        Look, I gotta get her to the 
                        hospital and gotta fix my car. I 
                        ain’t got no time for--
                                 MAN
                        You can’t drive this thing! Let me 
                        just call up AAA, on me, and I can 
                        take you to the hospital after 
                        dinner. How’s that sound
                            (beat)
                        I assume you’re going to Emory, 
                        yes?

           Anita nods.

                                 ANITA
                        Look. We have strict directions. We 
                        just can’t go off route, getting 
                        all lost.

                                 MAN
                        Well Emory’s only 20 miles from 
                        here and I’m not too far. 20 miles 
                        is 20 minutes! You won’t need them 
                        now that you’ve got me.

           Anita looks at the Man, at her car, to Berta, and back at his 
           smiling face.

           INT. MAN’S HOME - NIGHT

           It’s a quaint, oddly decorated home. Everything is a shade of 
           Brown and looks like it smells like moth balls.

           Tacky wallpaper is plastered on the walls and an Victorian 
           styled china cabinet obstructs an entire wall of the dinning 
           room. 

           Plates are dusty. Everything is in sets of one.  

           The Man comes out of the kitchen with mismatched plates in 
           hand. One for Anita and one for Berta. He re-enters the 
           kitchen.

           Anita and Berta look at each other, down at the food, and 
           back at each other. He returns.

           Anita guzzles down a glass of wine like it’s water. She 
           begins to pour herself another.

                                 MAN
                        Thirsty huh?

           Anita looks at him and continues pouring. 

                                 ANITA
                        I thought you said “out” to dinner?
                                 MAN
                        You two lovely ladies deserved some 
                        home cooking. 
                            (beat)
                        So what are your names.

                                 BERTA
                        I.. Um... I am...

                                 ANITA
                        Her name is Berta.

                                 MAN
                        And yours?

                                 ANITA
                        You don’t need to know.
                            (beat)
                        Berta, you know what your name is 
                        and where we are. We’re going to 
                        the hospital.

                                 BERTA
                        I know! Don’t talk to me like no 
                        baby. I know stuff! 
                            (beat, lookng around)
                        So... you live alone?

                                 MAN
                        Have been for 34 years.

                                 BERTA
                        Were you married.

                                 MAN
                        Widowed. Haven’t been with anyone 
                        since.

           He looks at Berta.

                                 BERTA
                        Well ain’t that sweet. You miss 
                        her?

                                 MAN
                        I miss a lot of things about her, 
                        what we used to do. But her as 
                        whole, drove me up a wall.

           He laughs. She smiles back. Anita shoots Berta a look. 
                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                            (laughing)
                        Back in our day, girls was only 
                        good for a few things. She tried to 
                        change all the rules but I still 
                        loved her. 

                                 ANITA
                            (sternly)
                        And what were those “few” things?

                                 MAN
                        My lady could cook. My lady could 
                        clean. And my lady could fuck a 
                        jimmy clean. Am I right?

                                 ANITA
                        No.

           Berta chokes on her food and embarrassingly blushes. The man 
           takes that as compliment.

                                 MAN
                        Well Ms. No Name, what is it that 
                        you do?

                                 ANITA
                            (obviously lying)
                        Oh, me? I’m a stripper. What’s it 
                        to you?

                                 MAN
                        Wow... Wasn’t expecting that.
                            (beat)
                        You sisters?

                                 ANITA
                        Uh--

                                 BERTA
                        Yes!

           Anita looks over, confused.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                            (obviously lying)
                        She’s taking me to the hospital 
                        because I got a candidate for very 
                        first intestine transplant for a 
                        woman over 50! They using a goat’s 
                        intestine. Longer than a person’s, 
                        you know?
           Berta gives her a look that says “I’m clever too.” Anita 
           smiles at her. Touche.

                                 MAN
                        Wow. What a lov--

                                 ANITA
                        Dinner was great, thank you, but we 
                        really have to get going. We held 
                        up our end so now could you take us 
                        to the hospital?

           The Man looks at the time.

                                 MAN
                        Oh, but it’s past 10pm. It’s too 
                        late for me to drive.
                            (beat)
                        I can take you first thing tomorrow 
                        morning. I have guest rooms for 
                        each of you!

                                 ANITA
                        I ain’t sleepin’ in your house!

                                 MAN
                        It’ll be best for all of us, yeah?

                                 ANITA
                        No!

                                 BERTA
                        Anita...

                                 MAN
                        Ahhh, Anita. What a lovely name.

                                 ANITA
                        What?!

                                 BERTA
                        To be quite honest, with you I’m a 
                        little tired.

                                 ANITA
                        Sleep in the car!

                                 MAN
                        What car!?
                            (beat)
                        First thing tomorrow morning?
           INT. BEDROOM - AFTER MIDNIGHT

           Anita lies awake in the bed. Tossing and turning, she 
           realizes a radio on the night stand.

           She gets up and stands in front of it. She rubs the top of 
           it, looking for the on button. As she looks around she hears 
           a creek in the hallway. She teeters over to the door to look 
           out.

           As she peeps through the crack, she notices the Man walking 
           down the hallway. Rolling her eyes, she turns to walk away 
           until she notices he’s not going into his master bedroom. 

           He’s going into Berta’s room.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Anita tiptoes down the hall as best as she can. She gets to 
           Berta’s door and peeks in.  Inside, she catches the Man bare 
           naked, getting closer to Berta, wobbling his dick “awake.”

           Anita rushes in, turning on the lights.

                                 ANITA
                        Are you fucking kidding me right 
                        now!

           Anita, grabs a lamp off of the table, rips it out the wall, 
           and hurls it towards him.

           He ducks and tumbles onto the floor. Berta jolts awake.

                                 BERTA
                        What the hell!?

                                 ANITA
                        Get up, and get your clothes on! 
                        This motherfucker just tried to 
                        crawl into bed with you.

                                 BERTA
                        What’s going on?

                                 ANITA
                        Just go, dammit!

           Anita stands in front of Berta, guarding her from the man who 
           cowers in the corner.

           Anita picks up the lamp again and holds it above her head.
           Berta gets out of the bed, puts on her clothes, and exits 
           staring at the man. 

           Anita, who still seethes, stands above him. They look eye to 
           eye.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t fuck with mine.

           She shatters the lamp, SLAMMING it right next to him. She 
           leaves the room.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                            (shouting)
                        Ungrateful bitches.

           EXT. MAN’S HOME - AFTER MIDNIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Anita exits the house to an already waiting Berta. She slams 
           the door behind her.

           Berta sits in her wheelchair in the driveway.

                                 ANITA
                        Get up. We don’t have time for 
                        this. Let’s go.

                                 BERTA
                        We ain’t walking nowhere!

                                 ANITA
                        You wanna stay here!? 

           Beat.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t think so!

                                 BERTA
                        Well what the hell are we going to 
                        do then?

                                 ANITA
                        If you stopped talking, I could 
                        think some.

           Berta silences. Anita paces back and forth, looking around. 
           Just then, she catches a glimpse of the Man’s car.

           She grins. 
           EXT. MAN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anita sweats, sitting under the wheel of his car. She 
           attempts to hotwire it.

                                 BERTA
                        So you can break into a car and 
                        hotwire it too?

                                 ANITA
                        Shhh. 

           Berta looks around nervously. 

                                 BERTA
                        If you’re going to do this, do it 
                        quickly!

                                 ANITA
                        What part of shh don’t you 
                        understand?!

           Berta looks at the Man’s house. It’s dark and quiet.

           Just then, the engine cuts on. Anita perks up and hops into 
           the driver’s seat.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Hurry the hell up and get in. 

           Berta gets out of her wheelchair and puts it in the backseat. 
           She runs over to the passenger side and gets in.

           They both strap up.

           Anita REVS the engine. 

                                 BERTA
                        Well what are you waiting for?!?
                        Go!

                                 ANITA
                        I want him to see this.

           Anita slams on the HORN, not letting go. 

           The LIGHT in his house turns on. 

                                 BERTA
                        We need to go!

                                 ANITA
                        Not yet...
           She slams on the horn again. Just then, the Man opens the 
           front door. Anita rolls down her window, sticking her middle 
           finger out.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (shouting)
                        Thanks for the ride, you bastard!

           The Man, only in underwear, rushes from his front porch to 
           chase down Anita. 

           She quickly peels out of the driveway, laughing.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        WOOOOOOOO!

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The two LAUGH, speeding down the residential street. 

                                 BERTA
                            (through laughter)
                        I can’t believe that just happened! 
                        What the hell is going on here!?
                            (exhaling)
                        Woooo boy.

           Anita still laughs.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        I have to give it you. You’re one 
                        hell of woman. 

                                 ANITA
                            (wiping tears)
                        Ohh man, oh man, oh man. Where the 
                        hell are we?

                                 BERTA
                        I have no idea.

           Berta looks at a nearby sign.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Does that say Rotwell?

           Anita looks up.

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah it does.

                                 BERTA
                        Holy hell, I know where we are.
                                 ANITA
                        Girl, you don’t know a damn thing!

                                 BERTA
                        Will you just trust me. Turn down 
                        Rotwell.

                                 ANITA
                        We ain’t got time for this.

                                 BERTA
                            (sharply)
                        Just do it!

                                 ANITA
                        Alright! Alright!

           Anita does so. She arrives on another residential street. She 
           squints, driving slowly. 

                                 BERTA
                        And turn here.

           As she does so she sees the street sign that reads “Alemeda.” 
           It’s Berta’s old street. Anita’s smile wipes clean off.

                                 ANITA
                        What’re we doing here...

           Berta rummages through her purse to find her phone.

                                 BERTA
                        I can’t believe we was so close all 
                        along.
                            (beat)
                        I gotta call to make sure 
                        somebody’s home.

                                 ANITA
                        Somebody’s home..? And would you 
                        give that phone bit up already. It 
                        don’t work. 

                                 BERTA
                        What phone bit? I’ll show you it 
                        does!

           Berta dials a series of numbers. The DISCONNECTED TONE 
           sounds.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Stop here!
           They arrive at a boarded up home on the dark street. The 
           house is rotting and decrepit. The windows and front door 
           have planks of wood nailed to them. The front lawn has 
           overgrown grass.

           Berta gets out of the car, quickly approaching the house, 
           still on the phone.

           EXT. ALEMEDA ST. - CONTINUOUS

                                 BERTA
                            (excitedly)
                        Willie! Willie, baby. Open the 
                        door.

           Anita gets out of the car, furious and in disbelief. Berta 
           walks up the steps of the house and onto the porch. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        You would not believe this trip! 
                        Hurry up and open the door. It’s 
                        late.

                                 ANITA
                        What’re you doing?! Who are you 
                        talking to?!

           Anita approaches Berta on the porch of the house.

                                 BERTA
                        I thought you said I was talking to 
                        no--

                                 ANITA
                        Who’s on the phone!

                                 BERTA
                        My husba--

                                 ANITA
                        Give me the phone!

                                 BERTA
                            (smugly)
                        No! Some of us have a man waiting 
                        for us.

                                 ANITA
                        Give me the damn phone. Don’t say 
                        that name.

                                 BERTA
                        Willie? You mean MY Willie?
           Anita snatches the phone from Berta.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        What the hell?

                                 ANITA
                            (screaming into the phone)
                        Who the fuck is this, huh?! Anybody 
                        here!?! Nobody’s fucking there. 
                        See!

           Nothing. She tosses the phone onto the porch.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is wrong with you 
                        saying his name? When I tell you to 
                        do something, you do it!

                                 BERTA
                        Who do you think you are, grabbing 
                        shit from me. 

           Berta runs over to pick up the phone.

                                 ANITA
                        What’s up with you, huh? What the 
                        fuck is going on. Do you know who I 
                        am or are you fucking fogged up 
                        right now? Tell me. Who am I?

                                 BERTA
                        You’re... my driver...?

                                 ANITA
                        Are you fucking with me?

                                 BERTA
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                 ANITA
                        You said his name!

                                 BERTA
                        Yes.. I did say my husband’s name! 
                        So what?!

                                 ANITA
                        He’s not just your husband. He’s 
                        not just your fucking husband.

           Anita paces back and forth.
                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t remember anything?! My 
                        God, you don’t know who I am? If 
                        you did you’d never speak his 
                        fucking name around me.

                        And you bring me here!! To y’alls 
                        old house. Of all the places.

                                 BERTA
                        What are you going on about?

                                 ANITA
                        This whole trip, I tried. I tried 
                        to be nice to you and get through 
                        this. I did. I sat next to you this 
                        whole way with a fucking smile on 
                        my face and--
                            (beat)
                        But look where we are.

                                 BERTA
                        What ar--

                                 ANITA
                        Look around you! This ain’t your 
                        house no more! Wake the fuck up. 
                        You see this?!

           Anita runs over, kicking and punching holes in the rotting 
           wood. She BANGS on the house in a fit of rage.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Nobody’s home! Knock-knock! Hello! 
                        You don’t fucking live here 
                        anymore, got it? Nobody does!

           Berta looks around, confused. She takes in her surroundings, 

                                 BERTA
                        I...

                                 ANITA
                        He’s not just your god damn 
                        husband. He’s a murderer. He killed 
                        my kids, dammit! He killed my kids 
                        and you have no clue! Your husband 
                        is dead. My kids are dead. Your... 
                        your fucking daughter is dead. And 
                        you don’t even know it! You don’t 
                        know what it’s like to have a dead 
                        child because you so “forgot.” But 
                        for the love of God, I wish you did 
                        know that fucking pain.

                        I wish you could remember picking 
                        out her casket. And her dress. And 
                        her makeup. I wish you could 
                        remember them burying her ass 
                        because if you did, you’d never 
                        speak his fucking name to me, let 
                        alone bring me to his damn house. 

           Berta pulls at her clothes as becomes very anxious and 
           erratic in her actions. 

           Berta runs up to the door, BANGING.

                                 BERTA
                            (shouting)
                        Willie!!! Willie!! Geraldine!! Open 
                        the door!

                                 ANITA
                            (shouting)
                        I told you. I fucking told you not 
                        to marry him. I had to tell you 
                        everything and you never listened! 
                        And when you finally did, when you 
                        left him, look what happened. To 
                        me! So, I’m telling you now, I’m 
                        fucking telling you now. Don’t say 
                        his name. Dont’ say it ever again!

                                 BERTA
                            Geraldine!!!

           Berta HYPERVENTILATES, just as she’s done in the Diner, 
           looking around, fully realizing her surroundings.

                                 ANITA
                        No, shut that shit up! You don’t 
                        get to do this now! You followed me 
                        all the way to Baltimore for me to 
                        talk, so here it is. You waited 25 
                        years for this! You happy now?! I’m 
                        talking to you and I know you know 
                        who I am now!

           Berta can’t get it together. Anita gets up in her face.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                            (shouting)
                        I hated you! I hated you! I hated 
                        you! 
                            (beat)
                        But I’m here dammit. Taking care of 
                        you again! Like I always did! But 
                        I’m done now.
           Anita walks down the steps of the porch to her car. Out of 
           the backseat, she flings Berta’s wheelchair into the grass.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Get to Emory on your own!

           Berta struggles to catch her breath. She makes a run towards 
           the wheelchair, picking it up.

           Anita hops in the car, starts it, and pulls off, leaving 
           Berta standing in the grass.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anita drives down the road, blowing off steam, SCREAMING for 
           as long as her breath can take it.

           She then hits herself in the face, getting herself together.

                                 ANITA
                            (flipping God off)
                        Fuck you!!!!

           She pulls the car over to the side of the road. 

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           She gets out, breathing heavily through tears.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. 
                        Lord Jesus Christ. I can’t do this. 

           She paces in front of her car, finally deciding to lay down 
           across the top of the hood. She stares in silence at the 
           night sky before pulling herself together. 

           She stares for minutes, taking in the sky, the leaves, the 
           bushes, the forest, the SOUNDS. Everything around her. She 
           calms.

           She slags off the hood of the car and into the driver’s seat. 
           Looking in the rearview mirror, drained, she wipes tears from 
           her face. She starts the car.

           EXT. ALEMEDA ST. - CONTINUOUS

           Anita pulls up on Alemeda St. once more. As she drives up to 
           Berta’s house, she sees Berta on the porch, sitting in her 
           wheelchair, asleep.
           Anita gets out of the car, walks up to Berta, and nudges her 
           awake. 

                                 BERTA
                        Who are you?

                                 ANITA
                        Let’s go.

           INT. CAR - EARLY MORNING

           Anita drives ahead, eyes fresh from recent tears. Berta 
           sleeps.

           Anita looks at the time. “6:40am.” 20 more minutes to claim 
           the spot. Worried, she looks around for the directions and 
           can’t find them. She sees an “Exit Approaching” sign come up.

           She nudges Berta awake.

                                 ANITA
                        Give me the directions.

           Berta awakens, unaware of the huge argument that just 
           transpired.

                                 BERTA
                        Well good morning to you too.

                                 ANITA
                        We don’t have time for this. Where 
                        did you put them.

                                 BERTA
                        I ain’t got directions. I don’t 
                        even know where we’re going.

                                 ANITA
                        For the thousandth time, Emory 
                        Hospital.
                            (beat)
                        You were the one who wanted to 
                        write em and keep em. So where are 
                        they?

           Anita sits back in the chair realizing Berta is right. She 
           stops in the middle of the highway, right before the exit.

           No one is around for miles.

                                 BERTA
                        What the hell do you think you’re 
                        doing!
                                 ANITA
                        Oh hush up so I can find it!

           Anita scrambles around the car. Berta looks around nervously.

                                 BERTA
                        Could you hurry up before someone 
                        crashes into the back of us!

                                 ANITA
                        Shut up!

           Berta sits back in her seat staring ahead. Anita twirls 
           around in her seat and becomes more and more frantic.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Son of a motherfucking bitch!

           She smacks the steering wheel, pissed off. In doing so, she 
           knocks the butterfly mobile from the rearview mirror into 
           Berta’s foot space.

           Berta picks it up and holds it.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t mess with that! Just give it 
                        here, alright!

                                 BERTA
                        You really love this thing?

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah now put it back.

                                 BERTA
                        Butterflies that important, huh? My 
                        sister--

                                 ANITA
                        Yes I know, your sister loved 
                        butterflies blah blah blah, you 
                        told me.

           Anita snatches them from Berta and hangs them delicately over 
           top the rearview mirror. Berta looks at them, back up at the 
           exit, and back at the mobile.

                                 BERTA
                        You said Emory, right.
                            (beat)
                        I... I know where we are.

           Anita rolls her eyes.
                                 ANITA
                        No you don’t.

                                 BERTA
                        I do! 

                                 ANITA
                        Because this worked out so well the 
                        last time.

                                 BERTA
                        What are you going on about?

                                 ANITA
                        Nothing.

                                 BERTA
                        Look, don’t take this exit. Go to 
                        the next one... It should be... 
                        Jefferson. 

           Anita looks down at the next exit. Shit. It is Jefferson.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        From there is my sister’s house, 
                        and from there I know how to get to 
                        the hospital.

                                 ANITA
                            (to herself)
                        That ain’t the way to my house, is 
                        it?

                                 BERTA
                        Say somethin’?

                                 ANITA
                        No.. Nothing. I don’t think you’re 
                        right.

                                 BERTA
                        I am!

                                 ANITA
                        No. Let’s just go this way. I think 
                        I remember it.

                                 BERTA
                            (raising her voice)
                        No dammit! Listen to me! I ain’t 
                        some helpless little thing. It’s 
                        that way I know it! I would never 
                        forget it!
           Anita is taken aback. She doesn’t move.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Well ain’t you gonna go.

                                 ANITA
                        I don’t thi--

                                 BERTA
                        Well move then! I’ll drive!

                                 ANITA
                        HA! You’ll drive!? You can’t even 
                        drive your own wheelchair.

                                 BERTA
                        Get out!

                                 ANITA
                        No!

                                 BERTA
                        GET OUT OF THE DAMN CAR!

                                 ANITA
                        NO!

                                 BERTA
                        It’s either you get out or we’ll be 
                        stuck here forever. 

                                 ANITA
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

                        Fine! Here! Take the wheel you damn 
                        child! This should be real good.

           Anita gets out of the car and walks over to passenger side. 
           Berta gets out and walks to the driver’s.

           Anita watches Berta settle in. She’s giggling because Berta 
           clearly is very out of touch. She doesn’t quite remember how 
           to start the car, let alone drive.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Any day now.

                                 BERTA
                        Shut up. You’re distracting me.

           With a little more tests, she turns the car on. She shakily 
           drives off.
           INT. CAR - MORNING

           Berta drives through the streets of Atlanta.

                                 ANITA
                        We almost there yet?

           Berta continues her gaze forward. She’s pressed closely to 
           the wheel of the car, driving under the speed limit.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Tick Tock, Ms. Daisy.

           Berta continues on.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you said you knew where 
                        you were going!

                                 BERTA
                        I do!

                                 ANITA
                        Sure don’t seem like it.

                                 BERTA
                            (giggling)
                        I just don’t remember the last time 
                        I drove.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh sweet lord.

           As Berta drives, Anita becomes aware of her surroundings. 

           It’s the same street of Berta’s accident years ago. They stop 
           at a light. It’s the same intersection where Berta’s crash 
           took place. Anita looks distraught, out the window to the 
           spot of the accident.

                                 BERTA
                        Didn’t think I’d make it this far, 
                        did you?

           Anita doesn’t answer. She continues to stare out at the spot. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t give me no credit, huh?
                            (beat)
                        When we supposed to get there?
                                 ANITA
                            (not even looking to 
                             Berta)
                        Um... 7... am...

           Berta looks down at the clock. It reads “6:53am.” Oh shit. 
           Berta looks around, seeing if any cars are coming, and 
           through the red light she slams on the gas.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?! Are 
                        you crazy!!

                                 BERTA
                        3 minutes! We’re almost there! 
                        We’re down the street from my 
                        sister’s!! 

                                 ANITA
                        You crazy--

           Berta makes a hard turn, weaving in and out of traffic. Anita 
           bumps her head against the window.

                                 BERTA
                        My bad!

           Berta swerves again. She makes a hard turn down a residential 
           street.

           Anita perks up, recognizing her surroundings. She’s visibly 
           nervous. Just then, she sees the sign for “Monastery Avenue.” 
           It’s a straight away street so Berta picks up speed. 

           Each row house looks the exact same as Anita tries to catch a 
           glimpse of each and every one. She hopes to see her own. 
           Berta picks up more speed.

           As Berta gets to the end of the street, Anita finally catches 
           a glimpse of her old home.

           It seems like slow motion for her. It’s repainted, remodeled, 
           and refurbished. 

           In that moment, Berta zooms by. Anita turns around in her 
           chair to see the house directly behind her. It fades into the 
           distance.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        The house on the corner. That was 
                        my sister’s!
           Berta continues forward. Anita sits forward into her chair 
           and looks ahead.

                                                             FADE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY - 1975

           Anita stands in front of hospital doors as PEOPLE file in and 
           out. She’s standing in front of the ER wing. She doesn’t go 
           in.

           In a commotion, Berta’s body is wheeled out of the ambulance 
           and into the ER.

           Tears form in her eyes as she watches Berta go out of sight 
           into the madness of the hospital. She looks around, wipes her 
           face, turns around, and leaves.

                                                        MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING - 2000

           Busyness ensues. PEOPLE mill about, filing back and forth. 
           People COUGH and SNEEZE throughout the ER waiting room. 

           Like the hospital before, it’s sterile and fluorescent. 
           Nothing special. Nothing inviting. 

           Anita scuffles into the hospital ahead of Berta, who is 
           wheeling herself through the automatic doors. Anita 
           approaches a MALE RECEPTIONIST, (30s).

           It’s “7:04am”

                                 ANITA
                            (rushed)
                        Hi, I’m here to check in a patient.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        This is ER ma’am, there’s no check-
                        ins.

           Berta wheels up. The Receptionist notices her.

                                 ANITA
                        Well where is the place for 
                        Alzheimer's people?!

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        That would be down that hall right 
                        there.
           Anita begins to walk off. The Receptionist calls out to her.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                            (referring to Berta)
                        Does she need any help?

           Anita turns around.

                                 ANITA
                        She got in here just fine, didn’t 
                        she? Now hurry up. We’re late!

           Anita continues down the hallway.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Anita jets down this long hallway. BEEPS echo the halls. 
           DOCTORS jet by. Anita takes in her surrounding, albeit 
           overwhelming. 

           Berta and The Receptionist follow closely behind. 

           Anita approaches the “Alzheimer’s Residency.” Front desk.

                                 ANITA
                        I’m here to check in a patient.

           A NURSE looks up.

                                 NURSE
                        What’s the name of the patient?

                                 ANITA
                        Roberta Murrell.

           The Nurse checks the computer database.

                                 NURSE
                        Ms. Murrell was supposed to be 
                        here...

           She looks at the time. It’s now “7:18am.”

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        18 minutes ago. Unfortunately we 
                        cannot--

                                 ANITA
                        You’re not about to tell me what 
                        you can’t do if I’m only 18 minutes 
                        late.
                                 NURSE
                        I’m sorry but policy is policy.

                                 ANITA
                        Policy my ass. You didn’t spend two 
                        damn days in a car driving her ass 
                        here. So, you can chuck the policy 
                        out of the window.

                                 NURSE
                        The bed was gone 18 minutes ago.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh bullshit the bed is gone! Check 
                        again!

                                 NURSE
                        Ma’am--

                                 ANITA
                            (sternly)
                        Check. Again. Now.

           The Nurse looks at Anita, afraid. She checks the computer 
           once again, defeated.

                                 NURSE
                        Well look at th--

                                 ANITA
                        Mhmm.

           Beat.

                                 NURSE
                        Ms. Murrell.
                            (beat)

                        I have your transferred documents 
                        here in the computer but I need to 
                        confirm. Is one, Geraldine Murrell 
                        still your emergency contact?

                                 BERTA
                        Yes. That’s my daughter.

                                 NURSE
                        And you are aware that this 
                        facility maintains that you remain 
                        here in our care until further 
                        notice? You choose to be here, 
                        correct?
                                 BERTA
                        I know! I know!

           Anita looks at Berta solemnly. 

                                 NURSE
                        Alrighty! We can take you on back 
                        now.

           The Nurse grabs Berta’s wheelchair to turn until--

                                 BERTA
                            (laughing)
                        You were one hell of a driver.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh now you remember me? Convenient.

                                 BERTA
                            (laughing)
                        How could I forget someone so down 
                        right awful?

           Berta grins.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        And still nothing from you, huh? I 
                        tell ya, you’re going to miss me 
                        when I’m gone. You’ll see. Goodbye 
                        ya old grump ass. Maybe you should 
                        think about getting a new job.

           Berta laughs as Anita slowly walks off.

           The Nurse rolls her off into an adjacent room.  

                                 NURSE
                            (to Berta)
                        I almost forgot your chart!

           She rushes back to the reception desk to collect the chart. 
           Anita she rushes back over to the desk.

                                 ANITA
                        Hey...

           The Nurse looks up.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Change the emergency contact.

                                 NURSE
                        Excuse me?
                                 ANITA
                        You can’t keep Geraldine as the 
                        contact.

                                 NURSE
                        That’s really the choice of the 
                        patient.

                                 ANITA
                        Look her daughter’s dead, okay. She 
                        don’t know that. 
                            (beat)
                        Make... make me the contact.

                                 NURSE
                        And you are?

           Anita looks over towards the room and back at the Nurse. 
           These words are hard to say.

                                 ANITA
                        I’m... her sister.

                                 NURSE
                        Oh, of course.

                                 ANITA
                        But don’t tell her I did that, 
                        hear? It’s no use anyway.

           The Nurse agrees. Anita walks out towards the front doors. 
           She turns back one time.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Anita exits the hospital doors. She’s alone and she feels it. 
           She gets to her car and turns around to take one final look 
           at the hospital. She takes a deep breath and gets into the 
           car, peeling out of the parking lot. 

           INT. CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Anita drives along in silence. She stops at a red light and 
           stares at the butterfly mobile hanging.

           She leans her head against the window. Lying there, in the 
           corner of her eye, she catches a glimpse of a liquor store. 

           She perks up, turns on her left blinker and as soon as the 
           light turns green, she makes her way into the liquor store 
           parking lot.
           INT. CAR - DAY

           Anita, parked, stares forward into the street, twiddling a 
           FIFTH OF VODKA in her finger tips.

           She looks down at it, cracks the top open, and takes a large 
           swig. It burns. 

           She stares at her butterfly mobile again. After she takes 
           another burning swig of vodka, she closes the top, and puts 
           it in the back seat.

           She starts the car.

           EXT. MONASTERY AVE - DAY

           Beautifully cut, green grass sits in front of each house. 
           Perfectly painted picket fences line almost every house.

           The sky is pure blue and the sun shines down on to the 
           blissful day. A cool breeze FLUTTERS through the trees. 

           Anita’s car slowly pulls up.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anita stares ahead, fighting to look at house “2792.” When 
           she finally can bring herself to look, she stares, as a tear 
           forms in her eye. She gets out of the car.

           EXT. MONASTERY AVE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Anita walks slowly to her front steps. She takes in the 
           surroundings. It all looks so different. As she walks up the 
           steps to the front door, she can’t bring herself to knock so 
           she just stands there.

           She looks down to the lower half of the door. It’s pristine 
           unlike the gaping gun hole she remembers. She crouches down 
           to take a closer look until the door flings open. To Anita’s 
           surprise, A MOM answers the door.

                                 MOM
                        Can I help you?

           INT. ROWHOUSE - DAY

           The house is beautifully decorated, clearly renovated with 
           today’s latest designs and technology. 
           The furniture is hand picked and immaculate. Anita sits on a 
           couch, completely out of place. She looks around.

           She inspects every inch of the room. She last saw it in 
           ruins. She looks at every piece of the space, knowing what 
           has happened here. Her eyes can’t hide the hurt.

           The Mom comes back into the living room from the kitchen, 
           heading towards a coat closet.

                                 MOM
                        You sure I can’t take your coat?

           Anita takes a look at the coat closet, the one she once hid 
           in, and shakes her head.

                                 ANITA
                        No no. I’m alright. Thank you.

           The DAD comes in from the kitchen, holing a tray of waters. 
           He hands one to Anita.

                                 DAD
                        So you’re here all the way from 
                        Baltimore? That’s a long way to 
                        drive!

                                 MOM
                        How long did it take you?

                                 ANITA
                        Two days but that’s because of some 
                        things we had to take care of. 

                                 DAD
                        Understandable.

                                 MOM
                            (sweetly)
                        And it’s crazy that you used to 
                        live here! I hope we done the place 
                        some justice.

           Anita looks around.

                                 ANITA
                        It sure is something.

                                 DAD
                        And why did you come down here in 
                        the first place? 
                                 ANITA
                            (smiling)
                        Just some family business.

                                 MOM
                        Well since we’re here, would you 
                        like to see what’s new!

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah, yeah. Sure.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Mom leads Anita down the hallway.

                                 MOM
                        As you can see we managed to expand 
                        the walls a bit, giving it more 
                        room. Can you tell?

           Anita grazes her hands against the walls.

                                 MOM (CONT’D)
                        You like the wallpaper? I hope we 
                        did your place some justice.
                            (beat)
                        Let’s go upstairs. It’s, in my 
                        opinion, the best part of the 
                        house.

           She goes up the steps. Anita cautiously follows.

           In the upstairs hallway, everything is beautifully designed 
           to mimic an upscale french parlor. 

                                 ANITA
                        Wow... You weren’t kidding.

                                 MOM
                        Here, let me show you my son’s 
                        room.

           She takes Anita to a bedroom that is slightly cracked. She 
           opens it slowly to reveal a sleeping young boy. An IPad plays 
           music beside him. Anita smiles.

                                 MOM (CONT’D)
                        I designed this one myself.

                                 ANITA
                        It’s... great.
                            (beat)
                        Only way to get him sleep?
           She points to the iPad?

                                 MOM
                        Ha, yeah. How’d you know?

                                 ANITA
                        My boy was just like it.

                                 MOM
                        Oldest trick in the book.

                                 ANITA
                        We had this radio we’d stick in the 
                        bathroom down there. He could hear 
                        it from his room... This room 
                        actually. He said it made him feel 
                        safe.
                            (beat)
                        Like someone was always there. 

           Anita stares at the bathroom, exhaling. A sigh of relief and 
           comfort.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        You know... when I couldn’t be 
                        there or awake, he’d always have 
                        someone to talk to or hear.

                                 MOM
                        That’s sweet.
                            (beat)
                        Would you like to see the master 
                        bedroom?

           Anita looks at the bedroom.

                                 MOM (CONT’D)
                        Wait until you see what I did with 
                        the master closet!

           She’s not thrilled. She remembers all too well what went down 
           in that master bedroom.

                                 ANITA
                        No. No, thank you. I should get 
                        going. Back on the road, you know.

                                 MOM
                        Okay, well, do you want to call 
                        anyone to let them know you arrived 
                        safely and are on your way back?
                                 ANITA
                            (in jest)
                        Ain’t nobody worrying about me.

                                 MOM
                        Oh trust me. Someone is always 
                        worrying. I really can’t believe 
                        you are going to make that trip all 
                        alone. Didn’t you come down here 
                        with somebody?

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah but she had to stay. My sister 
                        had to stay.

                                 MOM
                        Can I ask what for?

                                 ANITA
                        You can but that don’t mean I’m 
                        gonna tell you.

           The Mom recoils, shocked by the hostility. Anita notices.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        She’s in the hospital.

                                 MOM
                        I’m so sorry to hear that. 

                                 ANITA
                        It’s fine. She’s fine. Just a bit 
                        of Alzheimer’s.

                                 MOM
                        Well I’m sure she appreciates you 
                        looking out for her and all. What 
                        are we without family!
                            (beat)
                        So you sure I can’t call nobody for 
                        you?

           This hits Anita. She takes it in.

                                 ANITA
                        I’ll be alright. Thank you though. 
                        You know, for showing me all this. 
                        It really brings me back to... to 
                        home. 

                                 MOM
                        Oh no problem! No problem at all!
           EXT. MONASTERY AVE - AFTERNOON

           Anita stands outside of the car. She takes in one final look 
           a the street. Everything has changed.

           She gets in her car, starts it, and drives off. 

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anita drives down Monastery Avenue, passing her old street. 
           As she makes her way through the city she becomes more and 
           more fidgety. She looks back towards her past.

           She taps her foot. Her heart races. The light is still red. 
           She looks at the crash site one more time.

           Fuck it. Anita makes a U-turn and beams straight back towards 
           the hospital. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

           Anita walks through the doors of the Hospital. She approaches 
           the Alzheimer’s Ward.

           She’s met by the Nurse from before at the receptionist desk.

                                 NURSE
                        Ms. Murrell. Forget something?

                                 ANITA
                        I did actually. 
                            (beat)
                        Where’s my sister’s room?

                                 NURSE
                        She’s asleep due to her medication. 
                        We’re about to take her for 
                        observation. 

                                 ANITA
                        That’s all I need.

           The Nurse escorts Anita to the room and leaves. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Anita walks up to the bed and gently caresses Berta’s hand. 
           Anita pulls a chair up to the side of the bed and sits, 
           staring genuinely. Berta sleeps.
                                 ANITA
                            (in jest)
                        I could slap you right now, you 
                        know that? All these damn years 
                        apart, and here I am still taking 
                        care of your simple ass. Funny 
                        thing is, you won’t remember a 
                        thing about it.
                            (beat)
                        It must be something to wake up and 
                        not remember a thing... Lucky even. 
                        You got all these doctors in here 
                        calling it a disease and a problem 
                        but some people wish they were you, 
                        you know that?

           Anita begins to get up, standing over top of her sister.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t hate you anymore, Berta.

           Anita picks up Berta’s hand and kisses it and makes her way 
           to the door. Just then Berta jumps awake, startling Anita.

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 BERTA
                            (groggily)
                        Did you need something?

           Anita, taken aback. 

                                 ANITA
                        Umm yes I--

           Anita looks around the room and then back to Berta. She walks 
           over to the hallway window to see the Nurse not at the desk.

                                 BERTA
                        Well?

           Anita checks the hallway, nervously. She smiles.

                                 ANITA
                        I’m here to get you.

                                 BERTA
                        Get me for what?

                                 ANITA
                        For your... observation. 
                                 BERTA
                            (looking Anita up and 
                             down)
                        You a doctor?

                                 ANITA
                        I don’t look like one?

                                 BERTA
                        You ain’t dressed like one.

                                 ANITA
                        Yeah well, I’m on break. Now it’s 
                        over and we gotta move you.

           Anita rushes Berta out of the bed.

                                 BERTA
                        I’m coming. I’m coming.

           Berta begins walking towards the door until..

                                 ANITA
                        No no no. Sit your ass down in that 
                        wheelchair.

                                 BERTA
                        I ain’t crippled!

                                 ANITA
                        Sit! I’ll push you.

           Berta reluctantly does so. Anita is just about to push her 
           until Berta reaches back trying to grab her purse.

                                 BERTA
                        Wait, I need my bag.

           Berta accidentally knocks it off the table behind her. All of 
           her contents fall out.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Dammit.

                                 ANITA
                        It’s fine. I got it.

           Anita picks up all of Berta’s things. 

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Nah see! Always causing a mess.
                                 BERTA
                            (confused)
                        What are you talking about?

           Anita notices Berta’s memory loss.

                                 ANITA
                        Never mind.

           Anita puts things back into the purse until, under tissues 
           and loose pieces of paper she finds the bracelet from their 
           childhood. Anita is stunned. 

           She holds it in her hand, tears swelling in her eyes. She 
           picks it up and shows it Berta.

                                 BERTA
                        Give me that back! I know you ain’t 
                        trying to steal my valuables.

                                 ANITA
                            (choked)
                        It’s nice.

                                 BERTA
                        It ain’t mine. It’s my sister’s. 

                                 ANITA
                        Oh okay... You want it or do you 
                        want me to put it back in your bag?

                                 BERTA
                        In the bag is fine.

           Behind Berta, Anita pretends to put in back in the bag but 
           she places it on her wrist and covers it with her sleeve.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Are we ready now?

           Anita smiles at Berta. She pushes her out of the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Anita looks around. The Nurse from before is nowhere in 
           sight. Anita hurriedly pushes Berta towards the exit.

                                 BERTA
                            (loudly)
                        You can go a bit a slower.

                                 ANITA
                        You can shut up.
                                 BERTA
                        Excuse me?! What kind of doctor--

                                 ANITA
                            (sharply)
                        Sh!

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Anita pushes Berta into one of the crowded waiting rooms. She 
           looks nervous. PEOPLE swarm. DOCTORS and NURSES are around. 

           They slip right past anyone. No one notices or cares.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Anita picks up the pace. They head toward the exit. Berta is 
           confused. 

                                 BERTA
                        This don’t look like the 
                        observation room.

                                 ANITA
                        I don’t look like a doctor.

           The NURSE from before notices.

                                 NURSE
                        Excuse me. Where are you two going.

           Anita continues to walk.

                                 BERTA
                        Umm hello! She’s talking to us.

                                 ANITA
                        No she’s not, keep quiet.

           Anita pushes Berta likes she heard nothing. They exit the 
           building through the automatic doors.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

           Anita pulls keys out of her pocket and unlocks the car door 
           as she walks. Berta looks around, confused.

                                 BERTA
                        What the hell are you doing!
                                 ANITA
                        I’m taking you home.

                                 BERTA
                        Home?!

                                 ANITA
                        That’s what I said, right.

           They approach the car. Anita wheels Berta over to the 
           passenger side. 

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Get in.

                                 BERTA
                        I ain’t getting in no random lady’s 
                        car, are you crazy?

           Anita sees The Nurse at the hospital doors, on the phone, 
           with a concerned look on her face. She stares at Anita and 
           Berta.

                                 ANITA
                        Look Berta. It’s me. Anita.

                                 BERTA
                        What?!

                                 ANITA
                        Me! Anita. Your sister, dammit! We 
                        don’t have time for this get in.

                                 BERTA
                        No you ain’t!

                                 ANITA
                        Look at me! Yes I am! Now get in 
                        the car. We’ll play the alphabet 
                        game. We’ll do our dance. Whatever, 
                        it is, just get in the car.

           Berta looks Anita up and down. She takes notice to the 
           butterflies all over. She sees the bracelet on Anita’s wrist.

                                 BERTA
                        Hey that’s my bracelet.

                                 ANITA
                        You mean my bracelet! I will 
                        explain everything once you get in.
           Berta hesitantly does so. Anita picks up the wheel chair, 
           folds it, and put it in the backseat. Just then, she sees the 
           Alzheimer’s Ward Nurse exiting the doors, scanning the lot.

           Anita quickly hops in the drivers seat. Berta looks at her 
           confused. Anita starts the car and reverses out of the spot.

           The Nurse catches sight of the car backing out and begins to 
           run up to the car. She bangs on the window.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m going to call the police!

           Anita shifts the car into drive, looks at the nurse, and 
           flips her off, peeling out of the lot.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anita drives down the street. 

                                 BERTA
                            (shouting)
                        Could you explain what the hell is 
                        going on!

                                 ANITA
                        Oh would you stop yelling!

                                 BERTA
                        You just kidnapped me, dammit!

                                 ANITA
                        Oh you’re so dramatic. Always have 
                        been, always will be.

                                 BERTA
                        You don’t know me!

           Anita rolls her eyes.

           Berta rummages through her purse. She pulls out her phone.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        I’m calling the police.

           She dials. Anita looks over, and snatches the phone from 
           Berta. Anita rolls down the window and tosses the phone out.

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck!

                                 ANITA
                        Trust me. It don’t work anyway!
           Berta looks down and sees the Vodka in the middle console.

                                 BERTA
                        Are you drunk?!

           Anita looks over at Berta’s face and hysterically LAUGHS. 
           Just then, Anita picks up the vodka and tosses out the window 
           as well. Berta looks over in disbelief. 

           Berta scans Anita once more, the butterfly attire, the 
           bracelet, and her face. She holds on her face, a face that 
           looks just like her own. 

                                 BERTA (CONT’D)
                        Well damn... throwing my phone out 
                        the window like that. You may just 
                        be Anita after all. That bitch.

           Anita looks over at Berta again and SCREAMS of LAUGHTER even 
           harder. Berta chuckles a bit.

           The car speeds off into the distance. 

                                    THE END
