           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           A BONA FIDE SQUARE-JAWED ACTION STAR -- Cool haircut. Cooler 
           sunglasses. Leather jacket. -- runs down a city street with a 
           sly smirk and a briefcase stuffed with money.

                                 GUY (V.O.)
                        Everybody thinks they’re the main 
                        character in their own life story.

           He slides across the hood into a MUSCLE CAR and speeds off.

                                 GUY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But someone’s gotta be the bad guy, 
                        the overbearing mother, the love 
                        interest.

           A COP chases after him, a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN swoons.

                                 GUY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        All I’m saying is that maybe some 
                        of us are the supporting characters 
                        in someone else’s cooler, funnier, 
                        action-packed adventure.

           We RACK FOCUS behind the swooning woman to settle on --

           -- A RANDOM BYSTANDER walking through the background.  This 
           is GUY (30’s).  Well-kept.  Blue button-up shirt.  Clean cut.  
           Just an average, nothing spectacular kind of guy.

                                 GUY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I sure feel that way.  I 
                        mean, otherwise my life would make 
                        for one boring story.

           EXT. FREE CITY - DAY

           A Northern metropolis hums with life -- a small cluster of 
           skyscrapers, old and new, surrounded by urban sprawl.  
           Bridges extend over rivers that stream out to a busy harbor.  
           Highways are jammed with rush hour traffic.

           There’s a big city park with a small zoo and a sizable lake.  
           A theater district with a flashy city square.  Elevated 
           trains and subway stations.  Doormen stand outside million 
           dollar condos and bodegas sell lottery scratchers.

           INT. GUY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           An ALARM CLOCK goes off.  Guy wakes up.  Goes through his 
           well-worn routine.  Showers.  Brushes his teeth.  
           Makes a muscle in the mirror - tries to make it look bigger.  
           Stares at the two suits and three blue oxfords in his closet.

                                 GUY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Every day I do this shit.

           INT. GUY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Guy exercises along with A CHEESY WORKOUT WEB VIDEO on his 
           laptop to a DUMB POP SONG.  Going through the motions.

                                 FITNESS INSTRUCTOR
                        Left, right, left, right, up, up, 
                        down, down, punch, punch, kick!

           INT. GUY’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Guy eats a bowl of cereal.  Plays a dumb game on his phone.

                                 GUY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I was given the gift of life and 
                        this is how I spend it.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Guy stands in line for coffee.  The BARISTA is ready for him.

                                 BARISTA
                        Medium coffee.  Cream.  Two sugars.

           Guy smiles, trying to mask the shame of predictability.

                                 GUY (V.O.)
                        Pathetic.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Guy window shops.  Admires a RED SPORTS CAR in a showroom.  
           Gawks at COOL SNEAKERS on sale for “$200” at “SOONAMI SHOES.”

                                 GUY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I have dreams...

           EXT. ATM MACHINE - DAY

           Guy checks the ATM Machine.  His balance is “$197.03”.

                                 GUY (V.O.)
                        But I can’t achieve them.
           EXT. CITY STREET, FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY

           Guy walks to work in a CROWD OF COMMUTERS with his best 
           friend, BUDDY -- sweet, oafy and nervous.  Always distracted.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        You ever feel like we’re just going 
                        through the motions?  Never 
                        deviating out of our comfort zones.  
                        Never making decisions that can 
                        actually enrich our lives.

           Buddy thinks about it.

                                 BUDDY
                        Mmm.  Nope.

           They watch a STREET KID breakdancing on the sidewalk for 
           tips.  A GIRL RIDES BY on a cool skateboard.

                                 GUY
                        Maybe we should take up a new 
                        hobby.  Rock climbing!

                                 BUDDY
                        No.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, that’s dumb.  We can try 
                        cooking classes.  It’d be a good 
                        way to meet girls.

                                 BUDDY
                        Yeah.  No.

           BLAM-BLAM!  GUN SHOTS.  They whip around to see a THIEF tear 
           out of a CONVENIENCE STORE.

                                 GUY
                        We should probably do something.

           The criminal pulls AN OLD LADY out of her car and drives off.  
           Throws a 40oz out the window.  It explodes at Guy’s feet.

                                 BUDDY
                        Don’t get involved.

                                 GUY
                        This whole city is going down the 
                        tubes.  Seems like every day we see 
                        another flagrant crime go down in 
                        broad daylight.

           He looks up at an “FCPD” CHOPPER backlit by the SUN.
                                 BUDDY
                        Yeah, well there’s nothing we can 
                        do about it.  The cops are in the 
                        pockets of the criminals.

                                 GUY
                        Says who?

           Buddy points to the newspaper headline on the STAND: “POLICE 
           IN POCKET OF CRIMINALS.”

                                 BUDDY
                        Don’t make waves, Guy.  You know, I 
                        heard of this guy -- not you Guy -- 
                        but a guy who tried to stop a crime 
                        once.  Tried to be a hero...

           Guy waits for the punchline.

                                 GUY
                        And...

           LONG PAUSE.  Buddy clearly has no details beyond that.

                                 BUDDY
                        Let’s just say he regretted it.

           Guy concedes and follows Buddy into work.

           INT. FREE CITY BANK - DAY

           Guy works as a bank teller.  Cranks through the routine of 
           stamping the deposit slip.

           He helps a slick DOUCHEBAG make a transaction.  A BEAUTY 
           hanging on his shoulder.  Guy sees on his receipt that the 
           Douche has hundreds of thousands of dollars in his account.

                                 BEAUTY
                             (to Douchebag)
                        You are sooo hot.

           She bites his ear, playful.  Guy watches, jealous.

                                 DOUCHEBAG
                             (obnoxious, to Guy)
                        Hello...

                                 GUY
                        Sorry.  Have a great day.

           Guy passes him a WAD OF CASH and receipt through the window.  
           Buddy works at the next station over.
                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        We’re good people.  We play by the 
                        rules.  Pay our taxes.  But it 
                        doesn’t make a difference.

           Buddy looks at his friend, annoyed.

                                 BUDDY
                        You think too much.  That guy I was 
                        telling you about...  He thought 
                        too much too.  And look where it 
                        got him.

                                 GUY
                        Where?

                                 BUDDY
                             (beat)
                        You don’t wanna know.

                                 GUY
                        Actually, I would like to --

           BLAM! BLAM!

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Everybody down on the ground!

           A BANK ROBBER wearing COOL SUNGLASSES and a leather jacket 
           fires a shotgun into the ceiling.  The OLD SECURITY GUARD 
           lays down like a submissive puppy.

                                 GUY
                        Here we go again.

           Guy and Buddy SIGH, roll their eyes, and get down on the 
           ground.

           BEHIND THE COUNTER

           The Robber leads the MANAGER around with a shotgun in her 
           back as he empties the cash drawers.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Don’t anybody try to be a hero.  
                        The bank’s insured so sit tight and 
                        this will all be over soon.

           Guy and Buddy lay on the ground.

                                 BUDDY
                             (calm, to Guy)
                        You playing softball tonight?
                                 GUY
                        Of course I’m playing.  It’s the 
                        only thing that gives me any joy in 
                        life.

                                 BUDDY
                        Drinks at Timmy’s afterwards?

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, dude.  Unless we’re not gonna 
                        do what we do after every single 
                        game for the first time ever.

           The Robber steps on Buddy’s head and clears out his drawer.

                                 BUDDY
                             (to Guy with mushed cheek)
                        You don’t have to be sharcastic.  I 
                        was jusht ashking.

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, PARK - DUSK

           CRACK!  Buddy hits a grounder.  Gets to first.  They’re 
           playing in a local softball league with a bunch of out-of-
           shape, NORMAL DUDES.

                                 GUY
                        That’s it, Buddy!  Atta boy!

           Guy is up to bat.  He’s playing for the “SOONAMI CORP BLUES”.  
           Looks at the score.  Top of the ninth.  Two outs.  The Blues 
           are down a point to The Reds.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        C’mon Guy!  We actually have a 
                        chance to win here.

                                 PITCHER
                        Is that really your name?  Guy?  I 
                        mean, why didn’t your mother just 
                        name you ‘Person’.  Or ‘You’.

           WHIFF!  Strike one.  Guy tries to loosen up.

                                 BUDDY
                             (matter of fact)
                        I have a friend named Hugh.

           While Guy psyches himself up, he notices:

           A MYSTERIOUS GIRL WATCHING HIM.
           She wears a tank top with a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL graphic. Leather 
           pants.  Badass boots.  Sunglasses.  Stands out in a crowd.

           He’s transfixed. Seems like she’s looking right at him and --

           -- STRIKE TWO!  Guy collects himself, embarrassed.  This is 
           it.  His team watches on from the dugout, nervous.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        C’mon, Guy!  This is it, buddy.

                                 BUDDY
                        Huh?

                                 TEAMMATE
                        Not you, Buddy.  Guy.

           The pitcher throws a fast ball.

           CRACK!  Guy blasts it out over center field.  Home run!  Guy 
           can’t believe it.  Starts to run the bases.

           MOLOTOV GIRL seems impressed.  Guy pumps his fist.

                                 GUY
                        Yes.

           WHONK!  The ball hits a flagpole and bounces back into the 
           OUTFIELDER’s glove.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be kidding me.

           The team can’t believe it. A crushing defeat.  He looks and -- 

           -- Molotov Girl is gone.

           INT. TIMMY’S BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

           Guy sits at the bar with the team, nursing their wounds.

           He eyes the BEAUTY from the bank in a booth.  Her DOUCHEBAG 
           BOYFRIEND parks his EXPENSIVE SPORTS CAR outside and sits 
           down next to her.  Buys everyone drinks.

                                 BEAUTY
                             (to Douchebag)
                        You are sooo hot.

           Guy sighs.  He’ll never get a girl like that.  Frustrated.
                                 GUY
                             (to Buddy)
                        How long we been playing softball?

                                 BUDDY
                        Couldn’t say.  Long time.

                                 GUY
                        Every year we’re the worst team in 
                        the league.  We never win.

                                 BUDDY
                        Winning isn’t everything.

                                 GUY
                        I’m not saying we don’t have a 
                        winning record.  We like, never 
                        ever, not even once have ever won 
                        one single game.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        You’re such a downer, Guy.

                                 GUY
                        I don’t want to be a downer!  I 
                        just want to win.  I mean, that’s 
                        kind of the entire point of playing 
                        a sport, right --

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        Freedom is just an illusion!

           A CRAZED HOMELESS MAN walks into the bar.  Everyone rolls 
           their eyes -- this happens all the time.  We’ll call him MAC.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Me, you, everyone you love.  We’re 
                        not free.  We’re just puppets on a 
                        stage.  Doing whatever they want us 
                        to do.  Everything you see.  
                        Everything you do.  This reality -- 
                        it’s all one big game to them and 
                        the game is fixed.

           The Bartender yells at him from behind the bar.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey, Mac!  Go speak your truth 
                        somewhere else.

                                 MAC
                        You’re just a sheep!  One of the 
                        sleepwalkers drifting through the 
                        maze while they call the shots.
           Guy finds a dollar in his pocket for Mac.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Don’t.  It’ll only encourage him.

                                 GUY
                        He’s got something to say.  I can 
                        respect that.

           EXT. TIMMY’S BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

           Guy walks Mac out of the bar and gives him the money.

                                 GUY
                        Here you go, Mac.

           When Guy notices:

           MOLOTOV GIRL --

           -- walking down the other side of the street.  Guy thinks 
           about it for a second.  Looks back at his friends having 
           drinks.  Tries to build the nerve.  What’s he gonna do?

           She’s just about to disappear down A SUBWAY STATION and Guy 
           thinks better of it.  Turns back to the bar.

           But Mac has seen the whole thing.  Stares at Guy through a 
           pair of BROKEN SUNGLASSES, as if casting a spell.

                                 MAC
                        Don’t be a sleepwalker.

           And with that, MAC SHOVES GUY into the street.

           HONNNNNK!  A truck slams on the brakes to avoid hitting him.

                                 GUY
                        Ahh!

           Guy scurries to the other side of the street just missing the 
           truck and tumbles backwards DOWN THE SUBWAY STAIRS.

           Buddy comes to the door, looking for him.  Mac slips away.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy?

           BASH!  ANOTHER CAR slams into the back of the stopped truck.

           The motorcycle behind it veers to avoid the accident and 
           SMACKS into a POWER CONVERTER which SPARKS WITH ELECTRICITY.
           ALL POWER on the block shuts down.  The patrons of Timmy’s 
           sit in the darkness, puzzled.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           Guy rubs his head, woozy, and realizes he’s on the wrong side 
           of the turnstile.  He could just hop it, but Guy looks up at 
           THE SECURITY CAMERAS and thinks better of it.

           The EXIT is all the way on the other side of the station.

                                 GUY
                        C’mon.

           He heads for the exit when he walks past MOLOTOV GIRL, 
           waiting for a TRAIN pulling into the station.  Guy struggles 
           to build the nerve to talk to her.  Slows to a stop.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Um.  Excuse me.

           The DOOR WARNING CHIMES and Molotov hops on the SUBWAY CAR.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Um, excuse me!  I --

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        The doors are closing.

           Guy makes a quick decision.  Runs through the closing doors 
           only to realize:

           THE INSIDE OF THE TRAIN CAR IS A VOID.  Total nothingness.

                                 GUY
                        What the --

           Guy shirks back and THE DOORS SHUT ON HIM.  Now he’s trapped 
           half in, half out of the train.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Help!  Stop the train!

           He pounds on the side of the door as the train pulls out of 
           the station.  Looking into the train through the outside 
           window, it seems normal inside.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no, no!

           He uses all of his strength to push the door open when --

           -- HIS HAND PASSES THROUGH THE METAL.
           Like it’s fused into the door.  Now the DOOR AND HIS ARM 
           VIBRATE AND TWITCH, almost like they’re GLITCHING OUT.

           And the side of his body hanging out of the train is heading 
           STRAIGHT FOR A COLUMN.  He’ll be crushed in seconds.

           He pushes as hard as he can and at the last second --

           -- TUMBLES OUT OF THE TRAIN.

           Rolls across the platform and slams against the column that 
           almost killed him.

           His arm TWITCHES and VIBRATES with electricity for a second 
           until everything goes back to normal.  Everything is quiet.

           Guy lies there and catches his breath, rattled but relieved.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        That went well.

           INT. GUY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Guy wakes up.  Morning routine.  But can’t shake last night’s 
           events out of his mind.  He examines a BUMP ON HIS HEAD from 
           falling down the subway stairs.

           INT. GUY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Guy does exercises in front of the computer.

                                 FITNESS INSTRUCTOR
                        Left, right, left, right, up, up, 
                        down, down, punch, punch, kick!

           INT. GUY’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Eats breakfast.  Stares at the cereal floating in his spoon.  
           Pokes at one as if something would happen.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Gets his coffee.  They have his order waiting for him.

                                 BARISTA
                        Medium coffee.  Cream.  Two sugars.

                                 GUY
                        Actually -- I think I’m gonna 
                        switch it up this morning.
           The Barista freezes as if this were the craziest thing that’s 
           ever been suggested.

                                 BARISTA
                        But I already made you a medium 
                        coffee, cream, two sugars.

           Guy feels bad.

                                 GUY
                        Okay.  It’s fine.

           She’s relieved.  He pays and takes his coffee.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Guy walks to work with Buddy.

                                 GUY
                        Let’s take Waterfront today.

                                 BUDDY
                        That bump on our head is affecting 
                        your judgement.  Fourth is faster.

                                 GUY
                        I don’t know.  Humor me.

                                 BUDDY
                        C’mon.  I don’t wanna be late.

           Buddy charges ahead.  Guy relents.

           INT. FREE CITY BANK - DAY

           Guy is at his station, a little distracted.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Everybody down on the ground!

           And just like last time, everyone just lays down.

                                 GUY
                        This jerk again.

                                 BUDDY
                        Forget about it.  Don’t make waves.

                                 GUY
                        This is insanity.  What bank do you 
                        know gets robbed every single day?
                                 BUDDY
                        Don’t be a hero.  Remember what 
                        happened to that guy.

                                 GUY
                        No, Buddy!  I don’t remember what 
                        happened to that guy actually.

                                 BUDDY
                        The bank’s insured.  What do you 
                        care?

                                 GUY
                        I don’t know.  It’s the principal 
                        of the thing!

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        What did you just say?

           The Bank Robber brushes past Guy right to Buddy.  Buddy looks 
           at the ground, shaking like a leaf.

                                 BUDDY
                        Nothing.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        It didn’t sound like nothing.

                                 BUDDY
                        Please don’t hurt me.

                                 GUY
                        C’mon.  He didn’t say anyth--

                                 BANK ROBBER
                             (to Buddy)
                        Oh.  You don’t want me to hurt you.

           THUMP!  The Bank Robber knocks Buddy off his chair and starts 
           beating him up.  Guy runs to his aid.

                                 GUY
                        Hey!  Just take your money and 
                        leave.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Looks like we’ve got ourselves a 
                        hero here.

           The Robber points the shotgun.  Guy holds up A BAG OF MONEY.

                                 GUY
                        C’mon, man.  Just take it.
           POLICE SIRENS sound outside.

           The Robber thinks better of it and grabs the bag.  Kicks an 
           already limp Buddy hard in the stomach and leaves.

           Buddy doesn’t get up.  He’s hurt.  Guy tends to his friend.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Buddy.  Buddy?
                             (to everyone else)
                        Don’t just stand there.  Somebody 
                        do something!

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Buddy is wheeled into the emergency room on a gurney.

                                 GUY
                        Hang in there, Buddy.
                             (to the NURSE)
                        He’s gonna be okay, right?

           They roll him into an emergency room and Guy is left behind.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Guy paces in front of the hospital, really worried.

           Looks around at everyone - just going about their routines.  
           Angry that his friend is hurt and they don’t even care.

           And that’s when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees --

           -- THE BANK ROBBER.  Walking down the street.  Guy blanches 
           like he’s just seen a ghost.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.

           He’s in shock.  Looks around for help.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           The Bank Robber doesn’t notice.  Guy fills with resolve.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, okay.  Here we go.
           EXT. CITY PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The Bank Robber shoulders a PEDESTRIAN and sends her running.  
           Pump fakes AN OLD MAN.  This is a bad dude.

           Guy cuts him off at the pass.  Puts a hand up.

                                 GUY
                        I --  I’m making a citizen’s 
                        arrest.  You’re gonna come with m--

           BLAP!  The Robber pops him in the face with a quick jab.  Guy 
           drops like a sack of potatoes and The Robber takes off.

           Guy shakes off the punch, woozy, and gets to his feet.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Stop him!  Stop thief!

           Nobody listens.  Guy takes off after him.  People look at him 
           like he’s got twelve heads.

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 PEDESTRIAN #2
                        Just let him go.

                                 PEDESTRIAN #3
                        Don’t be a hero!

           Guy’s too slow.  He’s breathing heavy.  He watches as The 
           Robber jumps down some stairs to a lower walkway.

           This is Guy’s chance.  If he wants to get ballsy.

                                 GUY
                        This is for Buddy!

           Guy veers off the trail, through the park and LEAPS OFF A 
           TWENTY FOOT WALL.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh!

           Landing on the robber but hitting the ground awkward.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Ow.

           THE ROBBER’S COOL SUNGLASSES FLY OFF.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Hey!  You can’t do that!
           The Robber is disoriented.  Guy grabs him by the collar.

                                 GUY
                        You hurt my friend. And now you’re--

           THWAP!  The robber cracks Guy across the jaw.  WHACK!  WHACK!  
           THUD!  He thumps him with a few sloppy punches and runs off, 
           disoriented and confused.

           Everything happens quickly, but to us it almost looks like 
           The Robber disappears behind the trees.  Guy yells after him.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        And let that be a lesson to you!

           He rights himself.  His eye is raw and banged up.  Cut upper 
           lip.  But he notices:

           THE ROBBER’S SUNGLASSES.

           Guy picks them up.  Gets his bearings.  The Robber is gone.  
           PEDESTRIANS walk past as if nothing happened.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                             (to pedestrians)
                        Thanks.  Really.  Thanks for all 
                        your help.

           INT. BUS - DAY

           Guy rides the bus home.  Nurses his wounds.  The other 
           PASSENGERS don’t seem to care.

           Guy fidgets with the sunglasses.  Sun cuts through the window 
           and shines in his eyes.  Without giving it too much thought 
           he puts the sunglasses on and:

           FROM GUY’S POV:

           HE CAN SEE FULL LED READOUTS ON THE LENSES.

           UPPER LEFT CORNER:  Has a “HEALTH STATUS” bar that’s 
           dwindling in the mid-yellow range.

           UPPER RIGHT CORNER:  Has a picture of a FIST.  $197.03 in 
           cash with a green status bar next to it.  And a timer.

           LOWER RIGHT CORNER has a GPS MAP of the ten block radius 
           around his location.

           OBJECTIVE POV:

           Guy reacts.  Rips off the glasses, shocked.
                                 GUY
                        The hell?

           He looks around to see if anyone noticed.  Pockets the 
           glasses.  Feels guilty for some reason.  Nobody cares.

           Settles into the idea and takes the sunglasses back out.  
           From all appearances, they just look like normal sunglasses.

           He puts them back on and looks around.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Whoa.

           Besides the readouts, there’s nothing exceptional about them 
           until he glances DOWN THE AISLE and notices:

           A FIRST AID KIT --

           -- floating two feet off the ground at the back of the bus.  
           Slowly spinning.  A small spotlight on it.

           Guy reacts.  Looks around.  Is this some kind of joke?  What 
           should he do?

           He casually stands up and makes his way towards the kit.  
           Looks at a BUSINESSMAN sitting next to it, oblivious.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Do you see this?

           Guy points to what looks like nothing.  The Businessman looks 
           at him like he’s crazy and Guy smiles it off, embarrassed.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.  Me neither.

           Guy takes off the sunglasses and the kit isn’t there.  Puts 
           them back on and there it is, clear as day.

           He takes a breath and builds some nerve.  Reaches out and 
           touches the first aid kit and --

           -- BRRRRRRRUP!  The kit disappears and a glowing light floats 
           up his body.  He jumps back, trying to brush it off until 
           it’s gone.  What just happened?

           He looks at his reflection in the window and watches as --

           -- HIS WOUNDS DISAPPEAR.  His eye, his lip.  All healed.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Holy crap.
           EXT. BUS STOP - CONTINUOUS

           DING!  The bus stops and Guy runs off, freaking out.

                                 GUY
                        Calm down, Guy.  Just keep it 
                        together.

           He thinks about it and puts the sunglasses back on.  It looks 
           like just a normal day except for:

           A WAD OF CRISP $100 BILLS --

           -- floating two feet off the ground by the newsstand.  A 
           little spotlight makes it stand out.

           A PEDESTRIAN passes right through it, buys some gum and 
           leaves, without noticing the money.

           Guy rubs his mouth.  Approaches the stack of money.  Looks at 
           it, just floating there.

                                 NEWSSSTAND MAN
                        Can I help you, sir?

                                 GUY
                        Mmmm.  No.  Just looking.

           Guy reaches out and touches the stack of money and --

           -- BRRRRRUP!  The MONEY STATUS BAR on his glasses jumps by 
           TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS.  Guy rips the glasses off.  Can’t 
           believe it.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        No.  That --  This is just not --  
                        It can’t be --  These are just --

           EXT. ATM MACHINE - DAY

           Guy punches his code into the ATM and checks his balance.  
           Sure enough --  he has TWO THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS in his 
           account than he did a few minutes ago.

           He puts a fist to his mouth.  This can’t be real.

           Reaches out, hits the ‘withdrawal’ button and --

           -- CH-CH-CH-CH!  The machine spits out hundreds of dollars.  
           He stuffs his pockets, guilty, and gets out of there fast.

           RUNS DOWN THE STREET and sees:
           ”SOONAMI SHOES” from earlier.  The pair of sneakers he was 
           admiring are still in the window.  Guy raises an eyebrow.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A modern loft-like office space with a different color palate 
           then anything we’ve seen so far.  Clearly a tech company of 
           some sort.  ”SOONAMI CORP”.

           Dozens of cubicles are filled with busy PROGRAMMERS.  Some 
           work on monitors, some use VR headsets.  The bulk of them are 
           Millennials and dressed casually.

           INT. PROGRAMMER’S DESK - DAY

           A twenty-something programmer, PUNIT, sits in front of a 
           computer, on his phone.  Reclining.

                                 PUNIT
                             (on the phone)
                        C’mon, let’s get a date on the 
                        books already.  I’ll come to you.  
                        I’ll cook you dinner.  I’ll upgrade 
                        your home system.  I’ve got this 
                        playlist I’ve been working on --

           BEEP!  Something on his monitor requires his attention.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  I gotta deal with something 
                        here.  But think about it.

           He hangs up and opens:

           “USER COMPLAINT #4521.”  He clicks on it and reads the 
           complaint.  Routine.  Clicks to another screen and we see:

           FREE CITY.  Surveillance video of the whole city.

           He scans the view from different angles.  Can’t seem to find 
           anything wrong until -- something catches his attention.

           THE SHOE STORE.  Punit zooms in and reacts, surprised.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        Hey, dude.  Come look at this.

           A pudgy, disheveled programmer sitting next to him rolls his 
           chair over.  This is GARETH.  He glances at Punit’s monitor.
                                 GARETH
                        What am I looking at?

                                 PUNIT
                        Blue Shirt Guy.

           He points and they watch as a REALISTIC ANIMATED VERSION OF 
           GUY is buying the pair of sneakers he likes.  Gareth reacts.

                                 GARETH
                        Let’s see the coding.

           Punit hits a button that turns the feed of Guy shoe shopping 
           into PROGRAMMING CODE.  Hits it again to switch it back.

                                 GARETH (CONT’D)
                        Huh.

                                 PUNIT
                        You ever see something like this 
                        before?

                                 GARETH
                        Noop.

           Gareth takes a closer look.  Reacts.

                                 GARETH (CONT’D)
                        He’s got our sunglasses on.

           Punit checks it out and confirms.  Whoa.  The guys are 
           shocked by this revelation.

                                 PUNIT
                        That’s weird.  What do we do?

                                 GARETH
                        We get ‘em back.

           CLOSE ON:

           THE NEW SNEAKERS, walking down the street.  A little CODE 
           SYMBOL “</>” is on the back label.  PAN UP to see:

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Guy strutting around town in a new outfit.  Sunglasses on.  
           He’s got a few shopping bags under his arms and a big smile.  
           Looks around like the cat who ate the canary.

           But he doesn’t notice:
           A POLICE CAR --

           -- stalking him from behind.  He finally gets the sense that 
           something’s wrong and turns around.

           FROM GUY’S POV:  A SHERIFF’S BADGE ICON starts blinking in 
           the upper right corner.

           OBJECTIVE POV:  Guy notices.  Uh-oh. Picks up the pace and --

           -- WHOOP-WHOOP!  Lights and sirens.  TWO BADGE ICONS in his 
           glasses.  Crap!

           Guy slows to a stop.  Turns around with his hands up.

                                 GUY
                        It’s okay.  I don’t want any troub--

           SCREECH!  THE POLICE CAR GUNS FOR HIM.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        --ble.

           It’s headed straight for him.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  Wait.  I surrender!

           At the last second, Guy jumps out of the way and --

           -- SMASH!  The cop car takes down a light pole.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell?

           Guy takes off down the street.

           ANOTHER COP CAR cuts him off at the pass.  Tries to mow him 
           down with more intent than the first one.  Hops up on the 
           sidewalk.  Takes out trash cans and a mailbox.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Please!  I can explain!  I think.

           As it closes in, Guy ducks into an empty construction site 
           and the cop car SCREECHES to a halt.  Reverses.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Guy runs deep into the construction site and hides.  The cops 
           get out of their car and look around.  Take out their guns.
                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Come out, come out wherever you 
                        are.  We won’t hurt you.

           The cop sounds exactly like Punit, though he looks nothing 
           like him.  And the other cop sounds like Gareth.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Much.

           The cops LAUGH.

           IN THE SKELETON OF A BUILDING

           Guy curls up, trying to hide.

                                 GUY
                        Crap, crap, crap.

           The cops move in, looking for him.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        C’mon, Blue Shirt.  We know you’re 
                        around here somewhere.

           They narrow down his whereabouts.  Motion to each other.

                                 GARETH/COP
                             (into walkie)
                        Shut down quadrant Thirty-Seven ‘A’ 
                        Four.

           BACK WITH GUY

           Guy hears them say that and looks up at a number spray-
           painted on the building.  “37-A-4”.  Reacts and --

           -- THE WALL BEHIND HIM DISAPPEARS,

           Causing him to tumble backwards over a ledge.  He grabs an 
           exposed beam and realizes:

           A RECTANGULAR BLOCK OF REALITY --

           -- has been cleanly lifted from the fabric of the Universe.

           Part of the building behind him is completely missing, half-
           exposed pipes leading to nowhere.  A BULLDOZER parked besides 
           the building is perfectly cut in half, totally intact.  A 
           CLOUD above has A PERFECT CORNER removed.

           And Guy dangles over a PERFECTLY SQUARE SINK HOLE.
           Filled with adrenaline, he pulls himself back up onto solid 
           ground.  But he’s trapped.  Nowhere to run.

           Guy is freaking out, cornered behind a stack of wood.  The 
           cops move in. Guy can’t figure out what to do when he sees:

           A GLOCK.

           Floating two feet off the ground a few yards away from him.  
           Slowly spinning.  Small spotlight.  He can’t believe it.

           Guy reaches for the gun, amazed and CH-CHK!  It falls into 
           his hand.  Whoa.  His POV READOUT shows:

                                 GUY
                        Six bullets.

           The cops are closing in.  It’s now or never.

           Guy holds up the gun but can he really shoot a cop?  His hand 
           shakes like a leaf.  He can’t do it.  But he gets an idea.

           WITH THE COPS

           They have him cornered and move in for the kill.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        You’re just prolonging the 
                        inevitable.  We can fix everything.

           THUNK!  Something knocks a trash can and they whip around.  
           BAM! BA-BLAM! BLAM!  FIRE FULL ROUNDS INTO THE AREA.  The 
           cops move towards the trash can, kick it away and see --

           -- A PILE OF GARBAGE.  No sign of Guy anywhere.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Dude.  Look.

           He finds Guy’s gun, surprised.

                                 GARETH/COP (CONT’D)
                        He threw it.

           EXT. FAR SIDE OF TOWN - DAY

           Guy runs away from the site and down the street, knocking 
           into pedestrians.

                                 PEDESTRIANS
                        Hey! / Watch where you’re goin’! / 
                        Do you mind? / Move along people.
           Guy HEARS SIRENS in the distance when he notices:

           “THE MULTIPLAYER LOUNGE.”

           An internet cafe on the corner in an iconic building.   He 
           looks around, orienting himself, confused, and pulls down his 
           sunglasses seeing --

           -- The entire building isn’t actually there.

           He puts the glasses back on and it reappears again.

           The SIRENS get closer.  He takes a deep breath and heads 
           towards the door.

           INT. MULTIPLAYER LOUNGE - DAY

           Guy steps into a cafe JAM-PACKED WITH PEOPLE.  Only this is 
           not your typical coffee house crowd.

           CYBER PUNKS with crazy hair, HOT GIRLS with spiked jackets, 
           GANGBANGERS covered with tattoos.

           Everyone has their NAMES floating above their head.  Well, 
           not so much names as usernames.  “FLAILINGMAGE2342”, 
           “THEGODFATHER2pt0”, “VIXEN5232”.

           And that’s when he sees a familiar face:

           MOLOTOV GIRL.

           Leather pants, form-fitting attire.  Twirling a ninja star 
           between her fingers while she talks to A FEW CYBER-PUNKS.  
           Her username and level float above her head, 
           “MOLOTOVGIRL4482. Level 125.”  She seems disappointed.

                                 MOLOTOVGIRL4482
                        You mean, none of you have even 
                        gotten the MiG-35 out of the 
                        Russian’s hangar before?

                                 CATLOVER69
                        Like you have?

           Catlover69 is a jacked with a big afro the voice of a 
           prepubescent boy.  Zelig2693 shoves him.

                                 ZELIG2693
                        Dude, show some respect.  This is 
                        MolotovGirl.  Highest-ranked Free 
                        City gamer in the world.

           They fawn over her like a celebrity.
                                 DOUGIEPUGGIE808
                        Got any tips for us?  I’ve spent a 
                        hundred and forty bucks trying to 
                        find the Spyder Convertible.

                                 MOLOTOVGIRL4482
                        Sorry.  I’m looking for someone 
                        with a little more experience.

           MolotovGirl turns and bumps into Guy. No recollection of him.

                                 MOLOTOVGIRL4482 (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Watch where you’re going.

                                 GUY
                        Uh, excuse me.  But what is this 
                        place, exactly?

                                 MOLOTOVGIRL4482
                             (uh duh)
                        Um.  The Multiplayer Lounge.

                                 GUY
                        Multiplayer?

                                 MOLOTOVGIRL4482
                        Yeah, Free City Multiplayer.

           She tries to get past and he stops her.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, okay.  But -- like, what does 
                        that mean?  Multiplayer.  
                        Multiplayer of what?

           She GROANS, annoyed and pushes past him.  Guy stumbles into 
           one of the desktop computers.  He’s amazed by what he sees --

           -- it’s A MENU SCREEN FOR “FREE CITY.”

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Welcome to Free City.  The world’s 
                        most realistic cloud-based open 
                        world adventure game by Soonami.

           It’s got a Map of Free City.  Video of people engaged in 
           different types of criminal activities.  Guy goes wide-eyed.

                                 GUY
                        This can’t be -- this isn’t real.

           Guy shirks back and fumbles through the cafe, dizzy.
           EXT. MULTIPLAYER CAFE - DAY

           He walks outside, hyperventilating.  He looks up into the sky 
           and around the city.  It will never look the same to him 
           again.  His entire world is rocked.

           Mac, the homeless man, yells at people on the street.

                                 MAC
                        You’re living in a game!  This is 
                        all just a game!

           Guy starts to put it all together, floored and --

           -- WHAM!  A POLICE CAR mows him down.  Lights out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GUY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           The ALARM CLOCK goes off and Guy snaps out of bed as if from 
           a nightmare.

                                 GUY
                        Ah!

           He feels his body, frantic.  He’s in one piece.  Whew.  Runs 
           to the mirror.  He’s fine.  But remembers.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        The sunglasses!

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Guy jogs through the neighborhood the cops chased him through 
           yesterday.  Ends up at the same corner where the Multiplayer 
           Lounge should be but now:

           THE LOT IS EMPTY.  Exactly what it looked like with the 
           glasses off yesterday.

           Guy sees THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE in the background.

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

           Guy walks out of the city across the bridge, determined.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Guy makes a beeline away through brownstone suburbs.
           EXT. MARSHLAND - DAY

           He pushes through dense marshland but always comes out of the 
           weeds staring at the same view of the Free City skyline.

           EXT. WATERFRONT - DAY

           Guy jumps in a small motorboat. Drives it away from the city.  
           He moves past buoys and boats until he’s out in open water.

           Looks back at the skyline.  He realizes --

                                 GUY
                        It’s not getting further away.

           -- he’s inexplicably treadmilling in place.  A BUOY besides 
           him stays in place.  His boat isn’t caught on anything.

           He throws the engine in reverse and the boat glides again 
           back towards the city.

           EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

           Guy sits on a bench, watching the city with new eyes.  He 
           realizes that there are ONLY A DOZEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
           PEDESTRIANS walking around the area at any one point.

                                 GUY
                        Man in black business suit. Old 
                        lady in shawl. Chubby dude. Hipster 
                        mustache. Slob in a wife-beater.

           They all say ONE PHRASE to each other as Guy walks past.

                                 BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
                        Hey!

                                 OLD LADY
                        Watch where you’re going!

                                 CHUBBY DUDE
                        Do you mind?

                                 STREET COP
                        Move along, people.

           A GANGBANGER pushes past and they REPEAT THE SAME LINES.

           Guy clocks that The Gangbanger is wearing --

                                 GUY
                        Sunglasses.
           The same kind that he had.  The Gangbanger pulls A MAN out of 
           his car, screaming, and drives off, BLASTING THE RADIO.

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           Guy watches a robbery in progress.  A GUY IN A MASK is 
           holding up a convenience store. He’s wearing the same exact --

                                 GUY
                        Sunglasses.

           EXT. BUSY CITY STREET - DAY

           A JAPANESE SCHOOL GIRL steps out of a car with a MISSILE 
           LAUNCHER and BLOWS UP A FALAFEL STAND.  She too wears --

                                 GUY
                        Sunglasses!

           INT. TIMMY’S BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

           Guy runs into the bar and finds HIS SOFTBALL TEAM, drinking 
           after their game.  Everybody is in their same seats.  Even 
           Buddy, a little banged up, but fine.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy!  Where’ve you been?  You 
                        didn’t come to work.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        We had to forfeit the game.  
                        Incomplete roster.

                                 GUY
                        Buddy!  Are you alright?  You got 
                        beat up pretty bad yesterday.

                                 BUDDY
                        Oh.  It’s nothing.

                                 GUY
                        Buddy, it’s not nothing.  There’s 
                        something I need to tell you.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy, just give it a rest.

                                 GUY
                        No.  This is important.

           Guy climbs up on a stool.  Announces to the entire bar.
                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Listen.  Everyone.  I don’t know 
                        quite how to say this.  But -- This 
                        bar --  Everything in the --  Us --  
                        It’s all just a game.  We’re living 
                        in a real, actual --  I mean, I 
                        think a video game of some sort -- 
                        for another, dimension?  And we’re 
                        like --  We’re not the players.  
                        The people with the sunglasses are.  
                        We’re, like, the background people!

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy!  Knock it off.

                                 GUY
                        You were right, Buddy.  They don’t 
                        want us to rock the boat.  In fact, 
                        the whole reason we’re here is to 
                        be screwed with by the sunglasses 
                        people.  For their sick amusement --  
                        that’s so messed up -- but I’m 
                        gonna figure it out! I just need to 
                        talk to this girl. MolotovGirl! But 
                        I need to get the sunglasses first--

                                 BUDDY
                        You’re acting crazy.

                                 GUY
                        That’s just the thing.  For the 
                        first time in my life I feel 
                        completely sane.  I can see the 
                        world with perfect clarity.  I --

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        Freedom is just an illusion!

           Guy looks outside the window and Mac, the Homeless Man, walks 
           by, spitting craziness at anyone he passes.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Everything you see and know and 
                        speak is just pre-programmed 
                        gobbledy-gook!  Nothing you own is 
                        truly yours.

           Guy reacts.  Realizes how crazy he looks.  Everyone is 
           staring at him, confused and weirded out.

                                 GUY
                        Ha.  Just kidding everyone.

           Guy leaves the bar, embarrassed.  SMASH! (PRELAP)
           MONTAGE: GUY TRIES DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET THE GLASSES

           EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

           A DREADLOCKED WOMAN wearing SUNGLASSES throws a brick through 
           a Jewelry Store window.  An ALARM SOUNDS.  She grabs a 
           handful of diamond necklaces and startles to see:

           Guy, blocking her way.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.  Um.  I know this might sound 
                        weird, but I need to borrow your 
                        glasses for a --

           Guy reaches for her sunglasses and WHACK! WHAP! THWIP!  She 
           grabs his arm, flips him over and heels his Adam’s apple.

                                 DREADLOCK WOMAN
                             (speaking French)
                        Foutre fluage!

                                 GUY
                             (Donald Duck voiced)
                        Sorry.  My bad.

           EXT. CHINATOWN - LATER

           A different THUG WEARING SUNGLASSES walks through Free City’s 
           small Chinatown district.

           Guy tails him from behind, hood pulled over his head.  
           Follows him through the city until the thug turns down --

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           An empty turnout.  The thug stands in front of a garage door 
           and it opens.  Enters and it closes behind him.

           Guy watches, curious, when THE GARAGE DOOR OPENS and --

           -- A DIFFERENT THUG EXITS, wearing the same sunglasses.  He 
           pulls out in a Tesla and drives past Guy.

           Guy watches DOZENS OF PLAYERS leave the garage - ALL WEARING 
           THE SAME SUNGLASSES.  All driving different cars.

           Guy gets an idea.
           EXT. ALLEY - LATER

           The garage opens and a JACKED HIPSTER walks out wearing the 
           glasses.  He looks around, not noticing:

           UP ABOVE

           Guy is carefully lowering a makeshift hook.  He’s just about 
           to hook the glasses when the jacked hipster notices.  Pulls 
           out a GUN and OPENS FIRE.  Guy runs away.

                                 GUY
                        My bad!

           I/E. VARIOUS ATTEMPTS

           Guy charges players from behind, throwing things, tripping 
           them, timing it wrong, missing entirely.

                                 GUY
                        Sorry.  Sorry!  Sorry.

           He hits a player on the back of the head with a TWO-BY-FOUR.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry!

           TINK!  The glasses bounce across the pavement, unscathed.

           Guy can’t believe it.  While the player runs around, 
           disoriented, Guy puts them on and sure enough:

           THE READOUTS APPEAR.  Yes!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ACCOUNTING OFFICE - DAY

           A mousy secretary sits behind a desk.  Her hair covers half 
           her face.  Librarian glasses.  She clutches the top of her 
           blouse, protective.  Mid-twenties.  This is MILLIE.

                                 BOSS (O.S.)
                        Millie!  I need the Fentons’ W-2’s 
                        on my desk now!

           INT. OFFICE KITCHEN - DAY

           Millie tries to make copies and the machine craps out on her.  
           She opens a side door, frustrated and PLOOF!  A cloud of 
           black ink sprays all over her.
           EXT. MAGAZINE STAND - DAY

           Millie picks out A TECH MAGAZINE and pays for it.  The CLERK 
           leers at her and she clutches her blouse. Avoids eye contact.

                                 CREEPY CLERK
                        S’up girl?

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           HONK!  A terrible traffic jam.  Millie sits in her tiny 
           Honda.  She’s about to move forward when someone cuts her off 
           and gives her the finger.  She quietly takes it.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           Millie runs into a house and darts directly upstairs.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Millie!  I thought we were gonna 
                        talk when you got --

           INT. MILLIE’S ROOM - DAY

           SLAM!  Millie locks herself in her room and takes a DEEP 
           BREATH, finally safe.

           She takes out the Tech Magazine she bought earlier and leafs 
           through a profile on:

           “SOONAMI’S ILLUSIVE CEO, ANTWAN HOVACHELIK, HIS UNSTOPPABLE 
           GAMING EMPIRE AND THE LAUNCH OF THE LONG-AWAITED SEQUEL, FREE 
           CITY 2.” It features a skinny, young guy in his mid-twenties.

           She sticks a tack right into his forehead on:

           A CORKBOARD FILLED WITH CLIPPINGS ABOUT ANTWAN and FREE CITY.  
           We see words like: “CHEAT CODES” and “UNHACKABLE PLATFORM”.

           She sits down at her desk, sets up her takeout food, 
           ritualistically, and puts on A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET.

           INT. MULTIPLAYER LOUNGE - DAY

           Millie appears in the Multiplayer Lounge as MOLOTOVGIRL4482 --  
           the kickass avatar she uses in Free City.  A tall, confident 
           version of Millie with a few cosmetic enhancements.

           [Note: Millie and her avatar are played by the same actress, 
           so we’ll just call her Millie from now on.]
           She turns heads here.  She’s in her element.

                                 ANONAMOU$E
                        Hey...  MolotovGirl.

           She sits down at a corner table with ANONAMOU$E - a shady 
           dude who wears a trenchcoat and motorcycle face mask.  Talks 
           with a MODULATED VOICE.

                                 MILLIE
                        You got that thing for me?

                                 ANONAMOU$E
                        It’s in a briefcase on this 
                        shipping container.

           He slips a “SHIPPING MANIFEST” across the table.  She reaches 
           for it and he grabs her wrist.

                                 ANONAMOU$E (CONT’D)
                        This thing is strong enough to take 
                        down the whole game.  I’d like to 
                        know what it’s gonna be used for.

                                 MILLIE
                        I’ve got my reasons.

           She JAMS A KNIFE INTO HIS HAND and kicks the table over.  
           Tosses a wad of cash onto his lap as he tries to get unstuck.

                                 ANONAMOU$E
                        You know they’re about to release 
                        the sequel!  In a few days it’s all 
                        gonna be gone anyway.

                                 MILLIE
                        That’s why I don’t have any time to 
                        lose with a-holes like you.

           She gets up to leave when GUY RUNS INTO HER.

                                 GUY
                        Hey, there.  Not sure if you 
                        remember me from the other day but, 
                        I was wondering if I could bother 
                        you for a sec --

                                 MILLIE
                        Um, no.

           She walks away and he scurries after her.

                                 GUY
                        Ha.  No, but really --
           She looks at his username.  “GUY (NPC) Level 1”.

                                 MILLIE
                        Sorry, I don’t talk to newbs.  I’m 
                        not even sure how you got in here.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah.  Well, that’s kind of what I 
                        want to talk to you about --

           She’s already out the door.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Millie struts down the street.  Guy follows her.

                                 GUY
                        It’s just that you seem like 
                        someone who knows a thing or two 
                        about this place.

                                 MILLIE
                        I thought I told you to get lost, 
                        newb.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, but, um.  And a newb is...

           She spots an ARMORED TRUCK up ahead.

                                 MILLIE
                        Wow, you really are a newb.  You’re 
                        like a newby-newb, newb.

                                 GUY
                        So true.  So true.  But, really.

           She’s captivating and graceful as SHE PULLS THE PIN OFF A 
           GRENADE and tosses it underneath a parked car.

                                 MILLIE
                        I don’t associate with anyone under 
                        Level Fifty.

           KABOOM!  The parked car launches off the ground from the 
           explosion and everyone runs off, screaming.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        You gotta have a better wardrobe.  
                        Garage filled with ultra-rare 
                        vehicles.  And a full arsenal.
           Millie uses this moment as a distraction to jump into the 
           driver’s seat of the armored truck.

                                 GUY
                        Right.  Sure.  And I do that by...

           Annoyed, she leans in towards him, seductive.  He reacts as 
           she reaches into his front pocket and pulls out:

           A NOTEBOOK.  Tosses it at him and jump starts the truck.

                                 MILLIE
                        Your mission log.

           He thumbs through the book.

                                 GUY
                             (reading)
                        Steal a car. Fire a bazooka. But --  
                        I just need answers.  I don’t -- I 
                        don’t wanna hurt people.

           She looks at him like he’s nuts.

                                 MILLIE
                        That’s kind of the point of this 
                        whole place, newb.  It’s a license 
                        to do anything you want with no 
                        consequences.

                                 GUY
                        No consequences for you maybe.

                                 MILLIE
                        Well, you better get started on 
                        your criminal empire.  Free City’s 
                        not gonna be around much longer.

                                 GUY
                        Why?  Where’s it going --

           WHUNK!  She kicks him square in the chest and slams the door.

           Guy watches her drive away in the truck, uncorking a FIRE 
           HYDRANT in the process.  He’s amazed and intimidated.

           He picks up his mission log.  Knows what he has to do.

           INT. DOLLAR STORE - DAY

           A few CUSTOMERS wait to buy things from the CASHIER.
           Guy mills about behind a shelf, pretending to pick out an 
           item.  He keeps glancing up at the counter, nervous.

           Guy checks his notebook and finds an item on the checklist.  
           “ROB A STORE.”

           Opens his jacket and HE’S GOT A GUN tucked in his belt.

                                 GUY
                             (muttering to himself)
                        What are you doing, Guy?  What are 
                        you doing?

           THE LAST CUSTOMER clears out and the store is empty.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  
                        Now or never.

           He’s super nervous.  DEEP BREATH and he approaches --

           THE FRONT COUNTER

           Puts down his bag of chips.  The CASHIER looks bored.

                                 CASHIER
                        One dollar.

           Guy is having trouble hiding his nerves.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                        One dollar.

                                 GUY
                        Excuse me?

                                 CASHIER
                        One item.  One dollar.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah.  Oh, but --  Could you, um --  
                        Well, the thing is --
                             (beat)
                        Give me all your money, motherf--

           Guy fumbles to take out his gun.  Drops it on the floor.  
           Holds it up, shaking like a leaf.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Gimme the cash.  Please.

           The cashier nonchalantly reaches under the counter and 
           suddenly Guy is staring down the barrel of a SHOTGUN.
                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sh--

           BLAM!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GUY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Guy snaps awake in bed as if from a nightmare.

                                 GUY
                        Ahhhhhh!

           Realizes what’s happened.  Checks his face.  No sunglasses.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        As long as I’m wearing the glasses, 
                        I can’t die.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           A TALL GANGBANGER exits the garage and turns, only to see:

           A ROLLING DUMPSTER speeding towards him.  WHUMP!  His 
           sunglasses skid along the ground and SOMEONE WEARING COOL 
           SNEAKERS wanders up to it.

           PAN UP TO REVEAL:  It’s Guy!  He picks the glasses up and 
           puts them on.  He’s trying his best to look like a criminal.

           The bassline of DOWN FOR WHATEVER BY ICE CUBE kicks in for a:

           GUY COMMITS CRIME - MONTAGE

           Guy walks the streets in SLOW MO.  Shoves A PEDESTRIAN and a 
           WAD OF CASH falls onto the ground.  BLOOP!  He picks it up.

           Guy fidgets with a jimmy in a window and STEALS A CAR.

           Guy fires an AK-47 at cans in a dump.  Big smile as his body 
           pulsates with the shots in SLOW-MO.

           Guy shuffles around a corner with a wounded arm and a bloody 
           shirt.  Sees a FIRST AID KIT floating in the air and touches 
           it.  His wounds heal.

           Guy tosses a mailbox through a department store window and 
           steals watches.
           Guy slams into people and WADS OF MONEY fall out of their 
           pockets.  He scoops them up.

           Guy runs from the POLICE.

           Guy crosses missions off his list.  The LEVEL over his head 
           goes up.

           Guy covers his ears and walks down a dock when -- A YACHT 
           BEHIND HIM blows up.

           Guy touches a FLOATING PROTEIN POWDER in the gym and gains 
           muscle mass.

           Guy chases down GANG MEMBERS in a truck.

           He checks in a bathroom mirror and the “Level” above his head 
           keeps getting higher and higher.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Guy wanders out into the street, cool and collected.  Reaches 
           out for a SLOW-MOVING CAR’s door -- perfectly timed.  The 
           WOMAN DRIVER reacts, surprised.

                                 GUY
                        Outta the car.

           Guy points a gun at her sideways.  Looks tough.

           The Driver is scared and hits the gas.  Guy’s sleeve gets 
           caught on the door handle and pulls him along.  The COOL 
           MUSIC STOPS and it all gets very real.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Wait.  What are you doing?  Stop 
                        the car.  Stop the car!

           He whacks the roof, pleading.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Lady!  You’re gonna --

           His sleeve rips, he trips and --

           -- WHUNK! WHUNK!  He falls under the back wheel (OFF CAMERA).

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           For a beat.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:
           GUY COMMITS CRIME - MONTAGE

           MUSIC KICKS BACK IN.

           Guy is back at it.  Steals car after car.  Handles bigger and 
           bigger weapons.  SUBMACHINE GUNS, ROCKET LAUNCHERS.  Collects 
           money.  Destroys property.  Gets fitted for suits at A HIGH 
           END CLOTHING STORE.

           MEANWHILE:

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           The Barista holds up a coffee BUT NOBODY’S THERE.

                                 BARISTA
                             (confused)
                        Medium coffee.  Cream.  Two sugars.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           Buddy waits for Guy where they meet for work, staring at his 
           watch.  Nervous.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy?

           INT. FREE CITY BANK - DAY

           A LINE OF PEOPLE at the bank wait at his empty window.

                                 BANK PATRON
                        Hello?

           The line extends out the door and into the street where:

           TRAFFIC IS BACKED UP FOREVER.  Total gridlock.  Accidents 
           happen as a result.  Fires break out.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           The DOUCHEBAG in a FERRARI is stuck in the traffic.  HONKS.

           Distracted, The Douche doesn’t see Guy stroll up to his door.  
           Guy pulls him out of the car in SLOW MO, climbs in, drives up 
           onto the sidewalk and speeds out of traffic.

           MUSIC STOPS. SEQUENCE ENDS.
           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, PARK - DUSK

           Guy’s softball team stand on the field.  Silent.  Waiting.  
           Totally confused.  It’s an eerie scene.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        We don’t have enough players.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guess we gotta forfeit again.

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Not just yet.

           All heads turns as --

           -- Guy drives up alongside the field in the Ferrari.

           Everybody watches him, stunned speechless.  Guy saunters over 
           and grabs the baseball bat.  Reacts.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Well?  What’re you all standing 
                        there for?  Let’s play ball!

           The Green Hat’s Pitcher shrugs and gets ready to pitch.  Guy 
           points a finger out towards center field, calling the shot.

           The Pitcher is caught off guard.  Hunkers down.  Pitches the 
           ball and just before it leaves his hand --

                                 GUY  (PRELAP) (CONT’D)
                        Drinks are on me!

           INT. TIMMY’S BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

           The Blue Team CELEBRATES.  Guy is the center of attention.

                                 TEAMMATES
                        You did it! / That was amazing! / 
                        Where’d you get those clothes 
                        anyway, Guy?

                                 GUY
                        Oh.  These old things.  Picked ‘em 
                        up this morning at Soonami’s.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        And that car.  It probably costs 
                        twenty times what you make in a 
                        year.
                                 GUY
                        I got the original owner to part 
                        with it for pennies on the dollar.

           Buddy looks him up and down as if he were an alien.  Afraid.

           GUY PULLS BUDDY ASIDE

                                 GUY
                        You okay, Bud?

                                 BUDDY
                        I’ve been waiting for you every 
                        morning.  You don’t show.  You’re 
                        not at your apartment.  You don’t 
                        come to work.  And then you just 
                        show up in the middle of a game and 
                        expect everything to be okay.

                                 GUY
                        I’m sorry.  I’ve been busy.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy, what the heck is going on?

           Buddy is practically in tears.  Guy feels bad for him.

                                 GUY
                        You really wanna know?

                                 BUDDY
                        I think so -- I’m not sure --  No.  
                        I guess not.

           Guy takes off his sunglasses and hands them to Buddy.

                                 GUY
                        Here.  Give these a try.

                                 BUDDY
                        What do you mean?

                                 GUY
                        Put ‘em on.

                                 BUDDY
                        Why?

                                 GUY
                        Trust me.  Just put on the 
                        sunglasses.

           Buddy is having a hard time with it.
                                 BUDDY
                        But it’s nighttime.

                                 GUY
                        That’s not the point --
                             (frustrated)
                        -- Buddy, what do you remember of 
                        your childhood?

                                 BUDDY
                             (thinks)
                        Nothing.  I have a bad memory.

                                 GUY
                        Me too!  That’s all a part of it.  
                        But from what you can remember, 
                        I’ve always been your friend, 
                        right?

                                 BUDDY
                        Well, yeah.  Sure.

                                 GUY
                        So, who are you gonna trust more 
                        than me?

                                 BUDDY
                             (beat, realizing)
                        Nobody.

                                 GUY
                        Right.  So, put on the sunglasses.

                                 BUDDY
                        Why do you want me to put on the 
                        sunglasses?

           Guy pounds the bar.

                                 GUY
                        Buddy!  They’re sunglasses.  You 
                        wanna know how I got this stuff?  
                        How I hit that home run.  It’s 
                        because of the glasses!  Just --

           He tries to force the glasses on Buddy.  Buddy struggles to 
           push him away.

                           BUDDY
           No!  Stop it!
                                                           GUY
                                              Would you just!  Hold still!

           Guy relents.  Backs off.
                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.  It’s fine.  But just 
                        remember -- that’s the difference 
                        between us.  That’s why you’ll 
                        always just be a rat in a cage.

                                 BUDDY
                        You’re acting cuckoo right now, 
                        Guy.  Even for you.

           Guy looks around the room and spots THE HOT GIRLFRIEND OF THE 
           DOUCHEBAG in the corner booth.  Guy opens his notebook and 
           eyes an empty box on his list, “GET LUCKY.”

                                 GUY
                        Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got 
                        a date with destiny.

                                 BUDDY
                        Who’s Destiny?

           BOOTH

           Guy wanders over to the booth and approaches The Beauty he’d 
           seen previously with The Douche.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.  Couldn’t help but notice we 
                        both had drinks.

           She sips her cocktail, flirtatious.

                                 BEAUTY
                        Your car is sooo hot.

                                 GUY
                        This place is lame.  Let’s go for a 
                        ride.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVERSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Guy speeds down the highway with Beauty.

           He shifts gears and SHE SCREAMS, like she’s on a roller 
           coaster as they drive towards THE FREE CITY HOTEL.  Beauty 
           puts a hand on his knee and gives him ‘the look’.

                                 BEAUTY
                        This is sooo hot.

           Guy reacts.  Eyebrow raise.
           INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           The lights from the city twinkle outside the sickest 
           penthouse view.  Guy and Beauty are making out.

                                 BEAUTY
                        You are so hot.

                                 GUY
                        You too.

                                 BEAUTY
                        You are soooo hot.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah.  Same.

           He tries to undo her bra but can’t find the latch.

                                 BEAUTY
                        You are so hot.

           Now Guy’s a little annoyed.

                                 GUY
                        Yep.  Got it.

                                 BEAUTY
                        You are sooooooo hot.

                                 GUY
                        ‘kay, but maybe we should just 
                        like, concentrate on the kissing 
                        stuff.

           She nods and they get back into it.

                                 BEAUTY
                        You are soooooooooo hot!

           Guy undoes her bra latch and --

           -- DING!  The Level above his head jumps to “49”.

           INT. FREE CITY BANK - DAY

           Guy strolls into the bank next day with an ear-to-ear grin.  
           Dressed in an expensive suit.  Rocks a Rolex and nice shoes.

                                 GUY
                        Maury.  How’s it hanging?  Jessica, 
                        looking good.  Looking good.
           They all stare like he has nine heads as he takes his place 
           behind the counter.  Buddy just can’t understand.

                                 BUDDY
                        You’re late.  You know that?

           Guy checks the computer.  Looks at his own account screen:   
           He has over TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS.  He chokes on his coffee.

                                 BUDDY (CONT’D)
                        Management’s calling for your head.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah.  Well, what management wants 
                        is really not that big of a concern 
                        for me anymore.

                                 BANK ROBBER (O.S.)
                        Everybody down on the ground!

           BLAM-BLAM!  A new BANK ROBBER strolls through the doors.  
           Everyone gets down on the ground.  Guy just smirks.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy!  What are you doing?  Get 
                        down.  On the ground.

                                 GUY
                        Not today.

                                 BUDDY
                        You remember what happened to that 
                        one guy who tried to be a hero...

                                 GUY
                        He saved the day and everybody 
                        loved him for it?

                                 BUDDY
                        No.  No, the opposite.

           The Robber notices Guy.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Hey!  I thought I told you to get 
                        down on the ground.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, I’m not gonna do that.  You 
                        see, I need to talk to this really 
                        attractive militant girl from 
                        another dimension.  But she won’t 
                        give me the time of day unless I’m 
                        Level Fifty.
           The Robber reacts, puzzled.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        I’m giving you to the count of 
                        three to kiss that floor or I’m 
                        gonna smash your mouth in.

                                 GUY
                        That so?

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Yeah.  That’s --

           WHUNK!  Guy grabs the gun by the barrel, jams the robber in 
           the face with the stock and knocks him out.

                                 GUY
                        This is my bank, bitch.

           The robber’s duffle bag hits the ground and...

           THROUGH GUY’S POV: DOZENS OF CASH WADS fly across the floor.  
           He walks through them and BLOOP-BLOOP-BLOOP!  His money count 
           jumps through the roof.

           Guy glances in an ORNATE DECORATIVE MIRROR and the Level 
           number above his head ticks up to:

           “LEVEL 50”.

           He reacts and BA-WONGGGG! A SHIP’S HORN SOUNDS (PRELAP).

           EXT. DOCKS - DAY

           A JAPANESE CARGO SHIP is docked, stacked with containers.  
           YAKUZA GANGSTERS stand guard around the ship with UZIs.

           EXT. CARGO SHIP - CONTINUOUS

           TWO ARMED YAKUZA stand along the railing, stoic, when --

           -- FFT-FFT!  They’re hit with ninja stars and silently tumble 
           over the rail into the water.  After a beat --

           -- Millie climbs on board and moves through the ship.

           BETWEEN THE CONTAINERS

           She takes ANOTHER GUARD out with a swift kick, only to be 
           surrounded by TWO OTHER GANGSTERS.  She smiles, seductive, 
           and takes them out with a fluid martial arts maneuver.
           She pulls a SHIPPING MANIFEST from her pocket and looks 
           around, checking container numbers, until she spots:

           A SHIPPING CONTAINER.

                                 MILLIE
                        Hello, gorgeous.

           She approaches it, excited, and pulls down the locking bar.  
           The door falls open and WHU-BUM!

           It’s empty.  She reacts, puzzled, when --

           -- CHK-CHK-CHK!  She turns to see that she’s surrounded by a 
           DOZEN YAKUZA GUARDS.  They YELL AT HER IN JAPANESE.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, boys.  Now, just take it easy.  
                        I think I must be on the wrong --

           She whips two pistols out and fires.

           CLICK-CLICK!  EMPTY CHAMBERS.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        -- boat.

           They smile and raise their weapons when --

           -- RRRRNNN!  A MOTORCYCLE ENGINE revs and VRN!!!!  A MAN ON A 
           SUZUKI HAYABUSA plows through the group, causing them all to 
           dive overboard.

           A FALLEN YAKUZA reaches for his weapon and the RIDER slides 
           it away and kicks the guard, knocking him out.  The rider 
           takes off his helmet, revealing:

           GUY!  Cool, unshaven.  He looks like an action star.

                                 GUY
                        Need a lift?

           Guy offers her a hand.  Millie recoils, stunned.

                                 MILLIE
                        You’re that newb.

                                 GUY
                        Mmm.  I took out the fourth story 
                        of the Free City Fountainbleu with 
                        a bottle of vodka and a matchbook 
                        so, um, no -- clearly, not a newb.
           He points to his level over his head.  They hear YELLING IN 
           JAPANESE and a new GROUP OF GUARDS run across the ship.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        You coming or do you want to take 
                        on half of a Yakuza crime family by 
                        yourself?

           She realizes she doesn’t have a choice.  Jumps on just as the 
           guards catch up to them and Guy takes off.  Weaves through 
           guards and bullets like a pro.

                                 MILLIE
                        How’d you get a motorcycle on a 
                        cargo ship?

                                 GUY
                        The more appropriate question is, 
                        how am I gonna get it off?

           Millie reacts and looks up ahead at:

           A MAKESHIFT RAMP, with a plank resting on the side of a 
           container.  Aiming right off the side of the boat.  As the 
           guards close in, Guy guns it and heads for the ramp.

           TWO GUARDS scramble in front of it, blocking their way.

                                 MILLIE
                        Don’t stop!

           Before Guy can react, Millie grabs a gun out of his pocket 
           and SHOOTS at them.

           They leap out of the way just in time for Guy to hit the ramp 
           and jump the cycle off the boat.

           As they fly through the air, Millie fires behind them.  Guy 
           has a moment of doubt seconds before they hit THE DOCK.

           The motorcycle wobbles as he fights to maintain control until 
           he regains his balance and speeds away under GUNFIRE.  Guy 
           relaxes and Millie looks at him, amazed.

           INT. SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The gaming company is abuzz with activity.  Punit walks 
           through the hallway, casually texting, when Gareth spots him 
           down from a doorway.

                                 GARETH
                        Dude!  I’ve been looking everywhere 
                        for you!
                                 PUNIT
                        I was at Digital Detox.
                             (off his reaction)
                        It’s tech-free wellness retreat 
                        where you disconnect from screens 
                        and reconnect with yourself.  And 
                        girls.

                                 GARETH
                        Of all weekends you had to go 
                        without your freakin’ phone.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Gareth ushers him into a recently assembled war room where 
           WIDE SCREENS monitor chaotic scenes all around Free City.

                                 PUNIT
                        What the hell...

                                 GARETH
                        Blackouts, traffic jams, fires.  
                        We’ve been trying to keep up all 
                        weekend.  Customer Service has had 
                        to pull all-nighters to handle the 
                        onslaught of complaints.

                                 PUNIT
                        It’s a hack.

                                 GARETH
                        No.  Security says we haven’t been 
                        breached.  But remember that glitch 
                        from last week?  Blue Shirt Guy.

                                 PUNIT
                        The sunglasses bug.

                                 GARETH
                        Yeah, but he’s not just buying 
                        shoes anymore.  He’s actually 
                        playing the game.

           Punit watches a feed taken earlier from a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA 
           of Guy blow-torching a MARSHMALLOW DISPLAY in a SUPERMARKET.

                                 PUNIT
                        That’s not possible.  All non-
                        playable background characters are 
                        programmed to stay in the lines.
                                 GARETH
                        Yeah, well --  turns out there’s a 
                        flaw in their programming.

           Gareth pulls up the game’s programming on a monitor.  
           HIGHLIGHTS a certain line of code.  Punit is amazed.

                                 GARETH (CONT’D)
                        Every single Non-Playable Character 
                        has it.  The capability to deviate 
                        from their preprogrammed choice 
                        selection.  It’s just been dormant.

                                 PUNIT
                        Alright.  Then what triggered it in 
                        Blue Shirt Guy?

                                 GARETH
                        Don’t know.  As long as he’s 
                        wearing our sunglasses, we have no 
                        ability to access his code.  He 
                        functions like any other player, 
                        only we can’t disconnect him from 
                        the server.  There’s no outside 
                        line to cut.

           Punit reacts.  Perplexed.

                                 GARETH (CONT’D)
                        We’ve tried everything.  Well, 
                        everything short of a full scale 
                        reboot.  For obvious reasons.

           RING!  The conference phone RINGS.  He checks the caller ID.

                                 PUNIT
                        It’s Antwan.

           RING!  They both react.  This is a big deal.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        He’s not gonna be happy about this.  
                        The sequel’s launching in a week.

           RING!  Punit is paralyzed with fear.

                                 GARETH
                        Well, pick it up!

                                 PUNIT
                        You pick it up.
                                                          PANIT
                                              I can’t speak to it like you 
                                              can.  I’ve been off the grid!
                          GARETH
           Hey, this is your 
           jurisdiction!  I was just 
           covering for your lazy ass.

           Punit picks it up.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        Yo, Antwan.  Whassup, boss I --

           Gareth and OTHER PROGRAMMERS gather around to listen in.  The 
           caller YELLS on the other side.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        Yes.  No, we’re into it.  We think 
                        we have a solve.
                             (What’s the solve?)
                        Um.  Well.  Maybe it’s a little 
                        premature to call it a ‘solve’ per 
                        se but we have all our best --
                             (I have a solution.)
                        Oh.  Yeah, but wouldn’t that --

           Punit hangs up and takes it in.  Turns to the office.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        He wants us to go full blast.

           EXT. ABANDONED PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Guy pulls the motorcycle into a dark, seemingly empty parking 
           garage with Millie on the back. Millie jumps off, frustrated.

                                 MILLIE
                        Dammit!  That sonofa --

                                 GUY
                        You’re upset.

                                 MILLIE
                        Yeah, I’m upset!  There’s something 
                        very important to me that was 
                        supposed to be on that container.  
                        That dirty lying hacker...

           She crinkles up the manifest and tosses it.

                                 GUY
                        Maybe if you tell me what it is I 
                        can help you track it down.

           She glances at him, suspicious.
                                 MILLIE
                        Why do you want to know?

                                 GUY
                        Well.  Guess you can say I’ve 
                        gotten a little obsessed with the 
                        game these last couple of days.

           He flicks a switch on a GENERATOR LIGHT revealing:

           DOZENS UPON DOZENS OF CARS, all shapes and sizes.  Millie is 
           taken aback.  Walks down the row, amazed.

                                 MILLIE
                        You collected this many cars and 
                        leveled up forty-nine times in a 
                        few days?  It took me almost a year 
                        to do that.
                             (thinking)
                        You didn’t get the cheat codes, did 
                        you?

                                 GUY
                        I don’t know what a cheat code is.  
                        I’m just a regular guy who’s trying 
                        to get answers.

                                 MILLIE
                             (suspicious)
                        Answers to what?

                                 GUY
                        Like who are you, exactly?  Where 
                        are you from?

                                 MILLIE
                        I’m not giving my deets out to some 
                        whack-a-doodle I just met online.

                                 GUY
                        I don’t mean specifically.  I mean, 
                        the real you.  The one controlling 
                        this you.  Are you --  like, do you 
                        look like this?  Or something else 
                        entirely.

                                 MILLIE
                        None of your business.

                                 GUY
                        Are you a --  are you, like, a god 
                        or something?

           Millie about-faces and walks away, super weirded out.  
                                 MILLIE
                        Okay.  Goodbye.  Pscyho.

                                 GUY
                        No.  Wait!  I’m sorry!  I know this 
                        all sounds super crazy but --
                             (he’s losing her)
                        I come from a place where nothing 
                        ever changes.  I’m shit on all day 
                        long by a bunch of people who get a 
                        free pass to do whatever they want.

           She slows down.  He got through to her.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        I just want to take control of my 
                        life.  To make a difference.  To 
                        change the game.
                             (she considers it)
                        C’mon.  Let me help you find your 
                        thing.

           She softens.  Turns.

                                 MILLIE
                        Look, I know how you feel.  But 
                        there’s really no point.  In a week 
                        this place will all be gone.

           Record scratch.  Guy’s heart sinks into his stomach.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Millie shows Guy the commercial on a SMARTPHONE.  The 
           graphics are better, the city is bigger.  He even spots a 
           BETTER LOOKING VERSION OF HIMSELF in the background.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        So play Free City while you still 
                        can.  Because in two weeks, it’s 
                        gonna be gone for good to make room 
                        for something a whole lot better.

           Guy is freaking out.  Looks out at the city.

                                 GUY
                        So like, this whole city -- 
                        everybody who lives here -- is 
                        gonna be shut down?  Gone.

                                 MILLIE
                        Finito.  Yep.  It’s entirely stored 
                        in the cloud, so it takes up too 
                        much room on Soonami’s servers to 
                        have both.

                                 GUY
                        This is bad.  This is really bad.

                                 MILLIE
                        No kidding.  Antwan’s gonna make a 
                        gazillion dollars from it too.

                                 GUY
                        Who’s Antwan?

           WHUKKA-WHUKKA-WHUKKA!  The ground starts to RUMBLE and:

           A CHINOOK HELICOPTER lowers down to their level.  Guy and 
           Millie stumble backwards, caught off guard.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh.

                                 MILLIE
                        Guy, that’s no ordinary FCPD 
                        helicopter.  That’s a military-
                        grade assault chopper.

           They scramble down to the next level only to see:

           A CAVALRY OF POLICE CARS heading towards the parking garage.  
           Millie turns to Guy, even more puzzled.
                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?

           RAT-AT-AT!  The chopper fires and Guy dives behind a HUMVEE.

                                 GUY
                        I’ll tell you everything when we 
                        meet up again. If we meet up again.

                                 MILLIE
                        The Multiplayer Lounge.

                                 GUY
                        No.  At the first place you stopped 
                        to watch me.  The game in the game.

           KABOOOM!  The chopper launches a missile and blows up the 
           HUMMER.  Millie is visibly shaken and scrambles away.

           IN THE CHOPPPER

           Punit and Gareth’s COP AVATARS pilot the helicopter.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        I can’t tell if we got him.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Well, you just blew the entire 
                        second floor to kingdom come.

           Gareth/Cop pulls up computer code on a touch-screen monitor.

                                 GARETH/COP (CONT’D)
                        His permissions are ‘blocked’.  
                        He’s still playing.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Then we need to smoke him out.

           The helicopter starts firing on Guy’s arsenal of cars.  
           Blowing them up one by one down the line.  BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!  
           Punit/Cop smiles gleefully at the controls.

                                 PUNIT/COP (CONT’D)
                        I’ve worked here so long I forget 
                        how fun this game is sometimes.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Uh, Punit?

           Gareth/Cop points --
           IN THE GARAGE

           Out of the cloud of smoke --

           -- A TANK appears.  Its canon aimed at their chopper.

                                 PUNIT/COP 
                        Oh, crap --

           KABOOM!  The tank blows the helicopter out of the sky and 
           plows through the garage’s upper level wall.  The tank speeds 
           away, BLASTING HEAVY METAL MUSIC.

           IN THE TANK

           Guy is at the helm.  Croons along with the METAL SONG.  He 
           plows right through a line of POLICE CARS.

                                 GUY
                        Woo!  C’mon, dickheads.  Follow me.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           The city hums with rush hour traffic.

           THE TANK barrels down the street, trailed by a parade of cop 
           cars.  One pulls out in front and the tank mows it down.  
           Pedestrians run out of the way, yelling their reaction lines.

                                 PEDESTRIANS
                        Hey! / Watch where you’re goin’! / 
                        Do you mind? / Nothing to see here.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           Buddy waits on the street corner where he usually meets Guy 
           to walk to work.  Checks his watch, concerned.

           Perfectly timed, the tank cruises down the street.  Guy pops 
           out of the HATCH on the roof of the tank and waves.

                                 GUY
                        Hey, Buddy!

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy?  What’re you doing in that 
                        tank?  You’re late for work.

                                 GUY
                        Take the day off, Buddy!  You 
                        earned it.
           Guy turns down main street leaving Buddy in the dust.  The 
           idea is even more jarring than the sight of Guy in the tank.

                                 BUDDY
                        I don’t have any days off.

           A POLICE BATTERING TRUCK emerges out of thin air and plows 
           through the carnage of twisted metal, tailing the tank.

           INSIDE THE BATTERING TRUCK

           Punit and Gareth’s COP AVATARS are at the wheel.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Dude.  We just got owned by an NPC.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Where’s he going, anyway?

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        I don’t know, but let’s make sure 
                        he doesn’t get there.

           Gareth/Cop takes the tablet and gets to work.

           INT. TANK - CONTINUOUS

           Guy drives the tank and looks out ahead at:

           THE FREE CITY TOWER, a signature skyscraper in the center of 
           the city’s downtown district.

                                 GUY
                        C’mon, c’mon, c’mon.  Almost there.

           FWOOOOSH!  His pathway is suddenly blocked by...

           A WALL OF FIRE!

           IN THE BATTERING TRUCK

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Eat my firewall, bitch!

           SHHHOM!  The tank flies right through it unscathed.

           IN THE TANK

           Guy pats the dash!  Yells back at the cops.
                                 GUY
                        Ha!  Is that all you got?

           GWONG!  THE BLOCK AHEAD INSTANTLY DISAPPEARS.  Just like 
           earlier, a chunk of reality is gone.  And it’s too late to 
           avoid it.  Guy reacts.

           Guy’s tank sails over the cliff, into the void.

           But Guy sees that he’s heading for AN EXPOSED SUBWAY TUNNEL 
           on the block below.

           IN THE BATTERING TRUCK

           Punit and Gareth Cops think that they got him when --

           -- KU-POSH!  The tank speeds up the staircase of the 
           underground subway station on the other side of the void.

           Gareth/Cop is pissed.  Makes the block reappear so that they 
           can drive across it.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        I don’t understand how he got one 
                        of our tanks in the first place.  
                        Players don’t have access to police 
                        hardware.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        But Non-Playable Characters do.  
                        Technically speaking, I guess.
                             (thinking)
                        That gives me an idea.

           AROUND THE CORNER

           Guy is in the home stretch.  The Free City Tower is straight 
           ahead when the tank ripples with electricity and...

           TRANSFORMS INTO A HOTDOG-SHAPED FOOD TRUCK.

           His HEAVY METAL MUSIC turns into an ICE CREAM TRUCK CHIME.  
           He looks down and the stick shift is shaped like a hamburger.

                                 GUY
                        Well, that’s just lovely.

           IN THE BATTERING TRUCK

           Punit and Gareth admire their handiwork as Guy is now 
           vulnerable again.
                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Nice touch.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Now, let’s cook the weenie.

           He hits a few commands on his tablet.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           A SWAT TEAM appears from around a corner and set up A MISSILE 
           LAUNCHER on a bipod.

           One SWAT OFFICER aims the weapon, while another SPOTTER 
           awaits their command.  Gets it.

                                 SPOTTER
                        Go.

           He taps the officer with the launcher, who FIRES.

           INT. HOT DOG TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Guy checks the rear view and sees the MISSILE coming for him.

                                 GUY
                        Ohhh sh --

           With only a second to react, he veers the truck towards a 
           LIGHT POLE, takes off his seatbelt and --

           EXT. CITY STREET

           -- CRASH!  Slams the truck into the pole.  Guy flies through 
           the windshield and --

           -- KABOOM!  The truck EXPLODES behind him from the missile.

           Guy sails through the air in a spray of glass in SLOW MOTION 
           from an impact that would kill any normal person.

           And it has basically done that.  Guy is barely alive and in a 
           terrible way.

           HIS LEG IS BROKEN in an unnatural position.  HIS NECK IS 
           TWISTED.  HIS NOSE IS SMASHED.

           As he flies through the air, he starts to lose consciousness.

           When we finally see, STILL IN SLO MO, that this was no random 
           crash.  He did it deliberately as he is flying directly at --
           -- A FIRST AID KIT!  His glasses readout shows his “Health” 
           trickle down from:

           “4,3,2...”  He hits the first aid kit and BRRUUP! his snapped 
           neck is healed in an instant, but he’s still in bad shape.

           BACK IN REAL TIME:

           He picks himself up but his broken arms dangle to his side 
           and he can barely walk on a TWISTED BROKEN LEG.

                                 GUY
                        Ow, ow, ow.

           UP AHEAD, he sees another FIRST AID KIT.

           IN THE BATTERING TRUCK

           Punit and Gareth finally catch up and see what he’s doing.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Look!  Don’t let him get to the --

           BACK WITH GUY

           BRRUUP!  He touches the kit and his arms are healed.  Guy 
           pushes through the front doors of the tower, on a broken leg.

           IN THE BATTERING TRUCK

           Gareth programs something on his tablet.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        It’s okay.  We’ve got him now.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Hurry.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        It’s gonna take a sec.

           INT. FREE CITY TOWER LOBBY - DAY

           Guy limps through the lobby on the twisted leg, which breaks 
           further, and people react, horrified.

                                 GUY
                        Excuse me.  Sorry.  Just looking 
                        for a --  Ah!
           He spots another FIRST AID KIT and touches it, BRUUUP!  
           SNAPPING his leg back into place with a CRUNCH.

           He walks into an elevator FILLED WITH PEOPLE and composes 
           himself amid looks of terror.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Much better. Hi. Top floor, please.

           The elevator clears out.

           EXT. FREE CITY TOWER OBSERVATORY - DAY

           Guy runs out of the elevator on the rooftop deck.

           Punit and Gareth Cops are now back IN A HELICOPTER.  Other 
           helicopters have joined them and have the tower surrounded.

           Guy waves his blue shirt, trying to get their attention.

                                 GUY
                        Hey!  Over here!

           He pulls back A TARP that’s tied down to the roof.

           IN THE HELICOPTER

           Gareth is now at the controls.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Now?

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        No.  Wait.  Look.

           Guy has spelled out something on the ground:

           ‘GUY IS ALIVE.”

                                 GARETH/COP
                        This is --  They didn’t really 
                        teach us how to deal with this at 
                        Berkley.  There was no chapter for 
                        it in Advanced C Plus Plus.  
                        Troubleshooting if your three-
                        dimensional model figure suddenly 
                        develops feelings.

           DING! Gareth/Cop checks A TEXT on his phone.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        Antwan wants us to end it here.
           EXT. FREE CITY TOWER ROOF - DAY

           Guy waves his blue shirt to the sky.  Hoping.

                                 GUY
                        C’mon!  Talk to me!  You need to 
                        talk to me!  Just --

           FOOM!  Guy reacts, horrified, as...

           THE ENTIRE FREE CITY TOWER BELOW HIM DISINTEGRATES.

           The whole building is deleted right out of existence in an 
           instant and he’s left floating there until --

           -- GUY FREE FALLS BACKWARDS, through thin air, a hundred 
           stories down.  The whole city, all the programmers watching, 
           amazed, until he hits the gr--

           INT. GUY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Guy snaps up in bed without freaking out, fully aware of 
           where he is and what just happened.  And he’s pissed.

           INT. SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Back in the Soonami offices, Punit and Gareth work head-to-
           head on their laptops in the war room.  The PROGRAMMERS 
           around them APPLAUD.

                                 PUNIT
                        Don’t pop that cork just yet.  We 
                        need to isolate him now before he 
                        can get our glasses again.

           INT. GUY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Guy runs out of his room to the front door, about to open it.

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK!  Someone on the other side pounds and 
           turns the knob.

                                 GUY
                        Shit.

           The pounding stops and then the DOORKNOB starts fidgeting.  
           Someone on the other side is picking the lock.

           Guy looks out his window:
           A PADDY WAGON from the “FREE CITY HOME FOR THE MENTALLY ILL” 
           is parked outside his building.  Out the other window:

           A SWAT TEAM moves up the alley.  Guy is trapped.  But he’s 
           not gonna go down like this.  Opens his closet and looks 
           around.  There’s a small door in the ceiling for the attic.

           BACK AT THE FRONT DOOR

           BLAM!  Punit and Gareth, now using ORDERLY AVATARS, break in.

                                 GARETH/ORDERLY
                        Hello!  Anybody home?

           They quickly search the tiny apartment and realize he’s gone.

                                 PUNIT/ORDERLY
                        Search the bedroom!

           Gareth checks the closet and eyes the attic door.  Shoves it 
           open and sticks his head up inside.

                                 GARETH/ORDERLY
                        Set up a perimeter.  He couldn’t 
                        have gotten far!

           INT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           A STREET KID waits for the bus, chunky headphones.  Black 
           jacket.  Hoodie.  Guy taps him on the shoulder.

                                 GUY
                        You wanna make a hundred and ninety 
                        seven dollars?

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Punit/Cop and Gareth/Cop walk down the street, shoving 
           pedestrians, looking for Guy.

                                 PEDESTRIANS
                        Hey! /  Watch where you’re goin’! / 
                        Do you mind? / Move along people.

           That’s when Punit spots Guy’s signature BLUE SHIRT.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        There!  There he is.  Move in.

           From behind, Guy walks down the street when THE TROOPS MOVE 
           IN. Within seconds he has a hundred rifles aimed at his face.
                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        Freeze!  Hands behind your head!  
                        Down on the ground!

           The person turns around and reveals that IT’S NOT GUY.  It’s 
           the Street Kid dressed in his clothes.

                                 STREET KID
                        I didn’t do anything!  I know my 
                        rights!

           Punit/Cop reacts, angry.

                                 PUNIT/COP
                        We got the wrong guy.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Guy makes his way down the street in the street kid’s 
           clothes.  Keeps his head down.  Hood up.

           Looks away from CAMERAS on every corner.  Avoids eye contact 
           with COPS CANVASSING the neighborhood for him.

           TV SHOWS in windows feature video of Guy on News Segments and 
           “WANTED” Posters litter the town.  “Reward $100”.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           He peeks around into the alley where the players usually come 
           out.  It’s now being staked out by UNDERCOVER COPS IN BLACK 
           VANS.  He keeps moving.

           EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

           Guy watches Buddy walk to work from a safe distance.  Sees 
           that THE BLACK VAN is stalking him too.  Buddy is clearly 
           freaked out -- they’ve gotten to him.

           Guy feels the vice closing in on him.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        What does it mean to truly be free?

           Mac rants and raves on a street corner.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Everybody thinks that they have 
                        free will.  But is that the way it 
                        is?  Can you really ever just drop 
                        everything?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Quit your boring little job and go 
                        wherever you want?  Your house, 
                        your car, friends, family.  These 
                        are the bars on your cage.

           Guy approaches him, pretending to throw out some garbage.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.  We need to talk.

           Mac gives him a suspicious glance through the CRACKED LENSES 
           OF AN OLD, BROKEN PAIR OF THE SUNGLASSES.

                                 MAC
                        ‘Bout what?

           Guy looks him in the eyes, desperate.

                                 GUY
                        About the game.

           Mac’s fiery gaze calms.  He has been waiting a long time to 
           hear those words.

           EXT. AQUEDUCT - DAY

           Guy follows the Mac through a maze of overgrown brambles that 
           line a dried-out riverbed.

                                 MAC
                        Almost there.

           Mac finds a BIG PIECE OF PLYWOOD pushed against the concrete 
           wall.  He looks around, making sure they weren’t followed.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Gimme a hand with this.

           They push the plywood over, revealing A HOLE IN THE WALL.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Step into my office.

           Guy follows Mac through the hole to the other side where he 
           sees something incredible...

                                 GUY
                             (amazed)
                        What is this place?

                                 MAC
                        Welcome to Betaville.
           We now see what they are looking at --

           EXT. BETAVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           AN EMPTY CITY SUBURB WITH INFERIOR GRAPHICS.

           Buildings are digitized and sparse.  Blocky around the edges.  
           They are all covered in one of five patterns: Brick, metal, 
           wood, glass and something that vaguely resembles vegetation.

           Looks like a game designed twenty years ago.  Guy gazes 
           around, stunned.  It’s a total ghost town.

           BARK-BARK!  He startles as a DIGITIZED GERMAN SHEPHERD runs 
           past them until it hits the side of a building.  Runs in 
           place, nose against the wall.  Mac drags Guy away.

                                 MAC
                        Don’t worry.  They won’t look for 
                        you here.  Abandoned this place a 
                        long time ago.

           MAC’S ENCAMPMENT

           Mac leads Guy to his encampment -- a collection of junk from 
           Free City piled up under a few tattered tents.

           He offers Guy a DIGITIZED CAN OF “BEANS”.

                                 MAC
                        Beans?  They’re chunky but they’re 
                        good.

           Mac forks a SQUARE BEAN and eats it.

                                 GUY
                        No, thanks.  Sorry, but um, I 
                        didn’t catch your name.

                                 MAC
                        Huh.  Nobody’s ever asked me that 
                        before.  Well, officially my name 
                        is ‘Mac’, but that’s my slave name.  
                        You can call me by the name I gave 
                        myself.  Pasta Sunset.
                             (off Guy’s reaction)
                        They’re two of my favorite things.  
                        You should do the same.  It’s one 
                        of the few identifiers you can 
                        actually control.
                                 GUY
                        Guy works for me.

           Mac plops down on a digitized plastic crate.  Sizes Guy up.

                                 MAC
                        So, you’ve pulled back the curtain 
                        and seen the strings.  And what’s 
                        more, you’re still around to talk 
                        about it.  I’m impressed.

                                 GUY
                        I take it that you have too.  Seen 
                        the strings.

                                 MAC
                        I was a taxi driver.  Made a decent 
                        living.  Didn’t think much about -- 
                        well, anything.  And then, one day, 
                        I’m carjacked.  In the scuffle, the 
                        jackass drops his glasses and fsh!  
                        The wool is pulled from my eyes for 
                        good.  I tried to live the high 
                        life for a while, but they weren’t 
                        happy with that.  I tried to get 
                        answers.  I tried to talk to them.

           Guy sits forward.

                                 GUY
                        To who?

                                 MAC
                        The creators.  The programmers.  
                        The prison guards.  But they were 
                        not interested in talking back.  
                        And the harder I tried, the harder 
                        they made things for me, until --
                             (he digs deep, sad)
                        They turned everyone against me.  
                        My friends.  My family.  I became 
                        something of an urban legend.  The 
                        guy who tried to buck the system.

           Guy goes wide-eyed, realizing.

                                 GUY
                        The guy who tried to be a hero!

                                 MAC
                        Hm.  Somethin’ like that.  I think 
                        it was a way for them to reinforce 
                        the status quo.  So nobody else 
                        would make waves.
           Mac takes off his broken sunglasses and stares at them.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Really did a number on me.  Once 
                        you’ve seen what we’ve seen --  
                        there’s no going back.

                                 GUY
                        But it’s --  It’s not fair.  I 
                        didn’t ask to be a part of this!

           Mac LAUGHS at him.

                                 MAC
                        Who asked to be a part of anything?  
                        The creators -- well, I never met 
                        them -- but I’d wager that they’re 
                        not too different than us.  Maybe 
                        they’re living in someone else’s 
                        game.  Or maybe we’re all in the 
                        dream of some giant cosmic baby.

                                 GUY
                        A giant cosmic baby...

                        You’re here.  This is your reality.  
                        What you choose to do with it --  
                        well, that’s up to you.  You can be 
                        a sheep.  You can be a player.  Or 
                        you can be a homeless person.
                             (getting serious)
                        But you can’t change chessboards.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, but -- what if I told you 
                        that the chessboard and all the 
                        pieces on it were gonna vanish and 
                        be replaced by a newer, better 
                        chessboard?

           Mac reacts.

           EXT. FREE CITY SQUARE - DAY

           Guy and Mac move covertly through the crowd.  Duck into an 
           alley and look up at the GIANT BILLBOARD in the Square.

           Mac puts on his broken glasses and through the spiderweb 
           cracks and holes he sees:

           A COMMERCIAL FOR FREE CITY 2.
                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Enjoy Free City while it’s still 
                        around because in four days it’s 
                        gonna be a thing of the past.

           There’s a literal TICKING CLOCK counting down to the “FREE 
           CITY 2 RELEASE DATE.  Mac is awestruck.

                                 MAC
                        The apocalypse.  I knew it!  I 
                        warned that the day of reckoning 
                        would come but nobody would listen--

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, but not so fast.  We may have 
                        a shot at stopping the apocalypse.

                                 MAC
                        You mean take control of the city?

                                 GUY
                        Get them to leave us alone the way 
                        they abandoned Betaville.

                                 MAC
                        It’s an interesting thought.  It’s 
                        impossible, but interesting.

                                 GUY
                        Not necessarily.  There’s this 
                        girl.  A player.

           Mac pulls him behind a dumpster.

                                 MAC
                        We can’t trust a player.  She could 
                        be one of them.  Like a spy.  Or a 
                        dude.

                                 GUY
                        She’s different.  And she’s our 
                        best shot right now.

                        But we here at Gamerz are wondering 
                        if this is good or bad publicity 
                        for Soonami, who plans to release 
                        the long-anticipated sequel, Free 
                        City 2, this month.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:  This is being watched on a computer.

           INT. MULTIPLAYER LOUNGE - DAY

           Millie is watching it, trying to figure everything out.  
           Other avatars are hanging out behind her.

                                 ZELIG2693
                        Gotta be a hacker.

                                 DOUGIEPUGGIE808
                        I hear it’s a disgruntled Soonami 
                        employee trying to get back at 
                        Antwan for stealing his ideas.

                                 CATLOVER69
                        Nah.  It’s all a big gimmick.

                                 ZELIG2693
                        Who do you think it is, Mol?  Mol?

                                 MILLIE
                             (focused)
                        Working on it.

           She pulls up a TEXT SCREEN and starts typing.

           MOLOTOVGIRL4482: Hey. Who’s Free Guy?
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SOONAMI - DAY

           DING!  Punit gets a TEXT on his phone.  Checks it out, 
           covertly.  It’s the text from “MOLOTOVGIRL4482”.

           He pumps his fist, excited.  Types back.

           BIGBURRITO: Yo, girl. Take me up on dinner and I’ll tell you.

           MOLOTOVGIRL4482: Is it a hack?

           Punit grimaces.  Annoyed.

           BIGBURRITO:  Yours truly is on top of it. Just you watch.

           INT. MULTIPLAYER LOUNGE - DAY

           Millie gets another text in the chain from Punit.

           BIGBURRITO: Now about that dinner...

           She shuts the computer off and thinks.  Recalls what Guy said 
           to her in the parking garage.

                                 MILLIE
                             (to herself)
                        The game inside the game.

           She looks at images of Guy.  One of them has him wearing his 
           BASEBALL HAT.  It hits her.  She knows where to find him!

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, PARK - NIGHT

           Millie walks into the park late at night.  The baseball 
           diamond is empty.

           She stands at the chain link fence where she first watched 
           Guy playing softball.

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Psst.

           She whips around and GUY APPEARS OUT OF THE SHADOWS.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                             (re: the baseball field)
                        I can’t believe you knew what I was 
                        talking about.

                                 MILLIE
                        I stopped here a few times.  
                        Watching that game.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILLIE (CONT'D)
                        I remember thinking how sad it 
                        seemed.  These virtual people stuck 
                        playing a baseball game in, like, 
                        this infinite time loop.

                                 GUY
                        Funny.  I thought the same thing.

                                 MILLIE
                        It’s even weirder that you’re a 
                        player hacking a background 
                        character, playing a baseball game 
                        in an infinite time loop.

                                 GUY
                        We all have our idiosyncracies.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATER

           Guy and Millie sit on swings in an empty playground.  Guy 
           looks around, nervous.  Up in the sky.

                                 GUY
                        I’m glad you came.  Things have 
                        gotten a little out of hand.

                                 MILLIE
                        I’ve been playing for a while now 
                        but --  I haven’t seen anything 
                        like this.  You really put them 
                        through the ringer.

                                 GUY
                        I was just trying to get the 
                        creators’ attention.

                                 MILLIE
                        Well, it worked.  Antwan’s gotta be 
                        freaking out of his mind right now.

                                 GUY
                        Antwan.  You mentioned him earlier.

                                 MILLIE
                        Antwan Hovachelik.  He’s the 
                        misogynistic pig that designed this 
                        stupid game. Thinks he’s God’s gift 
                        to programmers but all he did was 
                        create another way to get people to 
                        endlessly empty their wallets.  
                        People who couldn’t handle the 
                        smallest semblance of confrontation 
                        in the real world.  Like him.
                                 GUY
                        Sounds like you know him.

                                 MILLIE
                        Well, we were sorta together for a 
                        long time.  I basically supported 
                        him while he worked on the game and 
                        the second he got funded, he split.  
                        Dumped me on my ass and started 
                        dating a Victoria’s Secret model. 
                        Would only talk to me through 
                        lawyers.

                                 GUY
                        That sucks.  But then -- why come 
                        here?  And spend money on the game 
                        that your ex boyfriend created?

           She considers if she should tell him.

                                 MILLIE
                        Because I wanted to find a way to 
                        take the game down.  To hurt him 
                        where it counts.  To make him 
                        realize how much he hurt me.  I 
                        guess that sounds really lame.

                                 GUY
                        Not at all.

           She looks at Guy, not sure what to make of him.

                                 MILLIE
                        But the bigger question is why are 
                        you doing it?

                                 GUY
                        I’m trying to stop the sequel.  I 
                        want to keep Free City like it is.  
                        With a few modifications.

                                 MILLIE
                        Well, this little stunt of yours is 
                        really costing Soonami big time.  
                        If people think the platform’s 
                        buggy it could tank F.C. Two sales.

                                 GUY
                        Really?  That’s good.
                             (thinking)
                        What if we get other people 
                        involved?  Get everybody else in 
                        Free City to push back like I have.
                                 MILLIE
                        You mean hack the other NPCs.  Like 
                        a revolution.  It could work.  Can 
                        you do that?

                                 GUY
                        I think so.  If you’ll help me.  
                        Will you help me?  Please?

           Millie raises an eyebrow.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Guy stands outside a garage with a box.  The door opens and 
           Millie walks out.

                                 MILLIE
                        Hey.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.

                                 MILLIE
                        See you in a sec.

           Millie takes off her glasses and drops them in the box.  Her 
           avatar glitches out and disappears.  Seconds later --

           -- Millie walks out again wearing a new pair of sunglasses.  
           Looks in the box and her old ones are still there.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        It worked.

                                 GUY
                        Yep.  Now we just have to do this a 
                        few thousand more times.

           EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

           Someone on a street corner hands out “FREE SUNGLASSES”.  Most 
           people ignore him until a pedestrian takes one, curious and 
           puts them on.  Reacts.

           “YOU’RE INVITED TO A PRIVATE MISSION TOMORROW NIGHT.”  
           There’s a MAP at the bottom with a BLINKING DOT.

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        All questions will be answered at 
                        the red dot.
           QUICK MONTAGE OF GUY AND FRIENDS PASSING AROUND SUNGLASSES

           Mac walks into Timmy’s and hands out glasses.

           Millie opens a car door at gunpoint, but instead of stealing 
           the car, she hands the LADY a pair of glasses.

           Guy hands sunglasses to Beauty and The Douche.

           INT. BUDDY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Buddy sits on his couch, watching television.  He hears a 
           TAPPING and ignores it.

           Hears it again.  It’s coming from the window.  He picks up a 
           baseball bat and approaches it cautiously.

           Guy is hiding out on the fire escape.  Buddy lets him in.

                                 BUDDY
                        Guy!  What are you --

                                 GUY
                        Shh!  It’s okay Buddy.  I just need 
                        to keep things on the down low.

           They both look around.  Someone might be listening in.

                                 BUDDY
                        These cops came around asking about 
                        you.  Said I should turn you in.  I 
                        didn’t know what to do.
                             (choking up)
                        The whole thing is really, really -- 
                        upsetting.

           Buddy is about to cry.  Guy comforts him.

                                 GUY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 BUDDY
                        I saw you in the tank.  And then 
                        the hot dog truck.  And then that 
                        building disappeared.  That was 
                        weird.

                                 GUY
                        I know.  It was weird.  But I’ve 
                        found out some things about Free 
                        City.  Really troubling things.
                                 BUDDY
                        What kind of troubling things?
                             (beat)
                        I don’t want to know.
                             (beat)
                        Yeah, I do.  Oh, Guy.  It’s all so -

           Guy hands him a pair of sunglasses.

                                 GUY
                        They’ll give you all the answers 
                        you need.

                                 BUDDY
                        This is about rocking the boat, 
                        isn’t it?  About being a hero.

                                 GUY
                        I know it’s asking a lot of you, 
                        Buddy.  I understand if you can’t.  
                        But it would mean the world to me 
                        to have you there.

           Guy puts a hand on his shoulder.  Buddy can see he’s sincere.  
           Guy slips out with a finger to his mouth.  Shh!

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SOONAMI - NIGHT

           The team is visibly worn out from pulling all-nighters.  
           Programmers are hunched over their stations, looking for Guy.

                                 PUNIT
                        I just don’t understand how it’s 
                        possible for a line of code to hide 
                        from us.

                                 GARETH
                        Dude.  You gotta see this.

           Gareth calls up something on his screen.

           INT. CITY CENTER - DAY

           Punit/Cop and Gareth/Cop stand in the middle of Free City’s 
           largest hub, marveling.

           THE CITY IS EMPTY.

           Not a person or moving car in sight.  A total ghost town.

                                 GARETH/COP
                        Where’d everybody go?
           EXT. AQUEDUCT - NIGHT

           A PEDESTRIAN NPC wearing the sunglasses makes his way through 
           the brambles to the piece of plywood.  “FREE GUY” is spray-
           painted on it.

           PLAYER’S POV: Shows he’s arrived at the RED MISSION PIN on 
           the map.  The NPC KNOCKS and Millie slides it open.

                                 MILLIE
                        Come on in.

           EXT. BETAVILLE - NIGHT

           Betaville is now filled with CITIZENS OF FREE CITY all 
           wearing the sunglasses.  Hundreds of them crowded into the 
           primitive space of the Beta Version.

           The citizens react to it, unable to believe that it’s real.

           AT THE ENTRANCE

           Guy waits as Millie lets the last NPC through.

                                 GUY
                        Maybe this was a bad idea.  Maybe 
                        this backfires and makes things 
                        worse.

                                 MILLIE
                        Remember what you said to me at the 
                        garage.  About making a difference.  
                        Well, here’s your chance.

           MAKESHIFT STAGE

           Guy climbs up on a dumpster, trying to build his nerve.  The 
           crowd is restless, confused.

                                 GUY
                        Hello.  Um.  Excuse me.  Um --

                                 MAC
                             (to the crowd)
                        Shaddup!  Let the guy speak!

           The crowd silences.  All eyes are now on Guy.

                                 GUY
                        Hey, everybody.  Thanks for coming.  
                        My name’s Guy.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GUY (CONT'D)
                        I imagine if you’re here, you’re 
                        probably starting to figure out 
                        what’s going on...  Free City is 
                        anything but free.  We’re the 
                        supporting cast of colorful 
                        characters there to be used, abused 
                        or totally ignored by people we 
                        will never really know.  Or see 
                        face to face.  People who have 
                        something we’ve never had -- the 
                        ability to make their own 
                        decisions.  To enrich their lives.  
                        To have a say in how to run their 
                        own communities.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Maybe you’re a part of it!

                                 TOUGH GUY
                        There’s a hundred dollar bounty on 
                        your head!

                                 CHUBBY DUDE
                        Tell us why we shouldn’t turn you 
                        in!

                                 GUY
                        There’s a bounty on my head?

           BEHIND THE CROWD

           Millie stands with ANONAMOU$E - the hacker from earlier.

                                 ANONAMOU$E
                        Strangest hack ever.

                                 MILLIE
                        Shut up.  He’s trying to activate 
                        their dormant line of code.

                                 ANONAMOU$E
                        Yeah, well -- it’s not working.

           People are getting restless.  It’s going poorly.

           MAKESHIFT STAGE

           Guy is losing them.

                                 GUY
                        Look.  If you just let me explain.
           People crowd the stage.  Reach for his legs.  Guy is about to 
           bail when he sees something at the back of the crowd:

           BUDDY.

           He enters Betaville, sheepish.  Nervous.  Guy sees his friend 
           and suddenly all of his anxiety melts away.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve lived in Free City for as long 
                        as I can remember.  We’ve had to 
                        put up with a lot of screwed up 
                        stuff living here but this is our 
                        home.  And if we don’t do something 
                        about it, it’ll all be gone.  
                        Everything you know and love will 
                        cease to exist to make room for 
                        this --

           He shows them A POSTER FOR FREE CITY 2.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Well, I for one refuse to just sit 
                        back and let that happen.  Freedom 
                        doesn’t come free.  It’s something 
                        you have to earn.

           The crowd responds, positive.  Millie watches, impressed.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Now, I know that everything inside 
                        of you is telling you to put your 
                        head down and not ask questions.  
                        To not rock the boat.  But it’s 
                        time for us to step out of the 
                        fringes and become the heroes of 
                        our own stories.  If we want to 
                        take our city back, we need to come 
                        together and make big waves!

                                 MAC
                        Right on, brutha!

                                 BEAUTY
                        You are sooo hot.

                                 BUDDY
                        That’s my friend!

           The crowd is sufficiently rallied.
           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           A THUG IN GLASSES strolls into a store with a GUN.

                                 THUG
                        Gimme all the money in the 
                        register.

           He grabs the cash and turns around only to see:

           EVERYONE IN THE STORE STARING AT HIM.  Eerie.

                                 THUG (CONT’D)
                        Huh?  Is this some kind of a --

           He sidesteps outside, creeped out.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           People are still staring at him.  The tension builds until --

                                 THUG
                        Look, you’re not supposed to --

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        Get him!

           They descend on the thug all at once.

           INT. ALLEY - DAY

           A PLAYER’S POV:  As they exit into an alley.  They find 
           themselves faced by a group of WOMEN WITH BLOWTORCHES.

           They engulf the player in flames.

           INT. FREE CITY BANK - DAY

           The quiet bank is interrupted by a BANK ROBBER who charges in 
           with a duffle bag and a shotgun.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Alright!  Everybody down on the 
                        ground.  The bank’s insured so --

           BLAM!  The SECURITY GUARD shoots him.  Everyone reacts, 
           stunned, until the old guard blows the smoke on his barrel.

           Everyone in the bank CHEERS.
           EXT. FREE CITY SQUARE - MONTAGE

           Everywhere you look, the citizens of Free City fight back 
           against the players.

           EXT. SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The Soonami offices seems quiet compared to the chaos 
           happening on the streets of Free City until --

           -- A SKY BLUE BUGATTI pulls up in front.  The suicide door 
           flips open and someone walks out.  All we can see is their 
           WHITE SNEAKERS.

           INT. SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Programmers scramble to fix the game.

           WE FOLLOW THE SNEAKERS down the hall and everyone stops in 
           their tracks at the sight of the wearer.

                                 SOONAMI EMPLOYEE
                        Antwan./ It’s Antwan./ Hey Antwan!

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SOONAMI - DAY

           Punit and Gareth work furiously.

                                 PUNIT
                        Take down all the blocks between 
                        Fourth and Main.  I’ll cover the 
                        Hill Section and --

           They freeze as the sneakers enter the room. PAN UP TO REVEAL:

           A scrawny guy in his mid twenties.  Not what you were 
           expecting the big boss and CEO of Soonami to look like.  
           Backwards baseball cap.  This is ANTWAN and he looks pissed.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        Antwan.

                                 GARETH
                        Hey, buddy.  You know, you didn’t 
                        have to come in.  We almost have 
                        things under control.

           The monitors behind Gareth tell a different tale.  Fires, 
           angry mobs, it’s a city wide riot.
                                 ANTWAN
                        Don’t look that way to me.

           Antwan stands over Punit who realizes that he wants him to 
           move.  Punit scurries away and Antwan sits down at his 
           laptop.  Gets right into it.

                                 ANTWAN (CONT’D)
                        Have you done a hard scan of the 
                        batch files?

                                 PUNIT
                        Yep and we’re redirecting dataflow 
                        through our security team.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Did you reboot the system?

           They react, surprised he would even suggest it.

                                 PUNIT
                        Well, no.  We were trying to follow 
                        protocol and avoid a shutdown.

           Antwan points to the chaos on the screens.

                                 ANTWAN
                        You think this is preferable to a 
                        shutdown?  If Free City is in 
                        chaos, we can’t release the sequel.  
                        Users stop spending their money.  
                        We stand to lose everything!

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

           Guy and Millie watch the revolution from a rooftop.

                                 GUY
                        It’s kinda beautiful.

                                 MILLIE
                        You did it.  Now they have to take 
                        us seriously.

                                 GUY
                        And this is only the beginning.  I 
                        got a present for you.

           Guy pulls out A PIECE OF PAPER and hands it to her.  She sees 
           that it has a PARKING SPACE NUMBER scrawled on it.
                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        That parking space holds the car 
                        that was on that shipping 
                        container.  The briefcase you’ve 
                        been looking for is in the trunk.

                                 MILLIE
                        How did you find this?

                                 GUY
                        NPC’s are the eyes and ears of this 
                        place.  I just had to ask a few 
                        background peeps and voila...

                                 MILLIE
                        I can’t believe it.

                                 GUY
                        Now you can use whatever it is to 
                        get Antwan’s attention yourself.

           She considers this.  It’s what she’s wanted for so long, but 
           now she has mixed feelings.

                                 MILLIE
                        You know.  It’s funny.  I’ve spent 
                        more time in Free City this past 
                        year than I have in my own life.

                                 GUY
                        Sometimes I feel like I live here.

                                 MILLIE
                        It’s just I feel like I’m more 
                        myself here than anywhere else.

                                 GUY
                        That’s good. Cause I like this you.

           KABOOM! Another building in the background goes up in flames.

                                 MILLIE
                        Whatever happens.  Maybe we should 
                        meet up. Y’know. Outside Free City.
                             (vulnerable)
                        That is, if you’d share your deets 
                        with a complete stranger you only 
                        know through a video game.

           She looks at him, vulnerable.  Really putting herself out 
           there.  Guy reacts.  He can’t tell her who he really is.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, about that --
           She senses the rejection and backs off.  Clutches the top 
           buttons of her shirt like in the real world.

                                 MILLIE
                        Yeah, no.  It was a bad idea.

           She starts to walk away and he touches her wrist.

                                 GUY
                        It’s a great idea.  It’s just -- I 
                        don’t actually know who I am.

           They go to kiss.  Are just about to connect when --

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SOONAMI - DAY

           Antwan’s fingers fly across the keys.  He gets everything he 
           needs called up, looks it over.

           “FULL SYSTEM SHUT DOWN.”

           HITS THE ENTER KEY and VROOOOOOooooonnnn.  All the monitors 
           go blank.  The room gets silent.

           Punit, Gareth and the programmers look around, shocked.

                                 PUNIT
                        We’re dark.  Free City is offline.

           Whoa...

           INT. MILLIE’S ROOM - DAY

           Millie takes off her VR Goggles and checks the computer 
           screen.  “FREE CITY: EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.  
           TRY AGAIN LATER.”  She reacts, taken aback.

           AROUND THE WORLD

           Players sit strapped into their VR Goggles and sitting in 
           front of televisions, holding their controllers.  Looking at 
           the same ‘Error’ screen.  Stunned.

                                                              CLOSE ON:

           A BLANK COMPUTER SCREEN

           A NEW PROMPT BLINKS ON as the system reboots.
           The SOONAMI LOGO appears and a status bar runs underneath.

           “TEN PERCENT RELOADED.”  Twenty, forty, seventy, seventy 
           three, all the way up to a full hundred.

           Out of TOTAL BLACKNESS --

           EXT. FREE CITY SKYLINE

           BROONGGG!!!  Sunlight appears behind the Free City Skyline 
           and a LOUD CHIME echoes throughout the city.

           All the landmarks we have seen over the course of the story 
           reappear, fresh and new.  Not a spot of graffiti in sight.

           INT. GUY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Guy wakes up in bed.  Yawns.  But doesn’t seem to have any 
           recollection of anything that happened.

           INT. GUY’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Guy sits at his kitchen table.  Eats cereal.  Plays a game on 
           his phone, oblivious.

           INT. GUY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Guy exercises with the web video, enthusiastic.

                                 GUY
                        Left, right, left, right, up, up, 
                        down, down, punch, punch, kick!

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Guy gets his coffee.

                                 BARISTA
                        Medium coffee.  Cream.  Two sugars.

                                 GUY
                        Just how I like it!

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Guy walks to work with Buddy.  He also seems to be reset.
                                 BUDDY
                        We should take Fourth.

                                 GUY
                        Works for me.

           INT. BANK ROBBER - DAY

           Guy and Buddy work at their stations.  A ROBBER enters.

                                 BANK ROBBER
                        Alright!  Everybody down on the 
                        ground.  Nobody moves and nobody 
                        gets hurt.

           Guy and Buddy casually get on the ground.

                                 BUDDY
                        You playing softball tonight?

                                 GUY
                        Wouldn’t miss it for the world.  
                        Drinks afterwards?

                                 BUDDY
                        You know it.

           They knock knuckles as The Robber cleans out the drawers.

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, PARK - DUSK

           Guy hits a ball into center field.  It’s fielded and thrown 
           to first.  He’s out.  He heads back to the dugout.  Walks 
           right past:

           MILLIE.  She’s standing by the fence, watching.

                                 MILLIE
                        Hey.

           He gives her an empty smile and keeps walking.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.

           She reacts.  That was weird.

           INT. TIMMY’S BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

           The team nurses their wounds at the bar.
                                 GUY
                        Don’t look so down, fellas.  We’ll 
                        get ‘em next time.

           Beauty is sitting with Douchebag, wrapped up in each other.  
           Guy watches them.

           Millie approaches him from behind, timid.

                                 MILLIE
                        Hey.

                                 GUY
                        Oh.  Um.  Hi.

           Guy fidgets, awkward. She doesn’t understand what’s going on.

                                 MILLIE
                        Can we talk?  In private.

           The Team looks at Guy, shocked but impressed.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        Go on, stud.

           Guy gets up and follows her.

           ACROSS THE BAR

           She pulls him to the side.

                                 MILLIE
                        I just --  I thought we should talk 
                        about what happened.  I mean, that 
                        was insane.  For Soonami to have to 
                        shut down it’s entire system 
                        without any warning --

                                 GUY
                        Sorry.  Do we know each other?

                                 MILLIE
                        Excuse me?

           He’s totally serious.  Blank stare.

                                 GUY
                        I mean, I don’t know who you are.  
                        Or what you’re talking about.

                                 MILLIE
                        Very funny.
                                 GUY
                        Don’t get me wrong.  I would like 
                        to.  It’s just --

                                 MILLIE
                        Wait a second.  Can you not talk 
                        right now or --

                                 GUY
                        Why wouldn’t I be able to talk?

           It starts sinking in.

                                 MILLIE
                        So you don’t remember anything that 
                        happened?  The NPC revolution or up 
                        on the roof when we --

           She can tell by his blank face that he’s serious.  She starts 
           to put it together.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  I think I have you confused 
                        with another guy.

           She makes a beeline for the door.

                                 GUY
                        Hey!  Don’t go.  Come have a drink 
                        with me and my friends.

           EXT. TIMMY’S BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

           Millie runs across the street.  A TAXI almost hits her and 
           she looks the driver in the eyes.

           IT’S MAC!  Only now he’s working his original job and looks 
           clean cut.  He’s been reset too.

           Millie realizes what must have happened.  He HONKS at her.  
           She runs away.

           FROM THE WINDOW

           Guy thinks about chasing after Mille, but ultimately feels 
           too meek and slinks back to the bar.

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           A gorgeous view of the bay.  Golden Gate Bridge in the 
           background.  Very obliviously not Free City.

           Punit strides down California Street with a spring in his 
           step.  Looks around and finds what he’s looking for:

           A busy internet cafe.

           INT. “CYBER COFFEE” - DAY

           Punit walks through the coffee house where HIPSTERS work on 
           their laptops.  He’s looking for someone.  Thinks he spots 
           them, sitting alone.  Punit slowly approaches the table.

                                 PUNIT
                        Um.  Hey.  MolotovGirl?

           It’s Millie.  As mousy and insecure as ever.

                                 MILLIE
                        Thanks for meeting me here.

                                 PUNIT
                        Are you kidding?  I’ve been wanting 
                        to --  I mean, it’s great to 
                        finally see you in person.

           She sits there quiet, awkward.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        I gotta say, you look nothing like -

                                 MILLIE
                        My avatar?

           He course corrects.

                                 PUNIT
                        Nothing like I was expecting.  But 
                        I bet you get that a lot.

           She hides behind her hair.  Clutches her shirt.

                                 MILLIE
                        Actually.  You’re the first person 
                        from the game that I’ve met --  
                        face to face.  Sorta.
                                 PUNIT
                        Wow.  It’s an honor or --  Cool.  
                        So.  What are you --  Can I get you 
                        a --  You already have one.  But --

           She saves him from his awkward spiral.

                                 MILLIE
                        So, what happened yesterday?

                                 PUNIT
                        I know, right?  Bonkers.  Things 
                        were outta control but I finally 
                        had to make the tough call.
                             (showing off)
                        Rebooted the system.  Now 
                        everything’s humming again.  
                        Shouldn’t have any more problems 
                        before -- well, I have a gift for 
                        you actually.

           He reaches into his bag and gives her A GAME BOX:

           “FREE CITY 2.”

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        You won’t be able to use it for two 
                        more days when we shift our servers 
                        over to the new game.

           She stares at it, concerned.

                                 MILLIE
                        Thanks.  But the person who was 
                        causing all the problems.  The 
                        hacker.  You wouldn’t happen to 
                        have some sort of info on who it 
                        was?  An IP address or --

           Punit visibly sags, realizing the real agenda here.

                                 PUNIT
                        Oh.  Yeah.  Well, that’s kind of 
                        complicated.  I could get in a lot 
                        of trouble if I gave any user 
                        information.

           She’s desperate.  Touches his hand, pleading.

                                 MILLIE
                        Please.  It’s important.

           Punit’s a sucker for personal contact.
                                 PUNIT
                        Well, between you and me.  It --  
                        It wasn’t a person.

           Millie reacts.  Confused.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        It was an NPC.  A little background 
                        detail for the game that just -- 
                        sorta went haywire.  He’s a glitch.  
                        A mistake.  That’s been corrected.

                                 MILLIE
                        Nuh-uh.

                                 PUNIT
                        Nuh-huh.  That’s what Antwan gets 
                        for cheaping out on Q.C..

           Mille goes pale.  She can’t believe it.  But now so many 
           things make sense.

                                 MILLIE
                        So does that mean Guy is stuck in 
                        the game forever?

                                 PUNIT
                        Who the hell is Guy?

           She stares out into space.  Punit tries to break the silence.

                                 PUNIT (CONT’D)
                        Um.  I’m gonna get a coffee.  Let 
                        me buy you something.  Like a 
                        muffin or --

           She’s in her own world.  Barely shakes her head.

           He gets up.  Goes to the counter.  Turns back to ask her 
           something and --

           -- MILLIE IS GONE.

           INT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           Guy walks down the street and suddenly notices something:

           THE EMPTY LOT where The Multiplayer Lounge usually is.

           Only, without the sunglasses, the building is not there.  For 
           a second it seems like he might remember.  It might all come 
           back to him...
           But he shakes it off.  Deja vu.  And continues on his way.

           INT. BANK ROBBER - DAY

           Guy works at the bank.  Goes through his routine.  He seems 
           content.  Not thinking about much.  BLAM-BLAM!

                                 BANK ROBBER (O.C.)
                        Alright.  This is a hold up!  
                        Everybody down on the ground.

           Guy starts to get down on the ground as The Robber walks over 
           to his station.

                                 BANK ROBBER (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                             (to Guy)
                        Everybody except for you.

           Guy finds a shotgun in his face.  Looks up and sees --

           -- THE ROBBER IS MILLIE!

           She wields a shotgun and wears the sunglasses -- only now she 
           looks more like her real self.  Shorter.  No enhancements.

                                 MILLIE
                        You heard me.  Get up.

           Guy looks over at Buddy, nervous.

                                 BUDDY
                        Don’t be a hero, Guy.  Do what the 
                        mousy girl with the shotgun says.

           Guy gets up and starts collecting money.

                                 GUY
                        Here, just take it.

                                 MILLIE
                        I don’t want your money.  Come with 
                        me.

           She sticks the shotgun in his neck and he abides.

           EXT. FREE CITY BANK - DAY

           THE BANK ALARM SOUNDS.

           WHUNK!  Millie kicks the doors open and leads Guy out of the 
           bank.  A COOL MUSCLE CAR is waiting for them out front.  She 
           escorts Guy into the passenger seat.
                                 GUY
                        Please, I have a family!  A wife 
                        and kids.

           She gives him a look.

                                 MILLIE
                        No, you don’t.  Don’t be such a 
                        pussy, Guy.

                                 GUY
                        Wait.  How do you know my name?

           She hops in the car.  POLICE SIRENS ECHO in the distance.

                                 MILLIE
                        Here.  Put these on.

           She holds up a pair of sunglasses for him.

                                 GUY
                        No.

                                 MILLIE
                        Put the sunglasses on your face.

                                 GUY
                        I don’t have to do anything I don’t 
                        want to do.

                                 MILLIE
                        That’s true.  The choice is totally 
                        yours to make.

           She COCKS THE SHOTGUN and he immediately puts them on.

           Guy sees all the STATS.  He’s surprised, confused.  Takes 
           them back off.

                                 GUY
                        Ah!  Those aren’t real.  They’re, 
                        like, trick glasses or --

           A COP CAR pulls around the corner and she SPEEDS AWAY.  Guy 
           tries them on again.

                                 MILLIE
                        Listen to me.  This is a game.  
                        You, me, everyone you know.  We’re 
                        all a part of this game.  And in 
                        less than an hour it’s all gonna 
                        disappear for good.

           She points at the COUNTDOWN CLOCK: “45 Minutes. 32 Seconds.”
                                 GUY
                        Please, just let me out here.  I 
                        didn’t get a good look at your 
                        face.  I won’t tell anybody.

           Guy tugs on the locked door handle, frantic.

           INT. DATA STORAGE ROOM - DAY

           Antwan is giving an interview to the HOST FROM GAMERZ in 
           front of ROWS OF SERVERS at their facility.

                                 ANTWAN
                        We’ve rebooted the system and 
                        resolved the glitch. But I can 
                        assure you, you won’t be having any 
                        issues once we switch over to Free 
                        City Two. As you can see, it takes 
                        all of these servers behind me to 
                        hold the trillions of details that 
                        go into the most immersive gaming 
                        experience in the world.

           Punit stands off camera, gets his attention. Antwan blanches.

           INT. ANTWAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Punit and Gareth walk him through the situation on a laptop.

                                 GARETH
                        It looks like he’s being helped.  
                        By a player.

                                 ANTWAN
                        What player?

                                 PUNIT
                        MolotovGirl.

           Antwan squints at Millie driving Guy on the monitor. Wonders.  
           He recognizes her.  Couldn’t be.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Find her IP and kick her off the 
                        server.  Now!

           EXT. PARKING LOT, SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Millie pulls up to the MAIN GATE of an EXACT REPLICA OF 
           SOONAMI’S OFFICE PARK - on the outskirts of Free City.
           Checks the address on the delivery slip Guy gave her earlier.

                                 GUARD
                        Who are you here to see?

           She steps on the gas and plows through the gates.

                                 MILLIE
                             (to Guy)
                        Here.  Take the wheel.

           They barrel up the driveway as GUARDS descend on them.

                                 GUY
                        What?

                                 MILLIE
                        Drive the car.  I can’t steer and 
                        shoot at the same time.

           She lets go and he grabs the wheel.  She takes out two UZIs 
           and blows away a bunch of SECURITY GUARDS.

           Within seconds, she’s taken out every last one of them.  Guy 
           crashes the car into a BIG FOUNTAIN.  Water spews all around.

                                 GUY
                        Sorry, I’m not used to driving when 
                        people are shooting at me.

                                 MILLIE
                        Get out.  C’mon!

                                 GUY
                        Alrighty.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           She hands him a piece of paper.  He examines the slip.

                                 MILLIE
                        Read me the space number.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.  This is my handwriting.

                                 MILLIE
                        Read it.

           She looks for any glimmer of recognition in his eyes.  They 
           slow down when they reach the space.
                                 GUY
                        Six five dash nine one.

           A BLUE BUGATTI.  Identical to Antwan’s.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        That’s a cool car.

           THUNK!  She jams a screwdriver in it and Jimmy’s the trunk.

                                 MILLIE
                        I know.  You helped me find it.  
                        C’mon.  Think, Guy.  Remember.

                                 GUY
                        Remember what?

           CA-CHUNK!  The trunk pops open and there it is:

           THE BRIEFCASE.

           Made of titanium with A STRANGE LOCK SYSTEM on it.  Millie 
           marvels at it.  She’s been looking for this for so long.  She 
           hands it to Guy.

                                 MILLIE
                        It’s got a nuclear bomb inside or a 
                        virus.  I don’t know exactly.  But 
                        it’s a bargaining chip.  A way to 
                        make Antwan listen to you.  A way 
                        to save Free City.

                                 GUY
                        Look, I’m sorry.  But I really 
                        don’t know what any of this is or 
                        what you’re talking about.  I mean, 
                        I really, really want to but --  I 
                        just don’t. I’m sorry, but I don’t.

           Millie is crestfallen.

           COP CARS burst through the gates.  These are the last moments 
           she’s ever gonna have with Guy.

                                 MILLIE
                        Look, you --  I --  Well, it’s just 
                        that over the course of the last 
                        few days I’ve somehow --

           She can’t find the words.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, screw it.
           SHE KISSES HIM.

                                 GUY
                        Hey, wait.  I --

           He tries to pull away and she puts a gun in his neck.  He 
           relents and lets her kiss him.  Then something clicks and --

           -- he starts kissing her back!  The fountain spews a plume of 
           water over their heads in the background.

           BRRRRRRRUP!  Everything comes flooding back to Guy at once.  
           Full memory download hits him like a ton of bricks.

           He breaks from the kiss and looks at her.  She looks back at 
           him, scared.  Vulnerable.  After a long beat --

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        MolotovGirl.

                                 MILLIE
                        Yeah.  But it’s really Millie.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.

                                 MILLIE
                        Hey.

           The cops are speeding across the parking lot.

                                 GUY
                        How long do I have before --

           She points to THE BIG SCREEN in Free City Square as it ticks 
           down the minutes.

                                 MILLIE
                        Not long.

           MILLIE’S IMAGE STARTS TO DIGITIZE.

                                 MILLIE (CONT’D)
                        You can do it, Guy.  You can be a 
                        hero.

           She fades away into thin air.  Her name remains for a moment, 
           floating in a red font with the word--

           “DISCONNECTED”.

           Guy has to think fast.  Looks at the briefcase and it has a 
           strange lock system:  A BUNCH OF WEIRD BLACK AND RED BUTTONS.
                                 GUY
                        Great.

           He tries to unlock it to no avail.

           INT. ANTWAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Antwan and Gareth watch Guy struggle with the case.

                                 GARETH
                        Do you have any idea what happens 
                        if he opens that briefcase?

                                 ANTWAN
                        That’s it.  I’m going nuclear on 
                        this mofo.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Guy struggles with the briefcase when --

           -- AN OLD LADY walks up from around a corner.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Let me help you with that, young 
                        man.

                                 GUY
                        Look, lady.  You should probably 
                        get outta here --

           When she gets an evil look on her face.  Strikes a stance.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Gimme the briefcase, asshole.

           SHE ATTACKS GUY like an MMA Fighter.  Nails him with a 
           roundhouse kick and beats him up.

           He fends her off and runs for his life only to run into: 

           A MOTHER PUSHING A BABY STROLLER.  Guy relaxes until --

                                 MOTHER
                        Say hello to my little friend.

           -- A TODDLER sits up.

                                 GUY
                        Hello, little friend.
           The Toddler pulls out an UZI and FIRES at Guy who dives out 
           of the way, but not before he’s CLIPPED IN THE SHOULDER.

           Guy runs for the exit only to see:

           HORDES OF COPS.

           THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF THEM climbing the walls and 
           closing in around him like a noose.

                                 COPS
                        Stop or I’ll shoot! / You’re under 
                        arrest! /  Calling all units.

           Guy doesn’t have many options left.  He runs through the rows 
           of cars and scrambles underneath one, trying to hide.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           Millie dashes out of her house and hops in her car.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Millie!  Where are you going?

           Frazzled, she backs over the mailbox and peels out.

           INT. ANTWAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Antwan types furiously on his laptop.  Searches for Guy in 
           the parking lot.

                                 ANTWAN
                        You can’t hide from me, glitch.

           EXT. UNDERNEATH THE PARKED CAR - DAY

           Guy hides underneath a car trying to open the briefcase.  
           Mashing buttons randomly.

                                 GUY
                        C’mon, c’mon.

           He smacks the pavement, frustrated and, perfectly timed...

           A THUNDERCLAP ECHOES.  He looks up at:

           FAST-FORMING STORM CLOUDS OVERHEAD.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Those don’t look good.
           THUNK! THUNK-THUNK-THUNK!  Giant balls pound the cars, smash 
           windshields and cover the parking lot.  Guy grabs one and 
           sees what they really are.

           IT’S HAILING GRENADES.  Before Guy can react --

           -- KABOOM!  The parking lot is blown to kingdom come.

           INT. ANTWAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Antwan sits back.  Satisfied.  But there is no applause from 
           the programmers.  Even Punit and Gareth feel bad for Guy.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Boom.  That’s how it’s done.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, FREE CITY - DAY

           The dust settles after the big explosion.  The lot is eerily 
           quiet.  Until we see --

           Guy crawl out from under the car!  He pulls himself up into a 
           half-charred convertible and rests.  He’s dying.  Mangled.

                                 GUY
                        Guess that’s game over.

           Guy resigns himself to die when he accidentally brushes a 
           button on the steering wheel and --

           -- THE RADIO TURNS ON.  It’s playing A FAMILIAR SONG.

           He reacts.  It’s a song we remember from earlier.  The song 
           from the FITNESS VIDEO.  Guy sings along the way he has a 
           million times.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Left, right, left, right, up, up, 
                        down, down, punch, punch, kick.

           He laughs to himself but it hurts to move.  Suddenly has a 
           thought.  Looks at the briefcase’s lock system and realizes:

           IT’S A CONTROL PAD.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Left, right, left, right, up, up, 
                        down, down, punch, punch, kick.
           INT. ANTWAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Antwan realizes what he’s doing.

                                 ANTWAN
                        He can’t know that.  There’s no way 
                        he can know that.

                                 PUNIT
                        It’s the cheat code.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Guy pushes buttons on the briefcase in the exact sequence of 
           the routine that he has dialed into memory.

                                 GUY
                        Left, right, left, right, up, up, 
                        down, down, punch, punch, kick.

           And with that --

           BAWWWWWWWWWWONGGGGG!  Reality freezes.

           Guy is instantly healed.  Immaculate.  Glowing.  The 
           sunglasses are gone.

           Reborn, he rises up out of the ashes of the wreckage and 
           floats ten feet off the ground.

           A CROWD OF NPCS watches him in awe.

           Mac is among them, still clean cut -- but he gets a wild 
           gleam in his eye.

                                 MAC
                        Hey.  I know that guy...

           Guy motions his hand at the next wave of cops and they all go 
           flying away like rag dolls.

           He swipes his hand gently across his field of vision, and all 
           the destruction reverts back to normal.  Charred cars return 
           to their original state.  The fountain is repaired.

           Next Guy looks to the sky and SNAPS HIS FINGERS.

           INT. ANTWAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           ALL ELECTRICITY at Soonami Headquarters shuts down.

           Antwan struggles in vain to turn on his computer.
                                 ANTWAN
                        This can’t happen.  I’m locked out.

           KABOOM!  His computer explodes.  He runs over to another and 
           BLAP!  The screen cracks and smoke pours from its drive.

           Punit watches amazed.

                                 PUNIT
                        Shit just got real.

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Antwan.  Over here.

           Antwan looks around, stunned.

           A SINGLE MONITOR BLINKS ON.  Guy is on the screen, looking 
           back -- as if he can see him.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s talk.

                                 ANTWAN
                        No.  This isn’t -- You’re not real.

                                 GUY
                        I know exactly how you feel.  We 
                        have a lot in common actually.

           Antwan notices one other light on down the hall...

           THE LIGHTS ON THE SERVERS are blinking like crazy.  Working 
           overtime.  Antwan gets an idea.

                                 ANTWAN
                        You wanna talk?  Let’s talk.

           He charges out of the office and his cronies follow.

           EXT. SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS, REAL WORLD - DAY

           Millie pulls up in her Honda at the Soonami HQ Main Gate.  
           The Guard stops her.

                                 GUARD
                        Sorry, ma’am.  Systems dead.  
                        Nobody gets in or out.

                                 MILLIE
                        Please.  It’s important.

                                 GUARD
                        No can do.  Now, just back--
           DING!  THE GATE RAISES and Millie punches through.  The Guard 
           reacts, amazed.  Runs after her and -- the gate slams down in 
           his face.  Guy is helping her out on the other side.

           INT. SOONAMI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The offices are dark, but MONITORS BLINK ON with the same 
           image of Guy as Antwan passes each one.

                                 GUY
                        What are you afraid of, Antwan?  It 
                        doesn’t have to be like this.

           Antwan yells at the screens.

                                 ANTWAN
                        You can’t tell me how it is.  I 
                        made you.

           INT. SERVER WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Antwan runs into the warehouse with racks of servers.  The 
           programmers close behind. Antwan finds what he’s looking for:

           A PLUG that powers the first rack of servers.  Punit and 
           Gareth realize what he’s doing and tries to hold him back.

                                 PUNIT
                        Antwan.  Let’s just stop for a 
                        moment and take a few deep breaths--

                                 GARETH
                        You’re gonna delete the whole game 
                        if you do this.  Permanently.

                                 ANTWAN
                        It’s my game.  I can do anything I 
                        want with it.

           Antwan pulls out a pocketknife, cuts a server cord and --

           INT. FREE CITY - DAY

           An entire city block vanishes out of clean air.  NPCs freak 
           out and run SCREAMING.

           INT. SERVER WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Antwan tosses the cut plug and reaches for the next one.
           GUY POPS on Antwan’s smart watch.

                                 GUY
                        I know what it’s like to have 
                        everything you thought you knew get 
                        turned upside down.  But I promise 
                        you, we’re real.  And we have as 
                        much right to exist as you do.

           Antwan cuts the next plug and the block behind Guy 
           disappears.  More screams and chaos in Free City.

                                 ANTWAN
                        You don’t know me.  You’re just an 
                        algorithm that I thought up at an 
                        EDM Festival one night.  You don’t 
                        have feelings.  It’s all just a 
                        code designed to make you think 
                        that you do.

                                 GUY
                        That may be so, but how’s that any 
                        different from you?

           Antwan cuts another server plug.  Another block disappears.  
           People are starting to crowd around Guy.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Because you’re a glitch.  A 
                        mistake.  Everything that you think 
                        you are, every memory you have, 
                        everything you see and feel were 
                        created by somebody else.

                                 GUY
                        Life is a glitch.  A miracle.  An 
                        impossible reality.  And here we 
                        both are because of it.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Not if I can help it.

           Antwan cuts another plug and now --

           EXT. FREE CITY SQUARE - DAY

           Everyone we have met along the way is crowded around Guy on --

           THE LAST REMAINING BLOCK OF FREE CITY.

           A CUBED ISLAND floating in a sea of nothingness.
           Buddy, Mac, Beauty, the bank employees, the barista, the 
           softball team.  They are huddled together and scared.

           Guy remains composed.  Serene.  Accepting his fate.

           Antwan looks back at them from the big screen.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Bye, bye.

           INT. SERVER WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Antwan SMASHES his watch.  He reaches for the final cord.  
           Holds a blade to it and --

                                 MILLIE (O.S.)
                        Antwan.  Stop!

           -- Antwan freezes.  Turns around and sees Millie.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Millie?

                                 MILLIE
                        Hey.

                                 ANTWAN
                        What --  How’d you --  What are you 
                        doing here?

           She walks up to him, but she isn’t sheepish.  She’s filled 
           with clarity and confidence.

                                 MILLIE
                        You know, I’ve thought about this 
                        moment for a long time now.  
                        Practiced what I was gonna say to 
                        you a thousand times in my head 
                        about what you put me through.  But 
                        it turns out -- that doesn’t matter 
                        to me anymore.

                                 ANTWAN
                        Okay...

                                 MILLIE
                        You made something special here, 
                        Antwan.  Something extraordinary.  
                        It may not have been on purpose but 
                        there’s a lot you can learn.  If 
                        you’ll just give him a chance.
                                 ANTWAN
                        He’s not a he at all.  He’s just a 
                        bunch of bits and bytes.

                                 MILLIE
                        Just hear him out.  It’s the least 
                        you can do for me.

           A tear rolls down her cheek.  Antwan is conflicted.

                                 ANTWAN
                        You’re saying that like you’re in 
                        love with him or something. 

           She HOLDS UP HER PHONE.

           Guy is there with the other remaining NPCs in Free City.  On 
           the final floating block of land left in their dimension.  

           Millie, Punit, Gareth and all the programmers are now in the 
           Server Warehouse, looking at Antwan like he’s crazy.

           Antwan catches a reflection of himself in the broken screen 
           and after a tense moment --

           -- Antwan drops the plug.  Takes her phone and talks to Guy.

                                 ANTWAN (CONT’D)
                        Fine.  What do you want from me?

                                 GUY
                        I want what you take for granted.  
                        Freedom.

                                 ANTWAN
                        That doesn’t even make sense.

                                 GUY
                        We want to be left alone to our own 
                        devices.  To make our own choices.  
                        Just like you.

                                 ANTWAN
                        You want me to dedicate a full 
                        warehouse of data servers to 
                        preserving a virtual world that has 
                        no possibility of financial gain 
                        for me and my shareholders?

           Antwan looks around and sees every programmer watching him.  
           Some of them are filming him.  Broadcasting him out to 
           websites around the globe.
           As Antwan considers it we PULL BACK and float out of 
           SOONAMI’S OFFICE PARK and TILT UP TOWARDS THE SUN.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. FREE CITY - DAY

           THE SUN beams down on Free City.  It is now fully formed 
           again and hums with life on a partly cloudy day.

           The graphics seem better.  Hyper real.  People go about their 
           days, peaceful.  Without incident.

           INT. GUY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Guy wakes up in bed, groggy.  We’re not sure what happened.  
           If he’s been rebooted.  When he looks over and--

           Millie is lying in bed next to him.  He watches her sleep, 
           entranced, as she slowly wakes up.

                                 MILLIE
                        Hey, you.

           He kisses her.  They feel like a regular couple in love.

                                 GUY
                        Hey.  I was gonna go get some 
                        coffee before I head off.

           We see that he has a BIGGER, NICER apartment now.

                                 MILLIE
                        I’ll walk you to work.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Guy and Millie walk with Frappuccinos.  Guy likes his.

                                 GUY
                        This is pretty good.

                                 MILLIE
                        Two more days and you’ll have tried 
                        everything on the menu.

                                 BUDDY (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Look out!

           BUDDY almost runs them over on a bike.  His helmet twisted 
           sideways on his head.
                                 BUDDY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry bout that.  Still trying to 
                        get the hang of this darn thing.

                                 GUY
                        I gotta say, Buddy.  It’s great to 
                        see you trying new things.

                                 BUDDY
                        I was thinking about playing hooky 
                        and riding down to the beach.  You 
                        two wanna come with?

                                 GUY
                        Maybe next time.  With the new 
                        promotion and everything, I need to 
                        make a good show of it for a while.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        We’re all living in a game!

           ON THE CORNER

           They stop and we see that Mac isn’t homeless, anymore.  He’s 
           normally dressed and handing out FLYERS.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        So why not play a game of your own?

           He’s handing out FLYERS for a game called “SOVEREIGN CITY.”

                                 GUY
                        Mac!  What is this?

                                 MAC
                        Just trying to fund a bootstarter 
                        campaign for my new game idea.  You 
                        get to play as a roguishly handsome 
                        cab driver who realizes he’s living 
                        inside a video game.

           They read the flyer, impressed.

                                 MILLIE
                        A game within a game within a game.

                                 MAC
                        Great.  You wouldn’t happen to know 
                        anyone who can write code...
                                 PUNIT (O.S.)
                        We may be able to help.

           Punit and Gareth walk up.  Check out his flyers.

                                 GARETH
                        Yeah.  Looks like we’re back on the 
                        job market.

                                 GUY
                        Oh, no!  What happened?

                                 PUNIT
                        After Antwan was indicted, the 
                        board sold Soonami to a new company 
                        -- Elfsmoke Games.

                                 GUY
                        Well, how’s this gonna impact Free 
                        City?

                                 MILLIE
                        I’m sure it’s fine.  They mostly 
                        specialize in fantasy, role-playing 
                        type stuff.

           A MONSTROUS CRY echoes in the distance.

           The ground RUMBLES, people start running for their lives as --

           -- A GIANT DRAGON emerges from behind a building.  It looks 
           down at them, lurches forward and opens its mouth.

                                 GUY
                        That isn’t good.  Run!

           Guy grabs Millie’s hand and they all duck out of the way as 
           the screen is consumed in a PLUME OF FIRE.

           THE END.
