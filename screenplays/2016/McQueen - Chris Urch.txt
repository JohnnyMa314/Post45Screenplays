           From a BLACK SCREEN

           We’re in the middle of a conversation.

                                 LEE (V.O.)
                        White socks. Discuss.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LEE MCQUEEN, 39, is staring right at us.

           He’s the smartest person in the room and he knows it.  
           Sitting at a table, with a mischievous eye he takes a drag on 
           his cigarette, smirking while continuing this filmed 
           interview...the year is 2009.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        What about them?

                                 LEE
                        About how me and my mum will be 
                        like walking somewhere -

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Walking where?

                                 LEE
                        Like, I dunno, like round 
                        Woolworths or something.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Okay -

                                 LEE
                        Yeah, and every time we reach the 
                        checkout she’ll spot someone 
                        wearing a pair. Like sock 
                        spotting’s become her fucking sport 
                        or something. And the next thing, 
                        see you know it don’t you?

           The screen blurs as the camera pulls in and out of focus.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Next thing you know, she’s pointing 
                        at the fucker, cause she likes to 
                        prove her point with a fucking
                        point. 

           The camera pulls sharply back into focus on LEE.
                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Only then she turns to me, turns 
                        and says ‘Lee. Never trust a man 
                        who wears white socks.’ 

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        I’m wearing a pair right now.

                                 LEE
                        Guess you’re proving her point.

           Pleased with himself LEE takes another cheeky smoke.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        I didn’t ask her here so you might 
                        trust me again.

                                 LEE
                        Is that right?

           LEE puts out his cigarette.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        The first time we met you asked me 
                        to record the real you and you’re 
                        never more real than when you’re 
                        with your mum.

                                 LEE
                        Are we okay with the sound?

           LEE takes a sip of his tea.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Sound is fine. Can we run starter 
                        questions while we wait for her?

                                 LEE
                        You can try.

           LEE sparks up another cigarette as the frame on LEE closes in 
           a little.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        What’s the most expensive thing 
                        you’ve ever stolen?

           LEE thinks for a moment. Tired, rubbing his face with his 
           palm. It’s been a long day.

                                 LEE
                        Someone’s heart.
                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        How many times have you been in 
                        love?

                                 LEE
                        One and a half.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Would you say you enjoy your work?

                                 LEE
                        Rarely.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Do you think it gives you meaning?

                                 LEE
                        Does yours?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Sometimes.

                                 LEE
                        Mine does when it’s good. Only when 
                        it’s good.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        What would you like your legacy to 
                        be?

                                 LEE
                        I haven’t thought about it.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Are you an honest person?

                                 LEE
                        No.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        What’s the biggest lie you’ve told?

                                 LEE
                        Pass.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        How would you define the truth?

           LEE contemplates this for a while before taking one last 
           inhalation on his cigarette and then exhales.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK:
                TITLE CARD

                           LONDON OCTOBER 2008

           INT. CAR - MORNING

           A rugged MIKE POULTER who looks like he hasn’t had a good 
           night’s sleep in years, sits in the back of a Mercedes driven 
           by a chauffeur. He pulls out a scrunched up woollen burgundy 
           tie from his trouser pocket and begins tying it, using the 
           reflective glass window to help guide him. As he does this, 
           we get glimpses of the rainy London streets outside as a 
           political debate plays on the radio. But MIKE’s not even 
           listening, the tie feeling ever more like a noose around his 
           neck. 

                                 POLITICIAN
                        I firmly believe the G20 conference 
                        is going to bring about some 
                        concrete action -

                                 PRESENTER
                        A summit which has been scrambled 
                        together -

                                                   PRESENTER (CONT'D)
                        POLITICIAN
           I don’t really think that’s 
           fair -
                                              A few months ago. Tell me, 
                                              why pump trillions of pounds 
                                              into the system to bail out 
                                              the banks when some would 
                                              claim they’re socially 
                                              useless?

                                 POLITICIAN
                        Fundamentally, when markets seize 
                        up the only people who can show 
                        leadership to build confidence is 
                        governments -

                                 PRESENTER
                        It’s going to be the tax payer who 
                        bails out the banks though isn’t 
                        that right?

           The DRIVER turns the radio down. We see his eyes in the 
           rearview mirror.

                                 CHAUFFEUR
                        First day then?

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe.
           MIKE returns to looking out the window. 

           INT. STAIRWAY UP TO MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           We follow MIKE as he climbs three flights of rickety stairs. 
           Through a door comes a group of men carrying boxes. From 
           within we can hear muffled studio noise. MIKE grabs the door 
           and walks into the studio with the door shutting behind him.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           We are hit by a wall of music and noise as we follow tight 
           behind MIKE as he’s lead through a frantic working studio by 
           a female assistant whom we never really see.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           MIKE sits awkwardly a few meters away from a giant stuffed 
           polar bear. He puts his attention on all the comings and 
           goings of the studio which intrigue him. 

           Technicians sewing at machines. Boxes being packed, sealed 
           and taken away by assistants. Other designers sitting at 
           their desks sketching, others work at computers with their 
           earphones in while two employees randomly play a rally of 
           table tennis in the corner.

           MIKE becomes increasingly aware that some of the staff are 
           observing him and discreetly passing judgement. They know why 
           he’s there and evidently isn’t what they were expecting. 

           Feeling he’s dressed a little too formally MIKE self-
           consciously takes off his tie, stashing it in his pocket, at 
           which point a line of staff begin filing past MIKE into the 
           room behind him. 

           Wondering what to do MIKE gets up from the chair and files in 
           behind them into -

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           A room filled with employees. 

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        ‘This one allowed us to see beyond 
                        the sensationalist presentation -

           MIKE politely navigates his way through the employees as we 
           hear SARAH BURTON’S Macclesfield voice reading a review.
                                 SARAH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And fully appreciate the beauty of 
                        the clothes...’

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        However? 

           MIKE sees an unassuming SARAH BURTON, Lee’s right hand woman 
           and most trusted advisor, holding a newspaper from which she 
           reads.

                                 SARAH
                        ‘However, so used to drama are we 
                        at McQueen that some of us left 
                        feeling as though we hadn’t quite 
                        seen it all. Where were the 
                        fireworks and nightmare inducing 
                        sound tracks we have come to 
                        expect?’

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        What did The Guardian say?

           MIKE moves again to try to get a better view. There is an 
           awkward tension in the room which makes MIKE feel slightly 
           uncomfortable, like a voyeur who shouldn’t be privy to this 
           information.

           In between the gaps of people he gets a glimpse of CAMILLA, 
           head stylist, extremely thin, always dressed in black, 
           holding The Guardian newspaper.

                                 CAMILLA (O.S.)
                        ‘If you want a dress that is 
                        gorgeous enough to break your heart 
                        and unnerving enough to send a 
                        shiver down your spine, McQueen's 
                        your man - ‘

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        But?

           CAMILLA feels slightly unnerved about continuing yet does so.

                                 CAMILLA
                        But for a coherent plan to save the 
                        planet? Looks like the search 
                        continues.

           MIKE finally gets a better view and glimpses LEE MCQUEEN. 
           He’s wearing baggy jeans, a white vest, and a red checkered, 
           flannel shirt and is casually smoking a cigarette whilst 
           perched on top of a chair. 
           The team nervously look for his reaction while LEE scans the 
           room. He spots MIKE.

                                 LEE
                        Who’s up for shopping?

           INT. CHARITY SHOP - DAY

           We’re inside a very traditional British Charity shop. Pokey, 
           musty, badly decorated with rails of clothes scattered 
           around. Shelves stacked with books and random ornaments line 
           the walls. Two of Lee’s dogs, JUICE and CALLUM, can be seen 
           through the glass front door, tied up outside.

           Deep in thought, LEE sifts through a rail of clothes which 
           act as a barrier between himself and MIKE, who is stood on 
           the other side, unsure of what he should be doing. A radio 
           plays in the background.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you always do that?

           LEE ignores MIKE.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Read your reviews?

           LEE keeps his head down searching through the rail.

                                 LEE
                        You have to rummage deep. They like 
                        to mix all the good stuff in with 
                        the crap.

           MIKE starts looking through some of the clothes and stock on 
           the shelves.

                                 MIKE
                        What is it you’re looking for?

                                 LEE
                        Not sure yet.

           LEE wanders over to another rail of clothes. MIKE follows 
           him.

                                 MIKE
                        The err...e-mail you sent -

                                 LEE
                        What about it?
                                 MIKE
                        It didn’t specify what the job was.

                                 LEE
                        You’re a photographer?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 LEE
                        You know what I do?

                                 MIKE
                        A little.

                                 LEE
                        What’s your thoughts on this?

           LEE holds up a black and white jumper resembling a Viennetta. 

           MIKE stares blankly at the jumper. Unsure of what to say.

                                 MIKE
                        I think whoever wore that never got 
                        laid.

           EXT. CANAL ISLINGTON - DAY

           The two men walk side by side along the rain soaked pavement. 
           LEE walks his two dogs on their leads and has the jumper from 
           the previous scene wrapped round his shoulders.

                                 LEE
                        It’s like everything you are is 
                        informed by where you’re from, 
                        isn’t it? Like what your upbringing 
                        is, those influences early on. 

                                 MIKE
                        So what’s your dad do for a living?

                                 LEE
                        Cab driver.

           Both men walk around a giant puddle.

                                 MIKE
                        And have you got any siblings?

                                 LEE
                        Five. Three sisters, two brothers.
                                 MIKE
                        And what do your brothers do?

                                 LEE
                        One’s a bricklayer, other one’s a 
                        cabbie.

                                 MIKE
                        So then growing up chances are 
                        what? He probably looked at your 
                        dad and thought, yeah, that’s what 
                        I should do. That’s the precedent 
                        that’s been set?

                                 LEE
                        Maybe.

                                 MIKE
                        But you didn’t did you? So why’s 
                        that?

                                 LEE
                        Because I’m a fucking anarchist 
                        mate.

           EXT. PARK - DAY 

           JUICE and CALLUM are play fighting in the park, while MIKE 
           and LEE sit on a pair of swings watching them.

                                 LEE
                        I like how you get to know the 
                        people you photograph and film. 
                        It’s like you get under their skin. 
                        You go to all these war zones, see 
                        all these fucking awful things and 
                        you seem to really try and 
                        understand them, record them 
                        truthfully. And I fucking rate 
                        that. For me that’s what sets you 
                        apart from other photojournalists. 
                        JUICE!

           LEE throws a giant stick to his dogs and continues watching 
           them play.

                                 MIKE
                        You should know I’ve little 
                        interest in fashion.

                                 LEE
                        And what makes you think I do? 
           JUICE returns with the stick. LEE throws it again.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny I was telling my mum I 
                        was meeting you and she reminded 
                        me, and I swear this is the god’s 
                        honest truth, I always wanted to do 
                        what you do.

                                 MIKE
                        But you didn’t.

           This stings LEE a little. LEE scrambles for his packet of 
           cigarettes, sticking one in his mouth.

                                 LEE
                        No...No, guess it was always gonna 
                        be fashion. Well either that or 
                        synchronized swimming.

           He offers the pack to MIKE.

                                 MIKE
                        Given up.

                                 LEE
                        You mind if I -

           MIKE shakes his head as LEE lights the cigarette.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        I used to go when I was eight.

           He exhales the smoke.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Only boy there, fat as fuck, like I 
                        was a big lad, but an excellent 
                        swimmer. 

                                 MIKE
                        Why d’you stop?

                                 LEE
                        Well one time before practice, I 
                        royally fucked up this back flip. 
                        Missed the water by about this 
                        much. Landed face first on the 
                        cement slabs.

                                 MIKE
                        Ouch.
                                 LEE
                        Yeah, never went back after that. 
                        Mind you, I now know why I was such 
                        a good swimmer.

                                 MIKE
                        Why’s that?

                                 LEE
                        Fat kids are more buoyant.

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           LEE and MIKE sit opposite one another at a table in an old 
           school greasy spoon. In front of them are two cups of tea and 
           some plates. They’ve both had a fry up but MIKE has only 
           eaten half of his. Every now and then LEE feeds scraps to his 
           dogs who sit by him on the floor.

                                 LEE
                        I’d be commissioning you to 
                        document the new collection. The 
                        process. Not the clothes but what 
                        makes the clothes. You would be the 
                        first person to have ever been 
                        allowed this kind of access.

                                 MIKE
                        So, why now?

                                 LEE
                        It’s our fifteenth anniversary so 
                        it seems like the right time. 

                                 MIKE
                        And what would it be for? An 
                        exhibition? A book? 

                                 LEE
                        Maybe, or in the end it might just 
                        be for me. 

                                 MIKE
                        So this is some kind of vanity 
                        project?

                                 LEE
                        No. Not at all. Like I said, I’ve 
                        been doing this for fifteen 
                        years...

           Lee struggles to find the words. He seems tired all of a 
           sudden. 
                                 MIKE
                        And...

                                 LEE
                        I want to see what we do. What I’ve 
                        done. But through the eyes of 
                        someone else. 

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 LEE
                        What I need right now is a little 
                        fucking objectivity. Are you done 
                        with that?

           MIKE gives LEE his plate of food. LEE scrapes the remains 
           onto his plate.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        An outside eye looking in. Some 
                        proof. 

                                 MIKE
                        Proof of what?

                                 LEE
                             (with a smile)
                        Plus I’ll pay you pretty much 
                        whatever you fucking want.

           Mike is certainly interested by Lee’s take on the project. 
           Plus the idea of money certainly doesn’t hurt. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’d need full access.

                                 LEE
                        Okay.

                                 MIKE
                        Not only to your staff and studio 
                        but your friends and family as 
                        well.

                                 LEE
                        Everything outside of the studio is 
                        irrelevant.

                                 MIKE
                        You mean everything outside is not 
                        in your control. And if that’s the 
                        case then this wont work.
           Lee smiles. He knows he’s right. 

                                 LEE
                        Okay then. 

                                 MIKE
                        Good.

                                 LEE
                        One question though.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 LEE
                        How much do you know about me?

                                 MIKE
                        A little. 

                                 LEE
                        Have you Google’d me?

                                 MIKE
                        What will I find if I do?

                                 LEE
                        I just want you to come at this 
                        with as few preconceptions as 
                        possible. 

                                 MIKE
                        That makes sense.

                                 LEE
                        So what do you think?

           Lee offers his hand and Mike shakes it cautiously. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing tonight?

           EXT. ROWAN WALK HORNCHURCH - NIGHT 

           MIKE (carrying a six back of beer) walks past a row of 
           handsome houses, mostly detached with nicely kept front lawns 
           and two cars on their drives. It’s a very middle class 
           neighbourhood, well lit and safe. 

           MIKE turns into the driveway of a family home, with a black 
           cab parked out the front. He makes his way to the front porch 
           of the house. 
           Colourful party balloons are attached to the door and the 
           front room light is on. Muffled party noise can be heard from 
           within.

           MIKE knocks on the door, waiting a few seconds before a six 
           year old GIRL wearing a ballerina dress and a party hat opens 
           the door.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh...hello.

           The little girl runs away leaving the door ajar. MIKE walks 
           through, shutting the door behind him.

           INT. JOYCE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           MIKE makes his way through the kitchen which is filled with 
           people lost in conversation. Slightly unsure of himself he 
           makes his way over to the kitchen unit placing the beers 
           down.

           A knock on the large window in front of him reveals LEE 
           smoking and waving at MIKE. 

           LEE gestures ‘one minute’ and then disappears again. 

           MIKE tears open the box of beer and opens a can. 

           INT. JOYCE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           A hub of noise hits us as MIKE and members of the MCQUEEN 
           FAMILY including JANET (Lee’s eldest sister, 53) and JOYCE 
           (Lee’s mother, 74, a charming East End matriarch, never 
           without a fag or a cup of tea in her hand) are all sat on the 
           floor playing a game. LEE’S dogs are running around playing, 
           causing havoc.

           The only person not taking part is RON (LEE’s father, 70) 
           sitting solitary in his armchair watching the football, 
           cheering on Arsenal who are playing.

           LEE, who is also participating in the game has the GIRL (now 
           with chocolate framing her mouth) sitting on his shoulders, 
           waving a wand, casting spells.

           On each of the family’s foreheads are post-it notes with 
           names of various celebrities or iconic characters, such as 
           Margaret Thatcher, Elvis Presley, Hitler, and JAY Z (which is 
           Joyce’s). They’re all trying to guess who one another are. 
           It’s Joyce’s turn.
                                 JOYCE
                        I can’t remember if I’m a man or a 
                        woman?

                            LEE
                                                          JANET
           She’ll never get it. 
                                              Mum, you’re a man. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        How’d you know I won’t get it?

                            LEE
                                                          JANET
           Cause you’ll never get it.
                                              Come on, come on, come on.

                           JOYCE
           Just let me a think a minute 
           let me think.
                                                           LEE
                                              Is this chocolate round your 
                                              mouth?

                                 GIRL
                        It’s mud.

                            LEE
                                                          JANET
           That’s mud?
                                              Come on.

           The girl nods. LEE laughs and then tickles her, making the 
           girl scream with delight. Arsenal score and the whole room 
           erupts with cheers. RON punches the air from his armchair.

                                 RON
                        GET IN! GET IN. Did you see that? 
                        Did you see that shot?

           INT. JOYCE’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           LEE and JANET are at the kitchen counter making sandwiches. 
           Meanwhile MIKE is sat with JOYCE at the kitchen table with 
           his bottle of beer while she sits drinking her tea, 
           orchestrating things around her and eating a biscuit. From 
           time to time the odd person may come in to collect a drink, 
           bottle opener, or a snack - mild chaos.

                                 JOYCE
                        I can’t get my head round why 
                        anyone would want to put themselves 
                        in danger.

                           MIKE
                                                          JANET
           Sometimes.
                                              (To LEE)
                                              Don’t be too generous with 
                                              the butter.
           LEE blobs some butter onto Janet’s face. She hits him with a 
           tea towel laughing, it’s clear they have good camaraderie. 
           JOYCE continues talking, absorbed in her conversation with 
           MIKE.

                                    JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t be able to sleep at 
                        night if that was me. 

                                 LEE
                        Lucky it’s not you then isn’t it?

                                 MIKE
                        How long have you and Ron lived 
                        here? It’s a lovely house.

                                 JOYCE
                        Been in Hornchurch few years now. 
                        In Stratford before.

                                 LEE
                        She didn’t want to move -

                           JOYCE
           That’s not true. Don’t listen 
           to him.
                                                      LEE (CONT'D)
                                              Didn’t want to move did she 
                                              Janet?

                                 JOYCE
                        I didn’t want you spending your 
                        money buying me and your father a 
                        house -

           LEE makes a few cups of tea from the kettle and then gives 
           one to JANET.

                            LEE
                                                     JOYCE (CONT'D)
                                              When we didn’t need one -
           Mum, mum, mum. Can we not 
           discuss money.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Jan, grab my lighter, it’s behind 
                        you love.

                                 JANET
                        You didn’t put sugar in this did 
                        you?

                                 JOYCE
                        Sure you don’t want a biccie?

           JOYCE offers MIKE a biscuit, he shakes his head politely.
                                 LEE
                        D’you want to drink it or fucking 
                        wear it?

                           JOYCE
           Mind your mouth.
                                                          JANET
                                              You hear how he speaks to his 
                                              sister Mike?

           JANET passes her mum a lighter.

                            LEE
                                                     JANET (CONT'D)
           Make it yourself then.
                                               You hear that?

                                 JOYCE
                        Show Mike what Lee got you for your 
                        birthday. Get those dogs out.

           JOYCE offers MIKE a cigarette as she lights hers. He shakes 
           his head declining. 

                                 LEE
                        (To the Dogs)
                        Come on, out. Out.

           LEE takes a big plate of cheese and ham rolls onto the dining 
           room table, which he starts rearranging things. JANET hands 
           MIKE a white gold and diamond cross necklace.

                                 JOYCE
                        White gold. Beautiful, isn’t it 
                        Jan?

                           JANET
                                                          MIKE
           Yeah.
                                              It’s lovely.

                                 LEE
                        Mum where’d you want the cake?

                                 JOYCE
                        Let me do it.
                        (To a dog)
                        Come on out.

           JOYCE gets up and wanders into the dining room to help LEE 
           with the cake.

                                 MIKE
                        So how many years between you two 
                        then?

                                 JANET
                        Fifteen. Oldest, youngest. You need 
                        another drink?
                                 MIKE
                        Umm...

                                 JANET
                        Oh go on.

                                 MIKE
                        Errrm, alright then. Cheers, yeah.

                                 JANET
                        What is it? A beer?

                                 MIKE
                        Please.

           JANET hands MIKE a beer.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           They watch JOYCE and LEE rearranging the table together. 
           Lighting the candles on the cake.

                                 JANET
                        Must be serious then?

                                 MIKE
                        What is?

                                 JANET
                        Well I can’t remember the last time 
                        he brought a fella home.

           JANET drinks her tea, while MIKE is stumped for words, 
           blindsided by this comment.

           INT. JOYCE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           The chaos of the birthday celebrations have subsided and 
           there is a sense of calm.

           RON sits in his armchair watching snooker smoking. MIKE sits 
           on the sofa between JANET (tea in hand) and JOYCE (wearing 
           her red reading glasses and smoking) proudly going through a 
           scrapbook filled with LEE’s achievements. 

           LEE is sat in an arm chair eating birthday cake and 
           intermittently feeding it to one of the dogs.

           JOYCE passes MIKE a picture of a YOUNG LEE wearing 
           questionable eighties fashion. 
                                 JOYCE
                        Remember the grief you gave me 
                        about taking that picture? The 
                        grief he gave me -

                                 MIKE
                        What’s this?

                                 JOYCE
                        That’s his first day on Savile Row. 
                        How old was he there Jan? Sixteen?

                                 JANET
                        Fifteen.

           Fifteen.
                                              You’re gonna make that dog 
                                              sick carrying on like that.

                                 LEE
                        He likes it, don’t you? 

                                 MIKE
                        How d’you get the job?

                                 JANET
                        Well you saw that advert on the 
                        telly didn’t you?

                                 JOYCE
                        There was this advert on the telly -

                           JANET
                                                     JOYCE (CONT'D)
                                              Which I saw -
           Looking for apprentices on 
           Savile Row.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        That’ right.

           JANET hands MIKE a photograph of LEE in his early twenties 
           holding a portfolio.

                                 JANET
                        This is Lee on his first day at St. 
                        Martins. 

                                 LEE
                        No, no, no, put that away. I look 
                        disgusting.

                           JANET
           Oh shut up, you look lovely. 
                                                      LEE (CONT'D)
                                              Mum, tell her to put it away.
                                 MIKE
                        Was this for a degree?

                                 LEE
                        M.A., not that anyone knew what it 
                        was.

           LEE laughs

                                 JANET
                        Shut up.

                                 JOYCE
                        You know who he sounds like when he 
                        laughs don’t you? That actor. 
                        What’s his name Ron? You know that 
                        actor. The American one. Scary 
                        eyes.

                                 RON
                        Jack Nicholson. 

           MIKE picks up a batch of newspaper clippings.

                            LEE
                                                          JOYCE
           I sound nothing like him. 
                                              Jack Nicholson. That’s it.

                                 JANET
                        Careful with those -

                                 JOYCE
                        Jack Nicholson, I like him.

                           MIKE
                                                          JANET
           Sorry -
                                              It’s a complicated system.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        He’s a good actor isn’t he? 

                                 MIKE
                        What are these?

                                 JOYCE
                        Now these are all his reviews.

                                 LEE
                        Mum seriously -

           LEE lights up a cigarette.
                                 JOYCE
                        The early ones we had to rescue 
                        from the bin cause he used to throw 
                        everything out. That one there’s 
                        his graduation show -

           JOYCE coughs.

                                 JANET
                        You okay?

                                 JOYCE
                        Those are from his years at 
                        Givenchy in Paris.

                                 LEE
                        We call them the lost years.

           JOYCE continues coughing. It sounds serious.

           RON hands JANET his cup of tea who passes it to JOYCE, who 
           sips from it.

           A concerned LEE stubs out his cigarette.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Mum you alright?

                                 JOYCE
                        Fine, don’t fuss.

           RON throws a glare of concern at LEE while JANET rubs her 
           mum’s back. MIKE continues sitting there, slightly 
           uncomfortable at this turn of events but smiles through it.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Where were we?

           JOYCE hands back the mug of tea to JANET before delving back 
           into the scrapbook and handing MIKE another photograph. RON 
           returns his focus to the television, while LEE slumps back 
           into the arm chair.

           INT. JOYCE’S HALLWAY - NIGHT

           MIKE slowly climbs the stairs, making his way to the 
           bathroom, looking at the old-fashioned picture frames lining 
           the walls featuring the McQueen family. 

           A black and white picture of a young JOYCE and RON on their 
           wedding day.
           LEE as a child in his swimming shorts and goggles, with both 
           thumbs up.

           Various shots of the family having fun at the entertainment 
           resort Pontins.

           LEE wearing his tartan kilt, proudly stood with his mum and 
           dad in Claridges holding his CBE.

           He moves a little further along spotting a wooden plaque with 
           the McQUEEN coat of arms.

           The quiet sound of voices grabs his attention. He turns and 
           sees through the bannister JOYCE sitting on her bed. LEE 
           comes into shot holding a glass of water and two pots of 
           pills. He passes the glass to JOYCE then kneels down in front 
           of her, unscrews the pots, counts out two pills and places 
           them in JOYCE’S hand. She swallows the pills.

           Without seeing MIKE, LEE shuts the door.

           Black.

           INT. STAIRWAY UP TO MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           MIKE climbs the three flights of rickety stairs. 

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           LEE is busy ripping down the display images and designs of 
           his last show as MIKE sets up his camera in the corner.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           LEE’s perched on top of a chair staring at the white studio 
           wall, surrounded by the discarded paper. On his lap is a 
           sketch book. He’s also intermittently drinking a bottle of 
           Diet Coke and smoking, desperately trying to think of ideas 
           for his collection.

           MIKE is on the periphery of the room taking shots of LEE.

           CLICK.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - LATER

           LEE browses through bookshelves handing MIKE books for 
           reference.
                                 LEE
                        My influences come through from 
                        everything I see. So from the 
                        street scene to the club scene. 
                        Sex, love, death, drugs, Scotland, 
                        that feeds into a lot of stuff.

                                 MIKE
                        You got Scottish roots?

                                 LEE
                        On my dad’s side. Grandad was from 
                        Isle of Skye, so you know it’s 
                        always playing in my head. You ever 
                        been there?

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        You gotta go. Seriously, it’s 
                        fucking stunning. It’s like my 
                        favourite fucking place. Films.

           LEE pulls a few DVD’S off the shelf and gives to MIKE.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Always good for ideas. Always 
                        watching them.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s your favourite?

           LEE passes a DVD of THE PIANO.

                                 LEE
                        Hang on, errr -The Piano. You seen 
                        it?

                                 MIKE
                        That one with -

                                 LEE
                        The Piano. Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        And the mute girl.

                                 LEE
                        It’s so fucking good.

                                 MIKE
                        I kinda found it a bit slow.
           LEE hands MIKE another book.

                                 LEE
                        Get out. Now.

           MIKE looks down at the book and recognizes it as his own. A 
           harrowing black and white war photograph graces the cover as 
           does the name MIKE POULTER. LEE hands him another book.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you ever go to art galleries for 
                        ideas?

                                 LEE
                        Only when things are looking really 
                        fucking bleak.

           LEE throws MIKE another book.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - LATER

                                 LEE
                        We create ten collections a year.

           LEE is sat at his desk smoking while sketching a design, 
           surrounded by fabrics, and books. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Womenswear, Menswear, the diffusion 
                        line, accessories. You keeping up 
                        with this?

                                 MIKE
                        So far.

                                 LEE
                        We also do stand alone 
                        collaborations with different 
                        companies. Individual commissions, 
                        which is good money.

           LEE throws a sketch away.

                                 MIKE
                        What was wrong with that?

                                 LEE
                        There was nothing right with it.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you ever get overwhelmed with 
                        the amount of work?
                                 LEE
                        I find smoking helps.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you allowed to smoke in here?

                                 LEE
                        I’m allowed to do what the fuck I 
                        want.

           LEE screws up another sketch and discards it. He then looks 
           up at MIKE quizzically. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t suppose you’re any good at 
                        sports?

           INT. STUDIO. LATER THAT DAY

           LEE & MIKE are in the middle of a rally of table tennis. MIKE 
           is really poor at it, LEE on the other hand is exceptional. 
           They drink cans of Diet Coke in between rallies.

                                 MIKE
                        Why do you say that?

                                 LEE 
                        Because for me love and sex are two 
                        completely different things.

                                 MIKE
                        How d’you mean?

                                 LEE
                        I mean, okay, can you recall the 
                        first sexual feeling you had 
                        towards someone?

           MIKE loses the point.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not talking about this.

           MIKE goes in search of the ball.

                                 LEE
                        Oh come on -

                                 MIKE
                        No -

                                 LEE
                        Don’t be fucking shy about it?
                                 MIKE
                        I could be shy, you don’t know me.

                                 LEE
                        Or you could be the kind of guy who 
                        makes blow job jokes in a church. 

                                 MIKE
                        Who was yours then?

                                 LEE
                        Mine?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 LEE
                        Mine was this Pontins entertainer 
                        who looked like a Ken doll you 
                        wanted to take home and play with.

                                 MIKE
                        That was your first love?

           MIKE throws the ball to LEE who holds on to it.

                                 LEE
                        No, that was my best friend from 
                        school. 

                                 MIKE
                        Did you ever tell him?

                                 LEE
                        He knew. We spent all our time 
                        together on the roof of the high-
                        rise opposite my house. Never 
                        really spoke about anything. Didn’t 
                        really have anything to say. Just 
                        ate fuck loads of chips and watched 
                        the birds fly.

                                 MIKE
                        So what happened?

                                 LEE
                        One day I got the urge to run my 
                        hand from the top of his neck all 
                        the way down to the bottom of his 
                        spine. And that was it. Never 
                        talked to me again after that. 
                        Friendship over.

           LEE starts the rally.
                                 MIKE
                        Are you seeing anyone now?

                                 LEE
                        Ahhh, that’s err, that’s 
                        complicated territory. 

                                 MIKE
                        Why’s it complicated?

           LEE wins the rally.

                                 LEE
                        I tend to push people away. That’s 
                        why I have dogs. They forgive 
                        everything. No, it’s your serve.

                                 MIKE
                        If I was you I’d want someone to 
                        share all this with, no?

                                 LEE
                        Yeah, but no one gets it. Not that 
                        I expect them to. You know I’m 
                        fucking difficult to be with.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t think so.

                                 LEE
                        No, yeah, I am. I’m pretty selfish 
                        when I want to be. But then maybe 
                        that’s because I find it hard to 
                        trust people.

                                 MIKE
                        Because of fame?

                                 LEE
                        That and because people have their 
                        own agendas. Even you. You have an 
                        agenda.

                                 MIKE
                        I guess.

           MIKE serves.

                                 LEE
                        So why’ve you never married then?

           LEE instantly wins the point.
                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Get in.

           LEE goes and retrieves the ball.

                                 MIKE
                        I guess I never felt it was fair on 
                        the other person with what I do. 
                        It’s difficult.

                                 LEE
                        In what sense?

                                 MIKE
                        Them not knowing how long I’d be 
                        gone for. When I’d be coming back. 
                        If I’d be coming back all. 

                                 LEE
                        What’s the worst thing you’ve seen?

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Your serve.

           The men continue to rally.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - NIGHT

           MIKE packs away his camera as he watches LEE sat at his desk 
           working. His computer screen lights up his face as he keeps 
           repeating a video clip on You Tube.

           MIKE closes the camera bag and puts it over his shoulder. He 
           walks over to LEE and see’s that he’s watching Edith Beale 
           (daughter) in GREY GARDENS who is telling the interviewer 
           what she’s wearing. LEE repeats the clips again.

                                 MIKE
                        See you Monday then.

           LEE doesn’t acknowledge MIKE, he’s too deep in thought.

                                 CAMILLA (O.S.)
                        You don’t think we should play this 
                        one a little more safe?
           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           The whole creative team is spread around a table filled with 
           laptops, papers, materials, sketches, bowls of sweets, 
           crisps, Jaffa Cakes.

           Joining LEE, MIKE, SARAH and CAMILLA (Stylist) are -

           SAM (30’s) the show producer, very preppy and cool. 

           CAT (30’s) brilliantly practical female Stage Manager. 

           JOHN (40’s) sound and lighting designer, husband to SAM.

           All of the core creative team have worked with LEE for years 
           and are incredibly loyal. Importantly, they have a quick 
           point of reference with one another. It’s an open forum for 
           ideas and questions. 

                                 JOHN
                        When have we ever played it safe?

                            LEE
           Pass the sugar. No the other 
           one.
                                                           SAM
                                              The collection needs to, no 
                                              I’m not using that -

           SAM passes a pen to CAT as JOHN throws LEE a packet of 
           Haribo.

                                 SAM
                        Have more of a commercial appeal 
                        after our last one, it just does.

                                 SARAH
                        When have we ever set out to be 
                        commercial? 

                                 CAMILLA
                        Are we discarding these sketches?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, we’re changing concept.

           LEE throws the sweets at JOHN.

                                 LEE
                        Stop me eating this shit.

                                 CAMILLA
                        I still think they’re good.

                                 SARAH
                        There’s no coherence to the ideas. 
                                 LEE
                        Have we got any Diet Coke? 

           CAT passes LEE a Diet Coke.

                                 JOHN
                        If we don’t commit to a concept 
                        now, we’re gonna run out of time.

                                 SARAH
                        We’re still playing around with 
                        ideas to do with the recession. 

                                 CAT
                        Too on the nose, no?

                                 SAM
                        Every other fashion house will be 
                        responding to it in someway and if 
                        we don’t we need to have a good 
                        reason why.

                                 CAMILLA
                        You see I don’t think they will. 

           MIKE notices LEE discreetly lifting up his jumper a little 
           and squashing his rolls of fat together and then sucking his 
           stomach in and then letting it out again. 

                                 CAMILLA (CONT’D)
                        All anyone is gonna be sending down 
                        the runway are cashmere twin sets 
                        because they’re shit scared of 
                        their cash registers not ringing.

                                 JOHN
                        So then we should.

                                 CAMILLA
                        Right.

                                 CAT
                        Okay, so what’s the angle so far?

                                 SARAH
                        We were toying with looking at 
                        postwar Britain but I don’t think 
                        Lee wants that, do you?

                                 CAMILLA
                        Why not?

                                 SARAH
                        There’s lots we could do with it.
                                 SAM
                        Really?

                                 CAMILLA
                        Austerity clothing wasn’t 
                        necessarily drab.

                                 LEE
                        Neither was it innovating or 
                        empowering. Fuck me, does anyone 
                        have any ideas today? I mean what 
                        is this shit? What is it? What’s 
                        that? Are you not fucking 
                        embarrassed? I’m embarrassed. This 
                        collection has to be special, to 
                        mean something, to say something we 
                        haven’t said before otherwise 
                        what’s the fucking point in any of 
                        this? It’s doing my head in. I cant 
                        fucking think anymore.

                LEE stubs out his cigarette and leaves the table.

                                 CAMILLA.
                        What about creating some new 
                        prints, perhaps ripping headlines 
                        from - great.

           LEE exits the studio leaving the team alone, unsure of what 
           to say or do. MIKE who is slightly bemused by the whole 
           situation tentatively asks...

                                 MIKE
                        Does he do this a lot?

           LEE re-enters the studio, ignoring his team and calling out 
           to MIKE.

                                 LEE
                        Mike. Are you coming or not?

           MIKE grabs his camera, coat and follows LEE out of the 
           studio, leaving the team slightly annoyed, surprised and 
           deflated.

           INT. TATE BRITAIN - DAY

           We see the painting : Three Studies for Figures at the Base 
           of a Crucifixion by FRANCIS BACON.

           MIKE and LEE are sat down looking at the pictures. Not many 
           tourists are milling around as it’s the late afternoon.
           They both sit there silently taking in this masterpiece.

           INT. TATE BRITAIN - DAY

           MIKE and LEE walk around the exhibition of BACON’S work 
           speaking quietly in the hushed room.

                                 LEE
                        The biggest criticism I have of 
                        myself is that I’m not good at 
                        taking it.

                                 MIKE
                        Why d’you think that is?

                                 LEE
                        When you’re starting out, trying to 
                        make a name for yourself, you have 
                        this like insane delusion that your 
                        work deserves to be seen. That it’s 
                        better than other people’s. When 
                        really the reality is you’ve no 
                        idea what the fuck you’re doing. 
                        You’re producing collections with 
                        no money, that no one is buying and 
                        that the critics hate. And the only 
                        way to keep going through all that, 
                        that fear is to keep telling 
                        yourself that all the work which is 
                        getting the recognition isn’t 
                        worthy of it. 

                                 MIKE
                        How’d you go about reconciling that 
                        when they start praising you then?

                                 LEE
                        Well then you have nothing to 
                        measure yourself by do you? Fucks 
                        you up. Then comes all this 
                        expectation, fear of failing. You 
                        gotta keep improving, bettering 
                        yourself, otherwise it’s all just 
                        gonna go away and that would be 
                        worse than never having had it at 
                        all.

                                 MIKE
                        How’d you deal with that?

                                 LEE
                        Drink. Drugs. Fuck lots of 
                        strangers. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        But then I’ll go through periods 
                        like now where you stop everything 
                        and go to the other extreme. But 
                        the only problem with that is the 
                        ideas are slower to form when 
                        you’re clean.

                                 MIKE
                        Why don’t just you stop working 
                        then?

                                 LEE
                        Well, yeah, that would be the smart 
                        thing to do. Stop while you’re 
                        ahead. Protect whatever kind of 
                        legacy you’ve got going for 
                        yourself because chances are the 
                        longer you continue the more likely 
                        you are to screw it up.

                                 MIKE
                        Really?

                                 LEE
                        Come on it happens to pretty much 
                        every artist, every actor, writer, 
                        musician there’s ever been. They 
                        all reach this kind of pinnacle and 
                        then it’s a downward spiral from 
                        there. Scares me to think your best 
                        is behind you. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m thinking about stopping.

           LEE stares at MIKE...

                                 LEE
                        To do what?

                                 MIKE
                        Shoot landscapes. 

                                 LEE
                        Don’t do that.

                                 MIKE
                        Why not?

                                 LEE
                        You’ll get bored...and fat.

           A beat.
                                 MIKE
                        I’m already fat.

           INT. MIKE’S HALLWAY - NIGHT

           MIKE turns the hallway light on, having just come in from the 
           rain outside. He picks up the pile of envelopes on the floor. 
           Mainly bills. There’s a suitcase at the bottom of the stairs. 
           He picks it up and starts walking up the stairs.

           INT. MIKE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           MIKE sits at his kitchen table alone eating a microwaved 
           curry. The kitchen is sparse of any personal items, or 
           clutter. Devoid of any personality. Radio 2 plays.

           INT. MIKE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Later that evening MIKE’S still sat on the sofa, feet perched 
           up on the coffee table. His battered laptop rests in his lap 
           with the television playing Billy Wilder’s ‘THE APARTMENT.’ 
           He stares at the GOOGLE home page open on his screen. He’s 
           unsure of what to write. 

           After a moment the letters being typed form: ALEXANDER 
           MCQUEEN

           He can’t decide whether to press enter or not...Thinking 
           better of it he deletes the letters and then shuts the laptop 
           screen off.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           We follow MIKE as he walks through to the back of the busy 
           studio. There’s no sign of LEE but his work space is strewn 
           with more books and magazines covering the floor. He picks 
           one up. It’s a 1950’s fashion magazine. His attention is then 
           drawn to a white wall which now features a giant question 
           mark drawn in black marker.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           We follow MIKE as he walks down a dreary corridor at the top 
           of the MCQUEEN building. Unsure of where he is going he 
           eventually comes to a large conference room where he can see 
           LEE and a group of important looking people in suits sat 
           round an oblong table. LEE who is addressing the room clocks 
           MIKE outside and signals for him to come in.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           MIKE walks into a heated conversation between LEE and JEFF 
           WILCOX (50’s) who is A SENIOR MANAGER of the MCQUEEN COMPANY. 
           MIKE discreetly sits down at the only spare seat around the 
           table.

                                 JEFF
                        There’s no market research telling 
                        us we’re failing because we’re 
                        overpriced. They’re telling us 
                        we’re falling behind because the 
                        customer doesn’t believe the 
                        designs to be wearable.

                                 LEE
                        The only people who believe the 
                        customer knows anything are the 
                        customers themselves.

                                 JEFF
                        And yet our main advertisement is 
                        the show and if the show doesn't 
                        represent products we can sell in 
                        our stores then we fall short. Who 
                        is this?

           JEFF shoots a look of annoyance in MIKE’S direction.

                                 LEE
                        Did we or did we not break even 
                        this year? 

                                 JEFF
                        If you’re asking was this the first 
                        year since Gucci acquired the 
                        company we didn’t make a loss? Then 
                        yes. Congratulations. 

                                 LEE
                        Then we’re improving.

                                 JEFF
                        Seven years of no profit.

                                 LEE
                        Seven years of building a 
                        foundation.

                                 JEFF
                        We’re currently running at 70% 
                        wholesale, 30% retail. 

           JEFF passes the paper down the table.
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I suggest we use this as leverage 
                        in our negotiations to find a 
                        partner able to provide mass 
                        distribution of an affordable 
                        collection.

           LEE takes a paper and walks towards the window feeling the 
           frustration of having to even consider working with another 
           company.

                                 LEE
                        I don’t want to even consider such 
                        a collaboration. I’ve told you I’m 
                        not working with another company.

                                 JEFF
                        It’s commercially vital we get the 
                        deal through by the end of the 
                        month so we’re cushioned for any 
                        economic blow-back.

                                 LEE
                        What is this?

           LEE holds up the paper.

                                 JEFF
                        We’ve gone over various strategies -

           LEE flicks through the document.

                                 LEE
                        Budget outlines, business models, 
                        lay off the bullshit. 

           LEE puts the document down, looking straight at JEFF.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        How much of my show budget is 
                        getting cut? 

                                 JEFF
                        Half.

           LEE is visibly shocked by this but tries to hide it. He looks 
           at the other board members who look slightly sheepish.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        The board agrees this is the best 
                        course of action if we’re to remain 
                        competitive.
                                 LEE
                        This isn’t survival it’s a suicide. 
                        You cut my budget by half you kill 
                        the company.

                                 JEFF
                        The company you sold a majority 
                        stake in for millions. Cuts are 
                        being implemented across the group 
                        and we need you to fall into line.

                                 LEE
                        No, you need me to make ten 
                        collections a year. Each one 
                        bigger, bolder and better than the 
                        next. 

                                 JEFF
                        I understand your frustrations -

                                 LEE
                        Understand it’s my name on every 
                        label, on every bag, on every sign 
                        above every god damn fucking store. 
                        It’s my name that gets written 
                        about when I don’t deliver what’s 
                        expected of me, not yours.

                                 JEFF
                        And we’re heading into one of the 
                        worst economic downturns any of us 
                        are likely to experience. If we 
                        don’t protect ourselves now the 
                        fallout could be catastrophic.

                                 LEE
                        That’s not what I care about.

           LEE slams all the papers off the table with his hand. They 
           scatter to the floor.

                                 JEFF
                        You’ll care when you’re sat round 
                        this table twelve months from now 
                        laying off members of your team.

                                 LEE
                        My team and I are creating work 
                        none of you are capable of 
                        producing. Work, which in years to 
                        come will not only be regarded as 
                        art but pieces of history. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        And if history has taught us 
                        anything it’s in times like these 
                        you have to take risks. And I’m not 
                        talking about the decision whether 
                        you wear a black or navy suit 
                        today. I’m talking about risking 
                        something of yourselves. You 
                        remember what that means? What 
                        loyalty is Jeff? What that sounds 
                        like? Because let me tell you I’m 
                        not hearing it. I’m not seeing it 
                        and by the looks of it you’re not 
                        even fucking wearing it.

           LEE storms out of the room as a bashful JEFF looks down at 
           his suit, aware it’s not a McQueen design and straightens his 
           tie.

           All the board members sit silently, slightly embarrassed but 
           mostly shocked by what they just witnessed, including MIKE.

           EXT. MCQUEEN STUDIO ROOFTOP - DUSK

           MIKE walks across the rooftop to where LEE is standing 
           smoking a cigarette. They both look out at the view of 
           London.

           There’s a silence between the men.

                                 LEE
                        Do you own another jacket?

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Why, what’s wrong with it?

                                 LEE
                        Nothing...I like it.

           LEE exhales his cigarette.

                                 MIKE
                        What you thinking?

                                 LEE
                        I’m thinking we should go get 
                        fucking smashed.
           INT. GHETTO BAR - NIGHT

           We’re hit by the punishing beats of club music. A barrage of 
           lights, noise, people drinking, dancing, it’s pure hedonism.

           MIKE and LEE push their way through to the bar greeting 
           ANNALISE, (39) a party girl model coming to the end of her 
           career but still strikingly beautiful.

                                 LEE
                        Hey, how are you?

           ANNALISE throws her arms round LEE hugging him tightly.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Good, I’m good. How are you?

                                 LEE
                        Anna Mike, Mike Annalise, one of my 
                        oldest friends.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Nice to meet you.

           INT. GHETTO BAR - LATER

           In the middle of a crowd of people ANNALISE and LEE introduce 
           MIKE to a small group of their friends. Firstly, ALINKA a 
           beautiful, stick thin, Russian model. 

                                                         ALINKA
                           MIKE
           Nice to meet you.
                                              Alinka.

                                 LEE
                        Alinka’s one of my models.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Bobby and Cookie.

           MIKE shakes hands with BOBBY, a hang over from the late 
           eighties, wearing crazy face make-up and a Sergeant Peppers 
           military styled red jacket. COOKIE is a cool looking pretty 
           boy half everyone’s age. 

                                 LEE
                        Don’t believe a word they say.

           INT. GHETTO BAR - LATER

           We see various shots from MIKE’S perspective of the group 
           dancing together, drinking shots. 
           He immerses himself with the group and is surprised by how 
           much fun he’s having after being reticent at first. The night 
           is young and so are they...well kind of. At some point we see 
           ANNALISE and LEE dancing to their reflections in a mirror.

           INT. CAFE BOHEME - NIGHT

           LEE, MIKE, BOBBY, COOKIE & ALINKA sit round a table drinking 
           and eating bites. BOBBY holds court telling a story of him 
           and LEE cruising.

                                 BOBBY
                        We’re in this club in Camden, and 
                        there’s sweat on the walls, cum on 
                        the fucking floor. No, seriously, 
                        we’ve taken so many fucking pills, 
                        we don’t know what the fuck is 
                        going on anymore, when this one 
                        demands we go cruising on Clapham 
                        Common -

                                 LEE
                        I fucking didn’t -

                           BOBBY
                                                      LEE (CONT'D)
           Yes you fucking did.
                                              Fuck off -

                                 BOBBY
                        Only we lose each other and I end 
                        up getting my arsehole torn to 
                        pieces by this German -

                          ALINKA
           That’s fucking disgusting.
                                                     BOBBY (CONT'D)
                                              He’s like five foot six with 
                                              a hard on the size of my arm.

           ANNALISE approaches the table with a tray of shots. Which 
           they all pick up as BOBBY continues on -

                         ANNALISE
                                                     BOBBY (CONT'D)
           Everyone take one. Here we 
           go. Come on.
                                              It’s the worst fucking 
                                              experience of my life.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Okay. One. Two. Three.

           Everyone takes a shot, various noise of disgust and laughing. 
           LEE starts throwing peanuts at BOBBY throughout the 
           continuing dialogue.
                                 BOBBY
                        Anyway, I spend the rest of the 
                        night looking for Lee only to find 
                        him three hours later, stop that, 
                        stark bollock naked tied with gaffa
                        tape to a fucking -

                         ANNALISE
           Oak tree. Oak tree. Oak tree.
                                                     BOBBY (CONT'D)
                                              Oak tree. Oak tree. Oak tree.

           Everyone laughs at LEE who swigs at his whiskey and coke as 
           ANNALISE wraps her arms round him and kisses his cheek.

                                 LEE
                        You’re all cock suckers. Get off. 
                        No, get off.

           INT. CAFE BOHEME - NIGHT

           ANNALISE, MIKE & BOBBY stood at the bar trying to order a 
           drink whilst watching LEE hitting on a good looking guy at 
           another table.

                                 ANNALISE
                        You’d never believe it but really 
                        he’s a romantic at heart.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, no, I don’t believe it.

                                 BOBBY
                        What are you having? The same?

                                 ANNALISE
                        Yeah but no ice. No, like he has 
                        lots of fun but ever since I’ve 
                        known him he’s always been in and 
                        out of relationships.

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh hello. 

           LEE has discreetly put his hand on the man’s arse.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Get in there my son!

           LEE gives BOBBY the middle finger without looking at him.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Always drawn to people who need him 
                        too much, you know what I’m saying?
                                 BOBBY
                        Has he spoken to you about George 
                        yet?

                                 ANNALISE
                        He doesn’t need to know about 
                        George.

                                 BOBBY
                        Ask him about George. They got 
                        married on this fuck off yacht in 
                        Ibiza.

                                 ANNALISE
                        It wasn’t legal or anything. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Only been together a few months -

                                 ANNALISE
                        But they wanted to show how 
                        committed they were to one another.

                                 MIKE
                        What happened between them?

                                 BOBBY
                        Fell apart. Lee was taking too many 
                        drugs.

                                 ANNALISE
                        But he’s clean now.

                                 BOBBY
                        Been clean since Izzy passed away. 
                        (To the bartender) I said no ice.

                                 MIKE
                        Who’s Izzy?

                                 ANNALISE
                        Isabella Blow?

                                 BOBBY
                        No. Ice.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Fashion editor? Stylist?

                                 BOBBY
                        She discovered him after seeing his 
                        first show. She helped him get to 
                        where he is. 
                                 ANNALISE
                        Do you know anything about fashion?

                                 MIKE
                        Not really.

                                 ANNALISE
                        So that’s why he likes you.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry?

           ANNALISE raises her voice over the music.

                                 ANNALISE
                        That’s why he likes you.

           EXT. OLD COMPTON STREET - NIGHT 

           MIKE stands outside on the street getting some air. We hear 
           the clattering sounds of the Soho nightlife around him. LEE 
           comes out of the front door and takes out a smoke. He offers 
           one to MIKE who takes one. They both stand there smoking 
           their cigarettes side by side soaking up Soho.

           EXT. VICTORIA PARK RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           LEE, ALINKA, ANNALISE and MIKE drunkenly stumble along the 
           quiet up market street - well it was until they arrived, 
           stealing traffic signs, messing around in the road as they 
           make their way up to LEE’S flat.

           INT. LEE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           MIKE stands next to a giant stuffed stag in the hallway, beer 
           in hand as he takes in the kitchen. It’s more minimalistic
           than he was expecting. Everything is white other than one 
           wall which is volcanic in its texture. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           MIKE stands with his back to a giant framed black and white 
           photograph of a man’s arse which dominates the wall. He 
           meanders around the living room. L-shaped sofa. Everything 
           covered in Ostrich skin. He looks at the coffee table which 
           hosts the ‘Marquis De Sade’s’ book 120 days of Sodom. 

           He scans the shelves which contain rows of DVDS and awards 
           such as British designer of the year. 
           He then wanders over to another wall where he takes in a 
           HENDRIK KERSTENS painting of a woman with a plastic bag over 
           her head.

           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT 

           MIKE meanders up the stairs. The walls feature macabre 
           artwork by NICK NIGHT, JOEL PETER WITKIN which are extreme in 
           their graphicness.

           He then stops in his tracks seeing one of his photographs. We 
           recognise it as the cover of MIKE’s book we saw earlier in 
           LEE’s studio. It’s of a bloodstained child standing in the 
           centre of rubble.

           From seemingly nowhere ANNALISE appears catching MIKE off 
           guard?

                                 ANNALISE
                        You coming?

           INT. LEE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MIKE follows ANNALISE into LEE’S large bedroom where LEE sits 
           upright on a huge bed eating a McDonalds, the dogs joining 
           him on the duvet. 

           ANNALISE jumps onto the end of end of the bed spread eagle  
           and starts channel hopping while smoking a cigarette. 
           Meanwhile ALINKA sleeps on the sofa with a throw wrapped 
           round her.

           MIKE makes his way over to a large chest of drawers upon 
           which sits a collection of photo frames, mainly of LEE with 
           his family and friends. 

           He spots a framed photograph of LEE and an eccentrically 
           dressed woman, pale faced, wearing a flamboyant hat. MIKE 
           picks it up to get a closer look.

                                 LEE
                        Izzy hated that you could see her 
                        face in that one. Although I always 
                        thought it was the best photo ever 
                        taken of her. 

           LEE returns to eating his food, as MIKE places the photograph 
           back.
           INT. LEE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           MIKE washes his hands in the bathroom basin catching his 
           reflection in the bathroom cabinet. He looks tired, and 
           unshaven. Just as he’s about to turn the tap off he gets a 
           thought which he knows he shouldn’t act upon but his 
           curiosity gets the better of him.

           Leaving the tap running he opens the mirrored cabinet 
           revealing various hygiene equipment, tooth brush, face wash 
           etc. But what is most striking is the sheer amount of 
           medication bottles. There’s enough here to stock a pharmacy.

           MIKE takes a few bottles off the shelf and examines the 
           labels intrigued by what they are. He places the bottles back 
           and shuts the cabinet.

           INT. LEE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MIKE exits the en-suite walking into the bedroom where LEE 
           (who has his back to him) is sitting in front of the 
           television with ANNALISE stood behind also watching, remote 
           control in hand.

           MIKE clocks the film playing, it’s the famous Ascot scene 
           from MY FAIR LADY. Ladies fill the screen wearing the famous 
           black and white frocks. As MIKE approaches he sees LEE is 
           actually sketching a design.

           LEE then rips out the paper and holds it up to show MIKE the 
           design of an elaborate skirt and jacket two piece.

                                 LEE
                        Got it.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - NIGHT

           The lights to the studio all flicker on, the place is 
           deserted of people. LEE strides through the room trailed by 
           ANNALISE, ALINKA and MIKE unsure of what’s going on.

           We watch the process of how LEE creates a two piece jacket 
           and skirt from start to finish. He begins by pulling out roll 
           after roll of black and white checkered material laying it on 
           the floor.

           He then places screen shots from MY FAIR LADY on the wall. 
           Bam. Bam. Bam.

           On his hands and knees he quickly begins cutting out a 
           pattern from the fabric. The scissors glide smoothly across 
           the material. 
           Meanwhile, MIKE takes out his camera and starts focusing the 
           lens as ANNALISE helps undress ALINKA down to her underwear.

           MIKE begins to circle LEE as he in turn circles ALINKA, her 
           arms outstretched like a beautiful swan. LEE wraps material 
           around her, quickly pinning it to create a silhouette he’s 
           happy with. Meanwhile ANNALISE stands to the side always 
           assisting with pins, scissors, cigarettes, coffee, whatever 
           is needed in the moment.

           The familiar noise of the sewing machine which lights LEE as 
           he sews a seam on the skirt, cigarette constantly dangling 
           from his mouth or seeing him rip the material with his teeth 
           again and again.

           A sleep deprived SARAH rushes into the STUDIO carrying her 
           bag, throwing off her coat and straight into assisting LEE.

           ANNALISE hands LEE and SARAH pin after pin as they both stab 
           through the material ALINKA is wearing. She stands still as a 
           statue slightly nervous she could get pierced at any moment. 

           LEE lays on his back, sweat dripping down his face as he 
           hacks away with a pair of scissors to the bottom of the black 
           and white checkered skirt. He hand sews intricately in and 
           out of the material. His eyes, red raw. 

           We watch a heady sequence of LEE and SARAH ripping, sewing, 
           cutting. Each consecutive sequence is faster, building 
           manically to a beautiful crescendo. ANNALISE and SARAH 
           constantly assisting, MIKE shooting and ALINKA modelling. 
           Until finally -

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - EARLY MORNING

           Stillness. The early morning sunlight streams through the 
           studio covered in material, paper, cigarette butts and books. 
           It’s like a fashion bomb’s exploded.

           A dishevelled LEE sits down next to SARAH. He clasps her hand 
           in relief and pride. ANNALISE affectionately throws her arms 
           around his shoulders, as they all looks up at ALINKA standing 
           before them like the most beautiful mannequin wearing LEE’s 
           new creation. A black and white houndstooth two piece skirt 
           and jacket. A relieved LEE rubs his tired face and exhales a 
           deep breath before a wide grin appears. He knows he’s created 
           the first piece in his new collection.

                        sackable offence.
           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           The whole creative team are once again spread around a table 
           filled with laptops, papers, materials, sketches, bowls of 
           sweets, crisps, jaffa cakes. 

                                 LEE

                        No one’s disputing the designs are 
                        good -

                                 LEE
                        They’re fucking excellent. 
                        I’m not considering any other 
                        venues. 

                       LEE (CONT’D)
           Pass me the sugar.

                                              We should discuss alternative 
                                              ideas before we go any 
                                              further on this.

           JOHN throws LEE a packet of Haribo.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        This has the potential to be the 
                        most exciting collection we’ve 
                        created in years. The only show 
                        anyone is going to be talking about 
                        will be ours. 

                                 SAM
                        Why?

                                 SARAH
                        Because people have bigger concerns 
                        than buying clothes no one can 
                        afford.

                        silhouettes as everything that’s

                        brand fucking new

                        Yes, which is why we’re also going 
                        to parody ourselves.

                        We’ve pushed consumerism to the 
                        point of overconsumption right? 
                        Designers don’t create anything new 
                        anymore. We just steal from the 
                        past, present it as if it’s new and 
                        everyone buys into it.

                                 SAM
                        The board won’t like it.

                                 LEE
                        Who says the board have to know?

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY 

           LEE presents the team with design ideas and sketches.

                                 SARAH
                        We’re gonna create pastiches of 
                        Givenchy’s little black dress. 
                        Valentino’s ladies at lunch. And 
                        Dior’s new look.

           SARAH hands out design references to the team.

                                 LEE
                        We’ll also concentrate on 
                        reinventing our best pieces from 
                        the last fifteen years referencing 
                        the archive. 

                                 SARAH
                        Key motifs, themes. We’ve already 
                        discussed using the Escher prints 
                        from Birds, using the houndstooth 
                        check. 

           The team pass pictures of past McQueen shows around as LEE 
           eats some chocolate.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        The idea is to turn trousers into 
                        shirts. Jackets into dresses. 
                                 CAMILLA
                        Retrospection into reinvention?

                                 SARAH
                        Exactly.

                                 LEE
                        I want you to look through every 
                        collection we’ve ever done. 
                        Suggestions to me by the end of 
                        tomorrow. John, can we pull up some 
                        music from past shows?

                                 JOHN
                        Already on it.

                                 CAT
                        Why don’t we use old props, pieces 
                        from past sets?

                                 LEE
                        And do what with them?

                                 SARAH
                        Use them as a centre piece?

                                 SAM
                        Set it up like a museum?

           MIKE picks up a picture of the HENDRIK KERSTENS painting of a 
           woman with a plastic bag over head he saw at LEE’S house.

                                 LEE
                        Fuck no.

                                 JOHN
                        What about a rubbish dump?

                                 LEE
                        Pile it up.

                                 CAT
                        Make it look like it’s all burnt to 
                        a cinder.

                                 LEE
                        I like that.

                                 CAMILLA
                        Are you wanting Philip to do 
                        headwear?

           LEE takes the Hendrik picture out of MIKE’S hand and passes 
           it to CAMILLA.
                                 LEE
                        Send him the Hendrik portrait as a 
                        starting point. I want us to also 
                        run with rubbish, bags, bin liners, 
                        work that into the clothes too.

                                 SAM
                        Do we have a title?

                                 LEE
                        I’m working on it. 

                                 SARAH
                        Any more questions...

                                 LEE
                        Great. Last one down to the archive 
                        is buying lunch.

           LEE starts running down the studio. The team all start 
           yelling and chasing after him. MIKE laughs. He’s in a 
           madhouse but LEE’S enthusiasm is infectious.

           INT. ARCHIVES BASEMENT - DAY

           A projector plays images from LEE’S first fashion show 

           JACK THE RIPPER STALKS HIS VICTIMS.

           MIKE sits next to LEE who is giving a running commentary of 
           his work to him. JOHN works the projector while CAMILLA, 
           SARAH, CAT and SAM sit around the room taking notes and 
           passing documents to one another. LEE intermittently bites 
           his fingernails off and lays them on his trouser leg in a 
           row.

                                 LEE
                        This one was a fucking mess.

                                 MIKE
                        This was your graduate collection?

                                 LEE
                        Yeah, we based it on Jack The 
                        Ripper and his victims.

                                 MIKE
                        What don’t you like about it?

                                 LEE
                        There’s too many ideas going on. 
                        It’s not cohesive enough as a 
                        whole.
                                 MIKE
                        Did you think that at the time?

                                 LEE
                        No at the time I thought it was the 
                        dog’s bollocks.

           INT. ARCHIVES BASEMENT - LATER

           The projector plays images of No13, one of LEE’S most famous 
           fashion shows.

                                 LEE
                        That girl there was an athlete who 
                        had her legs amputated as a child, 
                        so we offered to design those 
                        wooden legs especially for her.

                                 MIKE
                        Wow.

                                 LEE
                        Critics didn’t agree, they really 
                        went for us. Said we were 
                        exploiting disabled people, all 
                        that kind of shit, fucking killed 
                        me. Oh I love this bit it’s 
                        beautiful. Wait for it...Wait...

           LEE starts to conduct the music with his hands. He looks like 
           a child, filled with exuberant joy, as he watches the grand 
           finale; a solitary ballerina in a white dress rotates on a 
           turntable while being spray painted by two industrial robots.

           INT. ARCHIVES BASEMENT - LATER

           We’re nearing the end of VOSS. Models are walking around an 
           enormous glass box, with white tiled floors and walls formed 
           from surveillance mirrors. LEE is scribbling notes down while 
           eating sweets.

                                 SARAH
                        He’d say to the models, ‘do 
                        something fucking crazy. I don’t 
                        care what it is, just fuck with the 
                        audience.’ 

                                 MIKE
                        How’d you go about choosing the 
                        models?
                                 SARAH
                        Well some we use time and time 
                        again don’t we?

                                 LEE
                        Yeah but really they’ve just got to 
                        be strong and fearless, like 
                        warriors. Like men should be 
                        fucking scared of them, you know? 
                        That’s important.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 LEE
                        Just is.

                                 MIKE
                        And do you see this as more fashion 
                        or a show?

                                 LEE
                        I see it as art.

           Footage comes up of people being interviewed after a show. 
           ISABELLA BLOW appears. Just her voice makes LEE stop in his 
           tracks. His silent focus shows us how important she was to 
           him. He’s like a lost boy listening for directions. The rest 
           of the creative team share concerned looks.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        I know you’re talking to everybody 
                        but just quickly, in a phrase, what 
                        is Alexander McQueen? 

           IZZY turns away taking a puff on her cigarette before 
           returning back to the reviewer, sharp as a whip with an 
           answer. 

                                 IZZY
                        ‘He’s a wild bird with a good 
                        silhouette...And he always makes 
                        his whole work about being a bird. 
                        So birds have movement, they have 
                        freedom, they’re wild, they’re 
                        free. They don’t have to be 
                        responsible to anyone other than to 
                        their great technical ability to 
                        fly. And I think he makes clothes 
                        fly.’

           Clearly chocked, LEE clears his throat before saying -
                                 LEE
                        Stop there. I’ve seen enough.

           INT. STORE ROOM - DAY

           LEE scans through rails of clothes and shelves of boxes for 
           accessories while MIKE trails behind questioning him. 

                                 LEE
                        She made several attempts. Pills, 
                        tranquilizers, tried to drown 
                        herself once.

                                 MIKE
                        Did you ever try and help her?

                                 LEE
                        I paid for her medical bills, not 
                        that she knew. We weren’t really on 
                        the best of terms by then.

                                 MIKE
                        Why’s that?

                                 LEE
                        She felt I owed her a job and I 
                        wasn’t willing to give her one. 

                                 MIKE
                        Do you feel guilty about that?

                                 LEE
                        Has someone you loved taken their 
                        life?

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry, I shouldn’t have asked you 
                        about this.

                                 LEE
                        I only talk to you because I like 
                        talking to you. If I didn't I 
                        wouldn’t fucking say anything.

           MIKE feels weirdly validated by LEE’S back-handed compliment, 
           yet tries to conceal it.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        All I know is I’ve enough 
                        destructive tendencies of my own to 
                        not take on someone else’s. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t of helped her more than 
                        I did because I wasn’t in a 
                        position to help myself.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you angry at her for what she 
                        did?

                                 LEE
                        How can you be angry at someone for 
                        making the hardest choice there is 
                        to make? For someone to feel their 
                        life doesn’t have enough worth to 
                        keep going? How can I be angry at 
                        her for deciding that she wasn’t 
                        enough?

           LEE knows he has opened up too much, and goes back to looking 
           at the book but can’t concentrate, closing it after a few 
           moments.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        I think I’m done for today.

           LEE walks off in the direction of the exit, leaving MIKE 
           watching him go. 

           EXT. VOLVO CAR - MORNING

           From behind we see MIKE driving his battered old Volvo. He 
           pulls over into a layby picking up his camera from the 
           passenger seat and exits the car. From the car we see MIKE, 
           making his way up the hill and out of view.

           EXT. WOODLAND - MORNING

           MIKE trudges up the muddy hillside until he reaches the top. 
           We see the landscape darkened with towering rain clouds ready 
           to burst. It's a sight to behold.

           MIKE hears a rustling sound and looks round to see what it 
           is.

           We stay on Mike as raises his camera to his eye to capture 
           what we can’t see. 

           Click.
           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           MIKE walks through the quiet studio, wearing the same rain 
           drenched coat and camera. As he approaches we see LEE 
           focused, working on a model who is wearing a red dress with 
           black birds printed on it. As always, he is accompanied by 
           SARAH, CAMILLA and few other assistants, and everyone is 
           speaking in hushed tones.

           The studio has more mood boards filled with inspiration. 
           Hanging rails with a few completed dresses. New materials, 
           sketches, and polaroids of models.

           LEE keeps standing back from the model thinking deeply, rubs 
           his face frustrated at not being able to solve the problem 
           that stands before him. He gestures at an assistant for more 
           pins and gets down on his knees to fix the garment.

           Meanwhile MIKE takes out his camera and starts snapping. 
           Click. Click. Seemingly unaware that with each shot the 
           tension grows at how inappropriate this feels. LEE continues 
           to stand back from the dress deeply unhappy. He gestures for 
           the scissors, and starts hacking away at the dress. 

           Click.

           Click.

           LEE stands back again to observe his creation, still deeply 
           frustrated.

           Click.

           Click.

                                 LEE
                        STOP TAKING MY FUCKING PICTURE!

           LEE throws the scissors at the wall before going up to his 
           desk and throwing everything off it with one swish of his 
           arm. He then makes his way over to the mood boards manically
           ripping pictures and designs off the board as MIKE calmly 
           stands there, waiting for LEE to stop but he doesn’t. He 
           continues destroying parts of the studio and the collection 
           until he finally stops and begins to calm down. MIKE stays 
           standing there fascinated by what he’s witnessing.

           LEE begins to compose himself and looks up at MIKE. There’s a 
           new understanding between the men. LEE quietly goes back to 
           working on the models dress while MIKE resumes taking his 
           pictures.

           The studio goes back to work.
           INT. KITCHEN STUDIO - DAY

           MIKE is waiting for the kettle to boil. LEE walks into the 
           kitchen, grabs a cup, puts a tea bag in it, takes the kettle 
           of and pours the water in.

           MIKE pours the water into his cup as LEE looks in the fridge 
           for milk, pouring it into his own cup and stirring it.

                                 LEE
                        Milk?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

           LEE pours the milk into MIKE’S mug, stirs it and then gives 
           it to him. A poor mans apology.

           The men just stand there drinking their tea for a few 
           moments.

           INT. MIKE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           MIKE lays out all the equipment he will need to turn the 
           kitchen into a dark room. 

           Enlarger easel and timer. Trays and tongs to develop, stop, 
           and fix the prints. Bottles of chemicals, chemical cylinders, 
           photographic paper as well as his cameras.

           He then puts up rows of string across the ceiling from where 
           he will later hang the photographs, before covering up the 
           window (which has aluminium foil around the inside edges,) 
           with a piece of plywood until the room becomes pitch black.

           INT. MIKE’S KITCHEN - LATER

           The red light which has been placed on the wall, switches on. 
           It feels like we’re in a womb. 

           We see the step by step process of developing film.

           The rolling of film being unfolded, trays of chemicals, 
           developers, the clock watch being set into motion.

           MIKE hangs undeveloped pictures up on a line. 

           He then looks through some developed shots he’s taken over 
           the last few weeks. Images of models, mood boards, LEE in 
           various different states of emotions. He then looks closer at 
           a picture of LEE’S arm tattoo which reads...
           ‘LOVE LOOKS NOT WITH THE EYES, BUT WITH THE MIND.’

           INT. MIKE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           MIKE sits at the table surrounded by developed pictures. In 
           front of him sits his open laptop, with the home page open on 
           GOOGLE.

           He thinks, then writes something into GOOGLE and presses 
           search. The results page pops up and he scrolls through, 
           clicking on some of them. It becomes apparent it’s medication 
           for HIV.

           He sits back and reflects on this for a second, slightly 
           shocked by the discovery and secondly what he’s going to do 
           with the new found information. 

           He then returns to the laptop and begins to type into GOOGLE
           other subjects. McQueen HIV, McQueen drugs, McQueen
           Depression, McQueen Isabella Suicide. 

           Mike starts reading and then pointedly closes the screen 
           shut, instantly regretting his actions.

           INT. SADLERS WELLS AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           MIKE walks among a well-dressed crowd down the aisle of the 
           auditorium looking for his row. He then squeezes along, with 
           the odd person having to stand until he reaches his seat next 
           to which LEE is already sat waiting. The two men greet one 
           another but we can’t hear what they’re saying due to the 
           chatter of the crowd.

           INT. SADLERS WELLS AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           The dramatic orchestral score taken from Act 4 - three 
           minutes from the very end of the ballet - plays. 

           We look out on the audience watching the ballet, slowly 
           pulling in on LEE'S face. We stay on him for longer than is 
           comfortable. His face, transfixed, betrays every shifting 
           emotion.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY/NIGHT - MONTAGE

           The music continues as we see various shots over various days 
           of LEE creating the White and Black Swan pieces which will be 
           the grand finale to his collection.
           A MODEL stands in the middle of the room wearing nothing more 
           than a nude bodice and G-string and vertiginous heels as LEE 
           circles her sizing up what to do here.

           Various assistants pull out rolls of material and equipment 
           LEE might need. SARAH is stood with her notebook busy taking 
           notes as CAMILLA stands by assisting with pins and scissors. 

           LEE drapes beautiful white fabric over the MODEL, it’s fluid, 
           elegant and graceful. We circle him as he is handed pin after 
           pin by his assistants creating shape and form. MIKE all the 
           time capturing what he’s observing. White feathers are flung 
           out onto the floor. They are individually hand stitched to 
           the garment.

           The MODEL raises her arms to the sky and the white feathered 
           dressed is lowered over her head. She looks heartbreakingly 
           ethereal, as the team stand admiring her.

           Night descends on the studio. There’s a new MODEL, along with 
           SARAH, CAMILLA, MIKE and LEE who empties bags of black 
           feathers onto the floor. They all look completely exhausted. 
           Some are drinking cans of Red Bull or eating sweets to keep 
           going. SARAH measures the new MODEL while LEE cuts out the 
           pattern from a lengthy roll of black material. Again we see 
           him draping the material over the MODEL. It’s luxurious, 
           sensual, tender and fluid.

           LEE takes out the pins in his mouth and places them into the 
           dress. He’s beginning to look feverish and intense. The music 
           crescendos now.

           LEE circles the MODEL wondering what to do next, it’s not 
           working.

           Instead we see him ripping, tearing, cutting material with 
           hands, teeth, scissors. 

           Likewise we see the team, pinning, cutting, tearing feathers 
           out. Every component is coming together in perfect harmony. 
           The music, the coordinated movement, the humming rhythm of 
           work carried out in sync is an extraordinary thing to 
           witness. All the while MIKE continues documenting this 
           incredible feat of skilled teamwork.

           The team collapse one by one into their chairs looking at 
           what stands before them - The two MODELS stood in beautiful 
           black and white swan garments. 

           LEE stands in the centre of the studio. He knows he’s created 
           a masterpiece. 
           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - NIGHT

           MIKE sits uncomfortably as LEE does up the buckle of one of 
           his new skyscraper heels to MIKE’S foot.

                                 MIKE
                        What if I fall over?

                                 LEE
                        You fall, you fall.

                                 MIKE
                        What I don’t understand is why 
                        anyone would want to walk in 
                        something so high?

                                 LEE
                        Height gives you power. Stand up 
                        for me. Come on up. Up.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not sure that’s possible.

                                 LEE
                        You can’t appreciate a model’s job 
                        until you’ve walked in her shoes. 
                        Up you get. 

           MIKE stands back and tries to keep his balance.

                                 MIKE
                        Jesus...

                                 LEE
                        Walk to that wall and back.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not happening.

                                 LEE
                        Walk to the wall and back.

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        It’s either that or wear a dress.

           MIKE walks towards the wall slowly, as LEE picks up his 
           camera to take a shot.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Little quicker, Michael.
           Mike throws him the middle finger. Click. LEE takes the 
           photograph.

           LEE’s mobile phone rings. The caller ID reads JANET. LEE sits 
           back down and picks up the call.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Heya, you alright?

           MIKE reaches the wall and starts walking back.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Where is she? 

           MIKE sensing the change in LEE’S tone sits down. We now stay 
           on LEE as he hears the news.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        I see....

           A beat

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Will she...

           LEE’S finding it hard to not show his emotion in his voice. 
           He starts crying despite his best efforts not to.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, no, I’m still here.

           A beat.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Is Dad with you?

           A beat.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure I can see her like 
                        that...I know it’s just... Right, 
                        okay...No I’ll be there...Okay, 
                        bye. Yeah, bye.

           LEE cancels the call looking, slumping into his seat for 
           safety, numb.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           MIKE and RON sit next to one another in silence not knowing 
           what to say to one another, as medical staff wander past. 
           The windows are lined with tinsel as Christmas is soon 
           approaching.

                                 RON
                        They threw the game away today.

                        Always...Different game though now. 
                        People follow players not teams. 
                        When I was young you picked your 
                        team and you stuck with them. 
                        Whatever the season, whatever the 
                        outcome, however close to 
                        relegation you always stood by your 
                        team and they’d always see you 
                        through. Players come and go but 
                        the colours rarely change that’s 
                        what I say.

                        else...Wouldn’t know who I was 
                        without them.

                                 MIKE
                        Janet said they’re putting Joyce on 
                        dialysis...I didn’t know she had 
                        kidney problems. 

                                 RON
                        Why would you?

           MIKE searches for the most sensitive reply.

                                 MIKE
                        I mean, well Lee, he err never 
                        mentioned she was ill.
                                 RON
                        Maybe he didn’t mention it cause 
                        it’s got nothing to do with you. 

           RON’S frankness takes MIKE back a little.

                                 MIKE
                        No...No, I’m sorry -

                                 RON
                        Sorry for what? What you sorry for? 
                        Sorry for being here when you 
                        shouldn’t be? Or you sorry for 
                        coming into my house, my home 
                        without having the decency to shake 
                        my hand.

           MIKE just looks at RON blankly, unsure of how to respond to 
           this.

                                 RON (CONT’D)
                        What has to happen in a man’s life 
                        to end up being you, hmm? Having to 
                        come into someone else’s life 
                        because yours isn’t interesting 
                        enough? Or maybe you think spending 
                        a few months with my son and you’ll 
                        understand him? Well you won’t. 
                        I’ve spent a lifetime with him and 
                        he’s still a stranger to me. So 
                        good luck if you think you can do 
                        any better.

           A beat.

           MIKE gets up and walks away from RON, down the corridor. He 
           stops briefly at the window. He spots JANET asleep in the 
           corner armchair while LEE sits on the bed holding JOYCE’S 
           hand. She’s fast asleep in bed, wired up to machines. She 
           looks frail and a shade paler than when we last saw her. LEE 
           catches MIKE’S eye, looking like a lost boy. He then returns 
           his gaze to JOYCE as MIKE walks away.

           INT. MIKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MIKE lays restlessly in bed unable to sleep. After a few 
           moments he rolls over and rummages in a bag on the floor by 
           the side of the bed. He pulls out a packet of cigarettes and 
           lights one with a match illuminating his face. He sits in bed 
           smoking. It’s a release. 
           INT. STAIRWAY UP TO MCQUEEN STUDIO - MORNING

           From above we see MIKE walk into shot as he once again slowly 
           climbs the stairs up to the studio.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - MORNING

           We follow a tired looking MIKE as he walks through the 
           studio. For the first time we’re not hit by a barrage of 
           either music or the noise of machines. In fact it’s eerily 
           silent. There are hardly any workers present and those who 
           are, aren't doing much. No clothes are being made. Tools have 
           been put down. 

           MIKE walks past JEFF, who has just extricated himself from a 
           heated conversation with a very upset SARAH, who clocks MIKE 
           herself and hurriedly goes back to stitching a garment. 

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO KITCHEN - DAY

           MIKE makes a cup of tea while in conversation with JOHN who 
           sits on the counter sipping his drink.

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t know whether to call him 
                        or not?

                                 JOHN
                        Probably best to leave it for 
                        now... He’ll be back when he’s 
                        ready.

           A beat

                                 MIKE
                        Did any of you know Joyce was sick?

                                 JOHN
                        Umm, I don’t know if -

                                 MIKE
                        No it’s fine -

                                 JOHN
                        It’s just he tends to keep work and 
                        family separate.

                                 MIKE
                        Right.

           A beat.
                                 JOHN
                        Saying that, every show I’ve ever 
                        worked on Joyce has been there. 
                        Never missed one.

                                 MIKE
                        What about Ron?

                                 JOHN
                        I can’t recall him ever attending.

           MIKE takes a sip of his coffee, pondering the enigma that is 
           RON MCQUEEN.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Can you not tell him I said that?

           MIKE nods as JOHN exits the kitchen.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY.

           The sound of a phone ringing out. MIKE stands by a window, 
           mobile to his ear.

                                 LEE (V.O.)
                        This is Lee, leave a message.

           MIKE doesn’t know what to say, so after a few seconds hangs 
           up.

           EXT. LEE’S FLAT - DAY

           MIKE rings the intercom of a LEE’S FLAT. No answer. He rings 
           again.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 MIKE
                        Oh hi, it’s err, it’s Mike Poulter, 
                        who’s that?

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Janet.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, hi, I was err just checking 
                        Lee’s alright?

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        He’s fine.
           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        We’re all a little worried about 
                        him at the studio.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        He’s fine. I’m looking after him.

           MIKE looks around at the traffic thinking of what to say 
           before hitting the intercom again.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe I could come up and see him?

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        He doesn’t want to see anyone at 
                        the moment Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe if you told him I was here?

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        He doesn’t want to see anyone.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll try tomorrow then.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Why?

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Because I’m worried about him.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        If you’re worried you wouldn’t be 
                        here trying to take pictures of 
                        him.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m - I’m not here to take 
                        pictures. 

                                 JANET
                        But that’s what you do isn’t it? 
                        Take pictures of people suffering?

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not -
           The intercom cuts out. Deflated, he breathes out and shakes 
           his head in disbelief before walking away from the flat and 
           out of shot.

           INT. TUBE CARRIAGE- DAY

           MIKE stands on a packed tube carriage with his camera round 
           his neck. A few tourists wearing Santa hats are taking 
           selfies of themselves with their mobile phones.

           We hear the overhead announcement that the train is pulling 
           into Stratford and the other lines commuters can change to at 
           this station. 

           EXT. BIGGERSTAFF ROAD - DAY.

           MIKE walks through LEE’S old estate. It’s a sharp contrast to 
           Hornchurch, a lot more urban. There are three giant council 
           blocks, lots of rubbish on the streets and surly teenagers 
           around. He comes to LEE’S street and stands outside the 
           house. It’s changed since the McQueens were there, but still 
           looks small and humble.

           EXT. BIGGERSTAFF ROAD - DAY

           MIKE approaches the tower block behind the McQUEENS old 
           residency. As he approaches it a woman with a pram, shopping 
           bags and a small toddler is struggling to get through the 
           main entrance doorway. MIKE speeds up a little and helps the 
           WOMAN with her bags and gains entry.

           EXT. ROOF OF COUNCIL BLOCK - DAY

           MIKE stands taking in the view of Stratford, the birds flying 
           in their formations. He raises the camera to his eye -

           INT. MIKE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Channels of a television are being flicked through by MIKE 
           sat on his sofa drinking a beer. Most of the programmes are 
           to do with NEW YEAR. He stops on the BBC counting down from 
           the South Bank. Fireworks go off. MIKE closes his eyes for a 
           few seconds then turns off the television. He sits there in 
           the silence...The sound of a telephone.
           INT. MIKE’S HALLWAY - DAY

           MIKE walks into the hallway and picks up the phone from the 
           wall.

                                 MIKE
                        Hello?

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - MORNING

           MIKE walks through the studio, there’s a distinct change in 
           atmosphere. Work has recommenced. There are a number of 
           models being fitted into clothes, while an area is being 
           cleared for a walk way with chairs at the end for staff who 
           are assembling, with their notepads and electronics.

           JUICE runs up to MIKE who gives him a welcome pat. He looks 
           across the studio and sees LEE deep in conversation with 
           SARAH and ANNALISE, he looks tired, run down and continually 
           smoking.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - LATER

           There is a hushed silence as the whole MCQUEEN team have 
           assembled(including ANNALISE) sitting at the bottom of a 
           makeshift walkway. LEE sits centre, with SARAH and CAMILLA 
           next to him. MIKE stands to the side assembling his camera.

           Opposite the staff is a line up of models wearing some of the 
           new designs. They are staggeringly beautiful, very tall, and 
           yet there is a sharpness to them.

                                 LEE
                        And go.

           ALINKA walks from the back wearing the most beautiful red 
           dress with black birds printed on it. She stops in front of 
           LEE and his team.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Turn.

           ALINKA turns.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Go have your Polaroid taken. Next.

           ALINKA goes to another part of the studio, and has her 
           polaroid taken by an assistant up against a wall.

           Meanwhile, another MODEL walks forward and stops. 
                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Turn.

           The MODEL turns. LEE leans forward, there’s a problem. He 
           gets up and holds out his hand. SARAH gives him a pin.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        More.

           LEE pins the material while SARAH hands him two more pins, 
           which LEE puts around the waist. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Polaroid. Next.

           MODEL 2 walks forward and stops in the centre.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Good. Next.

           MODEL 2 goes to have her polaroid taken while GRACE a pale, 
           tall, freckly, ginger duckling who hasn’t the confidence yet 
           to know she’s a swan, walks towards LEE.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Stop. 

           GRACE stops slightly unsure of the protocol.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Go back and walk properly.

           GRACE returns to her spot and proceeds to walk again.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Stop...Again.

           GRACE nervously returns to her spot and proceeds to walk 
           again...She barely gets three strides in.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Again.

           GRACE returns. She’s physically shaking. He begins her walk -

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Again.

           GRACE returns to the spot. The team are all looking nervous 
           for her. Heads down. They know what’s coming. GRACE breathes 
           in and walks a few steps.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Again.
           Once more GRACE returns to the line turns and then walks. 
           Finally she gets to the middle and stops waiting for LEE’S 
           instruction. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 GRACE
                        Grace.

                                 LEE
                        So everyone can hear you?

                                 GRACE
                        Grace.

                                 LEE
                        How old are you?

                                 GRACE
                        Sixteen.

                                 LEE
                        Sixteen?

                                 GRACE
                        Uhhm.

                                 LEE
                        You ever walked for a fashion house 
                        before?

                                 GRACE
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        This your first one?

                                 GRACE
                        Yes.

                                 LEE
                        Name two of my shows.

           A beat.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Two of my shows. Name them.

           A beat.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Sarah how many shows have I done?
                                 SARAH
                        Thirty three.

                                 LEE
                        Two’s easy no? What are they?

                                 GRACE
                        Umm -

                                 LEE
                        What’s my silhouette? 

                                 GRACE
                        Silhouette?

                                 LEE
                        Describe a McQueen woman to me.

                                 GRACE
                        Sorry?

                                 LEE
                        Characteristics. Adjectives.
                        You know what an adjective is 
                        right?

                                 GRACE
                        Yes.

                                 LEE
                        Then name one.

                                 GRACE
                        Strong?

                                 LEE
                        What else?

                                 ANNALISE
                        Lee -

           LEE raises his hand to stop ANNALISE continuing.

                                 LEE
                        What else?

                                 GRACE
                        Powerful?

                                 LEE
                        What else?

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t know.
                                 LEE
                        Yes you do. What else?

                                 GRACE
                        Umm.

                                 LEE
                        WHAT ELSE?

                                 GRACE
                        Strong!

                                 LEE
                        You already said that. What else?

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t know.

                                 LEE
                        You don’t know?

                                 GRACE
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        Why don’t you know?

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t know.

                                 LEE
                        If you don’t know then how do you 
                        think you’re going to be one? Walk 
                        like one? Inhabit one? What is it? 
                        You think you can just turn up here 
                        in my studio, on my time and walk 
                        around this room like you haven’t 
                        got a fucking thought in your head? 
                        You better be crying because you 
                        care not because you’re frightened. 
                        Are you frightened or do you care 
                        about what we’re trying to achieve 
                        here? 

                                 GRACE
                        I care.

                                 LEE
                        It’s a privilege to walk in my 
                        clothes. What is it? 

                                 GRACE
                        A privilege.
                                 LEE
                        Louder.

                                 GRACE
                        A privilege!

                                 LEE
                        THEN FUCKING WALK LIKE THAT THEN!

           A beat.

           GRACE holds her head up high and walks her best circuit yet. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Better...

           LEE walks off in the direction of the toilets. ANNALISE runs 
           up to GRACE to try and comfort her, while the rest of the 
           team disperse mumbling to one another. We track MIKE who 
           walks through the studio following LEE into...

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO TOILETS - CONTINUOUS

           The toilets, where LEE is at the sink taking cocaine. 

                                 LEE
                        You here to judge me or take my 
                        picture?

           LEE takes another line of coke and washing his face with 
           water from the tap, looking at the mirror, dabbing his face 
           down with paper. MIKE just stands there for a second, taking 
           in the view of a man choosing to self destruct. 

                                 MIKE
                        How’s Joyce?

                                 LEE
                        Never better. Thanks for 
                        acknowledging that. You can go now.

                                 MIKE
                        I appreciate things are difficult 
                        for you -

                                 LEE
                        Appreciate your job is to document, 
                        not comment but hey, if you wanna 
                        have an opinion go right ahead -

                                 MIKE
                        Look if this helps you, makes your 
                        work better that’s your business.
                                 LEE
                        Sure is.

                                 MIKE
                        But you can’t treat people the way 
                        you treated that girl.

                                 LEE
                        I can treat people anyway I want 
                        because everyone knows I make them 
                        better at what they do.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s the most honest thing you’ve 
                        said to me in months.

                                 LEE
                        You don’t think I’ve been honest 
                        with you?

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        You think I’m adopting some fucking 
                        persona around you?

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 LEE
                        I have told you things -

                                 MIKE
                        Things you wanted me to hear so you 
                        can create a version of yourself 
                        you actually like.

                                 LEE
                        What is it you think I’m not 
                        telling you then?

                                 MIKE
                        Forget it.

                                 LEE
                        No come on, if you think you know 
                        something then ask me. Don’t 
                        fucking walk away from me you cunt. 
                        Ask me your fucking question.

                                 MIKE
                        I saw your medication in your 
                        bathroom cabinet. What is it?
           LEE is visibly shocked and then quietly upset by the 
           question. MIKE’S deception hits a raw nerve emotionally. 
           Loyalty is something he values above anything else.

                                 LEE
                        I invited you into my house, into 
                        my home. Let you into my life 
                        because I trusted you. I trusted 
                        you.

                                    MIKE
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were 
                        positive?

                                 LEE
                        There was no reason to.

                                 MIKE
                        It changes everything.

                                 LEE
                        Changes nothing. Get out of my 
                        face. 

                       LEE (CONT’D)
           Out of my fucking face.
                                                          MIKE
                                              Changes how you see things. 
                                              Your approach. Your work.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        I’m a faggot who grew up in the 
                        fucking eighties so sex and death 
                        are always gonna be related. As are 
                        the parts of me that are dark and 
                        ugly and messy which you’ve loved 
                        questioning me about so then you 
                        don’t have to ask anything of 
                        yourself. Because the truth is you 
                        are scared to live.

           LEE gets up in MIKE’S face

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        You are scared to be alive.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not true. 
                                 LEE
                        You don’t know how to be here 
                        anymore than I do. Is that honest 
                        enough for you?

           The two men intensely stare at each other, LEE slightly backs 
           away. MIKE takes a few breaths, gathering his composure. We 
           then follow MIKE as he walks past LEE exiting the bathroom.

           EXT. LAYBY - DAY

           MIKE’S Volvo sits in the layby, rain slamming down on the 
           window shield.

           EXT. COUNTRY HILLSIDE - DAY

           MIKE treks though the muddy landscape, rain pouring down on 
           his rainmack. After a while we see him come to a stop. He 
           spots something and squats down low. We see a HIND and its 
           FAWN walk into the shot who quickly spot MIKE and stop still. 
           MIKE is transfixed by the mother and baby and they are on 
           him.

           MIKE raises his camera to his eye. Click. The HIND and FAWN 
           run back into the woodland. MIKE lowers his camera watching 
           them go. He knows exactly what he needs to do next.

           EXT. ROWAN WALK - NIGHT

           From behind we follow MIKE walking along the familiar 
           residential road holding a bunch of flowers in his hand. He 
           turns into the driveway approaching the front door. He clocks 
           that RON’S cab isn’t there. He steps up and rings the door 
           bell.

           INT. JOYCE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           JOYCE sits in her armchair, wearing a baby blue dressing 
           gown, clutching a cup of tea smoking a cigarette, thinking 
           about the proposition that’s been put to her. This is the 
           most frail we’ve seen her.

           MIKE sits on the sofa holding his cup of tea, as the 
           television flickers in the background playing something along 
           the lines of Family Fortunes or Coronation Street. There’s a 
           selection of custard creams on a plate on the table.

           JOYCE exhales her cigarette.
                                 JOYCE
                        What’s Lee think about all this?

                                 MIKE
                        I wanted to run it past you first.

           JOYCE takes another drag on her cigarette, thinking.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m not sure.

                                 MIKE
                        Why not?

                                 JOYCE
                        You want one?

           JOYCE offers MIKE a cigarette.

                                 MIKE
                        Given up.

                                 JOYCE
                        Me and you both.

           JOYCE takes another drag on her smoke.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a nice idea...I mean it’s 
                        something I would have liked to 
                        have done. I would have liked to 
                        have done something like that. So 
                        many questions I’d like to ask. 
                        Mind you knowing Lee he wouldn’t 
                        want me asking most of them.

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Ron at work?

                                 JOYCE
                        Yeah, so help yourself to a biccie.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m alright.

                                 JOYCE
                        Go on, it stops me from eating 
                        them.

           MIKE takes a biscuit to appease her.
                                 MIKE
                        You seen much of Lee recently?

                                 JOYCE
                        We speak on the phone...How’s the 
                        collection coming together?

                                 MIKE
                        Okay...I think he’s a little 
                        unfocused at the moment.

                                 JOYCE
                        Well he’s always been like that. 
                        Too many ideas. Gets that from me.

           A beat.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t suppose he’s err - got a 
                        special friend at the moment?

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t think so...You know, I 
                        think if you did this it would be a 
                        good distraction for him.

                                 JOYCE
                        Distraction from what?

           MIKE takes a cigarette and lights it while JOYCE watches on. 
           She knows her son’s fallen off the wagon again.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        How bad is he?

                                 MIKE
                        He’s not in a good way...You said 
                        he hasn’t visited in a while?

                                 JOYCE
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe doing this interview might be 
                        a good way to visit him...Don’t you 
                        think?

           A concerned JOYCE sits back in her chair, thinking what would 
           be best for her son.
           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY 

           CONTINUING ON FROM THE FIRST SCENE

           LEE is on camera but looking to the side -

                                 LEE
                        Do you need a hand?

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        I’m fine. I’m fine.

           JOYCE sits down next to LEE. She is dressed up in a jacket 
           and skirt and holding a few sheets of paper with handwritten 
           questions.

                                 LEE
                        Can I look at these?

                                 JOYCE
                        No you flaming well can’t.

           JOYCE hits LEE playfully with her notes.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           LEE is answering JOYCE’S questions, he’s relaxed a little.

                                 LEE
                        What makes me proud? 

                                 JOYCE
                        Yeah.

                                 LEE
                        Well you make me proud.

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh get away - 

                                                     JOYCE (CONT'D)
                            LEE
           It’s true. It is.
                                              With you. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Well then what makes you furious?

                                 LEE
                        You do.

           LEE laughs as JOYCE hits him with her notes.
                                 JOYCE
                        (TO MIKE) I said he wouldn’t take 
                        this seriously -

                                 LEE
                        Go on, next one. Come on.

                                 JOYCE
                        As you know, I’m a big Simply Red 
                        and Elton John fan.

                                 LEE
                        I wouldn’t admit to that on camera 
                        mum. You don’t who’s gonna see 
                        this.

                                 JOYCE
                        Who are your favourite artists?

                                 LEE
                        As in singers?

                                 JOYCE
                        Yeah, well, y'know, groups -

                            LEE
           Oh I dunno. 
                                                     JOYCE (CONT'D)
                                              Because at one time, you were 
                                              very much into classical 
                                              music. 

                                 LEE
                        Ask me something else.

                                 JOYCE
                        Okay, so you’ve travelled round the 
                        world -

                                 LEE
                        Uhhm.

                                 JOYCE
                        But you still haven’t been to the 
                        Isle of Skye yet, which is the root 
                        of your McQueen heritage. So are 
                        you ever gonna visit it?

                                 LEE
                        Mmm ... yeah. Sure.

           LEE looks at MIKE knowing he’s been caught out.

                                 JOYCE
                        In the near future? 
                                 LEE
                        Yes.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

                                 JOYCE
                        If you hadn't trained on Savile 
                        Row, how would you have entered the 
                        fashion industry? 

                                 LEE
                        I'd have slept my way there.

                                 JOYCE
                        Lee -

                                 LEE
                        I’m joking, I’m joking. I’d err, oh 
                        God I dunno, I’d find other ways of 
                        getting into it.

                                 JOYCE
                        Do you ever look at something else 
                        and say, "I could have done that"? 

                                 LEE
                        Photo-journalism.

                                 JOYCE
                        Why?

                                 LEE
                        Cause I think it captures a moment 
                        in time that reflects where we are. 

                                 JOYCE
                        What about an architect?

                                 LEE
                        No patience for it.

                                 JOYCE
                        If you lost all this tomorrow, all 
                        the money and security -

                            LEE
           Uhhm -
                                                     JOYCE (CONT'D)
                                              What would be the first thing 
                                              you would do?

                                 LEE
                        Sleep. 
                                 JOYCE
                        See, I thought you’d say go on 
                        holiday. 

                                 LEE
                        How can I go on holiday if I’ve 
                        lost it all?

                                 JOYCE
                        (Laughing)
                        Oh, I didn’t think of that!

                                 LEE
                        Let me ask you one. 

                                 JOYCE
                        No hang on, what’s the err, what do 
                        you think is a side to you, you 
                        rarely let people see?

                                 LEE
                        I dunno, you tell me.

           JOYCE thinks about it for a second.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’d say it’s how kind you are. You 
                        can be really kind and I don’t 
                        think you want people to know that 
                        about you, and I have no idea why 
                        that is.

           LEE is unable to respond. He lowers his head slightly, 
           looking down at the floor to stop himself from getting 
           emotional. 

           JOYCE takes her son’s hand and squeezes it.

           MIKE takes a picture of them together.

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           We see LEE (smoking as usual) with MIKE sitting on top of a 
           table watching JOYCE with PHILIP TREACY trying on some 
           beautiful hats.

                                 LEE
                        You wouldn’t know she was ill to 
                        look at her.

           A beat.
           LEE hands MIKE an invitation to the show. The title of which 
           reads THE HORN OF PLENTY : EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK. 
           DEDICATED TO MY MOTHER. The image on the front is the HENDRIK 
           KERSTEN’S portrait.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t get the title.

                                 LEE
                        First show, what was it?

                                 MIKE
                        Jack the Ripper.

                                 LEE
                        That’s the name of the pub his 
                        final victim was last seen in 
                        before her murder.

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Cheerful then.

           LEE laughs. The bond between the two men is restored to a 
           degree.

                                 LEE
                        Twat.

           INT. MIKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MIKE unzips his empty suitcase on the bed. He then opens his 
           wardrobe. There are only five or six hangers holding clothes. 
           He takes the clothes and places them down in the suitcase 
           (Still on hangers).

           INT. MIKE’S HALLWAY - NIGHT

           MIKE stands in the hallways, turning off all the lights. 
           Darkness.

           INT. PRIVATE CAR - EARLY MORNING

           LEE & MIKE sit in the back seat of a fancy car driving 
           through Paris. It’s a sharp contrast to London. Even the 
           weather is starting to show signs of very early Spring.
           INT. PALAIS OMNISPORTS DE PARIS-BERCY - MORNING

           LEE & MIKE walk into the most gigantic sports arena. In the 
           centre of which is CAT, SAM, CAMILLA & JOHN looking at the 
           centerpiece of past MCQUEEN props all painted black, piled 
           sky high with the broken mirror flooring.

           LEE makes his way over greeting every one and then starts 
           inspecting the set, all the props piled together and the 
           cracked mirrored flooring. He dances on it like a little boy.

           INT. PALAIS OMNISPORTS DE PARIS-BERCY - DAY

           LEE sits at the sound and lighting desk drinking a Starbucks 
           with JOHN in the auditorium wearing cans. BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE by 
           MARILYN MANSON is blaring. The lights on the rubbish tip are 
           blue. Some of the creative team are walking around the space 
           as stand-ins for the models. The music cuts out.

                                 LEE
                        Can we try red?

           The lights change to red. LEE thinks about it. He’s not sure.

           INT. PALAIS OMNISPORTS DE PARIS-BERCY - DAY

           The MODELS circuit the space (at intervals) in their own 
           clothes but with the shoes that they will be wearing for the 
           show. LEE (stop watch in hand), SARAH & SAM stand on the 
           perimeter of the performance space watching the girls pass.

                                 LEE
                        (To Sarah)
                        Thirty seconds needs to come off.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

           MIKE walks around the backstage area which is being assembled 
           with mirrors, lights, tables. Television monitors are being 
           turned on showing us what’s happening on the stage.

           He walks over to a quiet corner where a make up artist is 
           doing a trial run on a MODEL. Pale white faces and lipstick. 
           LEE looks unhappy with the lipstick and gestures to take it.

                                 LEE
                        Can I?

           LEE takes the lipstick and draws around the model’s lips so 
           she looks like a clown.
                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Better.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER

           LEE is on his knees cutting away at a dress that a model is 
           wearing with CAMILLA assisting. SARAH meanwhile is going 
           through the rail of garments as MIKE photographs LEE. CAT 
           enters, holding her clipboard -

                                 CAT
                        Philip’s ready when you are.

                                 LEE
                        Okay.

           SARAH goes back through the rail, looking bemused.

                                 SARAH
                        Why are we seven dresses short?

           LEE stops what he’s doing and nails CAT with a piercing stare 
           who looks like she wants to fade away.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER

           A MODEL is sat down with PHILIP TREACY who is gaffa-taping a 
           plastic bag to her head. They have the HENDRIK KERSTEN 
           painting of a woman with a plastic bag over her head attached 
           to the mirror for reference. Once again CAMILLA and LEE 
           observe...After a while PHILIP finishes.

                                 PHILIP
                        Happy with that?

                                 LEE
                        Always.

           INT. MCDONALDS - NIGHT

           LEE and MIKE sit opposite one another eating Big Macs and 
           chips in a moderately busy McDonalds. MIKE is drinking a COKE 
           while LEE has a Strawberry Milkshake.

                                 MIKE
                        Why’d you call them the lost years?

                                 LEE
                        Givenchy?
                                 MIKE
                        Uhhm.

           LEE eats into his burger thinking about it and then starts 
           speaking with his mouth full. 

                                 LEE
                        It was like one of those 
                        relationships where you both really 
                        need the other but would be so much 
                        better off alone.

                                 MIKE
                        How old were you when you took the 
                        job?

                                 LEE
                        Twenty seven.

                                 MIKE
                        Young.

                                 LEE
                        Too young. Having all that 
                        responsibility’s not good for you.

                                 MIKE
                        Why d’you say that?

                                 LEE
                        Cause I was like that age, running 
                        this huge couture house which I 
                        knew fuck all about. Running my own 
                        label back in London, and I was 
                        making fourteen collections a year. 
                        Too much.

                                 MIKE
                        Then why do it?

                                 LEE
                        They offered me fuck loads of 
                        money...Passez la ketchup, sale 
                        cochon.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 LEE
                        Pass the ketchup you dirty pig.

           MIKE passes LEE the ketchup.
                                 MIKE
                        Five years in Paris and that’s what 
                        you came away with?

                                 LEE
                        Pretty much.

           INT. LEE’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT.

           MIKE pins up the last photograph of the collection he’s made 
           on the wall of this vast expensive antique looking hotel 
           suite.

           We now see the wall in all its glory. Hundreds of photographs 
           that MIKE has taken over the last few months.

           LEE looks on slightly dumbfounded by the scale and breath. He 
           looks through them, seeing the creative process through 
           MIKE’S eyes. 

           He begins to take down some pictures. MIKE picks one up.

                                 MIKE
                        Why not this one?

                                 LEE
                        I don’t look happy enough.

           LEE continues looking and taking down but holding onto 
           pictures of Biggerstaff Road, his old house, the view from 
           the block of flats, the birds, Janet’s birthday, the family 
           portrait, himself and ANNALISE in Soho, the team messing 
           around during meetings, his dogs, the picture of him and 
           Joyce, and lastly the pictures of the landscapes. It’s clear 
           that he’s trying to keep his emotions in.

           He looks down at the landscape picture of the storm clouds.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s wrong?

           LEE doesn’t know how to express what he’s thinking...

                                 LEE
                        These say more about me then any of 
                        the other ones.

           MIKE picks out a picture of LEE creating a piece from the 
           show, the expression on LEE’s face focused and intense. LEE 
           looks at the picture of himself.
           INT. LEE’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           LEE and MIKE lie on the bed together, head and feet in 
           opposite directions, looking up at the ceiling.

                                 LEE
                        Maybe none of it matters.

           A beat.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like anyone’s gonna care 
                        years from now, so what’s the point 
                        of all the stress it takes to do 
                        this? 

           A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        I used to ask myself if I had the 
                        right to take the pictures I took. 
                        How to justify my presence amongst 
                        so much misery and death...But I 
                        also know that if I really believed 
                        what I was doing was meaningless I 
                        wouldn’t do it.

           A beat.

                                 LEE
                        I feel lost...I thought by now I 
                        might understand myself a bit 
                        better. Gotten away from stuff.

                                 MIKE
                        What stuff?

                                 LEE
                        Being the fat kid with bad teeth. 
                        Little faggot. Being at home, 
                        seeing things I shouldn’t have 
                        seen.

                                 MIKE
                        What things?

           A beat.

                                 LEE
                        When I was young I used to see 
                        Janet’s late husband knocking her 
                        about. I was only eight or nine at 
                        the time. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        And when he was done with her he’d 
                        put his attention on me in ways you 
                        don’t understand when you’re that 
                        young.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LEE
                        Just the way it is 
                        really...Sometimes I wonder if he 
                        hadn’t done those things I probably 
                        wouldn’t be doing all this and 
                        maybe I’d be all the better for it.

                                 MIKE
                        Then go do something else.

                                 LEE
                        Maybe I’ll buy myself some land. 
                        Few animals -

                                 MIKE
                        What animals?

                                 LEE
                        Pigs. Sheep. I’ll name one after 
                        you if you’re lucky. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’ll get bored.

                                 LEE
                        No I won’t.

                                 MIKE
                        And fat.

                                 LEE
                        I’m already fat.

           LEE looks back up at the ceiling. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not worried about you...You’ll 
                        figure things out.

           A beat.

                                 LEE
                        All clothes are is armour...That’s 
                        all they are. 

           The men stay lying there.
           INT. MIKE’S HOTEL BATHROOM - MORNING.

           MIKE showers himself. We see a few nasty war wounds on his 
           body.

           INT. MIKE’S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           MIKE does up his shirt buttons when he hears a knock at the 
           door. 

                                 MIKE
                        One second.

           MIKE throws on his trousers and walks over to the door 
           opening it -

           INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           A large Alexander McQueen box sits outside the door. He looks 
           down the corridor but no one’s there. He picks up the box and 
           takes it back inside his room.

           INT. MIKE’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           MIKE opens the box on his bed. Inside is a beautiful McQueen
           suit.

           INT. STAGE RIGHT - DAY

           MIKE (in his pristine suit) walks around the perimeter of the 
           auditorium camera in hand, fiddling with his tie. The show is 
           pre-set, light floods the pile of props built up like a 
           mountain of trash in the middle of the stage.

           He witnesses the circus which has come to town. VIPS (we 
           don’t see their faces) are having their photos taken. Flashes 
           here there and everywhere erupt and dazzle us. 

           People mill around, eccentrics dressed to the nines air 
           kissing one another to death. 

           Bored security guards pace about the perimeter while SAM 
           talks into her walkie talkie like this is a covert operation.

           We see the bay of press heaving like a lion waiting to catch 
           its prey at the bottom of the catwalk, hungry for the kill - 
           or for a model to fall flat on her face.

           MIKE continues walking showing his backstage pass to the 
           security as he enters  -
           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Backstage, which is another level of craziness. There are 
           people milling around everywhere. Film crews, journalists, 
           photographers. It’s a feast for the eyes.

           MIKE passes CAT who sits by four large monitors talking on 
           her headset, going through cues. While an assistant is busy 
           sticking pictures of the models in order for the walk out 
           board.

           MIKE continues walking past a row of models all having the 
           finishing touches to their make-up done. Some are playing 
           with their phones, others are sat gossiping or simply zoned 
           out listening to music on their I-pods.

           MIKE pushes through a door and...

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Walks down a corridor where assistants run past with clothes. 
           He then turns into -

           INT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The GREEN ROOM where LEE & SARAH are on the floor stitching a 
           dress to a model. CAMILLA is in the midst of a conversation.

                                 LEE
                        So what does that mean?

                                 CAMILLA
                        All I know is the dresses still 
                        haven’t arrived.

                                 LEE
                        Fucks sake. Sarah, can you finish 
                        this?

                                 SARAH
                        Sure.

           LEE gets up off the floor and starts walking with CAMILLA, 
           MIKE trails them all the time.

                                 CAMILLA
                        We tracked them down -

                                 LEE
                        Mike, stay with me.
                                 CAMILLA
                        But the courier’s now stuck in 
                        traffic.

                                 LEE
                        So whose fault is it?

           They walk out of the room back down into the -

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

                                 LEE
                        Nice suit by the way.

                                 CAMILLA
                        It’s nobody’s fault.

                                 LEE
                        Who’s to fucking blame?

                                 CAMILLA
                        I’m not telling you.

                                 LEE
                        How long until they’re here?

                                 CAMILLA
                        Not long.

                                 LEE
                        I didn’t hear an answer in there.

           LEE pushes through the doors walking into -

           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The main backstage area.

                                 CAMILLA
                        Fifteen minutes. 

                                 LEE
                        The show starts in ten.

                                 CAMILLA
                        We always go up late.

           SAM comes up to LEE holding a clipboard.

                                 LEE
                        What is it?
                                 SAM
                        You know about the dresses?

                                 LEE
                        We’re not starting late.

           LEE stops at a model.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Stand up for me.

           LEE begins ripping a detail from her dress.

                                 SAM
                        People expect us to go up late.

                                 LEE
                        People expect us to defy their 
                        expectations. Try defying mine 
                        otherwise I’ll cancel the show.

           JEFF walks into shot unsure of what’s going on but concerned 
           it doesn’t sound good.

                                 JEFF
                        I need a word.

                                 LEE
                        Will two do you? 

                                 SAM
                        We’re not cancelling the show.

                                 JEFF
                        Why are you saying that?

                                 SAM
                        Everything’s fine.

                                 JEFF
                        Doesn’t sound fine.

                                 LEE
                        Will be when the clothes are. Walk 
                        with me. Mike you got any gum?

           MIKE searches for some gum and hands LEE one.

                                 JEFF
                        You want to tell me why you didn’t 
                        attend the press call this morning?
                                 LEE
                        I had this idea of letting the 
                        journalists form their own opinions 
                        rather than me telling them what 
                        they should know. (TO MIKE) Thanks. 

                                 JEFF.
                        We’ve arranged a photo call 
                        straight after the show and then 
                        some questions from the press. I 
                        need you to show up and be polite. 
                        Do you think you’re capable of 
                        that?

                                 LEE
                        I couldn’t think of anything I’d 
                        rather do. I need this.

           LEE takes JEFF’S can of coke and looks for PHILIP.

                                 JEFF
                        We can’t afford bad press.

                                 LEE
                        Well no we can’t afford anything 
                        can we? Out of interest do you have 
                        any idea how much of my own money 
                        I’ve put into this show? To make 
                        this happen?

                                 JEFF
                        All I’m doing is protecting you and 
                        your staff who by all accounts were 
                        working on this for weeks when you 
                        were nowhere to be found. Do you 
                        want to tell me about that?

           A beat.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t think so. See you after the 
                        show.

           JEFF leaves. LEE downs the can of coke as CAT appears.

                                 CAT
                        Lee your mum’s in the Greenroom.

                                 LEE
                        One second. I want us to use this 
                        in the hair.

                                 HAIR ASSISTANT
                        How?
           LEE grabs the models hair and raps it round the Coke can.

                                 LEE
                        Is something like this possible?

                                 HAIR ASSISTANT
                        Should be.

                                 LEE
                        Do as many as you can. Cat your 
                        monitors are down.

           The monitors have all gone from clear images of a stage to a 
           snowstorm of black and white.

                                 CAT
                        Seven minutes. Fuck.

           LEE walks past ALINKA wearing the BLACK SWAN dress.

                                 LEE
                        You able to breathe?

                                 ALINKA
                        Just about.

           LEE gestures towards the flowers sat on her dresser.

                                 LEE
                        Can I take these?

                                 ALINKA
                        They’re from you.

           LEE picks up the flowers as we follow him circuit the 
           backstage area. He spots GRACE sitting alone and looking a 
           little overwhelmed as the circus swells around her. 

           Grace looks up at LEE holding out the flowers.

                                 LEE
                        Prove me wrong.

           LEE hands a slightly stunned GRACE the bouquet of flowers and 
           continues walking away as he pulls out a packet of 
           cigarettes.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        You got a light?

           MIKE hands him a light as they walk through the door, into 
           the -
           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Corridor where some people pass by saying Good Luck to LEE 
           who pushes through a fire escape into -

           EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           A small courtyard filled with rubbish. LEE lights his 
           cigarette and takes a few moments to compose himself as MIKE 
           stands by watching him. 

                                 MIKE
                        You alright?

           LEE nods but then quickly starts to tear up. MIKE unsure of 
           what to do approaches him and gently places his hand on his 
           shoulder.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be great.

           LEE nods and tries to compose himself. He wipes his faces, 
           takes one quick inhale on his cigarette and stubs it out.

                                 LEE
                        Yeah.

           LEE followed by MIKE returns through the FIRE EXIT into -

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           The corridor which he walks down before turning into -

           INT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Green Room where SARAH is fitting another model which 
           ANNALISE is observing. Meanwhile JOYCE is sat down drinking 
           some tea with JANET. LEE’S dogs are also running amuck.  LEE 
           gives JOYCE and JANET a hug and a kiss.

                                 LEE
                        Hey mum. You alright?

                                 JOYCE
                        Fine, I’m fine.

                                 LEE
                        You look lovely. Jan.

           ANNALISE gives LEE a hug.
                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        You alright love?

                                 ANNALISE
                        It’s looking great.

                                 LEE
                        You think?

                                 ANNALISE
                        Best yet.

                                 JANET
                        How you feeling.

                                 LEE
                        Good. Yeah. Great. Sarah, how long 
                        on this?

                                 SARAH
                        One minute.

                                 LEE
                        Have you been shown where you’re 
                        sitting?

                                 ANNALISE
                        We’re fine, don’t worry about us.

           CAMILLA enters the room.

                                 CAMILLA
                        The dresses are here.

                                 LEE
                        Okay. Okay, I’ve got to go. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Good luck.

                                 LEE
                        (To Joyce)
                        Love you. 

           LEE kisses his mother again and leaves the room followed by 
           CAMILLA & SARAH. 

           MIKE nods his head and continues out the room leaving JOYCE & 
           JANET, & ANNALISE behind turning into the -

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Corridor with speed and pushes through the double doors into -
           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A barrage of backstage noise and activity. LEE, SARAH, SAM, 
           CAMILLA, and some other assistants are already dressing some 
           naked models with a rail of clothes close by. 

                                 CAT
                        Two minutes everyone.

                                 LEE
                        Out the way. Move, move, move. 

           MIKE watches on as MODELS line up preparing to take to the 
           catwalk wearing the most stunning creations. Meanwhile the 
           rest of the team continue frantically getting the other seven 
           models into their dresses. None of them give a shit how they 
           look. There is sweat pouring off them, dripping make-up, it’s 
           all pretty grim but all hands are on deck now. They are 
           racing against the clock which reads 11.58. 

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Move.

           LEE takes a dress from an assistant and puts in on the model, 
           making sure it falls the right way. He isn’t happy with how 
           it looks.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Scissors.

           The assistant gives LEE a pair of scissors and he starts 
           cutting away at the dress, it’s a radical move but he’s in 
           full control, pouring himself into his work. He is a master, 
           working so fast but precise, violent but elegant. Members of 
           the team and other MODELS can’t quite believe what they’re 
           encountering. It really is quite beautiful to watch. All the 
           while MIKE continues shooting away knowing he is capturing 
           gold. The clock reads 11.59.

                                 CAT
                        Front of House one minute to stand 
                        by please.

           The team frantically get the models zipped up and stage 
           ready, it’s like a relay race now. Scissors and needles are 
           being passed over like batons. MAKE UP ARTISTS are finalizing 
           the MODELS look. Hairspray is smothering everyone. Everyone 
           is on overdrive. 

                                 LEE
                        Go.

           LEE sends his model to the line up and runs over to finalise 
           the other six models looks with SARAH and CAMILLA.
           MIKE looks over at the monitors where CAT is sat.

                                 CAT
                        LX on standby...And three, two, 
                        one.

           On the monitors MIKE sees the lights start to change colour 
           as AUDIENCE members all start to turn to each other, hoping 
           they are about to witness something extraordinary. There is a 
           scurry of phones being whipped out from bags and held aloft. 

           MIKE turns his gaze back to 

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Ten seconds.

           LEE runs down the line of models throwing them words of 
           encouragement, respect and adoration. He reaches the front of 
           the line where GRACE stands, she looks at him. He rubs in 
           some make up on her face and then gives her a wink. 

                                 SAM 
                        We ready?

                                 CAT
                        You happy?

                                 LEE
                        (Smiling)
                        Never happy.

                                 CAT
                        We have a green. Good luck 
                        everybody!

           The whole creative team huddle round the monitor to watch the 
           show. The nervous energy is palpable. SARAH takes LEE’s hand 
           and squeezes it. 

           CAT stands next to the line of models with her clipboard and 
           headpiece.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        And three, two, one. Go Grace.

           GRACE takes a breath, lifts her head up and starts walking. 
           We hear the music erupt.

           We watch the monitors as GRACE makes her entrance onto the 
           catwalk, which surprisingly she owns. The buzz in the room is 
           electrifying. Murmurs ripple throughout the audience, audible 
           even over the roar of the soundtrack.
           Every three seconds we here CAT saying ‘And Go’ cueing the 
           next model on their entrance. LEE checks over each model just 
           before she makes her entrance as the rest of the team 
           continue nervously watching the monitors as the models strut 
           like towering giants, and pose at the end of the catwalk. 
           Fierce, bold, powerful women. The flashes from the press are 
           blinding. SARAH runs up to LEE trying to keep her composure -

                                 SARAH
                        There’s a problem.

           LEE follows SARAH as they run to the end of the line of 
           models, with MIKE in pursuit. We see two assistants already 
           surrounding ALINKA in her black swan dress picking up 
           feathers which are falling out. 

                                 LEE
                        Keep still, don’t move.

           LEE and SARAH are handed a needle and thread and start sewing 
           the feathers back on vigorously. LEE is not going to let his 
           last creation not go on stage. He will do anything to make 
           this happen. 

           We see more models leaving the backstage area and appearing 
           on the monitor.

                                 CAT
                        Petra. Go.

           The queue of models is getting shorter as LEE and SARAH sew 
           faster than they ever have before. The music is ringing in 
           LEE’S ears, it’s so loud even backstage. His jaw clenches, 
           his knuckles are red raw, his eyes start welling up with 
           tears and his forehead is sweating. But he ignores all this 
           and keeps fighting, keeps sewing. Under his breath he is 
           encouraging himself.

                                 LEE
                        Come on...come on...come on...

                                 CAT
                        White swan in five seconds. Lee 
                        you’ve got twenty. 

           The team are all looking nervous, unsure if the last creation 
           is going to make the stage.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        And go.

           The WHITE SWAN makes the most glorious entrance. She is mind-
           blowingly beautiful. 
           One of the most unique garments to ever grace a catwalk. We 
           see on the monitor the audience who are left breathless as 
           more and more flashes capture the image.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Ten.

                                 LEE
                        Come on.

           LEE and SARAH are like machines now. MIKE stares at them like 
           they’re attractions in a Zoo.

                                 CAT
                        Nine...Eight...Seven...

           SARAH is drenched with sweat. The music is roaring out.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Six.

           We can see LEE’s fingers are bleeding where he’s pricked 
           himself so many times.

                                 LEE
                        Come on. 

                                 CAT
                        Five.

                                 LEE
                        Come on.

           LEE’S crying with exhaustion and keeps on sewing.

                                 CAT
                        Four...Three.

           The whole team look on anxiously, are they going to make this 
           in time? SARAH stops exhausted.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Two.

           We go in close in on LEE the finishing line is within reach.

                                 LEE
                        COME ON!

                                 CAT
                        ONE.

           The climatic last thread through the feather as LEE rips it 
           with his teeth. He’s done!
                                 LEE
                        GO.

           THE BLACK SWAN walks out onto the catwalk. LEE is finished. 
           Everyone runs over to the monitor. MIKE stays with LEE but 
           looks up from where he is following the BLACK SWAN as she 
           makes her triumphant circuit. She hits her mark and poses, 
           poses again, strikes a final stance and as she does so the 
           music slowly fades into a heart beat. It grows louder and 
           louder and louder until finally it flat lines. THE BLACK SWAN 
           keeps on walking. The lights fade to black.

           The team stand huddled together looking at the blacked out 
           monitor. The flat line still plays for a few seconds and then 
           cuts out entirely...SILENCE...The whole team nervously 
           exchange glances. Was it good? A disaster? Did they love us 
           or hate us?

           A beat.

           We begin to hear a faint sound of applause...the team begin 
           to look relieved...the applause grows louder and louder until 
           it’s a roar.

                                 CAT
                        Models go. Grace go. Go.

                                 GRACE
                        What?

                                 CAT
                        Fucking go. 

           The models start filing out to do their final circuit as a 
           group. The whole team start hugging and celebrating with each 
           other. Pure delight and relief - they have pulled it off.

           We get quick glimpses of the audience on the monitors 
           rapturously clapping as the models walk past them for a final 
           time. More and more flashes from photographers and the 
           public. 

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Lee you’re up.

           LEE sits with his head in his hands, overwhelmed by the whole 
           experience.

           MIKE wraps his arm around him and helps LEE to his feet. 

           LEE’S a bit off balance but we follow him as he makes his way 
           from BACKSTAGE out onto the CATWALK.
           MIKE watches him on the monitor race round the catwalk, as if 
           he were a shy school boy lost amongst all the applause. LEE 
           spots JOYCE, JANET and ANNALISE on the front row, he runs 
           over and quickly hugs them before exiting back into the 
           backstage area behind the models who are all filing through. 

           Everyone is in a mass celebrating with each other but LEE 
           continues walking.

           MIKE sits down and watches him go, expecting LEE to turn back 
           but he doesn’t. Exhausted, MIKE continues watching as he 
           becomes engulfed by a wave of people celebrating. 

           INT. LEE’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           For the first time we see LEE alone. He examines the wall of 
           photographs. He scans them, pictures of him and JOYCE at the 
           interview, himself working on the swan dresses, and then one 
           of him looking pensive sat on the chair looking at the white 
           wall all those months ago. 

           He removes all the photographs off the wall one by one, and 
           then starts editing them, putting the pictures of himself and 
           the process he likes up on the wall in chronological order. 
           It’s clear he is creating his own version of events, the way 
           he wants to be seen, remembered.

           He puts the last photograph up and takes a step back. He  
           takes in the narrative before him. The rejected and more 
           truthful pictures are on the floor under his feet.

           INT. LEE’S HOTEL BALCONY - DUSK

           LEE stands on the balcony, lights a cigarette looking out 
           over Paris. The view is beautiful. We stay on LEE’S face. 
           What’s going on in his mind? What’s he going to do next? 
           After a while we hear MIKE’S voice -

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        You won’t ask me questions smarter 
                        than my answers will you?

           INT. MCQUEEN STUDIO - DAY

           LEE sits next to the cameras smoking while interviewing MIKE 
           who we can only hear - but perhaps can see his reflection a 
           little in the lens.

                                 LEE 
                        Have you ever stolen anything?
                                 MIKE  (O.S.)
                        An opportunity.

                                 LEE
                        Would you say you enjoy your work?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Sometimes.

                                 LEE
                        And if you had a legacy -

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        That’s a big if -

                                 LEE
                        Big if. What would you want it to 
                        be?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        I don’t expect to have one.

                                 LEE
                        How many times have you been in 
                        love?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        One and a half.

                                 LEE
                        Fuck off.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        It’s true.

                                 LEE
                        Okay then what’s the biggest lie 
                        you’ve ever told?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Pass. Last question.

                                 LEE
                        Last question?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Better make it count.

           LEE knowingly smiles. 

                                 LEE
                        How would you define the truth?
           We hold on LEE for a second before...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           BLACK.

           The camera pans across a wild, beautiful and remote 
           landscape, The Isle of Skye. Coming to rest on a gravestone 
           bearing the inscription ‘Love looks not with the eyes but 
           with the mind.’ The following titles play over it.

           TITLE: The Horn of Plenty is regarded as one of Lee’s 
           greatest works.

           TITLE: The following year Joyce McQueen died peacefully in 
           her sleep.

           TITLE: Lee took his own life three days later.

           TITLE: Alexander McQueen is regarded as one of the greatest 
           artists to have graced the world of fashion.
