           LAYLA MAJNUN is a tragic love story based on an Arabic poem 
           that dates back to the 9th Century.

           Its literal English translation is “possessed by madness for 
           Layla.”

           The story is said to have nearly 60 different iterations in 
           many languages.

           No version exists where the lovers end up together.
           OVER BLACK -- LONDON, 1970

           CLICK, CLICK - tape reels are loaded into a reel to reel 
           deck. CLANK - a metal canister knocks over onto a wooden 
           floor. A MAN with a heavy Southern English accent speaks:

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Oh- Sorry. [beat] Here. Put these 
                        on. [beat] Ready?

                                 PATTIE (O.S.)
                             (soft English accent)
                        Did you write me a song or 
                        something?

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        No, I wrote you an album.

           CLICK - a button is pressed. The reels roll, humming to life.

           INT. KENSINGTON FLAT - EVENING

           CLOSE ON: The angelic face of PATTIE BOYD (26), a heart-
           stopping beautiful blonde, with large headphones cradling her 
           head. She nods. The room is silent save for the muffled yet 
           audible DEREK AND THE DOMINOS “LAYLA” RIFF.

           Pattie closes her eyes and sways her body as she starts to 
           feel the music. After a moment, she opens her eyes.

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Well?

           She closes her eyes again, holding back tears, but one single 
           TEAR squeezes out and rolls down her smooth cheek.

           OVER BLACK -- 8 MONTHS EARLIER

           MUDDY WATERS’ “MANNISH BOY” creeps in...

                                 ERIC (V.O.)
                        “Dearest L... I am writing this note 
                        to you, with the main purpose of 
                        ascertaining your feelings toward a 
                        subject well known to both of us.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - HURTWOOD EDGE - DAWN

           A curly-haired OLDER MAN (50s) with an eye-patch and slight 
           hunchback lumbers toward the door with a bundle of firewood.

           This is ONE-EYED DON, Hurtwood’s caretaker, the Alfred to 
           Eric Clapton’s Bruce Wayne. And if you think Don looks like a 
           vagrant, that’s because he was one just a few months ago.
                                 ERIC (V.O.)
                        As you have probably gathered, my 
                        own home affairs are a galloping 
                        force which is rapidly degenerating 
                        day by intolerable day...

           One-Eyed Don passes by a brand new Lilac Ferrari 365 GTC - 
           parked half off the driveway with grass and mud in the rims 
           and a giant dent in the front bumper. Don shakes his head.

           INT. ERIC’S BEDROOM - HURTWOOD EDGE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Face down on the bed, ERIC CLAPTON (25), tall and lanky with 
           a thick-beard and long brown hair down to his shoulders, 
           sleeps fully clothed. Despite his stylish psychedelic 
           clothes, he looks disheveled - haggard even.

                                 ERIC (V.O.)
                        It seems like an eternity since I 
                        last saw or spoke to you! [beat] 
                        However, all of this is not the 
                        point... What I wish to ask you, is 
                        if you still love your husband, or 
                        if you have another lover?

           He comes to, taking a minute to grasp his bearings.

                                 ERIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        All these questions are very 
                        important I know, but if there is 
                        still a feeling in your heart for 
                        me... You must let me know!

           He gulps the watered down remains of his brandy and spots his 
           jacket on the floor. He darts toward it, fishes the pockets 
           for SOMETHING. Like a madman on his hands and knees, he 
           searches the floor and under the bed. He rips off blankets, 
           but can’t find whatever it is he’s looking for.

           He runs out the door.

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A fire crackles in the fireplace as Eric races through his 
           disaster zone of a living room - a mess only a rock star 
           could make.

           Eric beelines out the front door, not even noticing that One-
           Eyed Don sitting on the couch across from a wide-eyed young 
           MAN with wavy brown hair. This is BOBBY WHITLOCK (25) a good 
           ol’ boy from Memphis, Tennessee with a heart of gold.

           Out the window, they watch Eric sprint to the open, empty 
           post box. He slams it closed and bangs the top with his fist.
                                 ERIC (V.O.)
                        In fact, you must let me know 
                        whatever your feelings are.. Don’t 
                        telephone! Send a letter... That is 
                        much safer. [beat] Please do this. 
                        Whatever it may say, my mind will 
                        be at rest...... All my love. E.”

           Eric storms back inside and rips apart the room in search, 
           still not noticing One-Eyed Don and Bobby.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                             (without looking up)
                        Don! Did the post go out already? 

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                             (Cockney accent)
                        Course it has. It’s past one.

                                 ERIC
                        Shiiiiit! Have you seen an envelope?

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                        Eric, you’ve left Mr. Whitlock 
                        waiting all morning-

                                 ERIC
                             (ignoring)
                        Have you seen it or not?

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                        Eric!

                                 ERIC
                        What?!

           Don gestures to Bobby. Eric finally stops, acknowledges him.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Bobby! What’re you doing here?

                                 BOBBY
                             (with a Tennessee drawl)
                        You said to come on over, so... 
                        Here I am.

                                 ERIC
                        I did, huh?

                                 BOBBY
                        Ya don’t remember? Shit, I can go-

                                 ERIC
                        Nonsense, if I said it, I meant it.
           Bobby’s relieved. Don grabs his suitcase as Eric searches.

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                        Let me show you to your room. How 
                        long you here for?

                                 BOBBY
                        Til my money runs out, I guess.
                        I took Eric's advice and finally 
                        quit the band.

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                        What’re you taking advice from him 
                        for? Eric quits every band.

           Eric accidentally knocks over the record player, abruptly 
           stopping MUDDY WATERS.

                                 ERIC
                        Fuck!

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                        I told you not to write that letter.

                                 ERIC
                        Maybe I didn’t send it.

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                        You need to leave that poor girl 
                        alone. You really think Pattie’s 
                        going to love you just because you 
                        begged her to?

                                 BOBBY
                        Pattie? [incredulous] Oh. George’s 
                        Pattie?

           Eric lets out a heavy, guilty SIGH.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        I was love sick once. Was crazy 
                        about this girl back home... 
                        Beautiful.

           Eric attempts to fix the record player but gets frustrated 
           and throws a piece across the room.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        And by some strike of divine dumb 
                        luck, I managed to get her. Married 
                        her too. Things were peachy keen. 
                        But one day, out the blue fuckin’ 
                        sky, she slaps me with a divorce 
                        paper and no explanation.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        That was it. She was done. But I 
                        wasn’t.

           Eric turns his back to Bobby and fixes himself a drink. Bobby 
           looks to Don who gestures for him to keep trying.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        I was a damn train-wreck for 
                        months. Trying anything to win her 
                        back. Nothing worked. Not a goddamn 
                        thing. Until a friend of mine told 
                        me ‘bout this story, Layla and 
                        Majnun. Like an... Eastern Romeo 
                        and Juliet. Made me see that my 
                        love was no love at all. It was 
                        obsession. It wasn’t about her. I 
                        knew I was sick, man. Took reading 
                        that story to see it. And let me 
                        tell ya, there ain’t no version of 
                        it that ends well. For anyone.

           Eric downs his drink and silently heads back upstairs taking 
           the bottle of Brandy with him.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Eric, you sure it’s alright that I stay?

           No response.

                                 ONE-EYED DON
                        I think it’s best that you do.

           OVER BLACK -- LONDON, DECEMBER 24TH 1964

           EXT. ODEON HAMMERSMITH THEATRE - LONDON - NIGHT

           SECURITY GUARDS struggle to wrangle the huge CROWD that 
           eagerly waits in line. Police and paparazzi swarm the street. 
           The marquee above reads:
                                  BRIAN EPSTEIN PRESENTS:
                               ANOTHER BEATLES CHRISTMAS SHOW
                                    WITH SPECIAL GUEST
                                       THE YARDBIRDS

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY (O.S.)
                        Has anyone seen him?

           INT. THE YARDBIRD’S DRESSING ROOM - ODEON HAMMERSMITH THEATRE

           GIORGIO GOMELSKY (30), a slick-suited, well-respected manager 
           stands at the door looking in, waiting for a response...
                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        Helloooo?

           The energy is tense and quick as he addresses his band, THE 
           YARDBIRDS (PAUL SAMWELL-SMITH, KEITH RELF, JIM MCCARTY, and 
           CHRIS DREJA), who are all dressed in uniquely designed 
           matching black and beige suits. They prepare themselves for 
           their big night - everyone’s a bit on edge, specifically lead 
           singer, CHRIS DREJA, who seethes on the couch in silence.

                                 PAUL SAMWELL-SMITH
                        Haven’t seen him since sound check.

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        Well at least he was at sound check.

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           ERIC CLAPTON (at 19), in the same matching black and beige 
           suit as the rest of the band, walks down the hall with his 
           guitar case - he’s lanky and baby-faced with a bad crew cut.

           As he approaches The Yardbird’s DRESSING ROOM, he hears his 
           band-mates conversation (intercut between band and Eric).

                                 JIM MCCARTY (O.S.)
                        He’s probably too embarrassed to go 
                        on stage with that haircut.

                                 KEITH RELF (O.S.)
                             (chuckles)
                        He’s probably pouting in the 
                        bathroom trying to fix it.

           Giorgio stifles a laugh, trying to remain serious-

                                 CHRIS DREJA (O.S.)
                        Laugh all you want, Giorgio, but he 
                        hasn’t been to a rehearsal in 
                        months. I can’t deal with his 
                        fucking ego anymore!

                                 JIM MCCARTY (O.S.)
                        He asked me last night if I thought he 
                        was a genius. Who the fuck asks that?

           Eric turns and walks back the way he came.

                                 KEITH RELF (O.S.)
                        If he goes off on another ten 
                        minute riff in the middle of “For 
                        Your Love”, I’m gonna strangle him 
                        with my mic chord.
                                 CHRIS DREJA (O.S.)
                        Honestly, he’s just a miserable 
                        little bastard!

           Eric stops as the word BASTARD echoes after him.

           PRE-LAP: MUDDY WATERS’ “MANNISH BOY” creeps in and swells...

           INT. LOBBY BAR - ODEON HAMMERSMITH THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER

           “MANNISH BOY” continues into a blues solo. Eric, in his band 
           uniform, sits at the bar with half a beer in front of him, 
           vigorously playing his own variation of “MANNISH BOY” on his 
           GIBSON ES-335 - he’s in a trance...

                                 BARTENDER (O.S.)
                        Usually the band plays on stage.

           Eric wakes from his trance to find the older, stout BARTENDER 
           staring at him. Eric downs the last of his brew.

                                 ERIC
                        Can I get another?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Aren’t you playing soon?

                                 ERIC
                        That depends on if I get another.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Sharp suit. Never seen a cut like that.

                                 ERIC
                        I designed it myself.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fancy boy.

           Eric scowls and catches a glimpse of his own reflection in a 
           glass cabinet door behind the bar. He turns his nose up at 
           his crewcut and ruffles his hair to mess it up.

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll be back, gotta use the loo.

           He hops off his stool and abruptly bumps into a beautiful 
           BRUNETTE (20), knocking her and his guitar case to the floor. 
           Flustered, Eric grabs his guitar before helping the girl up.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        What the hell?

           His demeanor changes, all confidence has disappeared.
                                 ERIC
                        I’m terribly sorry. Truly.

           He helps her to her feet. She notes his guitar and smiles.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        Are you playing tonight?

           At the end of the bar sits a clean-cut young man in a grey 
           suit with angular features and a jet-black mop-top haircut - 
           this is the one and only GEORGE HARRISON (21). Amused and 
           cocksure, he watches this unfold as he sips his beer.

                                 ERIC
                        Uh- Yes. I’m in one of the opening bands.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        Which one?

                                 ERIC
                        The Yardbirds.

                                 BRUNETTE
                             (stepping closer)
                        Really?

           Eric tries to sidestep her but she blocks him.

                                 ERIC
                        Excuse me-

                                 BRUNETTE
                        Aren’t you going to buy me a drink?

           Nervous, he avoids eye-contact and ruffles his hair again.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh- Uh. I actually have to use the 
                        loo, then get on stage- And uh-

                                 BRUNETTE
                        How about you buy me one after you play?

           Her eyes twinkle, waiting for him to make a move but Eric is 
           oblivious, pulls out a few notes from his wallet, sincerely:

                                 ERIC
                        You can, uh- get yourself a drink.

           George, embarrassed for him, shakes his head in disbelief as 
           GIORGIO, his manager, pops his head out from the venue door.

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY 
                        Eric! What the hell? We need you.
           Eric fumbles with the money, it’s half in her hand before he 
           drops it on the floor. He half bends down to pick it up...

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY (CONT'D)
                        NOW!

                                 ERIC
                             (to the Brunette)
                        Sorry-

           Eric leaves it and shuffles off with his guitar, leaving her 
           rejected and beyond confused. She takes a seat at the bar as 
           Giorgio hurries Eric out through the doors.

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        They’re all waiting on you.

                                 ERIC
                             (confident again)
                        They get on just fine without me.

           The argument escalates as the doors close, drowning them out.

           George Harrison, who has been watching the whole painful 
           interaction, downs his beer, gets up from his stool, and 
           casually takes the seat next to the Brunette.

                                 GEORGE
                             (Liverpool accent)
                        Do you still want that drink, love?

           She glances at him and does a double-take... Then SQUEALS and 
           SCREAMS with excitement.

           PRE-LAP: THE YARDBIRDS’ “FOR YOUR LOVE” ROARS from stage over: 

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           A) THE BEATLES’ DRESSING ROOM - The Brunette’s SCREAMS are 
           now ones of ecstasy. With her dress hiked up, she straddles 
           George who’s now wearing only boxers and the puffy, furry 
           jacket of an Antarctic Explorer costume.

           B) STAGE - THE YARDBIRDS play “FOR YOUR LOVE” to a sold-out, 
           wild crowd. Behind them a BANNER reads: “ANOTHER BEATLES’ 
           CHRISTMAS SHOW”. Eric stands humbly at the edge of the stage 
           in the shadows, apathetically playing his guitar.

           C) THE BEATLES’ DRESSING ROOM - The Brunette ravages George 
           with kisses, trying to soak up every bit of him while she’s 
           got him. She struggles to remove his jacket.
                                 GEORGE
                        I’m supposed to be putting the 
                        costume on, love.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        I don’t care what you’re wearing 
                        while you fuck me, just fuck me.

           He lifts her up, flips her onto the couch, and gets on top.

                                 BRUNETTE (CONT'D)
                        You look ridiculous in that thing.

                                 GEORGE
                        You should see Ringo.

           An ELECTRIC BLUES GUITAR RIFF surges through the wall. George 
           stops and listens intently.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Whoa.

                                 WOMAN
                        I know!

           He tosses her aside and gets to his feet, trying to listen.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        Hey!

                                 GEORGE
                        Shh-

           D) BACK STAGE - The riff continues as George, now in the full 
           Antarctic costume, rushes to the wing staring out in awe...

           E) STAGE - CLOSE ON fingers moving unnaturally fast, up and 
           down the fretboard of a Gibson ES-335... We slowly pull away 
           from the dexterous fingers to find they belong to Eric, who 
           plays in the shadows of the stage.

           Eric, with his eyes closed in the darkness, effortlessly 
           feels every note surge through his body as if channeling some 
           otherworldly blues guitar-god.

           We continue to pull away until we are behind George in the 
           wing... Watching Eric solo out of control all alone on stage, 
           in the dark - it’s surreal and mesmerizing.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Brilliant.

           George’s eyes follow Eric’s fingers, and if they were moving 
           any faster, they’d start a fire.
                                 KEITH RELF (O.S.)
                             (furious)
                        Ey!

           Eric continues his frenetic riff as the crowd revs up.

                                 KEITH RELF (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Eric!

           Eric SNAPS a guitar string-- He stops playing. The crowd 
           quiets for a moment as he leans off stage, grabs a pack of 
           strings and proceeds to take his sweet ass time replacing it.

           A single CLAP emanates from the audience... Then another, and 
           another... Until the entire crowd, in unison, gives Eric the 
           SLOW CLAP as they wait for him to continue playing...

           We now see the full stage all lit up with Keith gripping the 
           mic chord ready to kill Eric, Chris on rhythm guitar, Paul on 
           bass, and Jim on drums... All of their eyes glaring at Eric 
           who’s off to the side of the rest of the band, still on stage 
           but just short of the light - just how he prefers it.

                                 CHRIS DREJA
                             (to Keith)
                        Fuckin’ do something!

                                 KEITH RELF
                        ‘Ric! Can we get on with the 
                        fuckin’ song now?

           Eric finally looks up and realizes the crowd’s eyes are glued 
           to him as they continue the SLOW CLAP. Eric ignores his 
           bandmates but transitions back into The Yardbirds’ “FOR YOUR 
           LOVE” as the crowd SCREAMS in a frenzy.

           Eric’s attention is drawn to the front row. Amongst the 
           screaming girls all dressed in black, grey, and tie-dye 
           stands quietly a beautiful, thoughtful BLONDE dressed in a 
           chic white sleeveless dress.

           This is PATTIE BOYD (20) - songs could be written about 
           her... And they will be. Pattie catches him staring, Eric 
           quickly drops his eyes. When he looks back up... She’s gone.

           INT. THE YARDBIRD’S DRESSING ROOM - ODEON THEATRE - LATER

           Everyone’s gone except for Eric, on the couch, focused 
           intently on restringing his guitar. There’s a KNOCK--

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        You missed out, mate.
           Eric does a double take - the George Harrison pushes the door 
           open. He’s back in his grey suit, holding the goofy Antarctic 
           explorer’s costume. Despite his youthful face, he emits a 
           cool confidence of someone 10 years older.

                                 ERIC
                        On what?

                                 GEORGE
                        The beautiful woman practically 
                        throwing herself at you.

                                 ERIC
                        She was not.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, don’t worry, I had your fun 
                        for you.

                                 ERIC
                        Just now?

                                 GEORGE
                        And during most of your set.

                                 ERIC
                             (laughs infectiously)
                        Must be nice being a Beatle.

                                 GEORGE
                        It could be just as nice being you. 
                        Just had to look her in the eyes.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh, just that simple, yeah?

                                 GEORGE
                        For us it is.
                             (re: Eric’s guitar)
                        I saw you play that thing. It’s 
                        like you sing through it. And that 
                        last solo man-

                                 ERIC
                        That was just an old blues riff I 
                        retooled. [re-stringing] It’s 
                        nothing really.

                                 GEORGE
                        For you maybe. You make a deal with 
                        the devil or do you just have some 
                        sort of magical strings?

           Eric gets a bit excited and grabs a new pack of strings.
                                 ERIC
                        Just these light-gauge strings. 
                        They break easy, as you can see, 
                        but I swear by ‘em. [beat] You want 
                        a pack? I’ve got extra.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, I’m alright, thanks. What was 
                        that new song you guys have? I only 
                        heard the tail end of it.

                                 ERIC
                             (sour)
                        “For Your Love.”

                                 GEORGE
                        Sounded like a riot, man. Crowd 
                        loved it.

                                 ERIC
                        Of course they did. Sounds just 
                        like the Stones.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s wrong with the Stones?

                                 ERIC
                        Nothing. Just like there’s nothing 
                        wrong with The Beatles. But we’re 
                        neither, we’re The Yardbirds.

           George is intrigued by this angry young man.

                                 GEORGE
                        In any case that blues solo was the 
                        best part of the song. Should sound 
                        great on the album.

                                 ERIC
                        It won’t be on the album. 
                        Apparently The Yardbirds aren’t 
                        making blues albums anymore.

                                 GEORGE
                        And that’s what you want to play?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s what I was put on this earth 
                        to play.
                                 GEORGE
                        So play the blues then. [beat]
                        I just gave my friend, Klaus, my 
                        favorite guitar- this Gretsch, 
                        mate, was amazing. My first real 
                        American guitar, ya know? Bought it 
                        off a cabbie when I was 18. It was 
                        tough, but I had to part with it.

                                 ERIC
                        Why?

                                 GEORGE
                        It just felt right.

           Eric nods, understanding his point. George’s calm maturity is 
           startling to Eric. He finally acknowledges the ridiculous 
           costume in George’s hand.

                                 ERIC
                        You taking that with you?

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ve got one from every Christmas 
                        show. I have more of these silly 
                        costumes than I have guitars.

                                 ERIC
                        What’s the point of those stupid 
                        skits anyway?

                                 GEORGE
                        Keeps the fans entertained.

                                 ERIC
                        Isn’t that what the music’s 
                        supposed to do?

           George looks down at the costume with disdain.

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe I should take my own advice.

           He turns to leave, but then-

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Actually, could I have those 
                        strings you were talking about?
                             (with a charming smile)
                        Can’t hurt, ya know?

           Eric tosses them to his new friend, THE GEORGE HARRISON.
           INT. GIORGIO GOMELSKY’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Eric’s guitar leans against the wall beneath a prominently 
           framed photo of his manager Giorgio with THE ROLLING STONES. 
           From the window, sunlight pierces Eric’s hung-over eyes as he 
           smokes a cigarette across the desk from Giorgio.

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        It’s become increasingly obvious 
                        you’re not happy.

                                 ERIC
                        What makes you say that?

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        No one’s holding you back from 
                        quitting if that’s what you want.

           Eric stares intensely at Giorgio for a long, uncomfortable 
           moment... Giorgio shifts in his seat, waiting for Eric to 
           explode. Eric puts his cigarette out, reaches for his guitar, 
           and plucks the strings incredibly fast, not looking up.

                                 ERIC
                        You firing me?

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        No. But you have to work with me.

           Eric ignores and focuses on his playing as Giorgio lights up 
           a cigarette, just about ready to give up on him.

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY (CONT'D)
                        You’re marketable. You’re Slowhand.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t want to be “marketable!” I 
                        don’t need a fuckin’ nickname. I 
                        want to play the blues in a blues 
                        band with blues musicians.

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        Things evolve, Eric. Bands evolve.

                                 ERIC
                        Pop is a de-evolution from blues. 
                        And I can’t contribute to that sort 
                        of... Bastardization.

                                 GIORGIO GOMELSKY
                        You don’t even have a backup plan. 
                        I mean, at least wait til we hit 
                        the States. No one quits a hit 
                        band, Eric. What’re ya gonna do?
           After a long drag, Giorgio exhales a thick cloud of SMOKE...

           JOHN MAYALL AND THE BLUESBREAKERS’ “LONELY YEARS” plays...

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING -- 1965

           SMOKE and DUST settle, revealing lanky ERIC (at 20), in a 
           hard-hat, jeans and dirty white T-shirt, awkwardly manning a 
           JACKHAMMER. He looks out of place amongst the rest of the 
           burly CREW - but he pulls his weight. His body vibrates, but 
           his eyes are fixed on something across the street... A 
           sidewalk newspaper KIOSK - the front page headline reads:

                        “JEFF BECK REPLACES CLAPTON IN YARDBIRDS;
                       ‘FOR YOUR LOVE’ HITS THE STATES AT NUMBER 6!”

           INT. SPEAKEASY - STAGE ROOM - MARGARET STREET

           A dimly lit, smoky restaurant bar, with brick red booths 
           adjacent to a large music room with a stage and dance-floor. 

           On stage, JOHN MAYALL AND THE BLUESBREAKERS (including JACK 
           BRUCE on bass who we’ll meet soon) play “LONELY YEARS.”

           AT THE BAR

           With his back to the stage, ERIC drinks alone, his hard-hat 
           on the stool next to him. A blaring BLUES HARMONICA rips 
           through the room. Eric perks up and looks to the stage...

                                                           SWISH PAN TO:

           INT. SPEAKEASY - ON STAGE -- 1966

           “LONELY YEARS” continues with the blues harmonica but now 
           Eric, dressed in a button-down with his hair grown out and 
           sideburns, plays guitar with the band - seated on a stool off 
           to the side of the stage, his back basically to the audience.

           ERIC (at 21) and JOHN MAYALL (33), with shaggy hair and a 
           faint goatee, close out the song with a dueling blues riff. 
           John tries to keep up with Eric’s impromptu yet natural 
           changes but gives up and just watches Eric do his thing which 
           silences the audience. JACK BRUCE (23), the baby-faced yet 
           smug young bassist, is equally impressed and humbled.

           In the far corner of the bar, a drunken, curly haired red-
           headed man, GINGER BAKER (26) wildly claps and hollers, 
           embarrassing the GIRLS he’s with. Ginger is gaunt and 
           grizzly, a real live-wire - though that could be the coke.

           Eric finally finishes and looks over his shoulder to John 
           Mayall, who stares in awe, feeling slightly one-upped.
                                 ERIC
                             (dryly)
                        What’s next?

                                 JOHN MAYALL
                        Why don’t you sing one?

                                 ERIC
                        You only hired me to play the 
                        guitar, mate.

           John is dumbfounded that someone would turn down this offer.

           INT. GINGER BAKER’S SEDAN - NIGHT -- WEEKS LATER

           Ginger drives, mumbling gibberish in his heavy South London 
           accent. In the back, Eric, dressed conservatively, makes out 
           with his new girlfriend, CHARLOTTE MARTIN - a beautiful cat-
           eyed French blonde (one of the girls with Ginger earlier).

                                 GINGER
                        Well, whataya think?

           Eric pulls away from Charlotte who composes herself.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m not too keen on starting a new band 
                        right now. I have a good gig going-

                                 GINGER
                        Jazz and blues, man. That’s all I 
                        want to play.

           Eric runs his hand down Charlotte’s thigh, kissing her neck.

                                 ERIC
                        I’ve heard that before.

                                 GINGER
                        I’m fucking serious, mate. I’m not a 
                        cocky fuck but I can wail on the drums. 
                        I’m the cream of the fuckin’ crop.

           Eric pulls away from Charlotte.

                                 ERIC
                        Who else do you have in mind?

                                 GINGER
                        Well, if you join then... That’ll 
                        be uh- You and me, wouldn’t it?

           Eric’s not impressed. Charlotte runs her hand up his thigh.
                                 GINGER (CONT'D)
                        We probably need a third, yeah?

                                 ERIC
                             (snarky)
                        Probably yeah. [beat] How ‘bout 
                        Jack Bruce? The guy’s a genius.

                                 GINGER
                             (swerving)
                        You fuckin’ kidding me?

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t get us killed, mate-

                                 GINGER
                        I hate that snob!

                                 ERIC
                        I promised him if I started 
                        something new we’d do it together. 
                        So it’s both of us, or neither.

                                 GINGER
                             (slams the wheel)
                        If you find him strangled to death 
                        backstage, you can’t say I didn’t 
                        warn you.

           INT. THE SPEAKEASY - NIGHT -- 1967

           Blaring music and flashing lights -- In the midst of this 
           crowded smoky room, ERIC and CHARLOTTE make out in a booth. 
           Eric’s style has done a complete 180 - now its full-on 
           psychedelic rock-star with a frizzy ‘fro, bell-bottom jeans, 
           colorful half-buttoned shirt, suede vest, and a silk scarf.

           They’re interrupted by a huge fuss of SCREAMING that comes 
           from the entrance. Eric cranes his neck to spot FOUR HEADS 
           with the same HAIRCUT bobbing and weaving through the crowd.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What is it?

                                 ERIC
                        I think The Beatles just walked in.

           Charlotte squeals with excitement, jumps to her feet and 
           pulls Eric through the crowd. 

           Someone grabs Eric, spins him around. It’s GEORGE HARRISON 
           (now 24). He’s different now - his eyes wild, maybe from 
           drugs. His hair is longer, has some scruff, and wearing a 
           flowy Indian tunic.
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        George!

           They hug. George holds on a beat longer than Eric.

                                 GEORGE
                        I really dig Fresh Cream mate.

                                 ERIC
                             (unenthusiastic)
                        Thanks. It’s alright I suppose.

           George feels Eric’s restlessness.

                                 GEORGE
                        You won’t find any answers in 
                        another band...

                                 ERIC
                        Answers to what?

           George leans closer and studies his eyes... It’s strange. He 
           places his palm over Eric’s chest. Charlotte is in awe.

                                 GEORGE
                        “Here in this body are the sacred 
                        rivers... Here are the sun and moon as 
                        well as all the pilgrimage places... I 
                        have not encountered another temple as 
                        blissful as my own body.”

                                 ERIC
                             (utterly confused)
                        You alright, George?

                                 GEORGE
                             (with a goofy smile)
                        Might give the DJ some of our new 
                        music tonight. I hope you like it.

           Charlotte excitedly nudges Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry. George this is my girlfriend 
                        Charlotte Martin. Charlotte, this 
                        is George Harrison.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (starry-eyed)
                        I know who you are-

           George takes her hand and kisses it gently - she melts.
                                 GEORGE
                        Pleasure to meet you. [beat] I have 
                        something for you both. Hold out 
                        your hands.

           They do and George places a pill in each.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What is this?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s called STP. [off their 
                        confused looks] Basically it’s 
                        really strong acid.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (handing it back)
                        I shouldn’t.

                                 GEORGE
                        How about you, Eric?

           Eric shows his hands... They’re empty. George LAUGHS and 
           leads them through the crowd toward the stage.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Great! By the way, that might last 
                        a few days, mate.

           Eric’s smile quickly changes to a panic.

           EDGE OF STAGE

           The Beatles’ “WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU” plays as Eric and 
           George lay on their backs with their legs dangling off the 
           empty stage... Just a few feet from their heads, Charlotte 
           dances like a gypsy with a few other girls.

           Eric shifts his eyes from Charlotte to George, whose eyes are 
           closed, lost in the music.

                                 ERIC
                        I can’t believe you had to fight 
                        them to get this on the album.

           George never opens his eyes.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s because the other Beatles 
                        weren’t on it.

           Eric sits up to survey the crowd. Eric locks eyes with a 
           familiar face. 
           The same breathtakingly beautiful blonde goddess from earlier 
           - PATTIE BOYD (23) - dressed once again in a chic white dress 
           amongst a sea of tie-dye. And this time... She’s walking 
           right toward him.

           He looks around dumbly and straightens himself up. She 
           finally arrives bearing a blinding smile.

                                 PATTIE
                        Hi...

           Eric is astounded this woman is talking to him.

                                 ERIC
                        H- hi... Hi.

           Pattie leans over to see who is laying on their back...

                                 PATTIE
                        Is that George?

                                 ERIC
                             (deflated)
                        Oh-

           Eric nudges George who sits up - he’s tripping and loving it.

                                 GEORGE
                        You made it!

           With envy, Eric watches them kiss until MAUREEN STARR (21), 
           Ringo’s wife, comes up from behind and throws her arms around 
           Pattie and George. George plants a loving kiss on her cheek.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        My other love!

           Eric is deep down the rabbit-hole, his eyes fixated on 
           Pattie. George grabs his hand and pulls him into the mix.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        This is my dear friend, Eric Clapton. 
                        Eric, this is my wife, Pattie, and 
                        Ringo’s better half, Maureen.

                                 ERIC
                        Hi.

           From the stage, Charlotte leans over and wraps her arms 
           around George’s neck.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How’s my Eric doing?
                                 GEORGE
                        He’s on a journey, my lady.

           Charlotte pulls George and Maureen to the stage to dance, 
           leaving Eric and Pattie alone. He’s way too shy and tripping 
           too hard to start a conversation...

                                 PATTIE
                        I do know who you are, ya know.

                                 ERIC
                        You do?

                                 PATTIE
                        Of course. I’ve seen you play before.

                                 ERIC
                        Yes, I play...

           She smirks, slowly nodding along as if he were a child.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        The guitar. I play the guitar on stage.

                                 PATTIE
                        Are you okay?

                                 ERIC
                        Why wouldn’t I be?

                                 PATTIE
                        Did George give you something?

           Eric nods. She LAUGHS, knowing he’s a million miles away.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re unusually beautiful.

                                 PATTIE
                        Is that a compliment?

                                 ERIC
                        It is. There are a lot of colors 
                        around you.

                                 PATTIE
                        George definitely gave you something.

                                 ERIC
                             (to himself, but aloud)
                        Patricia.

                                 PATTIE
                        People call me Pattie.
                                 ERIC
                        My mum’s name is Patricia, ya know.

                                 PATTIE
                        It’s a common name, I suppose.

           Eric nods as “WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU” comes to an end and a 
           “HARE KRISHNA” chant surges through the crowd. Everyone’s 
           focus, specifically Patties, turns to George who pulls her on 
           stage and they dance.

           Eric joins Charlotte on stage but his eyes remain glued to 
           Pattie as she twirls around in slow-motion with rays of 
           colorful light projecting from her every move...

           EXT. STREET - THE SPEAKEASY - LATER

           Wild-eyed Eric sucks down a cigarette with his eyes glued to 
           the front door. Beside him, Charlotte finishes her cigarette.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Can we go home?

           Before he can answer, chaos explodes from the entrance... 
           Policemen try to contain the crowd as The Beatles exit and 
           walk across the street to their Rolls Royce. Before Lennon 
           gets in, he throws up a rebellious “V-Sign.”

                                 ERIC
                        They’re in another world from us.

           One by one they file in... John/Cynthia, Ringo/Maureen, 
           Paul/Linda, with George/Pattie last.

           From afar, Eric watches Pattie disappear into the limo - he 
           could swear she glances back at him before shutting the door.

           He steps forward to go after the limo and the city around him 
           dissolves to DARKNESS and everything is muffled save for the 
           mellifluous voice of an indiscernible WOMAN.

                                 WOMAN‘S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Eric, are you with me?

           He ignores her and takes a few more steps toward the limo as 
           the haunting INTRO of Cream’s “WHITE ROOM” swells.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        “No limits have been imposed on you 
                        --you determine your nature by your 
                        own free will, in the hands of 
                        which I have placed you.”

           His pace picks up then he breaks into a full sprint.
                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        “I have made you neither celestial 
                        nor terrestrial, neither mortal nor 
                        immortal, so that, like a free and 
                        able sculptor and painter of 
                        yourself you may mold yourself 
                        wholly in the form of your choice.

           Oddly, the faster he runs, the further away the limo gets. As 
           he gives up and slows down, the limo SCREECHES to a stop...

           Before he can take another step forward, two impossibly giant 
           SILVER HORSES thunder by Eric on either side nearly crushing 
           him. He spins around, disoriented, but they’ve disappeared 
           before he saw what hit him. “WHITE ROOM” is blaring now.

           He looks to the limo. The back window rolls down less than 
           half-way revealing a blinding WHITE LIGHT and the eyes of a 
           beautiful woman staring back at him, then it rolls back up.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE  (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I have placed you at the world’s 
                        very center, that you may the 
                        better behold from this point...” 
                        Whatever is in the world.”

           Like a moth to a flame, Eric goes to the limo. He opens the 
           door and the WHITE LIGHT engulfs him as he gets in.

                                                          FADE TO WHITE.

           Silence. Then the faint sound of what could be the opening 
           riff of the song “LAYLA”...

           INT. JACK CLAPP’S SEDAN - DOCK - FLASHBACK -- 1954

           ENTIRELY FROM ERIC’S POV IN THE BACKSEAT: We gaze out through 
           the window into the thick white FOG that surrounds us. We’re 
           all alone. We look down to our unwieldy steel-string Hoyer 
           GUITAR in our tiny 9-year-old hands. A piercing FOGHORN 
           breaks the silence...

           We look up, startled to find our mother, the glamorous dark-
           haired PATRICIA CLAPTON (27) tapping at our window, dressed 
           in a fancy, flowy dress, a colorful scarf and big sunglasses 
           that accentuate her sharp features. Looming high above the 
           fog behind her is a BLACK VESSEL with an ornately carved 
           female FIGUREHEAD adorning the ship’s bow. The beautiful, 
           long haired wooden SIREN stares down at us.

           Patricia taps at our window again, motioning for us to roll 
           it down, and we do. In a sharp and cold South English accent:
                                 PATRICIA CLAPTON
                        Didn’t mean to startle you.
                             (looks us up and down)
                        Look at you. I remember when you 
                        could nearly fit in my hand.

           We are frozen stiff except for our thumb gently sliding 
           across the strings, not producing a sound. Patricia directs 
           her attention to our guitar, struggling to connect.

                                 PATRICIA CLAPTON (CONT'D)
                        You know, Eric, my ex-
                             (choosing words wisely)
                        Your father-- Birth father, I mean. He 
                        was a musician too. [off our silence] 
                        I look forward to hearing you play-

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                             (blurting)
                        Can I call you mummy now?

           Patricia looks back over her shoulder - a few feet behind, 
           ROSE and JACK CLAPP (Eric’s grandparents) are now eerily 
           watching. Rose holds Patricia’s infant daughter, CHERYL, and 
           Jack holds her son, BRIAN (6). She looks back to us and leans 
           in with tears in her eyes.

                                 PATRICIA CLAPTON
                        I think it’s best, after all they’ve 
                        done for you, that you go on calling 
                        your grandparents Mum and Dad.

           She steps back away from the window. Slowly, they are all 
           engulfed in the white fog until they disappear completely.

           INT. RETURN TO 1967 -- BEDROOM - ERIC’S FLAT

           CLOSE ON: ERIC’S GLAZED EYES STARING VACANTLY AHEAD.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        He’s catatonic.

           George kneels at the side of the bed, his head cocked, 
           staring directly into Eric’s vacant eyes. Charlotte closes 
           the book she was reading from: ORATION ON THE DIGNITY OF MAN.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s been days. When will it wear off?

                                 GEORGE
                        Depends on the person... Does he 
                        have any tea, ya think?
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh, will that help?

                                 GEORGE
                        No. I could use a cup.

           He’s on his feet heading for the kitchen. Charlotte follows 
           him because, well, he’s George Harrison.

           BEDROOM - LATER

           Eric rolls over and groggily opens his eyes to find a blurry 
           blonde woman sitting at the edge of his bed...

                                 ERIC
                        Who’s there?

           He struggles to reach out to her as if she’s far away, but in 
           reality, he’s just poking her back. She stifles a laugh.

                                 PATTIE
                        It’s Pattie.

                                 ERIC
                        My sister’s name is Pattie.

                                 PATTIE
                        I thought that was your mom’s name.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah.

                                 PATTIE
                        Which one is it, then?

                                 ERIC
                        Good question.

           Trying to hold himself together, he groggily gets to his feet 
           and becomes extremely aware that he’s wearing only underwear. 
           Embarrassed, he grabs a blanket to cover up.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Could you pass me my jeans?

           Pattie smiles and tosses them to him. He awkwardly tries to 
           put them on while also covering himself up. Pattie smirks...

                                 PATTIE
                        You’re not the first rockstar I’ve 
                        seen in their underwear.

           She leaves and Eric can breathe again. He struggles into his 
           jeans, falling over in the process. He jumps to his feet.
                                 ERIC
                        Never again.

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric stumbles out from the bedroom.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        The prodigal son has returned from 
                        his journey.

           Eric focuses across the room to find George and Charlotte on 
           the couch - uncomfortably close.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We were worried about you!

                                 PATTIE (O.S.)
                        Eric, do you want something?

           He turns, looking her straight in the eyes.

                                 ERIC
                        Yes.

                                 PATTIE
                        Okay, I’ll fix you something.

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Eric sits on the floor scarfing down some stew, looking up at 
           George who’s flanked by two beautiful women on the couch.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Thank God I didn’t do it. Who 
                        would’ve taken care of poor Eric?

                                 GEORGE
                        At least he knew he was doing it. 
                        This wicked dentist tricked us into 
                        taking acid our first time. Dropped 
                        it straight in our tea.

                                 PATTIE
                        It was coffee actually-

                                 GEORGE
                             (annoyed)
                        Does it really matter? It was wild. 
                        It made the little 2-bedroom flat 
                        feel like we were sitting in the 
                        middle of Albert Hall.
                                 PATTIE
                        Frightening to say the least.

           Eric watches her as she speaks softly.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        I never heard of it before. When it 
                        took effect, we were really keen to 
                        get away. So we piled into George’s 
                        mini, which felt like it was 
                        shrinking- If that’s even possible.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh, it is.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t think I ever want to try it.

                                 ERIC
                        Your mind plays tricks on you.

                                 GEORGE
                        She even tried to smash open one of 
                        the windows for air.

                                 PATTIE
                             (laughing)
                        I don’t know what I was thinking. 
                        But we finally got to a club and I 
                        was just beside myself. And all 
                        these people kept coming up to 
                        George... They looked like animals.

                                 GEORGE
                        Some of them were animals. Anyway, 
                        we clung to each other all night. 
                        Suffice to say, we never spoke to 
                        the dentist again. Though, I do owe 
                        him for turning me onto it.

                                 ERIC
                        The more we talk about it, the more 
                        I think I want to do it again.

                                 GEORGE
                        You should try meditation-

                                 PATTIE
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        Here we go-

                                 GEORGE
                        What? It’s more powerful than any 
                        one of these drugs.
                                 PATTIE
                        He meditates for five hours a day.

           George calmly ignores her jab.

                                 GEORGE
                        And it’s worth every second.

           INT. THE SPEAKEASY - BAR ROOM - NIGHT -- 1968

           CLOSE ON: Eric in a booth, strumming his guitar as he reads 
           aloud quietly from a bar napkin: 

                                 ERIC
                        “You thought the leaden winter 
                        would bring you down forever/ But 
                        you rode upon a steamer to the 
                        violence of the sun/ And the colors 
                        of the sea blind your eyes with 
                        trembling mermaids [beat] “And you 
                        touch the distant beaches with 
                        tales of brave Ulysses.”

           Eric strums a riff that sounds roughly like what will be 
           CREAM’S epic “TALES OF THE BRAVE ULYSSES.”

           The front door flies open and MAUREEN STARR storms in like a 
           bat out of hell. Trailing behind her elegantly is PATTIE 
           BOYD. For Eric the world stops. Pattie sits at the bar as 
           Maureen splits for the bathroom. Eric beelines for Pattie.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Pattie, good to see you.

                                 PATTIE
                        You too Eric.

           They are very sweet and at ease with each other.

                                 ERIC
                        You look very pretty today.

           She blushes, realizing he’s smitten with her.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Did you- Uh- Did you change your 
                        hair or something?

                                 PATTIE
                        You know you’re always very sweet. 
                        Like a shy school boy.

                                 ERIC
                        A school boy?
                                 PATTIE
                        It’s refreshing. Truly. I just had 
                        a different idea of how you’d be, 
                        ya know, from watching you on 
                        stage. That’s all.

                                 ERIC
                        Word of advice, never tell a man 
                        he’s like a school boy.

                                 PATTIE
                             (laughing/slightly drunk)
                        Unless he’s acting like one.

                                 ERIC
                        Is George coming?

                                 PATTIE
                             (annoyed)
                        No, he’s in a nasty mood.

                                 ERIC
                        What happened?

                                 PATTIE
                        Like he’d tell me. If I had to 
                        guess he got into a tiff with Paul 
                        or John. Probably Paul.

                                 ERIC
                        Trouble in paradise?

                                 PATTIE
                        George’s paradise is all in his 
                        head. [gesturing to bartender] You 
                        should come over for dinner soon. 
                        You and Charlotte.

           Charlotte exits the ladies room, and sees Eric at the bar - 
           tasting Pattie’s drink. Eric spots her, his big smile quickly 
           fading as he gestures her over. She half-smiles and joins 
           them, making a big show of hugging Pattie.

                                 ERIC
                        Pattie just invited us to dinner.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Lovely. I just ran into Maureen... 
                        Literally.

                                 PATTIE
                        She’s not herself right now. She 
                        had quite a few back at home.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        And you? How many have you had?

           The light mood is tainted... Eric squirms.

                                 PATTIE
                        A few less than her.

           EXT. HARRISON’S ESHER ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           Eric and Charlotte approach the front door. He holds a long 
           GIFT-WRAPPED BOX and she holds a bottle of wine. Before Eric 
           can ring the doorbell, an older Indian DOCTOR with greying 
           hair opens the door and exits, bag in hand.

                                 DOCTOR
                             (passing Eric)
                        Good day.

                                 ERIC
                        Wait, is George here?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes. He’s inside with Ms. Pattie.

           The doctor gets in his car. Eric peeks through the open door.

                                 ERIC
                        George?

           INT. FOYER - HARRISON’S ESHER ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric leaves Charlotte waiting in the foyer with their gifts.

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll see if I can find them.

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Further down, Eric hears a faint whisper from down the hall 
           and follows it. He can hear George chanting quietly:

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        “Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna/ Krishna 
                        Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama...

           The master bedroom door is cracked open, Eric peeks inside. 
           Pattie is sobbing, curled up in the fetal position on top of 
           the bed covers. George spoons her, holding her in his arms - 
           comforting her the best he can while he chants his mantra.

           George spots Eric watching and holds his gaze while he 
           continues to chant - it’s unsettling. George nods subtly 
           cueing Eric to retreat back to the foyer.
           FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric casually returns to Charlotte.

                                 ERIC
                        They’ll be out in a minute. How 
                        ‘bout a drink?

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Eric and Charlotte canoodle in the cushioned breakfast nook, 
           sipping cocktails. George and Pattie enter. Pattie acts 
           chipper but her glossy, puffy eyes betray her.

                                 PATTIE
                        Terribly sorry, got a late start.

                                 ERIC
                        We helped ourselves to your bar.

           Eric and Charlotte stand, hugs and kisses all around.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s in the box, mate?

           Eric grabs the long GIFT BOX that leans against the wall.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s for you.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (to Pattie)
                        And the wine’s for you, dear.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s the occasion?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s a proposal of sorts. Open it.

           George rips off the wrapping paper.

                                 GEORGE
                        A proposal?

                                 ERIC
                        I think we’d make excellent guitar-
                        in-laws.

           George’s eyes widen as he opens a guitar case to find a shiny 
           RED GIBSON LES PAUL. He examines it as Eric awaits approval 
           from his older counterpart.
                                 GEORGE
                        It’s a funny looking guitar. Redder 
                        than red.

                                 ERIC
                        Found her in a guitar shop in 
                        Manhattan. Used to belong to the 
                        guitarist from The Lovin’ Spoonful.

                                 GEORGE
                        She’s beautiful. Why give her to me? 

                                 ERIC
                        It just feels right. Besides I 
                        neglect her.

                           PATTIE
           Sounds familiar.
                                                         CHARLOTTE
                                               That’s not the only thing he 
                                               neglects.

           The girls cheers. The guys don’t even catch the comments...

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s her name?

                                 ERIC
                        I haven’t even named her, ya see 
                        what I mean?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (buzzed)
                        You should have seen him agonizing 
                        over it- “Is he going to like it?”, 
                        “You think he’ll even play it?” Back 
                        and forth, back and forth. He almost 
                        made me turn the car around tonight. 
                        Makes me wonder if he puts this much 
                        thought into my gifts.

                                 ERIC
                             (embarrassed)
                        She’s exaggerating- I was just-

                                 PATTIE
                        That’s really sweet, Eric.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m teasing. Just take a joke.

                                 PATTIE
                        George, you can play with your new 
                        toy after dinner.
                                 GEORGE
                        She’s not a toy, dear. Show some 
                        respect to Lucille. Lucille Ball.

                                 PATTIE
                        Maybe we should set her a place at 
                        the table.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Ever think he’d leave you for a redhead?

           George winks and moves to kiss Pattie. She lets him kiss her.

                                 ERIC
                        Give it a play. I tuned it before I 
                        came over.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He tuned it four times.

           He plays the familiar melody of “SOMETHING”.

                                 GEORGE
                        Somewhere in her smile she knows/I 
                        don’t need no other lover/Something 
                        in her style that shows me”

           Eric sees how his words affect Pattie, her eyes welling up. 
           George mumble hums two bars, then:

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Something in the way she moves/ Something 
                        in the way she woos me/ Attracts me like 
                        a... [mumbles] Pomegranate.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        A pomegranate?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, I’m still working on it.

                                 PATTIE
                        I think it’s sweet.

                                 GEORGE
                        Pattie was cutting up a pomegranate 
                        earlier... And it had the right 
                        syllables. It’s a placeholder.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Good.

                                 GEORGE
                        I hate showing a work in progress-
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did you just write that for your 
                        new love, Lucy?

                                 GEORGE
                        I wrote it for Pattie.

                                 PATTIE
                             (blushing)
                        Truly?

                                 GEORGE
                        Truly.

                                 ERIC
                             (writhing with envy)
                        You’re his muse.

                                 PATTIE
                        No, that would be yoga.

           Charlotte senses something off with Eric and slaps his arm.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (half-joking)
                        Where’s my song?

                                 GEORGE
                             (wincing, guilty)
                        Sorry, mate.

                                 ERIC
                        Every song was written for you-

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yeah, that must include “We’re 
                        Going Wrong.”

                                 ERIC
                             (laughing)
                        Actually Jack wrote that one.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Piss off.

           George urges the group toward the kitchen.

                                 GEORGE
                        Let’s eat, shall we?

           EXT. ERIC’S FLAT - MORNING - DAYS LATER

           George parks and HONKS the horn of his new RED MINI-COOPER - 
           colorful psychedelic graffiti adorning both sides.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - ERIC’S FLAT - MORNING

           Eric and Charlotte are in the throes of an escalating 
           argument. Eric peeks out the window and sees George leaning 
           against his parked Mini.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re really going to leave right 
                        now? In the middle of this?

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah, he’s here. He said we can’t 
                        be late.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Fuck you Eric. Why isn’t this 
                        important to you? [beat] Rhetorical 
                        fucking question. It’s because you 
                        only give a shit about yourself.

                                 ERIC
                        That’s not fair. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Just go. Don’t worry, I won’t be 
                        here when you get back.

                                 ERIC
                             (mocking)
                        Where are you going to go?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t know. Maybe back to Paris.

                                 ERIC
                        If that’s what you want...

           He casually puts his coat on. She SCREAMS as she chucks a 
           stack of MAGAZINES at him.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re a bastard.

                                 ERIC
                             (calmly)
                        I think you’re right.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That you’re a bastard?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s probably best we take a break.

           Tears streak her face as she grabs a glass to throw at him--
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Ey- Easy! It’s just I’m moving out 
                        of this place and-

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What the hell’s that have to do 
                        with us?

                                 ERIC
                        If I’m moving out, I think I need a 
                        fresh start. I need to live alone.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re lying to me.

                                 ERIC
                        No. What’s there to lie about?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (begging)
                        Your feelings. Just tell me how you feel.

                                 ERIC
                        We’ve grown apart. That’s all.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No you have. You’ve shut me out.

           George HONKS the horn again.

                                 ERIC
                        Charlotte, I’ve loved you more than 
                        I could possibly love anyone, but-

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re in love with someone else...

           He’s caught off guard. Charlotte instantly knows she’s right. 
           George HONKS twice more - Eric shakes his head, flustered-

                                 ERIC
                        Alright, fuck!

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Does he know you’re in love with 
                        his wife?

           She doesn’t even let it settle before she grabs her purse.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                        I’ll move my stuff out tonight.

           She SLAMS the door behind her, leaving Eric with his shame.
           EXT. ERIC’S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER

           George leans up against his car smoking a cigarette as 
           Charlotte storms out. She walks right up to him and without 
           hesitation gives him a long kiss. She pulls away, smirks 
           devilishly, and without a word, struts off leaving George 
           caught off-guard, but intrigued. A moment later Eric emerges. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Everything alright?

                                 ERIC
                        Charlotte and I just ended it.

                                 GEORGE
                             (understanding now)
                        Sorry to hear that.

                                 ERIC
                        Never mind that. What’s all this 
                        about? What was so urgent?

                                 GEORGE
                        We’re late. Gotta get to Abbey Road.

           Eric’s mood does a 180 as George gets in the car.

                                 ERIC
                        Really? Fantastic!

           EXT. PARKING LOT - ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS - SHORTLY AFTER

           As they get out of the Mini and head toward the front door.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a favor to ask you.

                                 ERIC
                        Name it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I wrote this song for our new 
                        album, ya know, and I’d like you to 
                        play guitar on it.

                                 ERIC
                             (dumbfounded)
                        You want me to play guitar, the instrument 
                        you play, on a Beatles album?

                                 GEORGE
                        Just one song.
                                 ERIC
                        Right. So you’ve kidnapped me to 
                        play on a Beatles record- George, 
                        no one ever plays on Beatles’ 
                        records. Except for The Beatles.

                                 GEORGE
                        You could be the first.

                                 ERIC
                        That’s a lot of pressure. They’re 
                        not going to want me intruding.

                                 GEORGE
                        Sure they will. They love your work.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t know. Like you said, Paul 
                        has very particular tastes. We 
                        might not vibe, ya know?

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re Eric fucking Clapton. He’ll 
                        let you play how you want to play.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re just saying that.

                                 GEORGE
                        You really gonna make me beg mate?

                                 ERIC
                        What about John?

                                 GEORGE
                        John loves you. He talks about 
                        playing with you all the time.

                                 ERIC
                        Really?

           George looks at his watch.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well what’s it going to be?

                                 ERIC
                        I didn’t even bring my guitar.

                                 GEORGE
                             (smiling)
                        You can borrow Lucy.
           INT. STUDIO - ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS - LATER

           Eric sits amongst THE BEATLES (PAUL, JOHN, RINGO, and GEORGE) 
           like he belongs there as they all prepare to play. Pattie and 
           Maureen, beers in hand, come into the studio.

                                 RINGO
                        There she is. With beer no less. 
                        What a woman!

           Ringo kisses Maureen warmly. George is off to the side, too 
           preoccupied talking with the ENGINEER to even acknowledge 
           Pattie. Instead Eric does.

                                 ERIC
                        I didn’t know we were going to have 
                        an audience.

                                 PATTIE
                        Do we make you nervous?

                                 PAUL
                             (claps his hands)
                        Alright, let’s get to it.

           Everyone takes their place, the girls sit on the floor.

                                 GEORGE
                        So, Eric, I’ll start it off and you 
                        just come in when it feels right.

                                 ERIC
                        Huh? You want me to wing it? I can’t 
                        just- This is a Beatles album.

           Eric squirms as Paul and John stare at him.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’ll do fine, mate. Just play off 
                        me, whatever comes naturally.

                                 ERIC
                        George. I need a little more than that.

           George begins strumming “WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS” as 
           Eric’s mind races, sweat beading up on his forehead. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Play from the heart.

           Eric grips his guitar, glances around the room, all eyes on 
           him. His attention falls onto Pattie, he takes a deep breath.
           Eric strums his first chord and settles in, laying down the 
           guitar expertly without ever taking his eyes off Pattie.

           Paul barely keeps up on bass. John and Ringo can’t take their 
           eyes off his fingers as he closes with a beautiful CODA.

           As he finishes, Eric glances over to George who’s been 
           watching him stare at Pattie the entire length of the song.

                                 JOHN
                        That was fucking brilliant.

                                 PAUL
                        It really was.

                                 ERIC
                        I just played off George. He had 
                        the vision.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, that sealed the track for me.

           Paul gestures to the ENGINEER through the window.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Let’s play it back.

           The song plays. Eric cringes as he hears himself.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ERIC
                        It sounds like me.

                                 RINGO
                        What’s wrong with that?

                                 ERIC
                        It sticks out like a sore thumb. It 
                        should sound more like a Beatles 
                        song, not a blues song.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s why George brought you.

           Everyone relaxes, grabbing beers. George goes into the 
           control room to tinker with the engineer. Maureen follows, 
           which Eric notices. So does Pattie, who sidles up to Eric.

                                 PATTIE
                        You fit right in, huh?
                                 ERIC
                        Yeah, I was thinking of getting the 
                        signature haircut.

           She LAUGHS as Eric’s eyes shift to George and Maureen through 
           the glass - their interaction is harmless but suspicious. 
           John interrupts and throws his arm around Eric’s shoulder.

                                 JOHN
                        Eric, we need to play together. 
                        Beyond this obviously. I don’t know 
                        when or where, but it will happen.

                                 ERIC
                        I’d like that.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not joking. I know I can bring 
                        out something great, in fact 
                        greater, in you that has yet to be 
                        discovered in your music.

                                 PAUL
                        Was that supposed to be a 
                        compliment, John?

                                 PATTIE
                        He’s already quite great, John.

                                 RINGO
                        Yeah, godly great.

                                 ERIC
                             (beyond embarrassed)
                        Please- I think I know what he means-

                                 JOHN
                        Of course he’s great. But just wait 
                        til we get together.

                                 PAUL
                        Watch out Eric. I think John’s 
                        trying to seduce you.

           Eric looks to George through the glass - he’s been listening 
           to the whole thing.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

           The studio is empty - George, headphones on, sits listening 
           to playback - he rewinds and restarts with a smile across his 
           face. Pattie sits next to him, half asleep, but stirs as Eric 
           enters. George’s eyes are closed as he sways to the music.
                                 ERIC
                        Everyone’s left and I just realized 
                        George drove me here.

                                 PATTIE
                        We’ll take you home.

                                 ERIC
                        Wait’ll I tell my mum I played with 
                        The Beatles.

                                 PATTIE
                        Aw- You two must be close. You seem 
                        like that type.

           Eric shifts his weight and moves his attention to George.

                                 ERIC
                        What does he think?

                                 PATTIE
                        Looks like he likes it.

                                 ERIC
                        He wrote a very moving song.

           She looks at George, lost in his happiest place. Whispers:

                                 PATTIE
                        He talks about you all the time.

                                 ERIC
                        None of it’s true.

                                 PATTIE
                        He said after he met you he almost 
                        quit playing the guitar. He said 
                        you just have this feel. An 
                        intuitive touch that he envies.

                                 ERIC
                        He’s got it too. He’s got quite a 
                        few things I envy actually.

           Pattie blushes.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HARRISON’S ESHER ESTATE - WEEKS LATER

           Eric plays guitar as George writes lyrics. They pass a joint.

                                 ERIC
                        I think I just found my new place. 
                        It’s this ridiculous Italian Villa 
                        in Surrey called Hurtwood Edge.
                                 GEORGE
                        Cool name. Sounds Gothic.

                                 ERIC
                        Thanks for helping me write this. 
                        I’d never be able to get it done 
                        before my session tonight.

                                 GEORGE
                        Did you just forget about it?

                                 ERIC
                        No, but given the choice between 
                        accomplishing something and just 
                        lying around, I’d rather lie 
                        around, play the guitar.

                                 GEORGE
                        If you’re going to play the damn 
                        thing, why not just write as well?

                                 ERIC
                        Because then I have to think. I 
                        play on autopilot. I blackout or 
                        something, the world turns off. 
                        There’s nothing better, ya know?

                                 GEORGE
                        No, mate, I think a lot when I play. 
                        I have to. You’re a freak of nature.

           Eric LAUGHS.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Writing’s my favorite part. I’d 
                        write all day and night if it meant 
                        I didn’t have to play.

                                 ERIC
                        Good thing you play in the most 
                        famous band in the world.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, maybe one day I’ll write for 
                        them too-

           George starts playing the beginning of Cream’s “BADGE”.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        The only time I enjoy playing these 
                        days is when Pattie’s watching. 
                        Playing for her is like... I can’t 
                        explain it. She makes me feel like 
                        George fucking Harrison, ya know?
                                 ERIC
                        Yeah. I do.

           George smirks.

           INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - NIGHT

           CREAM (Eric on guitar, Ginger on drums, and Jack on bass and 
           vocals) play “BADGE”.

                                 JACK BRUCE
                        “Talkin’ bout a girl that looks 
                        quite like you/ She didn’t have the 
                        time to wait in the queue/ She 
                        cried away her life since she fell 
                        off the cradle.”

                                 ERIC
                             (stops playing)
                        Maybe, try singing it like...

           Eric SINGS it slightly different but his voice is soft and 
           unsure; Jack mimics almost exactly but with confidence-

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Closer, but-

           Eric SINGS it again, Jack is getting frustrated.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Ginger, what do you think? Which 
                        way do you like it best?

                                 JACK BRUCE
                        You wrote the damn thing, Eric, why 
                        don’t you just sing it.

                                 ERIC
                        No, no, no. I couldn’t. I’d never 
                        want to listen to it. Sorry just do 
                        it your way.

                                 GINGER
                        Make up your fuckin’ mind, mate!

           Ginger starts wailing on the drums.

           INT. HURTWOOD EDGE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

           “MANNISH BOY” plays on vinyl. Eric, on the couch, is dressed 
           in a dapper suit with his hair combed and beard neatly 
           trimmed as he sips on a brandy and 7-Up. He wipes the wet 
           from his mustache as he looks to the ticking CLOCK. After a 
           moment, the phone RINGS, he jumps to his feet and grabs it.
                                 ERIC (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello!

           Eric goes quiet as his body softens and shrinks.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Oh. Of course [beat] No, no, 
                        wouldn’t want to burden you. [beat] 
                        Next time then. Right.

           Eric hangs up, sits down, and gulps down his drink. He 
           reaches over to the phone, brings it to his lap, and dials.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Oh- Hi, Pattie. Is George- [beat] 
                        I’m good. How are you? [beat] I’m 
                        glad. Is George around? [beat] Of 
                        course he is, the man never stops 
                        working. [laughs] Was just looking 
                        for a mate tonight- A drinkin’ mate.

           Eric goes silent. His eyes brighten.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Really? You want to be my drinkin’ 
                        mate tonight?

           LATER

           Eric, still in his sharp suit, opens the front door to find 
           Pattie, heavenly in a casual white dress. Eric stares.

                                 PATTIE
                        May I come in?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Eric nervously makes her a drink. Pattie notices his clothes.

                                 PATTIE
                        You didn’t get all dolled up like 
                        that for me, did you?

           Eric is caught off guard.

                                 ERIC
                        Of course I did.

                                 PATTIE
                        You’re lying to me, Eric. Did you 
                        have a date?

                                 ERIC
                        No.
           She jumps to her feet to console him.

                                 PATTIE
                        Oh my god, you had a date. Eric, 
                        what happened?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s nothing.

                                 PATTIE
                        Who is she? Did she cancel on you? 
                        I swear I’ll find her and-

                                 ERIC
                        I’m fine. But thank you.

           Eric LAUGHS. Pattie studies his face.

                                 PATTIE
                        Was it that little French girl?
                             (stern)
                        Eric, do not go crawling back to 
                        her. She’s poisonous.

                                 ERIC
                        It wasn’t Charlotte.

                                 PATTIE
                        Good. I never liked her.

           Eric LAUGHS and hands her the drink.

                                 ERIC
                        Drink up so you can have another. 
                        You have some catching up to do.

           LATER

           Eric, strumming his guitar, sits beside Pattie on the couch, 
           comfortable with one another now.

                                 PATTIE
                        Can you play David Bowie?

                                 ERIC
                        Anything you want.

           Eric plays an impressive version of “Space Oddity.” 

                                 PATTIE
                             (swaying to the music)
                        You have to sing it.
                                 ERIC
                        Absolutely not.

                                 PATTIE
                        Give me your best Bowie.

                                 ERIC
                        How ‘bout I play, and you give me 
                        your best Bowie?

           He takes a MICROPHONE from a stand and hands it to her. 

                                 PATTIE
                        You aren’t any fun.

           Eric strums harder, really into it. They sit Indian-style on 
           the couch, face to face with knees touching. 

                                 ERIC
                        Go ahead.

           Pattie clears her throat.

                                 PATTIE
                             (doing her best Bowie)

           Pattie GIGGLES.

                                 PATTIE
                        Commencing countdown, engines on...

                                 PATTIE
                        Check ignition and may God’s love 
                        be with you...

                                 ERIC
                        Two, one, liftoff...

           Pattie jumps to her feet on the couch, towering over Eric, 
           who gazes up at her belting out the next verse with passion.
                                 PATTIE
                        This is Ground Control to Major/ 
                        You’ve really made the grade/ And

                        leave the capsule if you dare...

           EXT. MARGARET STREET - LONDON, ENGLAND - LATER

           DAVID BOWIE’S “SPACE ODDITY” continues softly. Eric and 
           Pattie drunkenly walk arm-in-arm, in sync, but holding each 
           other up. There’s a lightness to their step.

                                 ERIC
                        Now that man is an alien. I’m not 
                        kidding. You haven’t seen him play. 
                        He’s not even playing music. I 
                        don’t know what’s coming out of 
                        that guitar but it’s sure as shit 
                        not from this world.

           Pattie gazes up at Eric as he talks passionately.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        My jaw was on the fuckin’ floor 
                        when he came out to play “Killing 
                        Floor” with us. I couldn’t keep up. 
                        And I’ve never not kept up.

                                 PATTIE
                        He couldn’t have been that good. 
                        You’re a god, Eric. It’s graffitied 
                        all over the fuckin’ city.

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t remind me. It’s disgusting.

                                 PATTIE
                        No, it’s beautiful. You’re revered.

                                 ERIC
                        People love to worship false idols.

                                 PATTIE
                        You’re absolutely mad.

                                 ERIC
                        Jimi fucking Hendrix. He’s a force 
                        to be reckoned with. He’s the only 
                        one out there truly upholding the 
                        blues standard. It’s me and him. 
                        And he’s winning.

           Pattie LAUGHS and squeezes Eric’s arm tighter.
                                 PATTIE
                        It’s not a competition.

                                 ERIC
                        Of course it is.

           INT. STAGE ROOM - SPEAKEASY - LATER

           Eric and Pattie sit across from each other, still drinking.

                                 PATTIE
                        Please tell me who the lucky lady 
                        was suppose to be tonight.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s not important.

                                 PATTIE
                        It’s very important. You deserve 
                        someone who can reciprocate all this 
                        love I know you have inside you.

           Eric stares at her, falling in love.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        Let me set you up with one of my friends.

                                 ERIC
                             (deflated)
                        I hate set-ups-

                                 PATTIE
                        Don’t be silly. I don’t have many 
                        girlfriends but the few I do are-

                                 ERIC
                        Pattie, I don’t have time for a girl. 
                        I’m going to LA for the farewell tour-

                                 PATTIE
                        I just want to see you happy.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m happy right now.

                                 PATTIE
                        Let me think who would be ideal for-

                                 ERIC
                             (blurting)
                        It was my mother. [beat] My mother 
                        stood me up. She’s the one who 
                        cancelled on me tonight.
           Pattie’s heart breaks.

                                 PATTIE
                        Oh. Eric.

           She gets up and slides in next to him, putting her arm around 
           him. He’s uncomfortable yet happy to be so close to Pattie.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s nothing.

                                 PATTIE
                        Shut up.

                                 ERIC
                        What?

                                 PATTIE
                        You’re hurting. It’s okay.

           She holds him, he’s settles into her arms a little.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        Look at me.

           He does like an obedient child.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        When’s the last time you saw her?

           Eric thinks for a long moment and grimaces at the memory.

                                 ERIC
                        About 4 or 5 years ago. I visited 
                        her on a German Air Force Base 
                        where her husband was stationed. I 
                        had just started playing with The 
                        Yardbirds. Finally coming into my 
                        own, ya know? And you know what the 
                        prick does to me?

                                 PATTIE
                        What?

                                 ERIC
                        Gives me a crew cut. Says he 
                        wouldn’t have me prancing around 
                        his base with women’s hair. I 
                        didn’t even know the guy. Had never 
                        met him before.

                                 PATTIE
                        I like your hair.
                                 ERIC
                        Can we talk about something else?

                                 PATTIE
                        So that’s the last time you saw 
                        your mum?

                                 ERIC
                        Her name’s Pat. I don’t call her 
                        mum. She’s not my mum. Not in the 
                        true sense of the word anyway.

                                 PATTIE
                        What does that mean?

           Eric looks away from her. He SIGHS.

                                 ERIC
                        My grandparents raised me. She’s my 
                        sister. I thought my mum was my 
                        sister until I was 9. Everyone knew 
                        except... [beat] They called me a 
                        bastard. I thought it meant idiot.

           Pattie has no words as Eric’s face becomes increasingly red.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I’m a bastard and my mum wanted 
                        nothing to do with me. She went off 
                        and had a new family and new kids 
                        and left me to figure the rest out. 
                        Okay? You got the whole story now.

                                 PATTIE
                        I had no idea.

                                 ERIC
                        No one does.

                                 PATTIE
                        Except for your guitar.

                                 ERIC
                        I like it that way.

           From across the room, a STAGE MANAGER calls out to Eric:

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Eric! Our opening act cancelled on 
                        us. You want to sing a few songs?

                                 ERIC
                        We’re in the middle of something here.
           Approaching, the Stage Manager sees Eric’s teary eyes.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        I didn’t mean to interrupt.

           Before Eric can react, Pattie places her hand on his.

                                 PATTIE
                        It’s okay.

           Eric looks at her hand on his, she slowly pulls away, 
           realizing they’ve gotten too close. He wipes his face and 
           swigs his drink.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry mate, ya didn’t interrupt anything.

           Pattie rubs his back.

                                 PATTIE
                        Eric. You should sing. Everyone 
                        will love it.

                                 ERIC
                        Pattie, please-

                                 PATTIE
                        Do it for me.

           Eric contemplates as he stares into Pattie’s pleading eyes.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Well?

           STAGE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

           Eric sits on a stool on stage alone with his guitar facing a 
           fairly large audience - Pattie sits front and center. Eric 
           lowers his head slightly and with eyes focused on his guitar, 
           plays a stripped down, understated “SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE.”

                                 ERIC
                        It’s gettin’ near dawn/ When lights 
                        close their tired eyes...

           His voice trembles, noticeably... It’s soft and barely 
           emanates through the room - so the room adjusts and becomes 
           DEAD SILENT - despite it’s softness, his voice is beautiful.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I’ll soon be with you my love/ To 
                        give you my dawn surprise/ I’ll be 
                        with you darling soon/ I’ll be with 
                        you when the stars start falling...
           Pattie is mesmerized. Eric has yet to look up from his 
           guitar, afraid of how the audience is reacting to his voice.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been waiting so long/ To be where 
                        I’m going/ In the sunshine of your love.

           Eric belts out on the word “LOVE” and lets it linger. He 
           finally looks up and immediately locks eyes with Pattie who’s 
           frozen with watery eyes.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I’m with you my love/ The light’s 
                        shining through on you/ Yes, I’m 
                        with you my love/ It’s the morning 
                        and just we two/ I’ll stay with you 
                        darling now/ I’ll stay with you 
                        till my seas are dried up...

           Eric doesn’t take his eyes off her as he plays an elegant 
           solo... She finally exhales the breath she’s been holding 
           since he started singing.

           The DOOR at the back of the room swings open and in walks 
           GEORGE, RINGO, and MAUREEN. They freeze as they recognize 
           Eric on stage. Eric nearly chokes on his words as George 
           gives him an amused little wave. Eric watches George come up 
           behind Pattie, whisper in her ear, and pull her to his booth.

           Eric finishes up his song and quickly packs up his guitar.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        That’s it for me. Thank you.

           Eric ducks offstage and heads toward the exit as Pattie 
           cozies up next to George, who shows her an unusual amount of 
           affection. Eric stops as Pattie glances over to him. He 
           musters a sad smile, mouths to her “good night” and turns to 
           leave. Right as Eric reaches the door, a hand grabs his 
           shoulder and spins him around.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey, where you going?

                                 ERIC
                        Home. I’m tired.

                                 GEORGE
                        Uh huh. Well, I just wanted to give 
                        you a preview of our new album. 
                        Swing by before you head to LA. I’d 
                        love to hear what you think.
                                 ERIC
                        I’d love that.

           George gives him a hug.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK -- 1970

           EXT. BACKYARD - HURTWOOD EDGE - AFTERNOON

           Grizzly bearded ERIC (25), wearing a tattered robe, sits on 
           the porch staring at the snow-covered hills with a bottle of 
           brandy and the telephone by his side, its cord pulled taut 
           from the house. He talks quietly to himself...

                                 ERIC
                        “I know we haven’t spoke in a 
                        while, but I’m just wondering if 
                        you got my letter.” No-

           He takes a swig of brandy. BOBBY steps out onto the porch.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        “Hi Pattie. I’m calling to make 
                        sure that you got my letter-” Shit. 
                        “Pattie. There’s a strong chance I 
                        accidentally mailed you something-”

           He downs his brandy and dials. Bobby lunges for the phone.

                                 BOBBY
                        Hey, hey! You can’t call her, man!

           They wrestle over the phone until Bobby manages to hang it 
           up. Eric pushes Bobby off the porch into the snow. They stare 
           at one another, breathing heavily.

                                 ERIC
                        I need to know.

                                 BOBBY
                        If she read the letter, then her 
                        silence on the matter should give 
                        you your answer.

                                 ERIC
                        And if she didn’t read it, then-

                                 BOBBY
                        Then that’s fuckin’ great because 
                        you shouldn’t have written it in 
                        the first place!
                                 ERIC
                        I need to know!

                                 BOBBY
                        No, what you need is to focus on a 
                        new band.

                                 ERIC
                        Like me and you?

                                 BOBBY
                             (nervously)
                        Maybe?

                                 ERIC
                        Could be fun... Not an Eric Clapton 
                        band though. Something different.

                                 BOBBY
                             (smiles)
                        Whatever’ll get your mind off it.

           Eric looks at him, contemplating.

                                 ERIC
                        Tomorrow we’ll go see Stigwood and 
                        we’ll tell him that we are putting 
                        together a band and we need a little 
                        pocket money while we’re doing it.

                                 BOBBY
                        He’ll pay us before we even tour?

           The phone RINGS - the guys freeze for a long moment. On the 
           third RING they both lunge for the phone - Bobby grabs it.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

           Bobby’s eyes go wide. Eric has a mini panic attack.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Uh- Just a moment, I’ll get him.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s her, isn’t it?

                                 BOBBY
                             (cupping the receiver)
                        It’s George.

           Eric nearly chokes on his heart. He takes the phone.
                                 ERIC (INTO PHONE)
                        Hi George. Uh huh. Okay. What 
                        about? Oh- Sure, I’ll meet you 
                        there tonight.

           Bobby cringes as Eric hangs up the phone, terrified.

                                 BOBBY
                        What’d he want?

                                 ERIC
                        Didn’t say. He just said, “We need 
                        to talk.”

           INT. BAR - LIVERPOOL EMPIRE HOTEL - NIGHT

           The lively CROWD swarms around Eric who sits alone in a semi-
           circle booth nursing a drink. His eyes focus on another 
           drink, presumably George’s, condensating across from him. A 
           beautiful, drunken WOMAN recognizes Eric and sits down.

                                 WOMAN
                        What’s got you so tight? Loosen up. 
                        [pulling at his sleeve] Come dance.

                                 ERIC
                        Not tonight-

           George arrives at the table and puts two more drinks down.

                                 GEORGE
                        Miss, I think you’re in my seat.

           She SQUEALS, Eric cringes. She throws her arms around George.

                                 WOMAN
                        He’s no fun.

                                 GEORGE
                        And either am I. Excuse us.

           Rejected, she stomps off as George sits down. He pushes one 
           of the drinks toward Eric.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Thought we could use a few more.

                                 ERIC
                             (apprehensive)
                        So, George, what are we doing here?

                                 GEORGE
                        I haven’t seen you in awhile. Feel 
                        like you’ve been avoiding me.
                                 ERIC
                        No, just been busy with the solo 
                        album. You know how it is.

                                 GEORGE
                        You finished that months ago.
                             (Eric shrugs as--)
                        I told you I started work on my own 
                        solo album, yeah?

                                 ERIC
                        You may have mentioned something.

                                 GEORGE
                        “This Too Shall Pass.”

                                 ERIC
                        Huh?

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s what I’m going to call it. 
                        It comes from a Sufi proverb 
                        meaning that everything is 
                        temporary. Material possessions, 
                        emotions, and just life in general.

                                 ERIC
                        Does this mean you’re finally 
                        signing the divorce papers?

                                 GEORGE
                        I think we all know it’s coming.

                                 ERIC
                        All things, even The Beatles, have 
                        to die at some point.

                                 GEORGE
                        Good riddance, I say.

           Eric downs his drink and musters up some nerve...

                                 ERIC
                        Out with it George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Out with what?

                                 ERIC
                        Whatever you wanted to talk to me 
                        about? It sounded pretty serious.

                                 GEORGE
                        It is. We’re talking about it right now.
                                 ERIC
                        We are?

                                 GEORGE
                        I want you to put together a 
                        backing band for my album. I won’t 
                        take no for an answer.

                                 ERIC
                             (relieved)
                        When you said, “we need to talk,” 
                        George, I thought you wanted to kill me.

                                 GEORGE
                        Why would I want to kill you?

                                 ERIC
                        Wasn’t sure.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, how about my new album?

                                 ERIC
                        Absolutely. I’d be honored.

           They cheers and down their drinks.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I’m actually one step ahead of you. 
                        I’ve started something with Bobby 
                        Whitlock. We’re bringing in Carl 
                        Radle and probably Jim Keltner.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s fuckin’ fantastic. [beat] 
                        Let’s get us a bottle. Pattie’s on 
                        her way with her sister.

                                 ERIC
                        Here?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah. Pattie’s got it in her head 
                        to set you two up.

           Eric ruminates... Did she read the letter?

                                 ERIC
                        Is that right?

           LATER

           Eric and George are about halfway through the bottle.
                                 ERIC
                        Shit- George, I really ought to 
                        talk to you-

           Distracted, Eric's attention moves to the entrance as Pattie 
           walks in.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Pattie’s here.

           George follows his eye-line and spots her.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, that’s her sister, Paula.

           Eric squints and sees it’s her younger and just as beautiful 
           sister, PAULA BOYD (19). Pattie follows close behind, almost 
           protective, as they maneuver through the crowd. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        She just moved back in town. She’s 
                        a bit of a lush, a wild child.

           Eric, intrigued, glances between the Boyd sisters who bear a 
           remarkable resemblance in both facial features and hairstyle.

                                 ERIC
                        She looks a lot like Pattie...

                                 GEORGE
                        I think I’m gonna have a go at her.

           Eric LAUGHS - George can’t be serious... Can he?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s her sister! Don’t you think 
                        Pattie might have something to say 
                        about that?

                                 GEORGE
                        Not if Pattie is preoccupied with a 
                        fine gentleman such as yourself.

           Eric bursts into an awkward laugh as the LADIES sit.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                             (snarky)
                        Fashionably late, as always-

                                 PATTIE
                             (snarkier)
                        Well, we wanted to be sure you had 
                        ample time to talk business.
                                 GEORGE
                        We were done about a bottle ago.

                                 PAULA
                        Enough. The girls are here now, and 
                        we want to dance.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’d love to dance Paula-

           George takes her hand and whisks her to her feet.

                                 PATTIE
                        Eric’s got better moves anyway-

                                 GEORGE
                        Good, maybe he could teach you a 
                        thing or two-

           MOMENTS LATER

           Eric and Pattie dance without a word, until...

                                 ERIC
                             (blurting)
                        Did you read my letter?

           She’s visibly caught off guard.

                                 PATTIE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking about.

                                 ERIC
                        You never got a letter?

                                 PATTIE
                        No, I didn’t get any letter.

                                 ERIC
                        Fuck- All this time. You don’t 
                        think George opened it, do ya?

                                 PATTIE
                        If he did, would he be upset?

           Eric gives that a thought, looks to George and Paula dancing.

                                 ERIC
                        I would be. [beat] You really 
                        didn’t read it?

                                 PATTIE
                        No. And from the sound of it, it’s 
                        best I didn’t. 
           Eric bites his tongue as George and Paula dance around them.

                                 ERIC
                        Pattie-

                                 PATTIE
                        I don’t want to know what it said-

                                 ERIC
                        I was just going to say you look 
                        wonderful tonight.

           She studies his face, his eyes, and then softens.

                                 PATTIE
                        That’s very sweet.

           A moment of silence...

                                 ERIC
                        But I will say, I think you might 
                        enjoy reading it-

                                 PATTIE
                        My sister keeps asking about you. 
                        Let’s talk about that.

           Eric eyes George as he dances with Paula.

                                 ERIC
                        She seems fun.

                                 PATTIE
                        Do you find her attractive?

                                 ERIC
                        Of course. She looks like you.

                                 PATTIE
                        She’s much prettier. You’d be lucky 
                        to have her.

           George and Paula sidle up to them. Pattie grabs George’s hand 
           and pulls him close; Eric now dances with Paula, his eyes 
           never leaving Pattie.

                                 PAULA
                        Hello again...

                                 ERIC
                        I heard you fancy me-

           He barely gets the words out before she plants a KISS on him.
           LATER

           In a booth, Pattie’s falling asleep on George’s shoulder - he 
           bitterly watches Eric and Paula tear up the dance floor, 
           kissing between moves. As Eric dips Paula, George interrupts.

                                 GEORGE
                        We’re going to call it a night. 
                        Coming Paula?

                                 PAULA
                        No. Eric and I are going to stay 
                        out all night!

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s up to Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        Of course. I’ll get her home safe.

           Paula hugs Pattie goodbye as George whispers to Eric.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re lucky I changed my mind.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m so grateful for your divine 
                        grace.

           Eric hugs George, then kisses Pattie and the couples part.

                                 PATTIE
                        Have fun, kids.

           INT. GEORGE’S CAR - NIGHT

           George is stoic as he and Pattie drive home.

                                 PATTIE
                        They’re so cute together. I think 
                        it’ll be good for both of them. 
                        Don’t you think? [off his silence] 
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Nothing.

                                 PATTIE
                        It’ll be healthy for Eric.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s not Eric I’m worried about.
                                 PATTIE
                             (heart-warmed)
                        She’ll be fine, George. Lord, you’re so 
                        protective of her. Like a big brother.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, I’m not.

                                 PATTIE
                        Yes you are. It’s sweet, really.

           EXT. BACKYARD - ROBERT STIGWOOD’S MANSION - AFTERNOON

           A huge GO-KART TRACK surrounds a luxurious pool with 
           beautiful PAULA floating on a raft in the center.

           Bobby Whitlock zips around with two of his old Southern 
           bandmates: CARL RADLE (28) balding with long hair, a handle 
           bar mustache, and small round spectacles, and JIM GORDON (25) 
           who’s got a foul-mouth and a curly mop of hair.

           INT. OFFICE - STIGWOOD’S MANSION - AFTERNOON

           Eric sits across from his manager ROBERT STIGWOOD (35), 
           tanned in a smart blue suit and a suave scarf - the man is 
           immaculate. Eric throws a ROLLING STONE article down...

                                 ERIC
                        “Clapton is a master of the blues cliché.”

                                 ROBERT
                             (Australian accent)
                        What the fuck does John Landau know?

                                 ERIC
                        He’s not fucking wrong, Robert. 
                        Cream was nothing but a bunch of 
                        self-indulgent pricks soloing for 
                        thirty minutes a piece.

                                 ROBERT
                        Well those self-indulgent solos 
                        made us all a lot of fuckin’ money. 
                        And if you had just stuck it out 
                        with Blind Faith, then-

                                 ERIC
                        Then what?

                                 ROBERT
                        My point is, what are you doing 
                        dickin’ around with these guys?
           Robert glances out the window as Jim rams Carl off the track 
           flipping the go-kart, Bobby screeches to a halt. Eric LAUGHS.

                                 ERIC
                        They’re talented and they know the 
                        fuckin’ blues.

                                 ROBERT
                        They’re nobodies, Eric. Tough sell.

                                 ERIC
                        That’s not my problem. They’re 
                        exactly what I need.

                                 ROBERT
                        What you need is another solo album-

                                 ERIC
                        This is happening.

                                 ROBERT
                        Fine. What about Ginger on drums?

                                 ERIC
                        Absolutely not. We got Jim. And we’re 
                        going to need some money to get 
                        started. They’re all living with me.

           Robert rolls his eyes.

                                 ROBERT
                        Here we go- Do you have a name yet?

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t care what our name is as 
                        long as Clapton is nowhere near it.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’re killin’ me, Ric.

           Robert pulls out his checkbook and starts scribbling.

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        I’m giving you this check on one 
                        condition. I heard Dave Mason is a 
                        free agent. Bring him on as 2nd 
                        guitar, give this thing some clout.

                                 ERIC
                        Deal.

           Paula, wrapped in a towel, comes in and sits on Eric’s lap as 
           Robert hands him the check. Eric waves it in front of her.
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go buy you a new dress.

           They make out like teenagers as he picks her up and carries 
           her toward the door.

                                 ROBERT
                        Get to work, Eric!

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOTHING BOUTIQUE

           Paula, half-naked with her long blonde hair covering her 
           chest, straddles Eric, ravishing him with kisses as they 
           alternate doing bumps of coke off of a SILVER SPOON hanging 
           around Eric’s neck. Hanging next to the mirror is a beautiful 
           WHITE DRESS reminiscent of the one Pattie wore when we first 
           met her. Paula starts unbuckling his pants but he pulls away.

                                 ERIC
                        Wait-

                                 PAULA
                        What?

                                 ERIC
                        Put the dress on first.

                                 PAULA
                        We’ll ruin it.

                                 ERIC
                        So what-

           He offers another bump, she does it and kisses him, then 
           proceeds to slip into the dress with her back facing him. 
           Eric gazes at her face in the mirror as she struggles to zip 
           up the back. From Eric’s POV, it’s Pattie’s reflection, her 
           face is half-obscured with hair, but definitely Pattie.

                                 PAULA
                        Don’t just stare, help me!

           Eric gets up and gently moves her long blonde hair to one 
           side to avoid the zipper. With Pattie in mind now, his 
           demeanor has changed from aggressive to sensual. He zips her 
           up slowly and kisses her neck. She shivers.

                                 PAULA (CONT'D)
                        Oh Eric-

           She spins around and pushes Eric back into the chair, 
           ravaging him again.
           INT. CORRIDOR - COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION STUDIOS - MORNING

           The happy couple giggle as they rush down the hall searching 
           for the right studio room - Eric holds a GARMENT BAG.

                                 PAULA
                        You don’t need to come in with me.

                                 ERIC
                        I want to. I’m curious to see you 
                        in all your modeling glory.

           They pause to do a bump of coke from Eric's necklace.

           STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           They try to enter quietly but they’re still giddy and can’t 
           keep their hands off one another.

           Bright glamour lights illuminate the set, done up to look 
           like a high end clothing boutique. The photographer, DAVID 
           BAILEY (32), a handsome man wearing a white tank-top tucked 
           into black slacks, directs a few beautiful MODELS. Eric spots 
           Pattie rushing over to them with a CAMERA in hand.

                                 ERIC
                        Hi Pattie-

                                 PATTIE
                        Paula, what the hell is wrong with 
                        you? You’re late-

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry, it’s my fault.

                                 PATTIE
                        I vouched for you- This is 
                        extremely unprofessional.

                                 PAULA
                        I’m sorry-

           Pattie slaps Eric on the arm.

                                 PATTIE
                        I’m so embarrassed.

                                 PAULA
                        You’re making a bigger fuss than it is.

                                 ERIC
                        Where’s George?
                                 PATTIE
                        He never comes to my shoots.

                                 ERIC
                             (genuinely interested)
                        Are you shooting and modeling?

                                 PATTIE
                        Yes, as a matter of fact I am. 
                        David Bailey’s my mentor, sort of. 
                        He lets me shoot.

                                 ERIC
                        I had no idea.

                                 PATTIE
                        Excuse us-

           Pattie grabs Paula’s hand and drags her toward David Bailey - 
           scolding her further with indiscernible curses.

                                 ERIC
                        Wait- The dress.

           Eric gives her the garment bag as Pattie pulls her away.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I’ll pick you up in an hour.

           Eric lingers, a jealousy boils inside him as he watches 
           Pattie put her endearing smile on to introduce Paula to David 
           -- Pattie glows with admiration. Eric eavesdrops.

                                 DAVID BAILEY
                        Pattie, why don’t you show Paula 
                        her wardrobe?

           Pattie takes Paula toward the dressing room.

                                 PAULA
                        I love those jeans.

                                 PATTIE
                        I know! They’re bell-bottoms. I 
                        wish I could keep them. You can 
                        only get them in the States.

           As Eric leaves, David greets him in an English accent.

                                 DAVID BAILEY
                        I’m a huge fan.
                                 ERIC
                        Thank you. Pattie speaks very 
                        highly of you.

                                 DAVID BAILEY
                        She’s got a great eye. Fast 
                        learner. And her sister, she’s just 
                        beautiful. She yours?

           Eric hesitates for a moment and then with a confident smile:

                                 ERIC
                        Yes. Yes she is.

                                 DAVID BAILEY
                        You’re a lucky man.

           David returns to set leaving Eric quite pleased with himself.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - SHORTLY AFTER

           Eric sits alone outside, smoking a cigarette. For the first 
           time in awhile, he seems at ease, happy even. He takes in the 
           London street, noticing a lovely COUPLE strolling hand-in-
           hand, then ANOTHER COUPLE sharing a pastry a few tables away.

           A cute WAITRESS greets him with a cup of tea and places a 
           NAPKIN down with her PHONE NUMBER written on it...

                                 WAITRESS
                        I get off at 7, Mr. Clapton.

                                 ERIC
                             (contemplating)
                        You’re very cute, and sweet. But I 
                        must decline.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Oh. Do you not fancy me?

                                 ERIC
                        I do. It’s only because- 
                        [confidently] I have a girlfriend.

           The waitress melts at the thought of a faithful rockstar.

                                 WAITRESS
                        She’s a very lucky lady. Let me 
                        know when it goes sour.

           INT. STUDIO - COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION STUDIOS - LATER

           Eric slips in quietly and spots Pattie talking to David 
           Bailey. 
           He walks toward them but is intercepted by a girl in a tie-
           dye dress with short cropped blonde hair (like Mia Farrow in 
           Rosemary’s Baby). She throws her arms around him and kisses 
           him on the lips. He grabs her by the waist and takes a good 
           look at her... It’s Paula.

                                 PAULA
                        What do you think?

                                 ERIC
                             (genuinely pissed)
                        What the hell did you do?

                                 PAULA
                        The stylist wanted to try something 
                        different. Don’t you love it?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s so... Short. I didn’t even 
                        recognize you.

                                 PAULA
                        I know! I love it. And so does 
                        David. He said I look exotic.

           He glances from Paula to Pattie - their similarities faded.

                                 ERIC
                             (matter of fact)
                        I hate it.

                                 PAULA
                        What?

                                 ERIC
                        You don’t look like...
                             (glances at Pattie)
                        You, anymore.

                                 PAULA
                             (in tears)
                        Well, you’re the only one then.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m just being honest. I liked your 
                        long hair.

           She SLAPS him and runs into the dressing room. Pattie glares 
           at Eric mouthing “WHAT DID YOU DO?” as she goes to console 
           Paula. Eric stands there like an asshole, all eyes on him.
           EXT. BACKYARD PATIO - FRIAR PARK - AFTERNOON

           Eric, detached and brooding, sits amongst the All Things Must 
           Pass BAND. George leads a casual but lively jam session 
           consisting of Eric (guitar), Carl (bass), Jim (drums), Bobby 
           (keyboard), and guitarist DAVE MASON (24) with long straight 
           hair. CHRISSY O'DELL scribbles notes as she rhythmically nods 
           along to a rough version of George’s anthemic “WAH WAH”.

           INT. KITCHEN - FRIAR PARK - SAME

           “WAH WAH” seeps into the kitchen as Pattie prepares lunch for 
           the band. Paula glumly looks over developed PHOTOGRAPHS:

           Eric and George playing guitar; Eric and Paula kissing; 
           George and John; George meditating shirtless; and Eric 
           scowling in front of GRAFFITI that reads: “CLAPTON IS GOD”.

                                 PAULA
                             (re: the last one)
                        I think this is my favorite.

           Pattie leans over and contemplates the photo of Eric.

                                 PATTIE
                        Mine too.

                                 PAULA
                        And people think us Boyd girls are 
                        only of use in front of the camera.

                                 PATTIE
                        Who knew?

                                 PAULA
                        It was nice of George to build you 
                        that little dark room.

                                 PATTIE
                        He can be a sweetheart when he 
                        wants to.

           From the other room, George’s SINGING gets a bit louder.

                                 PAULA
                        How do you deal with it when George 
                        is on the road?

                                 PATTIE
                        What do you mean?
                                 PAULA
                        Eric’s about to go on the road. And 
                        he told me Stigwood has a “no 
                        girlfriends policy.” But I think he 
                        made that up.

                                 PATTIE
                        As stupid as that is, I’ve heard 
                        that before-

                                 PAULA
                        That’s exactly what it is. Stupid.

                                 PATTIE
                        You can’t own a musician when 
                        they’re on the road. [beat] Just 
                        know that he’ll be coming back to 
                        you in the end, okay?

                                 PAULA
                        That’s it? That’s what you do?

                                 PATTIE
                        Mmhmm. I know he loves me.

                                 PAULA
                        That’s the problem. I’m not so sure 
                        about Eric.

           Pattie bites her tongue as she glances at Eric through the 
           back window. He looks up from his guitar, feeling her eyes on 
           him. She quickly looks away and grabs a platter of food.

                                 PATTIE
                             (to Paula)
                        Give me a hand.

           EXT. BACKYARD - SAME

           The band finishes playing “WAH WAH”. Eric retreats into his 
           own mind as the band discuss.

                                 CHRISSY O’DELL
                        Phil Spector called. We can start recording.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thanks, Chris. Tell him I need one 
                        more day, and then we’ll start.

                                 BOBBY
                        You think Spector would record a 
                        single for us? Since we’ll all be 
                        in the studio anyway-
           Pattie and Paula step out onto the patio with platters of 
           food, giggling as they whisper and organize the table for 
           lunch. Eric watches uncomfortably.

                                 CARL RADLE
                        Yeah, that’d be wild.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t see why not- I’ll talk to him.

                                 JIM GORDON
                        You think maybe we should come up 
                        with a name first?

                                 CARL RADLE
                        Probably a good idea.

           From Eric’s skewed POV, the Boyd sisters are perfect twins 
           except for Paula’s short haircut. Their chatter taunts him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes, but not on my time. I want to 
                        try something a little different 
                        with “Let It Down”, listen-

           George strums the first chords. Eric rudely gets to his feet.

                                 ERIC
                        I gotta go...

                                 PAULA
                        Where?

                                 ERIC
                        Home.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ey, we’re not done.

                                 ERIC
                        I am.

           George does not look happy. He and Pattie share an awkward 
           glance while everyone else watches Eric leave. Paula follows.

                                 PAULA
                        I’ll come with you-

                                 ERIC
                        No, I’m fine.

           He leaves Paula embarrassed and hurt.
                                 GEORGE
                        Can we go again, please?

           PRE-LAP: FREDDIE KING’S “HAVE YOU EVER LOVED A WOMAN” blares.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HURTWOOD EDGE - SHORTLY AFTER

           The MUSIC continues as Eric blows through lines and lines of 
           coke. With every snort a MEMORY FLASHES in his head... 
           SNORT/Pattie in her white dress amongst the concert crowd.  
           SNORT/Seeing himself in the dressing room mirror standing 
           behind Paula as she morphs into Pattie. SNORT/His mother, 
           Patricia, standing in the fog on the dock.

           He SNORTS the last line of coke and realizes there’s no more, 
           the bag is empty. He manically searches the room, ripping 
           through drawers and cabinets. He finds a tiny bottle of 
           LIQUID LSD and quickly squeezes two DROPS onto his tongue.

           He goes up to Bobby’s room and rummages through his things. 
           When he gets to the desk, he sees a tattered copy of the 
           “LAYLA AND MAJNUN book. On the inside cover reads: “TO ERIC, 
           FINALLY FOUND A COPY. HOPE THIS HELPS. YOUR FRIEND, BOBBY.” 

           Amped up, Eric tries to focus on the colorful COVER ARTWORK.

           ERIC’S POV: The IMAGE of the Persian lovers atop white horses 
           blur and blend together creating a PSYCHEDELIC KALEIDOSCOPE 
           OF COLORS as the “HAVE YOU EVER LOVED A WOMAN” guitar riff 
           transitions into a more EASTERN INSPIRED instrumental (sitar) 
           - with glimpses of the famous “LAYLA” guitar riff that Eric 
           has yet to write. The kaleidoscope image readjusts into...

           ERIC’S MINDSCREEN ANIMATION: Envision the psychedelic style 
           of Marcell Jankovics’ Fehérlófia (Son of the White Mare).

           MAJNUN (resembling Eric dressed in 12th century Persian garb) 
           gallops through a forest on a majestic white STALLION. He 
           stops at a river bank and hears the mellifluous sounds of a 
           WOMAN’S SINGING. He spots LAYLA (resembling Pattie) further 
           down the river, singing as she washes herself, naked.

           Majnun sees a WATER SERPENT slithering toward her... He 
           gallops into the river and scoops her up onto his horse.

           She literally melts into his arms - they become one amorphous 
           being of colors and then separate atop a mountain with the 
           crescent moon set behind them as they make love...

           The crescent moon turns and morphs into a BEARDED MAN’S HEAD 
           (resembling George’s long, bearded, narrow face) scowling 
           down on them. Majnun and Layla are ripped from one another, 
           flying off the mountain top in opposite directions, becoming 
           two yellow specs of stardust in the black sky.
           Disheveled, Majnun now has a beard as he sits on the snowy 
           forest floor crying, scribbling in a notebook. He looks up at 
           the two specs of stardust which become TWO EYES looking down 
           at him - they are wild and crazy. They belong to a massive 
           BLACK PANTHER which opens its mouth revealing bright white 
           sharp teeth as it descends toward Majnun and eats him up...

           Before a crowd of people, Layla, in a wedding gown, stands 
           face to face with the BEARDED MAN... They kiss and converge 
           into one, then separate again finding themselves swimming in 
           the river. From the dark forest, the black panther prowls, 
           inching closer and closer until it POUNCES onto the BEARDED 
           MAN, mauling him into oblivion, literally dissipating.

           The panther morphs back into Majnun as he takes Layla in his 
           arms... From the forest, a MOB OF MEN emerge with torches and 
           spikes. Majnun and Layla gallop through the forest on their 
           white horse as the mob takes chase... They slide to halt at a 
           cliff’s edge... The mob closes in, surrounding them until 
           they cannot be seen... After a moment, Majnun and Layla’s 
           BODIES shoot straight up to the sky, the mob of men around 
           them explode into a frenzy of shapes and colors.

           Majnun and Layla are lip-locked, spiraling through a heavenly 
           kaleidoscope until they converge into one bright white 
           fluorescent light that envelops everything-

           EXT. BACKYARD - HURTWOOD EDGE - MORNING

           Eric is passed out, face down in the snow, wrapped in a white 
           sheet like a sheik. Footsteps come toward him but stop at the 
           “LAYLA AND MAJNUN” book a few feet away. Bobby crouches down 
           and picks up the book. He shakes Eric awake. He’s shivering.

                                 BOBBY
                        Let’s get you inside.

                                 ERIC
                             (grabbing the book)
                        I have to go.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re not going anywhere. You need 
                        to help us move into the new flat!

           Eric, in only boxers, gets to his feet and pushes past him.

           EXT. FRIAR PARK - AFTERNOON

           He rings the doorbell with a bottle of wine in one hand and 
           the Layla book in the other. Pattie answers.

                                 PATTIE
                        What are you doing here?
                                 ERIC
                        I’m mad for you. Absolutely Majnun.

           She looks at his wild eyes, his massive pupils.

                                 PATTIE
                        What are you on?

                                 ERIC
                        Everything’s very clear to me now. 
                        Very real.

           He walks right past her. She rolls her eyes.

                                 PATTIE
                        Eric, won’t you please come in.

           INT. LIVING ROOM ON THE COUCH - FRIAR PARK - LATER

           They sit drinking wine. Pattie flips through the book.

                                 ERIC
                        That’s how I feel about you. It’s 
                        the only way I could explain it.

                                 PATTIE
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 ERIC
                        Because you’re Layla, Pattie.

                                 PATTIE
                        You said that already. Have you 
                        told George?

                                 ERIC
                             (sarcastically)
                        No, I was hoping you would.

                                 PATTIE
                        You’re an ass.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m kidding. I’m going to talk to him.

                                 PATTIE
                        I don’t think there’s anything to 
                        talk about. George is your best 
                        friend. And you’re seeing my sister.

                                 ERIC
                        Because she reminds me of you.
                                 PATTIE
                        Eric!

                                 ERIC
                        Really. I swear it.

           Pattie reaches down, pulls a piece of paper from her purse.

                                 PATTIE
                        I haven’t gotten many love letters in my 
                        life but this was the most passionate and 
                        romantic one I have ever gotten.

                                 ERIC
                             (heart dropping)
                        You did read it.

           She nods subtly.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        He doesn’t make you happy.

                                 PATTIE
                        You really are mad. And you don’t 
                        know what you’re talking about. 

                                 ERIC
                        I do know. I can see it in your face.

                                 PATTIE
                        What exactly are you proposing anyway?

           He lunges to try to kiss her, but she pulls away.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        Eric. You’re very sweet but I 
                        really think you need help.

                                 ERIC
                        I know you’re not happy.

                                 PATTIE
                        You don’t know anything.

                                 ERIC
                        I know everything. You’re at the end 
                        of your rope and he is too. He’s 
                        been checked out. And neither of you 
                        can give the other what they want.

                                 PATTIE
                        What’s that supposed to mean?
                                 ERIC
                        Nothing. I’m just saying-

                                 PATTIE
                        What has George told you about us? 
                        [no response] What did he tell you?

                                 ERIC
                        He told me you’re... He said that... 
                        [mumbling] You can’t have children-

                                 PATTIE
                        So, that’s what you two fucking 
                        talk about, huh?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s not like that. George loves 
                        you, and he just needed someone to 
                        confide in. It just sorta-

                                 PATTIE
                        Why don’t you two just run away together 
                        and leave me out of the whole thing!

           She shoves the book into his chest but he grabs her hand and 
           plants a kiss on her lips. She tries to pull away but 
           succumbs to his passion. He tries to put down his glass of 
           wine but misses the table and it spills everywhere.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m sorry- I didn’t mean to do that.

                                 PATTIE
                        You should be sorry, I’m a married woman.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m sorry about the wine. I have no 
                        regrets about the kiss.

                                 PATTIE
                        I think you should go before you 
                        make a bigger mess.

                                 ERIC
                        Can’t we spend the night together?

                                 PATTIE
                        Of course not! You need to leave!

                                 ERIC
                        Why- George?
                                 PATTIE
                        I need to start getting ready. I’m 
                        going to see a play.

           PRE-LAP: THE BAND's melancholy “LONG BLACK VEIL” fades in...

           INT. KENSINGTON FLAT - AFTERNOON

           “LONG BLACK VEIL” instrumental continues. Carl, Jim, and 
           Bobby move a heavy dresser. Eric and Paula lay, drunk, on a 
           futon cuddling and whispering. Paula musters some courage...

                                 PAULA
                        I want to come on tour with you.

           Eric SIGHS as Jim drops his side of the dresser dramatically.

                                 JIM GORDON
                        Thanks for your help Eric, you’ve 
                        been tremendous.

                                 PAULA
                        Hey, we set up the futon!

                                 CARL RADLE
                        So you could fuck on it.

                                 ERIC
                        I should help.

                                 PAULA
                        No! I’m trying to have a real 
                        conversation with you. About something 
                        that’s important to me. Okay?

                                 ERIC
                        Okay.

           Carl and Jim grumble under their breath as they leave again.

                                 PAULA
                        Well?

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t know if there will even be a 
                        tour. We haven’t finished any songs.

                                 PAULA
                        You know you’re going to tour.

                                 ERIC
                        We don’t even have a band name.
                                 PAULA
                        I’ve never been. Just say "yes."

                                 ERIC
                        We’ll see.

                             (fuming)
                        Do you remember when you were on 
                        your last tour with Cream?

                                 ERIC
                        Between the drugs and my repressed 
                        memories of Ginger... No, not much.

                                 PAULA
                        It was right after you broke up 
                        with Charlotte?

                                 ERIC
                        How do you know about Charlotte?

                                 PAULA
                        Pattie told me all about Charlotte...

           Eric’s goes white. He already knows what she’s going to say.

                        who ran looked a lot like me...

           Eric pulls his Ferrari up to the VALET’S booth and hops out.

           An USHER steps outside for a cigarette, spots Eric.

                        You’re Eric Clapton!

           Ignoring them both, Eric rushes inside past the Usher.
           INT. PLAYHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric slips in, pausing at the sight of full frontal nudity on 
           stage. He scans the crowd spotting Pattie in the center. The 
           LEAD ACTOR finishes belting out the last song of the act. The 
           lights go up as the audience files out for intermission.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Eric finds Pattie’s empty seat. There’s a GENTLEMAN in the 
           seat next to her.

                                 ERIC
                        Sir, could I trade seats with you?

                                 GENTLEMAN
                        It’s the middle of the show, are you mad?

                                 ERIC
                        Slightly. Take my ticket. It’s up 
                        in that balcony.

                                 GENTLEMAN
                        My seats much better, thank you.

                                 ERIC
                        Sir, listen to me, you’re sitting 
                        next to the love of my life and I 
                        need to talk to her-

                                 GENTLEMAN
                        I think it can wait until after the 
                        second act, young man.

           Eric pulls out a stack of 50 pound notes.

                                 ERIC
                        No it can’t.

           LATER

           Pattie and PETER BROWN return to their seats to find Eric 
           waiting with a smile on his face.

                                 ERIC
                        Hi Pattie-

           She’s surprised - more smiley than angry.

                                 PATTIE
                        What in the hell are you doing 
                        here, Eric?
                                 ERIC
                        I had to see you. Where’s George?

                                 PATTIE
                        I’m not here with George.

                                 ERIC
                        Who the hell is this guy, then?

                                 PATTIE
                        This is my friend, Peter Brown.

                                 ERIC
                        Just a friend?

                                 PATTIE
                        Yes, he’s just a friend, Eric. Just 
                        like you. [realizing] Where’d the 
                        gentleman go that was sitting there?

           Eric points up to the balcony where the man now sits.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        You’ve officially lost your mind.

           The lights go down.

                                 ERIC
                        Shush. It’s about to start.

           Pattie rolls her eyes, exasperated.

           LATER

           Eric leans over to Pattie. Peter rolls his eyes.

                                 ERIC
                        How come you never told me George 
                        slept with Charlotte?

                                 PATTIE
                             (embarrassed)
                        Eric! Shut up-

                                 PETER
                        I think you'd better go.

                                 ERIC
                        Are you sleeping with her?

                                 PATTIE
                        Eric! Enough.
                                 ERIC
                        What are you doing after this?

           She SHUSHES him.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Can we ditch Peter and go 
                        somewhere?

           Peter SHUSHES him.

                                 PATTIE
                        No, Peter’s taking me to Stigwood’s 
                        party.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh that’s perfect. I was invited. I 
                        wasn’t going to go, but now that I know 
                        you’ll be there... It might be worth it.

           A few other people SHUSH him. Pattie smirks just a little.

           INT. ROBERT STIGWOOD’S MANSION - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The party is wild with over a hundred people, drugs and 
           alcohol in abundance.

           EXT. GARDEN - ROBERT STIGWOOD’S MANSION - ALMOST MORNING

           Eric and Pattie talk quietly near the gazebo. The sun’s just 
           rising and a light fog covers the entire garden.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t think Peter thinks you two 
                        are just friends.

                                 PATTIE
                        Of course he does.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re oblivious, Pattie.

                                 PATTIE
                        No, you are.

           Eric tries to plant a kiss on her, she pulls away.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t you think you should tell 
                        George first?

                                 ERIC
                        He didn’t tell me about Charlotte.
                                 PATTIE
                        You weren’t married to Charlotte.

                                 ERIC
                        But George is married to you. Why 
                        are you defending him?

                                 PATTIE
                        I don’t have to defend him to you.

                                 ERIC
                        This isn’t about me. He cheated on you.

                                 PATTIE
                        This is about you. It’s always 
                        about you, Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        No, this is about us.

                                 PATTIE
                        It will never work between us.

                                 ERIC
                        Not if you keep saying that. I know 
                        you’re lonely. I see it in your 
                        eyes. And when I kiss you, you-

                                 PATTIE
                        I what?

           Eric plants another kiss on her lips - this time she doesn’t 
           pull away and she melts into him a little as his years of 
           unrequited passion are finally released and returned.

           Their lips slowly unlock, revealing George at the back door.

                                 GEORGE
                             (surprisingly playful)
                        What’s going on?

           Pattie covers her face and backs away as George approaches.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Pattie?

                                 PATTIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s not her fault, George.

           Eric is drunk but understands the weight of the situation. He 
           looks at Pattie, then back to George.
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I have to tell you, man, that I’m 
                        in love your wife.

           George’s eyes go dark and he nods his head.

                                 GEORGE
                        Finally, Eric. You found the words.

                                 ERIC
                        You knew...

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you think I’m an imbecile?

                                 ERIC
                        Not at all.

           George stares at him dead in the eye but says nothing.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I understand if you never want to 
                        speak to me again.

           George remains calm... Unnerving Eric to his core.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Ya know what? Sock me. Right in the 
                        face. Please. Hit me as hard as you 
                        can. I beg you.

                                 GEORGE
                        That's not necessary. We’re all adults.

           Eric’s guilt takes over. A small crowd has gathered..

                                 ERIC
                        I need you to hit me, George. Hard.

           George ignores Eric and looks to Pattie.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, are you going with him or 
                        coming with me?

                                 PATTIE
                             (immediately)
                        With you, George. I’m coming home.

           George walks off past a group of guests who witnessed the 
           entire ordeal. Pattie begins to cry as she follows George, 
           leaving Eric alone in the middle of the misty garden.
           INT. GEORGE’S FERRARI - MOMENTS LATER

           George is aloof. Pattie stares at the side of his face.

                                 PATTIE
                        Please say something. [no response] 
                        George. Please.

                                 GEORGE
                        If you love him, you should be with him.

                                 PATTIE
                        You don’t mean that.

                                 GEORGE
                        No sense in carrying on like this.

                                 PATTIE
                        How could you be so cold?

           He looks her dead in the eye.

                                 GEORGE
                        How could you?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HURTWOOD EDGE - NIGHT

           Paula alternates doing lines of coke with Eric who’s more 
           focused on strumming to the tune of what will be “LAYLA”, 
           still searching for the heart of the song.

           Eric is wild-eyed - physically and mentally exhausted.

                                 PAULA
                        Do you know your tour dates yet?

                                 ERIC
                             (instinctively)
                        Shh-

                                 PAULA
                        Did you just shush me?

                                 ERIC
                        What?

                                 PAULA
                        You just shushed me, Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        I did not.
                                 PAULA
                        Yeah, you did. I asked you if you 
                        know your tour dates yet?

                                 ERIC
                             (still strumming)
                        Why?

                                 PAULA
                        Because I’m trying to plan for it. 
                        I have a few shoots coming up.

                                 ERIC
                        You shouldn’t miss them.

                                 PAULA
                        That’s what I’m trying to avoid.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s really not a good idea for you to 
                        come anyway. Plus, Stigwood’s policy-

                                 PAULA
                        Fuck that- It’s your band.

                                 ERIC
                        None of the guys bring girls. It’s 
                        a distraction.

           A KNOCK at the door.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Come in.

           A young BRITISH MAN enters.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for coming-

                                 PAULA
                        Eric-

                                 ERIC
                        I’m in the middle of something.

           Paula storms out. The Man feels the tension, places one bag 
           of powder on the table then another, and takes the money.

                                 MAN
                        Here, you look like you need 
                        something a little stronger. I 
                        won’t charge you for that.

           Eric looks at it, the second bag looks a little different.
                                 ERIC
                        What’s that one?

                                 MAN
                        That’s one gram of cocaine, and one 
                        gram of heroin. Give you a nice 
                        little balance.

                                 ERIC
                        I hear that’s a nasty little drug.

                                 MAN
                        It’ll be kind to you.

           Eric stares at the bag as the man leaves. A car horn HONKS 
           and Paula comes back into the room with her coat and purse.

                                 PAULA
                        That’s Bobby and the guys, are you 
                        ready to go?

                                 ERIC
                        Go where?

                                 PAULA
                        I told you, Jagger’s party is tonight.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh. Go on without me. I’m going to 
                        keep writing for a little while.

                                 PAULA
                        You’ve been a hermit all day, come 
                        out with me.

           Eric grabs his guitar and plays. Bobby comes in.

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s the hold up? You two coming?

                                 PAULA
                        I am.

           She smacks the back of Eric’s head as she passes by and hooks 
           arms with Bobby, pulling him away.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re not coming Eric?

                                 PAULA
                        No. You’re my date for the night.

                                 BOBBY
                        Eric-
           Paula pulls him out the door and slams it shut. Eric 
           continues playing, his eyes shift from his lightning fast 
           fingers to the baggy of heroin.

           INT. ENTRANCE - ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS - MORNING

           Eric groggily walks in as Bobby’s coming out of the bathroom.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re late.

                                 ERIC
                        No shit.

           Eric heads for the bathroom but Bobby grabs and steers him.

                                 BOBBY
                        No time, lets get you in the studio.

           STUDIO - ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS - SHORTLY AFTER

           Eric and Bobby walk in uncomfortably late. Everyone’s greets 
           them silently as they take their places. Eric and George are 
           on opposite sides of the room - in between them, Bobby, Jim, 
           Carl, and Dave. Through the studio glass in the control room 
           stands PHIL SPECTOR, Ringo, Maureen, Chrissy, and Pattie. All 
           eyes are on Eric, including George’s.

                                 GEORGE
                        Everyone all set then?

           Eric gives an awkward nod. George nods to the control room. 
           The RED LIGHT goes on. George counts calmly to himself, then 
           leans into the microphone slowly singing “LET IT DOWN.”

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Though you sit in another chair I 
                        can feel you here/ Looking like I 
                        don’t care but I do, I do/ Hiding 
                        it all behind anything I see/ 
                        Should someone be looking at me.

           Eric lifts his cowardly gaze from his sloppy fingers and up 
           to George who’s staring back at him.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        While I occupy my mind, I can feel 
                        you here/ Love to us is so well 
                        times, and I do, I do/ Wasting away 
                        these moments so heavenly/ Should 
                        someone be looking at me.

           Bobby glances between George and Eric while Pattie watches 
           George sing with his beautiful voice.
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Let it down, let it all down/ Let 
                        your hair hang all around me/ Let 
                        it down, let it down/ Let your love 
                        flow and astound me

           Eric looks to Pattie who won’t return his gaze. She’s 
           swooning over George’s singing.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        While you look so sweetly and 
                        divine, I can feel you here/ I see 
                        your eyes are busy kissing mine, 
                        and I do, I do/ Wondering what it 
                        is they’re expecting to see/ Should 
                        someone be looking at me.

           George leans away from the microphone. A moment of uneasy 
           silence is broken by the INTERCOM:

                                 PHIL SPECTOR (O.S.)
                        That was great. Let’s do “Wah-Wah” 
                        again. Now that we have Eric.

           MOMENTS LATER

           They’re all playing “WAH-WAH” which requires a lot of Eric’s 
           skills. He’s sloppy and screws up a few times. Through the 
           glass, Phil Spector cringes. Eric looks over to Pattie and 
           plays faster, trying to outplay George, who notices.

           Just as George finishes singing the second verse, Eric goes 
           off on a jarring blues riff, throwing everyone off. Through 
           the glass, Phil looks pissed.

           CONTROL ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

           Everyone has dispersed. Phil fiddles with the controls as 
           George listens with headphones... He removes them.

                                 PHIL SPECTOR
                        It could use Bobby Keys on the sax. 
                        [George nods] I like the warmth of 
                        your voice, but it needs to be 
                        strengthened. [George nods again] 
                        It could use an answer vocal from 
                        you on the “Let It Down” parts too.

                                 GEORGE
                        Noted.

                                 PHIL SPECTOR
                        Also... Eric-
                                 GEORGE
                        What about him?

                                 PHIL SPECTOR
                        He’s fucking up left and right. I 
                        think we should find someone else.

                                 GEORGE
                        No. [beat] Eric stays.

                                 PHIL SPECTOR
                        I could be wrong, but I think he’s 
                        a little strung out.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, he’s just had a rough few 
                        nights. He’s the best there is.

           INT. TEAROOM - ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS - LATER

           Bobby comes to the door to find Eric playing a few chords of 
           what will be “LAYLA”, singing softly to himself.

                                 ERIC
                        What’ll you do when you get 
                        lonely?/ And nobody’s waiting by 
                        your side?

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s a great line. What’re you 
                        working on?

                                 ERIC
                             (dryly)
                        A song I have to write.

                                 BOBBY
                        You have a name for this 
                        masterpiece?

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah, I was thinking “Layla.”

           Bobby gets his meaning and sits down next to Eric.

                                 BOBBY
                        Speaking of Layla- I want to talk 
                        to you about her sister.

                                 ERIC
                        She’s fucking pissed at me.

           Eric does a small bump of heroin off the table.
                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah. This is really hard for me to 
                        say, but-

                                 ERIC
                        You and Paula had sex. [off Bobby’s 
                        silence] It’s okay.

                                 BOBBY
                        It is?

                                 ERIC
                        Of all people, who am I to stop 
                        you?

           Eric does another bump and melts into the couch.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        She’s all yours.

                                 BOBBY
                             (realizing)
                        That’s not coke is it?

           INT. MAIN FOYER - FRIAR PARK - NIGHT

           Pattie comes home and hear VOICES and MUSIC coming from 
           George’s home studio.

           INT. GEORGE’S HOME STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Pattie KNOCKS and enters to find a few studio engineers and a 
           few musicians, but no George.

                                 PATTIE
                        Hey guys. Where’s George?

           Busy working, they all shrug which frustrates Pattie.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Pattie walks down the hall toward the master bedroom, but 
           hears GEORGE’S VOICE from another room. It’s locked. She 
           BANGS on the door... No answer. She BANGS again.

                                 PATTIE
                        George!

           He finally comes to the door and slips out.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?
                                 GEORGE
                        Just taking a break, how was your night?

                                 PATTIE
                        Who’s in there?

           She tries to sidestep him but he grabs her.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s just Maureen. She was tired. 
                        She’s just lying down.

                                 PATTIE
                        So why the hell are you in there 
                        with her, George?

           She pushes past him and finds Maureen relaxing on the bed. 
           There’s coke on the night stand.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 GEORGE
                        Pattie, nothing is going on.

                                 MAUREEN
                        I came to watch the recording session.

                                 PATTIE
                        So watch the damn recording 
                        session. You’re the last person I 
                        thought would do this!

                                 MAUREEN
                        I’m not doing anything.

           George pulls her out of room.

                                 GEORGE
                             (calmly, smugly)
                        Nothing is going on.

                                 PATTIE
                        Something must be. What else are you doing?

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re just being paranoid. I’m 
                        going back to the studio-

                                 PATTIE
                        Don’t!

           Pattie steps back into the room to confront Maureen.
                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        Have you thought about your 
                        children? Huh? [off Maureen’s 
                        silence] Fine. I’m going to sleep. 
                        You should go home to your husband.

           She SLAMS the door behind her.

           EXT. FRONT OF FRIAR PARK - NIGHT - LATER

           Eric pulls up in his Ferrari, his headlights catch Pattie 
           waiting on the front porch. She approaches as he gets out.

                                 ERIC
                        Everything okay? Sounded like you 
                        were crying on the phone.

                                 PATTIE
                        I’m okay now. I just needed a 
                        drinking mate. 

                                 ERIC
                        Where’d you want to go?

                                 PATTIE
                        Anywhere. A bar or- I don’t know, I 
                        just need to get away from here.

                                 ERIC
                        We could go back to the Kensington 
                        flat. The guys are all out.

                                 PATTIE
                        Okay... I guess that would be fine.

           Eric opens the car door for her.

                                 ERIC
                        So what happened?

                                 PATTIE
                        I found him with Maureen.

                                 ERIC
                        Always knew he had a thing for her.

                                 PATTIE
                        I didn’t. She’s my friend.

           Eric gently puts his arms around her.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        He makes me think I’m the crazy 
                        one.
                                 ERIC
                        You’re not. [she melts into him] This 
                        is why you should be with me.

           She stiffens and pulls away.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Where is he anyway?

                                 PATTIE
                        In the studio, where else?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s lovely how he’s never around. 
                        I can come around anytime I want.

                                 PATTIE
                        Could you just be my friend? Just 
                        for a fucking minute.

                                 ERIC
                        No. I can’t.

                                 PATTIE
                        This was a mistake.

           She heads back for the front door. He runs in front of her.

                                 ERIC
                        Wait! Come back. I’ll be your 
                        friend, just come back. Come back 
                        or I’ll... I’ll hit the deck.

                                 PATTIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 ERIC
                        If you don’t come with me... If you 
                        don’t leave that man in there, 
                        right this instant... I swear-

                                 PATTIE
                        You swear what?

           He pulls out a bag of heroin and dangles it in her face.

                                 ERIC
                        I swear I’ll do this entire bag 
                        right now.

           She reaches for it, frantic and terrified.

                                 PATTIE
                        Stop this, right now! Please!
                                 ERIC
                        I’ll do all of it. And if that 
                        doesn’t work, then I’ll find more. 
                        And I’ll do all of that. And if it 
                        kills me, then so be it!

           Pattie tries to snatch the bag, but he runs away in a zigzag 
           like a madman. She chases after him, but slips in the wet 
           grass. He doesn’t notice and runs to the door of his car.

                                 PATTIE
                        Eric, please-

                                 ERIC
                        Yes or no?

                                 PATTIE
                        No. And no matter what happens with 
                        George and I, I can never be with you.

                                 ERIC
                        Why?

                                 PATTIE
                        Because to George, I’m just his... 
                        I don’t know... His pomegranate. 
                        But to you, I’m everything.

                                 ERIC
                        Exactly!

                                 PATTIE
                        No! You don’t understand, Eric. You 
                        love me too much... I’m sorry.

                                 ERIC
                        Too much? What the fuck-

                                 PATTIE
                             (ranting)
                        I’m not even sure it’s love, Eric. 
                        It’s obsession. It’s filling a 
                        void. You’re just a sad little boy 
                        who’s mother never paid him any 
                        attention. And I can’t fix that!

           Eric’s finally at a loss for words. Pattie regrets her words, 
           she’s never been that venomous before. She steps toward him, 
           maybe to give consolation, but pulls back. He gets in his car 
           and SLAMS the door.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        Wait!
           He speeds off.

           PRE-LAP: TALES OF THE BRAVE ULYSSES plays over the following:

           INT./EXT. ERIC’S FERRARI - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric whips around a bend, one hand on the steering wheel, the 
           other bringing a bump of heroin to his noise...

           He loses control of the car and skids off the road. He veers 
           back on the road, but jerks the wheel too far and spins out 
           of control until he hits a ditch which FLIPS the car. On its 
           roof, the car skids to a dead stop on the side of the road...

                                                        FADE OUT/FADE IN:

           INT. ERIC’S FERRARI - NIGHT - SHORTLY AFTER

           A bloody-faced Eric comes to, dangling upside down, held in 
           place by his seat belt. Thick white smoke seeps through the 
           smashed windshield from under the hood. It surrounds him...

                                                           MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. JACK CLAPP’S SEDAN - DOCK - FLASHBACK -- 1954

           ENTIRELY FROM ERIC’S POV IN THE BACKSEAT:

           The thick white FOG surrounds us. We’re all alone. We look 
           down to our unwieldy steel-string Hoyer GUITAR in our tiny 9-
           year-old hands. A piercing FOGHORN breaks the silence... 
           Through the fog, we catch a glimpse of our mother, PATRICIA 
           CLAPTON, floating toward the large ominous BLACK VESSEL that 
           looms above the dock. Her voice ECHOES as she disappears...

                                 PATRICIA CLAPTON
                        It’s too much... I’m sorry.

           We open the car door and get out, immediately engulfed in 
           white fog. Disoriented, we panic... Our hands searching for 
           her. In the distance, we catch another glimpse of our elusive 
           MOTHER. We run to her but she disappears again, like a ghost.

           PRE-LAP: A HEART MONITOR BEEPS...

           We look up at the BLACK VESSEL, focusing on the ornately 
           carved FIGUREHEAD adorning the bow. The beautiful, long 
           haired wooden SIREN stares down at us - she looks a lot like 
           PATTIE BOYD. The BEEPS continue, joined now by STRUMMING.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LONDON - PRESENT DAY -- 1970

           George plays guitar bedside next to Eric, who’s sleeping, 
           hooked up to numerous IVs and monitors. After a moment, Eric 
           groggily comes to, wincing from his bruises and stitches.

                                 GEORGE
                        How’re you feeling, mate?

                                 ERIC
                        Been better. It’s good to see you.

                                 GEORGE
                        Gave us all quite the scare.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry. For, ya know-

                                 GEORGE
                        Paul released his solo album today.

                                 ERIC
                        Huh?

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, advance release. With a press 
                        release that says The Beatles broke up.

           Eric, struggling with a head injury and loads of guilt, tries 
           to keep up.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Can you believe him?

                                 ERIC
                        So what? This is what you wanted. 
                        You’re writing songs and recording 
                        them. Answering to no one.

           George smirks, remembering why he likes Eric so much.

                                 GEORGE
                        You going to be able to play?

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll be alright. Have a few days to 
                        rest before our first show here at 
                        the Lyceum. Then I’m off to Miami.

           Pattie comes to the door but sees them bonding and ducks out.

                                 GEORGE
                        Miami?
                                 ERIC
                        Going to record our album with Tom 
                        Dowd at Criteria.

                                 GEORGE
                        Lucky man.

                                 ERIC
                        Why don’t you join us? We need a second 
                        guitar. Dave Mason is moving on after we 
                        play at the Lyceum.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t think so. You know, I 
                        really hate airplanes.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re afraid to fly?

                                 GEORGE
                        No, I just hate airplanes.

                                 ERIC
                        Come on, I’ll sedate you. Get one of 
                        the stewardess’ to take advantage of 
                        ya, how bout that then?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sorry mate, I’m mixing the album 
                        with Phil. It’s not perfect yet.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s just a few weeks. I could 
                        really use you on second guitar.

                                 GEORGE
                        Just layer them yourself. [beat] 
                        Besides if we’re both not here, who 
                        will keep Pattie busy?

           George takes dry humor to a new level.

           EXT. LYCEUM - LONDON - NIGHT - DAYS LATER

           Eric, Carl, Jim, Bobby, and Dave pile out of Eric’s lilac 
           Ferrari. Eric sees the MARQUEE: “ERIC CLAPTON AND FRIENDS”

                                 ERIC
                        Oh fuck. That’s got to change.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - LYCEUM - SHORTLY AFTER

           Eric and the Band argue with Robert. George hangs with Pattie 
           while Paula stands by Bobby - who's clearly uncomfortable.
                                 ERIC
                        You have to change that fucking 
                        marquee outside-

                                 ROBERT
                        And put what instead? Your name is 
                        how I got asses in the seats.

                                 GEORGE
                        The whole “...and Friends” thing is 
                        shit, I agree.

                                 JIM
                        Yeah, we’re not Eric’s backing band.

                                 CARL
                        What about “The Dynamics?” Like 
                        y’all talked about?

                                 DAVE
                        I thought we said “The Dynamos”.

           The STAGE MANAGER interrupts.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Tony has two more songs. Then you 
                        guys are up. [beat] You guys have a 
                        proper name, by the way?

                                 ROBERT
                        “Eric and The Dynamics,” yeah?

                                 ERIC
                        I said no “Eric.” I’m dead serious.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        So just “The Dynamics” then?

                                 JIM
                        It sounds like a doo-wop group.

                                 BOBBY
                        I agree with Jim. Robert, maybe you 
                        can get us matching zoot-suits.

                                 GEORGE
                        I like “dynamos” better. Derek and 
                        the Dynamos. How about that?

                                 ERIC
                        Interesting... Completely 
                        anonymous. I like it.
                                 ROBERT
                        Who the fuck is Derek?

                                 BOBBY
                        Tony kept calling Eric - “Derek” - 
                        when we were touring. Sorta stuck.

                                 ROBERT
                        Eric, how am I suppose to sell this?

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t for all I care!

           ON STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           TONY ASHTON and his BANDMATES finish their last song, then 
           Tony announces to the CROWD:

                                 TONY ASHTON
                        I’m Tony Ashton and we’re Ashton, Gardner, 
                        and Dyke! Thank you all for coming out to 
                        support Dr. Spock’s cause! [off CHEERS] Up 
                        next we have a very special surprise. 
                        Please welcome...

           Tony looks over to the Stage Manager, Eric, and everyone 
           else... The Stage Manager mouths “DEREK AND THE DYNAMOS.” 
           Tony’s not sure what he’s saying, so he wings it:

                                 TONY ASHTON (CONT'D)
                        Derek and The Dominos!

           The crowd goes silent...

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        Who the fuck is that?!

           Everyone backstage starts LAUGHING except for Stigwood.

                                 ERIC
                        I guess we’re the Dominos.

           DEREK AND THE DOMINOS take the stage in silence and 
           immediately roll into Cream’s “SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE”.

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        Is that Clapton?!

           The crowd breaks into pandemonium.

           INSERTS - MIAMI - THE NEXT DAY

           The plane touches down. Beaches, bikinis, Ocean Avenue, 
           bright neon clubs and the cocaine that accompanies them.
           INT. STUDIO - CRITERIA STUDIOS - DAYS LATER

           DEREK AND THE DOMINOS fool around in between jamming - empty 
           bags of coke lie about amongst numerous bottles of whiskey. 
           The small space is crammed with an organ, a grand piano, drum 
           set, and two amps - hopsack and egg cartons line the walls.

           Their producer, TOM DOWD (45), straight hair and a greying 
           goatee, struggles to comprehend a few pages of scribbled 
           notes on sheet music... He turns some upside down.

                                 TOM
                        Looks like we’ll do “I Looked Away” 
                        first, being that it’s the only 
                        song that’s close to done. [off 
                        Eric’s shrug] “Bell Bottom Blues” 
                        needs some work, and a name change.

                                 ERIC
                        The name stays.

                                 TOM
                        Okay. You got those two, a hook for 
                        something called "Anyday" and... 
                        Man, these are all depressing.

           He looks over to Eric who’s doing a line of coke.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I know you said you had a few 
                        covers in mind, but got any other 
                        originals... Or ideas at least?

           Tom looks around, no one is paying attention except Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        Eric, what was that song you kept 
                        playing? Did you ever finish it?

                                 ERIC
                        I’m close. It’s all I’ve been working on.

                                 TOM
                        What’s it called?

                                 ERIC
                        Layla. And it’s going to be a 
                        brilliant fucking song.

                                 TOM
                        I need an album, Eric, not a song.
           INT. ERIC’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Eric plays a few chords of “LAYLA” and stops. Frustrated he 
           tosses the guitar aside and does a few lines, washing it down 
           with whiskey. He sits in a silence for a long moment then 
           picks up the guitar again. He sings the “LAYLA” lyrics softly 
           at first but slowly raises his voice as passion takes over. A 
           KNOCK at the door stops Eric abruptly. He’s embarrassed. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        There was a call for you. A Mr. Stigwood. 
                        [Eric does another line] It’s urgent.

                                 ERIC
                        Take a message.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        I already did. He said, and I 
                        quote, “If you don’t stop doing 
                        fucking drugs all day and get in 
                        the studio, then say goodbye to 
                        your allowance.” End quote.

           Eric straightens up.

           STUDIO - LATER THAT DAY

           Bobby watches Eric lay down a guitar track from “KEEP ON 
           GROWING”. He starts to layer in another using a different 
           guitar... Tom comes in. 

                                 TOM
                        I just got a call. The Allman 
                        Brothers are in town for a show. 
                        Their guitarist asked if he could 
                        come by and sit in on a session.

                                 ERIC
                             (perking up)
                        Wait, you mean the chap who played-

           Eric plays the lick from Wilson Pickett’s “HEY JUDE” cover.

                                 TOM
                        That’s him.

                                 ERIC
                        He can come by anytime!

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bobby plays a version of “TELL THE TRUTH” as Eric watches 
           JIMI HENDRIX play “LITTLE WING” in concert on the TELEVISION.
           Bobby watches Eric snort lines between swigs of whiskey.

                                 BOBBY
                        Eric... Eric! [Eric turns with 
                        powder on his nose] Do you have a 
                        death wish or something?

                                 ERIC
                        I'm on a journey into darkness. But 
                        I plan to see it through to the 
                        other side.

                                 BOBBY
                        At the rate you’re going, you’ll be 
                        dead before we finish recording.

                                 ERIC
                        Well if that’s the case, please see 
                        to it that Pattie hears “Layla”.

                                 BOBBY
                        We’re never going to even record 
                        “Layla” if you don’t finish writing 
                        the damn thing!

           Eric starts pacing the room - coked up, not even listening.

                                 ERIC
                        Let me ask you something. You think 
                        she’ll cry when she hears the record?

                                 BOBBY
                        We don’t have a record, Eric. 
                        That’s the point.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t necessarily want her to 
                        cry, ya know? But I want her to 
                        feel something. I want her to know 
                        that every line of every song was 
                        written for her.

           Bobby watches as this madman snorts another line.

                                 BOBBY
                        I know it’s not my place to say...

                                 ERIC
                        Then don’t say it.

                                 BOBBY
                        You need to stop worrying about 
                        what Pattie’s going to think and 
                        just record some good music.
           Bobby goes for the door-

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Besides, based on what I’ve seen, 
                        Pattie’s not leaving George for 
                        anyone. Not even Eric Clapton.

                                 ERIC
                        Fuck off. What do you know-

           A KNOCK at the door interrupts them. Eric becomes paranoid 
           and moves to hide the coke. Another KNOCK - Bobby looks 
           through the peephole to find Paula, her hair longer now.

                                 BOBBY
                        Relax. It’s just Paula.

           He opens the door, PAULA walks in with a suitcase. They hug 
           and kiss, and shares a brief awkward smile with Eric right 
           before he does another line of coke. Paula rolls her eyes.

                                 PAULA
                        I see some things never change.

                                 ERIC
                        Want one?

           She shrugs and joins him as Bobby watches, uncomfortable.

           INT. STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

           Eric sits alone in the studio working on “LAYLA”. A KNOCK.

                                 ERIC
                             (without looking up)
                        Come in.

           The door eases open slowly and DUANE ALLMAN (24), tall, lanky 
           with long reddish-blonde hair, mutton chops and a handle bar 
           mustache pops his head in. In a Southern drawl:

                                 DUANE
                        Eric fuckin’ Clapton.

                                 ERIC
                        I’ve been waiting for you. [beat]
                        Grab a guitar.

           They strum along but quickly escalate into an intense yet 
           respectful duel of synchronized guitarman-ship. Duane goes 
           off on a tangent and Eric slows down just to listen to what 
           Duane’s doing. Duane realizes Eric’s stopped playing.
                                 DUANE
                        Why’d you stop?

                                 ERIC
                        Let me play you something. It’s 
                        rough.

           Eric plays what he has completed of “LAYLA,” singing softly 
           as Duane closes his eyes and takes it in. Eric stops.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        There’s something missing, ya know?

                                 DUANE
                        Let me hear it again.

           Eric plays a few chords of “LAYLA” and meanders into a rough 
           version of the famous opening RIFF. Duane perks up.

                                 DUANE (CONT'D)
                        That’s familiar.

                                 ERIC
                        What is?

           Duane sings back what Eric just played on guitar. 

                                 DUANE
                        Sounds like, uh- What is it?-

           Duane plays a similar RIFF on his guitar...

                                 DUANE (CONT'D)
                        “As The Years Go Passing By.” Albert King.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re right! Didn’t even realize.

                                 DUANE
                        Blues are in your DNA, man!

                                 ERIC
                        It’s slower though, on that line. 
                        [plays it slower, does his best 
                        King] There is nothing I can do if 
                        you leave me here to cry...

                                 DUANE
                        Exactly. But sped up-

           Eric plays his original version, faster now.
                                 ERIC
                        Yes! There’s a desperation there. A 
                        war cry.

                                 DUANE
                        A love cry!

                                 ERIC
                        It could be like a hook- 

                                 DUANE
                        Right on! If ya rip into that from the 
                        get-go, that shit’ll kick off the song 
                        with a fucking bang.

           They play it simultaneously, louder now. Eric yells:

                                 ERIC
                        It’s perfect.

           HALLWAY - SAME

           Jim Gordon comes to the door and hears them in there.

                                 JIM
                             (sotto)
                        Damn it.

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Let’s call it a night. We can sleep 
                        on that. Flesh it out tomorrow.

                                 DUANE (O.S.)
                        Sounds good to me, partner.

           Jim hides as Eric and Duane leave then slips into the studio.

           INT. STUDIO - NEXT DAY

           The Dominos, including Duane Allman and Paula, listen to the 
           playback of “LAYLA” but Eric still looks unsatisfied.

                                 TOM
                        I love it. [to Duane] Gotta get you 
                        and Eric in a room together more 
                        often.

                                 ERIC
                        The guitar is perfect, but-

                                 DUANE
                        But what?
                                 ERIC
                        It’s still missing something. It’s 
                        incomplete. It feels emotionless-

                                 TOM
                        I have to disagree, Eric, it’s 
                        incredibly emotional.

                                 ERIC
                             (shakes his head)
                        Play it back.

                                 TOM
                        Why don’t we move onto “Little 
                        Wing”? Come back to it tomorrow.

           The band resets. Brooding, Eric hums “LAYLA” to himself. 
           Duane strums the first chords of “LITTLE WING” but is cut off 
           as Eric rips into the “LAYLA” RIFF. Everyone stares at him.

                                 JIM GORDON
                        Enough! We’re moving on man!

           Eric is cornered, everyone’s eyes are on him. He looks manic.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m not done yet. You guys can go.

           Bobby and Paula share a look, then everyone looks to Tom.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        That’s fine. We’ll call it a night, 
                        pick up with “Little Wing” 
                        tomorrow. [to Duane] Work for you?

                                 DUANE
                        Don’t make no difference to me.

           Everyone clears out. Paula glances back before leaving.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           HOWARD ALBERT (20), the exhausted engineer, is teary-eyed as 
           he watches through the window... Eric, all alone in the dark 
           studio, singing his lungs out - his face is red.

                                 ERIC
                        “Let’s make the best of the 
                        situation/ Before I finally go 
                        insane/ Please don’t say we’ll 
                        never find a way/ And tell me all 
                        my love’s in vain."
                                 ENGINEER
                        That was amazing, Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        Let me go again.

                                 ENGINEER
                             (biting his tongue)
                        Sure thing, man.

                                 ERIC
                        “What’ll you do when you get lonely?”

           INT. COCONUT GROVE CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - AFTERNOON

           Eric walks in alone and peruses the blue jeans. He pulls a 
           pair from the shelf and holds them up - Bell Bottoms.

           EXT. POOL - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Drunk, Eric stumbles by the pool with a shopping bag and 
           spots PATTIE smoking a cigarette with her feet in the water.

                                 ERIC
                        You came!

                                 PAULA
                             (confused)
                        I’ve been here.

           Eric realizes it’s Paula, her hair long like Pattie's again.

                                 PAULA (CONT'D)
                        Come sit with me.

                                 ERIC
                        I might fall in.

                                 PAULA
                        That’s a risk I’m willing to take.

           To Eric, Paula is Pattie now. He kisses her, she pulls away.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry.

                                 PAULA
                        Don’t be. Let’s go to your room.

                                 ERIC
                        Too risky. I know where we can go.
           INT. HALLWAY - CRITERIA - SHORTLY AFTER

           Eric pulls Paula along toward the studio. He hears a PIANO. 
           The mellifluous KEYS PLAYING stops Eric dead in his tracks.

                                 ERIC
                        What is that? [beat] Wait here.

           STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric enters to find Jim Gordon playing a beautiful piece on 
           the piano - his back to the door. As he finishes...

                                 ERIC
                        That was beautiful.

           Jim nearly jumps out of his skin.

                                 JIM
                        Eric- Are you here to record?

                                 ERIC
                        Uh- Yeah, I wanted to work on my 
                        vocals for Layla.

                                 JIM
                        It’s a little late, isn’t it?

                                 ERIC
                        I could say the same to you. 
                        What’re you working on?

                                 JIM
                        I’m just fooling around.

                                 ERIC
                        That why the recording light is on?

           Jim looks to the red light - he’s caught red-handed.

                                 JIM
                        I’ve been... Recording some solo stuff. 
                        I’m trying to put together an album.
                        I’m sorry. But I couldn’t afford to 
                        rent the studio for myself.

                                 ERIC
                        You could get Stigwood in a lot of 
                        trouble, you know that?

                                 JIM
                        Please don’t tell him- I’ll stop, I promise.
                                 ERIC
                        What was that you were playing?

           Jim plays a section of it.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        It’s emotional.

                                 JIM
                        Really? It’s not done.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s exactly what “Layla” is 
                        missing. It compliments the guitar 
                        perfectly. It’s delicate. And 
                        emotional. It says everything that 
                        my lyrics can’t. I need it.

                                 JIM
                        I don’t know-

                                 ERIC
                        Let me use it and you can keep stealing 
                        studio time. I won’t say a word.

                                 JIM
                             (considering)
                        You like it that much?

                                 ERIC
                        I think Pattie will be in tears by 
                        the end of that coda.

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric opens the door to find Paula, crying.

                                 PAULA
                        Pattie is Layla.

           She slaps him, hard, and storms out, slamming the door behind 
           her - she’s gone. Jim and Eric share an awkward look.

           EXT. CRITERIA - MORNING

           The sun rises over the studio.

           INT. HALLWAY - CRITERIA

           Bobby enters the hall as Eric’s about to go into the studio.

                                 BOBBY
                        Eric! Have you seen Paula anywhere?
                                 ERIC
                        Not today. [changing the subject] 
                        Hey- What was that song you played 
                        for me when you first came to stay 
                        at Hurtwood? I remember it was slow 
                        and something like... [beat] And I 
                        hate to hurt your feelings/ But 
                        it’s not the way it seems-

                                 BOBBY
                        ‘Cause I miss her. [beat] I can’t 
                        believe you remember that song.

                                 ERIC
                        I think we should close the record 
                        with that song. You’ll sing it.

                                 BOBBY
                        You screwing with me?

                                 ERIC
                        Not at all. I mean it. We’ll record 
                        it as soon as we finish “Layla.”

           Bobby rolls his eyes as they duck into the studio.

           STUDIO - LATER

           Everyone listens as Jim plays the PIANO CODA for “LAYLA”.

                                 ERIC
                        What does everyone think?

                                 TOM
                        I think it works. It’s like a postcoital 
                        cigarette... Reflective and calm.

                                 DUANE
                        Couldn’t have put it better myself.

                                 BOBBY
                        Eric, you really like it?

                                 JIM
                        What’s wrong with it?

                                 BOBBY
                        Nothin’ wrong with it. I just don’t 
                        think it fits.

                                 TOM
                        Bobby if you want to play it, you 
                        can give it a stab.
                                 JIM
                        Yeah, if you don’t want me to play 
                        your precious keys, then go ahead 
                        and play it for all I care.

                                 BOBBY
                        It has nothing to do with who plays 
                        it, it doesn’t belong in the song. 
                        It ruins the integrity of it all.

                                 JIM
                        Integrity? You’re just mad because 
                        you didn’t write it.

                                 BOBBY
                        You didn’t write it either. Your 
                        girlfriend did.

                                 JIM
                        We co-wrote it- Fuck you Bobby. I’m 
                        sorry Paula left you high and dry, 
                        but don’t take your shit out on me.

                                 BOBBY
                        How’d you know Paula left me?

           Jim realizes he let the cat out of the bag, looks to Eric.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        What?

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eric pleads with Bobby.

                                 ERIC
                        I was drunk, man. And all I did was 
                        kiss her.

                                 BOBBY
                        What about Pattie, huh? That’s what 
                        all this is for anyway!

                                 ERIC
                        Honestly, I kissed her because she 
                        reminded me of Pattie. I swear.
                             (Bobby rolls his eyes)
                        She ran away from me. Not you. 
                        It’ll be fine back in London.

                                 BOBBY
                        So you only asked me to sing my 
                        song ‘cause you felt bad.
                                 ERIC
                        No, no. I loved that song. Truly.

           STUDIO - LATER

           A quiet tension in the room. Everyone’s ready but Eric’s 
           missing. He finally enters with a brand new acoustic guitar.

                                 TOM
                        We ready?

           Eric plays a few chords on the guitar and hands it to Bobby.

                                 ERIC
                        Here. This is for you. Use it for 
                        your song.

           Bobby looks it over. He musters some forgiveness for Eric.

                                 BOBBY
                        Thanks. Hey Duane, could you do me 
                        a favor and play it first?

                                 DUANE
                        What for?

                                 BOBBY
                        Hoping to harness some of your 
                        energy into it.

           Duane smiles, plays the famous “LAYLA” riff, hands it back.

           STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           All five guys are gathered around one microphone with Bobby 
           in the center on a stool...

                                 BOBBY
                        And if I never see her face again/ I 
                        never hold her hand... (continues)

           INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING

           We pan over everyone passed out in their seats, stopping on 
           Eric as he reads “LAYLA & MAJNUN” - the shopping bag with the 
           jeans beside him. He looks healthier, cleaner, and content.

                                 BOBBY (V.O.)
                        And if she’s in somebody’s arms/ I 
                        know I’ll understand but I’ll miss 
                        that girl/ Lord I still miss that 
                        girl/ Maybe someday soon, somewhere.
           EXT. KENSINGTON FLAT - EVENING

           Eric smokes a cigarette outside under a light drizzle with a 
           bag in his hand. Pattie arrives with an umbrella. They hug.

                                 PATTIE
                        You look good. And tan.

                                 ERIC
                        You too. Well not tan. Because you 
                        didn’t come to Miami.

                                 PATTIE
                        Don’t start.

           Eric hands Pattie the bag. She pulls out the BELL-BOTTOM 
           JEANS and smiles.

                                 PATTIE (CONT'D)
                        How did you know? [hugging him] 
                        Thank you, Eric!

                                 ERIC
                        So do you really like me then, or 
                        do you only see me because I’m 
                        famous and buy you nice things?

                                 PATTIE
                        Oh that’s strange, I thought you 
                        were seeing me because I’m famous.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m just trying to get close to George.

           She hits him playfully.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Don’t lie, I know you’ve missed me.

                                 PATTIE
                        Not at all.

                                 ERIC
                        I have a surprise for you.

                                 PATTIE
                        Another one?

           INT. KENSINGTON FLAT - SHORTLY AFTER

           Pattie watches as Eric sets up the tape reels for playback - 
           he is jittery and hopeful.
           He sits her down and grabs a set of headphones, knocking over 
           the metal cannister in the process.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh- Sorry. [beat] Here. Put these 
                        on. [puts them on for her] Ready?

                                 PATTIE
                        Did you write me a song or 
                        something?

                                 ERIC
                        No. I wrote you an album.

           He hits play. The room is silent save for the barely audible 
           “LAYLA” RIFF coming from the headphones. Eric doesn’t take 
           his eyes off Pattie as she moves her head to the music. Eric 
           smiles. Her eyes close as she sways gently, starting to feel 
           it. Eric glows with excitement. After a moment, she stops 
           moving completely and opens her eyes. He freezes as she looks 
           up at him bitterly... He tries to read her face. A single 
           TEAR streams down her cheek, but she quickly wipes it away, 
           composing herself.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Well?

           She closes her eyes again, trying to hold back, but more 
           TEARS come. Eric smirks, twistedly proud of himself. As she’s 
           about to remove her headphones... He stops her.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Wait, let me play it again.

                                 PATTIE
                        Eric-

                                 ERIC
                        No, listen again.

           He rewinds and hits play. Eric watches her in dead silence as 
           she listens for another long while. Her tears flow harder. 
           Eric can’t determine if they are tears of joy or sadness.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Do you like it?

           She looks up at him and nods subtly. Eric SIGHS in relief.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Good. That’s good.
           After a moment, Pattie wipes the tears from her cheeks, sits 
           up straight and finds her strength. She removes the 
           headphones and hands them to him defiantly.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I wrote it for you.

                                 PATTIE
                        I know Eric. I’m not stupid. The whole 
                        world will know you wrote it for me.

                                 ERIC
                        So? Do you like it?

                                 PATTIE
                             (getting to her feet)
                        Yes. Yes, I fucking love it. It’s 
                        raw and beautiful. It feels like 
                        being stabbed with a knife. 
                        Piercing to the point of numbness. 
                        [off Eric’s smile] You’re very 
                        talented and passionate. You know 
                        it better than anyone else. 

                                 ERIC
                        I need you to hear the whole album. 
                        They’re all for you, Pattie. 
                        Everything was always for you.

           She studies his crazed eyes full of desperation. After a 
           moment, she gathers her coat and purse.

                                 PATTIE
                        I have to go, Eric.

                                 ERIC
                        What do you mean? You just got here. 
                        Don’t you want to hear the rest?

                                 PATTIE
                        I’ll hear them on the radio.

                                 ERIC
                        Wait- This is it. You have to leave him now.

                                 PATTIE
                        This is not it. This is emotional 
                        blackmail. Do you understand that? 
                        Did ever once think what you’ve 
                        been doing to me? To George? He’s 
                        not stupid, ya know?
                                 ERIC
                        He is. He is because he doesn’t 
                        know what he has. And I do.

                                 PATTIE
                        But you don’t.

           She kisses him on the cheek and leaves. He doesn’t try to go 
           after her. He collapses onto the chair, pulls the headphone 
           jack out - the room swells with the sound of “LAYLA”.

                                 ERIC (V.O.)
                        Let’s make the best of the 
                        situation/ Before I finally go 
                        insane/ Please don’t say we’ll 
                        never find a way/ And tell me all 
                        my love’s in vain.
                             (beat)
                        Layla, you’ve got me on my knees/ 
                        Layla, I’m begging, darling please/ 
                        Layla, darling won’t you ease my 
                        trouble worried mind.

           The haunting PIANO CODA trickles in. Eric stops the playback, 
           rewinds and hits PLAY again. The opening guitar riff hits him 
           hard... He stops it, rewinds and hits PLAY again. The riff 
           swells as Eric watches the tape-reel spin round and round.

           THE FOLLOWING TEXT SLOWLY FADES IN - ONE LINE AT A TIME:

           Derek & the Dominos’ “Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs” 
           was a commercial failure at the time of its release...

           Mainly due to the fact that no one knew “Derek” was Eric.

           Eric fell into a self-imposed, heroin-induced exile for three 
           years, rarely seen by the public or his friends.

           In 1974, he kicked his habit. Shortly after, Eric finally won 
           his “Layla” from his dear friend George.

           Eric & Pattie were married in 1978...

           George Harrison & his wife, Olivia, attended the wedding.

           Eric & Pattie were divorced in 1988.

           Eric & George remained friends until George passed in 2001.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.
