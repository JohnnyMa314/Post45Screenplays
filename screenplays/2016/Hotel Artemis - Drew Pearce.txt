                        The angriest safe-man in Los Angeles
           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           We open on A SHOT of 1920s Downtown Los Angeles.

           PULL BACK to reveal it’s a PEELING FRESCO in a once-glamorous 
           but now utterly busted Art Deco hotel suite.

           Beneath the mural, a lady (64) sleeps restlessly. Her name is 
           JEAN THOMAS, but everyone calls her 

           THE NURSE

           She’s fully-clothed under the covers, snoring gently in a 
           Mojave cardigan and hospital whites. A half-empty glass of 
           rye and some pills lie on the bedside table next to her.

           BRING-BRING

           An old-fashioned telephone on the side table rings, and the 
           nurse is immediately awake. She leans over to answer, 
           knocking a small PHOTOGRAPH FRAME off in her hurry.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (answering phone)
                        How can I help?

                                 MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Nurse? It’s Sherman Atkins.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Oh, hey honey. Longtime no speak. 
                        You back in town?

                                 MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        ‘Fraid so. And I need a couple of 
                        rooms for the night.

           The nurse rises, and examines a WOODEN CLIPBOARD -- which 
           surprisingly illuminates her face with BLUE DIGITAL LIGHT.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I’ve got two left. Guess you’re in 
                        luck.

                                 MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        With all due respect, luck is one 
                        commodity I am shit out of tonight. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Let’s see what we can do about 
                        that. Come on in the back...

                                 MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Copy that. We’re five minutes out.
           The nurse hangs up, then replaces the FRAME on her bedside 
           table. She smiles a little sadly as she addresses the photo:

                                 THE NURSE
                        Namaste, babe.
                             (then, to the room)
                        TV.

           An incongruous HOLOGRAPHIC 3-D SCREEN flickers to life. 
           STREET WARFARE and NEWS-ANCHOR BULLSHIT fills the dusty room.

           ON THE TV SCREEN:

           We see the date -- 1:02am, October 4th 2021 -- and FOOTAGE 
           showing riots between armored paramilitary and street gangs.

           The ticker reads “28 DEATHS SO FAR IN THIRD NIGHT OF RIOTS”.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        ...Governor has warned that if 
                        civil obedience isn’t established 
                        by midnight, martial curfew will-

                                 THE NURSE
                        Mute.
                             (yawn)
                        Just another Wednesday.

           She stretches and WALKS THROUGH the hologram to a spinning 
           RECORD PLAYER. There, she returns the needle to the start of 
           a record -- something Seventies, Laurel Canyon and upbeat:

                              “Spirit Of The Letter” by Elyse

           The nurse nods, throws down some more pills and a finger of 
           rye. Then she heads into the bathroom with a slight LIMP.

           MUSIC SOUNDTRACKS THE NURSE’S MORNING ROUTINE:

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” BATHROOM - HOTEL - NIGHT

           The nurse brushes her teeth, applies eyedrops, humming to the 
           tune. A robe hanging behind the door reads “HOTEL ARTEMIS”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           She picks up an OLD LEATHER DOCTOR’S BAG, bustles into the 
           corridor, putting on her HEADPHONES, still nodding along.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LOBBY - HOTEL - NIGHT

           She grabs TWO KEYS from the hotel room hooks. Each of the 
           hooks bears the name of a 1920s vacation spot: 

                       NICE    LOS ANGELES    ACAPULCO
                            HONOLULU     NIAGARA

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           The nurse enters busily. The wall behind her shows another 
           fresco, this time of PERIOD HONOLULU in all its Tiki glory.

           The lady hums, plumps the pillows in the bedroom. The linens 
           bear the faded insignia of a stag, and the initials “HA”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “HONOLULU” BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE UP of a TOOTHBRUSH being laid out by the sink. Next to 
           them the nurse sets down a big pot of MEDICAL-GRADE PERCOCET.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           The nurse places her thumb on a SCANNER by an old wardrobe. 

           It makes a SHNIIIK noise, and the nurse winces as she rubs 
           away the PIN-PRICK OF BLOOD that the ID-ing process requires. 

           The doors open to reveal a futuristic cornucopia of medical 
           equipment. The nurse picks out a couple of items,  then 
           leaves the room, taking her old doctor’s bag with her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR RECEPTION - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Now at one end of a long, ornate-but-crumbling corridor, the 
           nurse waits patiently. Crumpled serenity incarnate.

           At the other end of the corridor are two ornate ELEVATOR 
           DOORS. 

           And between the doors and the nurse -- in stark contrast to 
           the faded deco -- is a cutting-edge METAL GATE.
           An arrow indicator above one of the elevators rises slowly.

           7, 8, 9, 10... DING

           Suddenly the gilded doors slam open, the music CUTS OUT and --

           CRASH

           ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

                                 HONOLULU
                        JESUS FUCKING CHRIST HELP ME-

           THREE MEN IN ONCE-WHITE HOTEL UNIFORMS fall out the elevator.

           SHERMAN ATKINS AKA WAIKIKI (39) is focused but messed up, 
           already taking in the room in his bloodied disguise.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        There she is. See, it’s gonna be 
                        okay, it’s gonna be okay...

           LEVON ATKINS AKA HONOLULU (36) is next. His own sharp look is 
           let down by the fact that his dinner jacket is a deep red.

                                 HONOLULU
                        Lev, it hurts... it hurts weird...

           Finally, there’s the most aggressive of the three: PAUL PENG 
           (35). He has a bleeding head and his eyes are wild.

           As the visitors proceed they’re SCANNED by a SECURITY ARCH.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Hey Peng, gimme a hand here, he’s 
                        passed out again-

                                 PAUL PENG
                        And I’ve got a fucking BULLET in my 
                        NECK, OKAY SHERMAN?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Easy, fellas, everyone’s gonna get 
                        fixed. Sure you left all your heat 
                        at the door?

                                 PAUL PENG
                             (gesturing at the arch)
                        We’re DOUBLE-CLEAN, okay?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Then I just need you to verify your 
                        membership and we’ll be off to the 
                        races, medically-speaking...
           She indicates the WALL, where a PALM-SCANNING DEVICE sits.

           Waikiki quickly SWIPES his WRIST across it. 

           Bleep. 

           The nurse looks down at her clipboard, which we now see is 
           actually a TABLET-LIKE HOLO-SCREEN.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You’re peachy. How about the 
                        nogoodnik?

           Waikiki scans Honolulu’s limp arm, leaving a smear of blood.

           Bleep. 

           The nurse looks a little surprised.

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (seeing her reaction)
                        Yeah, I covered his dues. Can you 
                        put me in with my brother?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Okay, you boys take the double. 
                        He’s Honolulu, you’re Waikiki.
                             (then, on a walkie-talkie)
                        We’ve got a Code Red and a possible 
                        Code Grey, and I need a gurney in 
                        the lobby tout damn suite.
                             (to Paul Peng)
                        You’re up, Slick.

           Paul Peng scans his wrist. 

           Nothing. 

           The Nurse scowls, as Paul Peng looks at her incredulously.

                                 PAUL PENG
                        The thing’s covered in blood!

                                 THE NURSE
                        So clean it off and run it again.

           He does as he’s told, then swipes it again. 

           Nothing. 

           Paul Peng angrily holds up a wrist, where we see a tiny SLIT:
                                 PAUL PENG
                        I’ve got the fucking SCAR, haven’t 
                        I?

                                 THE NURSE
                        That incision could be from any 
                        D.R. in the world-

                                 PAUL PENG
                             (changing tack)
                        Okay, okay. What if I pay you now-?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Against the rules -- I have to run 
                        checks. You could be serial, a ped-

                                 PAUL PENG
                        I’m not, I swear!

                                 THE NURSE
                        Listen bub, L.A.’s a goddamn temple 
                        to hypochondria. There’re plenty 
                        hospitals out there-

                                 PAUL PENG
                        Where the cops are looking for us!

                                 THE NURSE
                        C'est la guerre...

                                 PAUL PENG
                        YOU’RE SPEAKING FUCKING FRENCH NOW?

                                 THE NURSE
                        See now, raising your voice to me, 
                        that’s also against the rules. It’s 
                        right there under “don’t kill the 
                        other patients”. Which you’d know 
                        if you were a member, because the 
                        rules are in the membership pack.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I have to get him inside NOW.
                             (to Paul Peng)
                        Let us through.

                                 PAUL PENG
                             (moving in front of the 
                              gate, cutting them off)
                        You think you’re getting in WITHOUT 
                        me, Sherman?

           Waikiki leans in, dark-eyed, and DROPS HIS VOICE:
                                 WAIKIKI
                        Let us through... or I’ll put you 
                        down like a cheap carpet and wipe 
                        my boots on your fucking back.

           There’s a beat of tension --

                                 THE NURSE
                        Better listen to him, Slick. ‘Cos 
                        even if you get past him, I’ll drop 
                        a mountain on you.

                                 PAUL PENG
                        And what’s THAT supposed to mean?

                                 THE NURSE
                        EVEREST!

           A HUGE FIGURE in an ORDERLY’S UNIFORM -- Latino, gang tattoos 
           -- comes around the corner. This is EVEREST (32). 

           Paul Peng’s face falls.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Know why he’s called Everest? Yeah, 
                        you get it.

           Waikiki sees an opening -- and SLAMS Peng backwards into the 
           metal fence using his prone brother’s body --

           -- as The Nurse pulls a LARGE METAL KEY WITH THE ARTEMIS LOGO 
           out of her cardigan, and lets them in.

           Paul Peng regroups, though, and LUNGES for the opening -- 

           -- but Everest matter-of-factly GRABS him by the throat.

                                 EVEREST
                        Nope.
                             (to the nurse)
                        What you want doing with this one?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Give him a shot then take him for a 
                        ride. I got work to do.

                                 PAUL PENG
                        I can’t go back out there! They’re 
                        ripping the city-UGH!

           Everest slams a NEEDLE into Paul Peng’s CHEST, pushes the 
           plunger, and the angry criminal INSTANTLY SLUMPS DOWN --

           -- then Everest drags him unceremoniously to the elevators.
           The Nurse dumps her bag on Honolulu’s gurney, starts PUSHING 
           him from the gate towards his suite.

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Waikiki is trying to keep up while the Nurse performs running 
           triage on Honolulu -- as an unbroken shot of their journey 
           establishes the geography of this hidden haven:

           -- the three FRONT ELEVATORS, which lead to that elaborate 
           security corridor, which once you’re through opens into --

           -- the PENTHOUSE LEVEL of a dilapidated hotel, now apparently 
           an underground emergency room for the criminally injured --

           -- in the center of which is a disused BAR AREA, surrounded 
           by the corridor housing our FIVE PENTHOUSE SUITES.

           But back to the business at hand... a bleeding bank robber.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (urgent)
                        I’m seeing multiple entry wounds, 
                        an air-conditioned liver, left 
                        clavicle and scapula completely 
                        blown. Anything I miss?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I heard the leg break-

                                 THE NURSE
                        Forget the leg. A leg he can live 
                        without -- a liver not so much. How 
                        about you?

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (wincing)
                        The vest stopped a couple of 240s. 
                        Feels like the third one made it 
                        through, chose to stick around.

           The nurse nods sympathetically -- then GRABS Waikiki’s arm, 
           jabs her finger into the bullet hole. Waikiki SCREAMS.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Sorry, babe, no time to buy you 
                        flowers. Yeah, there’s a bullet in 
                        there. And a whole bunch of bone 
                        fragments. Not yours.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        The wheelman took a headshot right 
                        next to me.
                                 THE NURSE
                        Then that’ll be the wheelman.

           The nurse removes her finger -- and Waikiki YELPS with pain. 
           She pulls an EPI-PEN from her bag, JABS him with it.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Adrenaline and a little morph to 
                        keep you going. Though I’m failing 
                        to see how a bank job ends up with 
                        this much human smush.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        We got caught in the riot... but 
                        mostly it was the team. The 
                        trouble’s always on the inside, 
                        y’know?

           The nurse PUTS HER HAND in the cavity in Honolulu’s leg, 
           WRIGGLES a piece of DEBRIS from inside -- PULLS IT OUT.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I never had a problem with the 
                        inside. It’s kind of my sweet spot.

           The nurse throws Waikiki a room key, and he opens the door to 
           the Honolulu SUITE. CLUNK. The heavy bolts let it swing open.

           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse slams a hand on another SENSOR, then winces as the 
           door opens. She pulls medical equipment from cupboards, as at 
           the table, Honolulu begins to come around, terrified:

                                 HONOLULU
                        Sherm?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I’m here. It’s good. We’re good.

           The nurse switches on a LARGE FUTURE-TECH SCANNER. It purrs 
           as she pulls an ultrasound over Honolulu’s chest -- 

                                 THE NURSE
                             (concerned by his stats)
                        You know, this guy’s tranq 
                        tolerance is through the roof.
                             (then)
                        Okay, big brother. You need to hold 
                        his hand, let him know you’re here 
                        for him...

           Waikiki takes the hand, as the nurse passes him a DRIP LINE.
                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        ...then ram that needle into the 
                        biggest vein you can find and seal 
                        it up with this.

           She throws him a small bottle of GORILLA GLUE.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        He’s gonna struggle, ‘cos the pain 
                        meds won’t kick in before I have to 
                        play lasertag in that liver. And 
                        he’s gonna need as much of the good 
                        shit as he can get, especially with 
                        what’s coming up in part two...

           She opens the machine, which we see is a 3-D PRINTER. The 
           machine is CROSS-HATCHING something into existence.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        ...his new shoulder blade.

           VOOOM 

           Suddenly, THE LIGHTS CUT, and the room goes PITCH BLACK.

                                 WAIKIKI (O.S.)
                        What’s going on?

                                 THE NURSE (O.S.)
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        Grid’s out, probably riot control. 
                        Don’t worry, there’s a back-up.

                                 WAIKIKI (O.S.)
                        With everything that’s happening, 
                        you think this place can hold up?

           FZZZZ

           The LIGHTS RETURN, and we see the nurse again. She looks up 
           from her bloody work, but smiles calmly to Waikiki:

                                 THE NURSE (O.S.)
                        Sweetheart, me and The Artemis have 
                        been here 32 years. 
                             (then)
                        This is just another Wednesday.

           And with that we SLAM CUT TO FULL-SCREEN TITLE CARD:

                                HOTEL ARTEMIS
           EXT. LOS ANGELES SKYLINE - NIGHT

           A DERELICT 1920s DOWNTOWN HOTEL -- 

           -- except for THE PENTHOUSE FLOOR, whose windows are BLACKED 
           OUT and invisible. On the roof, a NEON NAME SIGN glows.

           The skyline behind the hotel is full of glass skyscrapers, 
           reflecting searchlights and the fires of unrest --

           -- as we hear a distant RADIO REPORT play on a tinny speaker:

                                 RADIO NEWS (O.S.)
                        ...as protests at the reassignment 
                        of law enforcement from the 
                        L.A.P.D. to the private sector...

           The camera DROPS to street level --

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           -- where we see a HIDDEN DOOR open onto a dirty Downtown back 
           alley, and an ambulance accelerate out into the night.

                                 RADIO NEWS (O.S.)
                        ...turned into three nights of gang-
                        led carnage now ravaging the city.

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Everest is at the wheel, looking out for a drop-off spot.

           BOOM

           Up above -- a distant POLICE CHOPPER explodes, spins high 
           about the skyline, SMASHING into the US Bank skyscraper.

                                 EVEREST
                        Man, gangbanging’s gotten way more 
                        ambitious since my day.

           Suddenly, the radio is interrupted by his WALKIE-TALKIE:

                                 THE NURSE (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Hey, Tall Boy. Sorry to interrupt 
                        your little daytrip, but riot 
                        control just killed the grid.

                                 EVEREST
                        Shit, the back-up generator’s 
                        older’n you-
           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse is busy setting up Honolulu’s LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM.

                                 THE NURSE
                        And twice as busted. So yeah, I 
                        suggest you head on up to the roof 
                        ASAP, give it a little love.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Can’t you do it?

                                 THE NURSE
                        I’ve got a handful of fresh thief 
                        liver up here, bub. So this ain’t a 
                        Debate Club.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Kinda tetchy tonight -- you need a 
                        vacation.

                                 THE NURSE
                        All I NEED is a larascopic miracle 
                        and a glass of Chivas. Now just 
                        deliver the outpatient then head up 
                        and make sure we stay Christmas-y, 
                        will you babe?

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                             (with a sigh)
                        Yes, nurse.

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           She CLICKS OFF -- as Everest slams to a halt.

           Then he swings his frame through into the back section --

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           -- where the back doors of the ambulance BURST OPEN -- to 
           reveal Everest and a woozy Paul Peng. 

           Everest SLAMS him against the side of the ambulance.

                                 PAUL PENG
                        WHAT?!

                                 EVEREST
                             (re: his orderly badge)
                        See this? This means I got medical 
                        prowess. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVEREST (CONT'D)
                        But that knowledge goes both ways. 
                        So you tell anyone -- an-y-one -- 
                        ‘bout this exit or that entrance or 
                        anything else you saw tonight? I 
                        will hunt you down and un-heal the 
                        SHIT out of you. You feel me?

                                 PAUL PENG
                        So you’re just gonna LEAVE me here? 
                        With a FUCKING BULLET IN MY NECK?

                                 EVEREST
                        Hey, you want it, I got something 
                        here might help with the pain.

           Everest reaches into the ambulance -- pulls out a GLOCK 19. 

           Paul Peng BLANCHES. 

           Then Everest digs deeper... pulls out a PACKET OF TWO ADVIL. 

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        Compliments of the Artemis, 
                        chingada madre.

           Everest SLAMS the doors, and guns the ambulance back home --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - HOTEL - LATER

           -- as high above them, Waikiki stares at his prone brother, 
           unconscious on the bed. The nurse is cleaning off, job done.

                                 WAIKIKI 
                        How long before I can move him?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Two weeks.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        We’ve got two hours.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Then you’ve got an issue. Because 
                        this guy’s drug tolerance...?

           She pulls up Honolulu’s sleeve. There are red raw TRACK MARKS 
           in the soft skin between each of his fingers.
                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        ...let’s say it’s unusually high.
                             (then)
                        I need to take a look at you now.

           The nurse affixes a NANITE CUFF to Waikiki’s arm, examines 
           her clipboard -- as he stares down at his brother ruefully.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        He said he’d cleaned up.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Well, he didn’t. So you’re gonna 
                        need a really big shot of 
                        painkillers to move him. Like, the 
                        kind they give baby elephants.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Right...

                                 THE NURSE
                        No, I’m serious. Real baby 
                        elephants. Since that Middle East 
                        Wall went up, teenagers in 
                        Beirut’re using it to party ‘cos 
                        they can’t get Western smack. I 
                        mean, kudos, but who’s the first 
                        kid that thinks “I wonder if these 
                        jumbo tranqs would get me high?”.

           Waikiki thinks, then:

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Maybe the one whose dad’s a 
                        zookeeper.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Huh. You’re a smart guy.
                             (so...)
                        How come you wound up back here?

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (gesturing to his brother)
                        Family reasons. But, you know -- I 
                        really did get out for a while. 
                             (then)
                        I’m guessing you hear that a lot.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Sure. Though I can usually tell who 
                        it’s not going to stick for.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Oh yeah? And how’s that?
           The nurse indicates the place around her. The Artemis.

                                 THE NURSE
                        They don’t stop paying their dues.

           Waikiki looks down at his wrist -- rubs the INCISION MARK of 
           his membership chip that he never gave up.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                             (looking at his x-ray)
                        Son, you’ve got more holes than 
                        Donut Time. How many bullets’ve you 
                        taken for this guy?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I lost count. It seemed apposite.

           The nurse shakes her head, starts to stitch him up.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (faux idly)
                        I ever tell you about the dog I 
                        had?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Um... not that I recall.

                                 THE NURSE
                        He wasn’t a good dog. Never house-
                        trained. Played in traffic. Bit my 
                        kid, even. But my husband never had 
                        the nerve to put him down, so we 
                        just lived with all the shit and 
                        blood and broken bones for years. I 
                        feel bad saying it, but it was kind 
                        of a relief when he went.
                             (then)
                        See... there comes a point, if a 
                        dog’s gonna keep playing in 
                        traffic, you just gotta let him get 
                        on with it. What’s gonna happen 
                        will happen. And you definitely 
                        don’t throw yourself in front of 
                        the 18-wheeler that’s meant for 
                        him. It’s tough, but-

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I get it. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Good.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You’re more of a cat person.
           She chuckles, indicates a machine next to Honolulu’s bed.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Okay, smart guy -- this is a life-
                        support. Handsome needs to be on it 
                        for the next three hours or his 
                        photocopied liver goes into shock, 
                        and then his life, see, will cease 
                        to be supported. Clue’s in the 
                        name.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        So... three hours. Then we’re out?

                                 THE NURSE
                        That’s the best I can do.
                             (patting his shoulder))
                        You’re a sweet kid. Always welcome, 
                        whether you want to be here or not.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Does anyone want to be here?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Well that’s a much bigger question, 
                        now, isn’t it honey?

           The nurse exits, and the door closes behind her.

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse pulls her cardigan sleeves back down and rolls out 
           into the hallway, whose LIGHTS still splutter a little.

           Behind her, the door closes heavily --

           -- and THREE HEAVY INTERNAL BOLTS clunk into place. The 
           hospital might be old, but the security is cutting edge.

           The nurse consults her clipboard, looks down at the last two 
           rooms on her rounds: “NICE” and “ACAPULCO” --

                                 THE NURSE
                        Well, okay-

           DOOT-DOOT

           -- but then, an alert tone interrupts her routine. The nurse 
           hits a button on the clipboard and -- 

           ON THE SCREEN:
           we see a CCTV image labelled “DOOR #1”. It’s a man in a 
           bloody tracksuit, hair cut thug-short -- ILYA FRANKLIN (28).

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV)
                             (Russian accent)
                        Where is nurse?

           The nurse frowns, but doesn’t answer.

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV) (CONT’D)
                             (Russian accent)
                        WHERE IS NURSE?

           The nurse hits a SPEAKER BUTTON:

                                 THE NURSE
                             (calmly)
                        Well, that depends who’s asking.

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV) 
                        Ilya Franklin. You know my father.

           The nurse stops. 

           She takes a deep breath. 

           Her tone changes.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Yes I do.
                             (then)
                        How can I help?

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV)
                        He is badly hurt. I need you to 
                        hold a room.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Is he here?

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV)
                        Soon.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Well I’m real sorry, junior, but 
                        it’s first come first serve. That’s 
                        the rules.

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV)
                        How about new rule -- you hold room 
                        or I burn you down.
                                 THE NURSE
                        Look, I get it, you’re upset -- but 
                        you think Daddy’s gonna be happy if 
                        you torch his investment?

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV)
                        You think he will be happy if you 
                        give away his fucking room?

           The nurse pauses.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Okay, that’s a good point. I guess 
                        there’s some... privileges. For 
                        founders.

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV)
                        Good. I wait here, secure entrance-

                                 THE NURSE
                        Junior, we’re a goddamn SECRET 
                        EMERGENCY ROOM. Murderous-looking 
                        young men hanging ‘round the hidden 
                        entrances is kind of a no-no.

           Ilya grits his teeth -- comes CLOSE to the CCTV camera:

                                 ILYA (ON CCTV)
                        Old lady, I give zero fucks about 
                        your secret OR your deal with my 
                        father. If he dies, I own you AND 
                        your hospital... and I will break 
                        you both apart. So... I wait here. 
                        Then you -- you fix HIM.
                             (then)
                        He coming from Bel Air... GPS says 
                        50 minutes. Be ready.

           He steps away from the door. The nurse rubs her eyes --

           -- then looks up to see a woman fiddling with her DIGITAL 
           WATCH. This is NICE (36). 

           (It’s Nice like the city. “Neece”.) 

           She sits on a chaise long, in a bloodied evening dress and a 
           SHOULDER CAST. The cigarette in her mouth is ready to light.

                                 THE NURSE
                        What a dreamboat, huh?

                                 NICE
                             (heavy french accent)
                        My TV exploded.
                                 THE NURSE
                        We’re working on it. But if you 
                        wanna kill yourself even quicker 
                        than the .44 that went through your 
                        shoulder, try sparking up that 
                        Gitanes in my hospital.

                                 NICE
                             (Parisian shrug)
                        My TV exploded. What else am going 
                        to do?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Tell me about that shoulder.

                                 NICE
                             (more vulnerable now)
                        It... it still hurts.

           The nurse sits next to her, and inspects the bullet wound 
           underneath the cast. She fishes something out of her bag, 
           applies it to the wound. Nice WINCES audibly.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Relax. If I had a dollar for every 
                        bullet hole I’d patched up...
                             (gesturing around her)
                        ...well, I kind of do.
                             (casually)
                        You know, you did a good job here.

                                 NICE
                             (frowning)
                        I don’t know what you mean.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Sure you do. I mean one inch lower 
                        and you’d have lost the use of the 
                        arm for good. That’s precise work.

                                 NICE
                        Really, I don’t-

                                 THE NURSE
                        Babe, 85% of what I fix is gun-
                        related. Entrance angles, 
                        projectile tear, muzzle burn...

           As the nurse explains, she MIMES shooting her own shoulder.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        We both know you checked YOURSELF 
                        in here.
                                 NICE
                             (beat, then)
                        I needed somewhere quiet.
                             (re: shoulder shot)
                        Though it was more difficult to do 
                        than I expected. Unnatural.

                                 THE NURSE
                        No shit. Listen, I don’t care how 
                        you got here -- but you can relax. 
                        The Artemis is a real fine place to 
                        hide. Up here, it’s like what’s out 
                        there ain’t even happening.

                                 NICE
                        That’s good.
                             (then, Parisian again)
                        But what about the TV?

                                 THE NURSE
                             (really?)
                        Well, there’s another one in the TV 
                        room. Down the corridor, you can’t 
                        miss it -- it’s the room with a big 
                        fucking TV in it.

           BEEP BEEP

           Nice’s CHUNKY WATCH sounds an ALARM. She frowns.

                                 NICE
                        Excuse me. I have to make a call.

           Nice quickly retires to her bedroom, shutting the door behind 
           her, leaving the nurse outside. 

                                 THE NURSE
                             (to the empty corridor)
                        My pleasure, I guess.
                             (looking at her clipboard)
                        Okay. One more to go.

           Then the nurse makes her way off down the hallway --

           INT. “NICE” SUITE - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           -- as a beautiful French Riviera fresco frames Nice, who 
           makes a bee-line to the bathroom mirror of her suite. 

           She fishes for something in her pocket:

           A CONTACT LENS. She puts it in her eye, stares in the mirror.
                                 NICE
                        Confirm sync. Secure line.

           A WALLET on her bedside table HUMS QUIETLY, as one eye 
           FLICKERS -- the lens now transmitting an OCULAR MESSAGE.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        2am check in, attention D2T: 
                             (then, reporting)
                        Due to an intelligence breach, the 
                        target was surrounded by ten times 
                        more security than expected. And 
                        they knew I was coming. Unlike your 
                        research division will if they EVER

                        that situation. I will be in touch 
                        when I can confirm, in just under

           There’s a long beat as she waits for a reply. 

           Nice idly looks around her in the room -- cupboards full of 
           medical equipment. She holds up a thumb up to the latch of 
           one, and the DNA LOCK PRICKS her digit -- but nothing opens.

           Then, in her POV, we see TEXT flash up:

                           “COMPANY INTELLIGENCE WAS UP-TO-DATE.
                          COMPROMISE IS ASSET’S RESPONSIBILITY.”

                        Enculés bon marché...

           SUBTITLE: Go fuck yourselves.

           Nice PULLS OUT the contact lens, takes a beat to gather her 
           thoughts. 

           She clicks her WATCH, checks the time. She seems unflustered 
           by what she sees, then goes to her door, tries the lock:

           CLUNK. CLUNK. CLUNK. Those heavy, hi-tech bars.
           She frowns -- then her eye follows a THICK ELECTRIC CABLE 
           from the door frame, to the ceiling, out into the corridor. 

           Nice takes her cigarette from behind her ear, puts it in her 
           mouth, exits the room -- and starts following the lead. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - NIGHT

           The nurse knocks briskly on the door of THE ACAPULCO SUITE.

           It opens to reveal a guy in an Artemis robe, ponytail, 
           bandaged face, sunglasses at night. This is ACAPULCO (49).

                                 ACAPULCO
                        The TV-

                                 THE NURSE
                        Yeah, I heard. Cops surged the 
                        power, some of the screens blew. 
                        There’s another one in the TV room.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        You expect me to, like, watch the 
                        news with a bunch of criminals?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Kinda comes with the territory, 
                        sport. Let’s face it, nobody’s here 
                        for the decor. Can I come in?

           He lets her in grumpily, closes the door quickly behind her.

           INT. “ACAPULCO” SUITE - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Acapulco sits in-front of a peeling Caribbean mural. We see 
           FEMALE SCRATCH MARKS on his face. He shifts uncomfortably.

                                 THE NURSE
                        So how’re you feeling?

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Like some whore knifed me in the 
                        back.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Yeah, that probably smarts.

           The nurse picks up her clipboard, swings it around -- shows 
           him a MAP OF HIS OWN BODY. Points to a FLOW OF RED MIST --
                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Well, you’re healing up okay. See 
                        this -- that’s the blood-tech-

                                 ACAPULCO
                        I know how fucking nanites work.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Got it.
                             (handing him a pill pot)
                        Take a couple of these every thirty 
                        minutes, okay hotshot? They’ll take 
                        the sting out the robots skinny-
                        dipping in your spinal fluid.

           BOOM

           There’s an explosion outside, and they both JUMP.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Woah. I remember when cops just 
                        handed out tickets and ate ice-
                        cream. Now they’ve got goddamn 
                        rocket launchers.

                                 ACAPULCO
                             (know-all)
                        That was an RPG. Listen, are you 
                        sure I’m safe in this dump? I mean, 
                        like, how do I know the people in 
                        here aren’t part of what’s going on 
                        out there?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Every patient is checked for gang 
                        affiliation. And... well, they 
                        couldn’t afford the Artemis even if 
                        they knew about it.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Good. Good. I mean, that is what we 
                        pay for. To be away from them.

           The nurse looks troubled by this idea for a beat. Like an 
           itch she can’t scratch. But then:

                                 THE NURSE
                        Yeah, that’s what you pay for. 
                        That... and discretion. 
                             (indicating his scratches)
                        She must’ve been a strong girl. I 
                        guess you paid for that too.

           The nurse smiles sarcastically, then exits. 
           Acapulco goes to say something -- then tuts, and returns to 
           reading the yacht catalogue from his Louis Vuitton bag.

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           In the corridor, the nurse leans back against the wall for a 
           beat, closes her eyes. 

           There’s a tiny moment of respite, but then -- her walkie-
           talkie CRACKLES. She opens one eyelid.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        I’m on the roof. Hope you’re happy.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Tell me it’s all okay, tall boy.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        It’s all okay.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Now tell me if you’re lying.

           EXT. ROOF - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Everest stands under the huge ARTEMIS sign, in front of an 
           OPEN FUSE UNIT. It’s SMOKING, having seen better days.

                                 EVEREST
                        I’m lying. This thing’s in trouble.

           Overhead: PROTEC HELICOPTERS circle. 

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        Hear that? That’s some privatized 
                        riot control shit right there. 

                                 THE NURSE (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        It’ll blow over. I’ve seen it all 
                        before. To everything, turn turn 
                        turn...

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse enters her bedroom, pours herself a finger of rye. 
           She reconsiders, pours herself another couple too. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO LOCATIONS FOR CONVERSATION
                                 THE NURSE
                        ...there is a season turn turn 
                        turn.

                                 EVEREST
                        All I know is that curfew’s coming 
                        down, and the whole place gonna be 
                        swarming. Might even have to evac.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Gimme a break.

                                 EVEREST
                        I know you don’t wanna leave-

                                 THE NURSE
                        ‘Cos this is the safest hole-up in 
                        Los Angeles. We’re not going to-

           WOOP-WOOP-WOOP. 

           Suddenly, the ALARM SYSTEM makes itself known. The nurse 
           frowns, looks up at the TV screen. 

           Her eyes WIDEN.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Woah. Babe, check out Door #4. Are 
                        you seeing what I’m seeing?

           ON THE NURSE’S TV:

           We see a CCTV feed -- a WOMAN crawling up to one of the 
           hotel’s hidden back doors. 

           She’s bloodied and battered --

           -- and wearing a COP UNIFORM.

                             (dumb-founded)
                        That... is some security breach.

                        REMEMBER? MORGAN DANIELS!
                             (then, shouting)
                        MRS. THOMAS, PLEASE!
           Suddenly, the nurse’s face DARKENS. She DROPS to the bed.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Oh brother.

                                 EVEREST
                        Did she say your NAME?

           The nurse reaches out, sinks a long tug of rye. She inhales 
           deeply, like she’s coming up for air.

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        You KNOW this chota?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Give me a second.

           The nurse whisks her hand over her clipboard, and pulls up a 
           bookmark: A HACKED L.A.P.D. DATABASE 

           She searches, finds the face of the woman outside:

                        SERGEANT MORGAN DANIELS. PASADENA PRECINCT.
                                COMMUNITY LIAISON FOR DTLA.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. We have... a problem.

                                 EVEREST
                        Well, she ain’t OUR problem.

                                 THE NURSE
                        She might be. See, this gal’s not 
                        the first hanger-on we picked up 
                        tonight, sweetchunks.
                             (then)
                        Take a look at Door #1.

           EXT. ROOF - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Everest frowns, brings up a second CCTV image on his 
           CLIPBOARD: ILYA, smoking a cigarette, on-guard at DOOR #1.

                                 EVEREST
                        Do I know this guy?

                                 THE NURSE (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Nope. But you’ve sure as shit heard 
                        of his daddy.
                             (then)
                        It’s Orian Franklin.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Waikiki stares at his brother, as the helicopter noise 
           outside finally forces him to stir. His pained red eyes OPEN.

                                 HONOLULU
                        Sherm?
                             (panicking, wheezing)
                        Shit, what’s wrong with my chest?!

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Nurse cut it open. Good news is she 
                        left a new liver in there.

                                 HONOLULU
                        Shit, man. My LIVER-

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Take it easy-

                                 HONOLULU
                        You take it easy! I lost my LIVER, 
                        Sherm! Why’s it always ME that 
                        takes the goddamn hit, huh?

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (with a heavy heart)
                        Lev, I took a hit the day I came in 
                        with you on this. Then I took three 
                        more trying to drag your sloppy ass 
                        out of a job I TOLD you was wrong 
                        from the get-go. And that crew-

                                 HONOLULU
                        They were the best I could get.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You know why? ‘Cos no-one can trust 
                        you...

           To prove his point, Waikiki pulls up the bedsheet -- 
           revealing the TRACK marks on his hands. Honolulu grimaces.

                                 WAIKIKI (CONT’D)
                        You told me you cleaned up. Said 
                        you needed my help for Diane, for 
                        the boys, for your future. That’s 
                        why I’m HERE, Lev. Not to refill 
                        your goddamn arm... 

                                 HONOLULU
                             (trying to appease him)
                        Listen... okay... I messed up. But 
                        I’ll get clean now, I swear.

                        I mean, this is the end of the 
                        tunnel, right? You got us out! And 
                        you got the take!

           Waikiki nods -- taps his BREAST POCKET.

                                 HONOLULU (CONT’D)
                             (dropping his voice)
                        And did you get any heat in?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        No, ‘cos I told you -- that’s 
                        against the rules.

                                 HONOLULU
                        Come on, man! I asked you to bring 
                        some... you gotta look after me!

           Waikiki dry-washes his face. Then, reluctantly -- 

           -- he pulls out a white paper CREDIT CARD. 

                                 WAIKIKI
                        This do?

                                 HONOLULU
                             (relieved)
                        Ah, there he is. Sherman Atkins, 
                        always the smartest guy in the 
                        room.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        ‘Cos I’m always in a fucking room 
                        with you. 
                             (shaking his head)
                        This is the last time, Lev. And the 
                        last time I say “the last time”.
                             (getting up)
                        I need some coffee.

           Waikiki exits, leaving his brother alone. The door SLAMS 
           SHUT, and the three bolts SLAM into place.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - NIGHT

           ON HER HOLO-SCREENS:

           The nurse looks at MORGAN, huddled in one doorway -- 

           -- then back to Ilya, pacing around the building towards her.

                        THE Orian Franklin?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        The one blew up a school bus in 
                        Watts to make a point to the Crips? 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Yup.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        The one splashed the Deputy Major 
                        of Beverly Hills last Christmas?

                                 THE NURSE
                        I mean, he didn’t do it himself-

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        The Orian Franklin who FUNDS this 
                        place?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Yeah. 
                             (then)
                        Yeah, that’s the one.

           The nurse clicks through the cameras -- Ilya is checking out 
           DOOR #2 now. The others will be next...

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You need to go get that girl.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Serio? No fuckin’ way.

                                 THE NURSE
                        That blatnoy’s all over our 
                        building. If he finds her out there-

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        -it ain’t NOTHING on what happens 
                        if he finds her in HERE! I mean, 
                        for thirty years you never let a 
                        single person in wasn’t a member! 
                        Never broke the rules, and it kept 
                        this place safe that whole time. So 
                        why pick TONIGHT?

           The nurse looks at MORGAN THE COP’S eyes. Pleading to camera.
                                 THE NURSE
                        Thirty-two. It’s been thirty-two 
                        years.

           Then -- the lights SHORT OUT, and the image disappears.

           EXT. ROOF - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           In front of Everest, the FUSE BOX is on fire. Everest 
           scrambles for a FIRE EXTINGUISHER, coats the fire.

                                 EVEREST

                        Big guy, if we go dark we’re DEAD 
                        MEAT. We’ll lose Honolulu. And 
                        Niagara’s gonna need juice too.

                        Okay, there’s some stuff I can do -- 
                        re-route the G9s, hotwire the grid. 
                        Gimme a little time. 

                                 THE NURSE (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        You’re a doll.

                                 EVEREST
                        Yeah I am. Just forget about the 
                        cop, will you? 

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse stares long and hard at where the holo-screen used 
           to be. She picks up the bottle of Rye --

                                 THE NURSE
                        Forget about the cop, he says.

           -- next to the PHOTO from earlier (which we still don’t see). 

           The nurse stares at it, takes a big swig and some pills -- 

           -- then pulls the folded photograph OUT OF ITS FRAME.

           Then, the nurse POCKETS both the bottle and the picture. 
           Finally, she pick up her doctor’s bag, her hands shaking --

           -- and exits with purpose.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Nice limps into the what used to be a BILLIARDS ROOM -- all 
           dusty leather and oil paintings. Nowadays, as advertised: 
           there’s also a big fucking TV in the corner.

           watching TV in an armchair. 

           He smirks lasciviously.

                        I said “Nice”.

           BOOM. 

           There’s an explosion outside, and Acapulco visibly JUMPS.

                        and I’m a 20-ounce sirloin. You’re 
                        a housemaid with a handgun, but I

           In the corner, the coffee pot makes a noise as it sits back 
           on its holder -- and both of them turn to see WAIKIKI.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Oh hey. Don’t mind me.

                        Well, “bro”... since you ask. What 
                        I want is a vacation. And to get 
                        out of this place. A few less 
                        bullet holes would be nice. Some 
                        decent scotch. And my ex-wife to 
                        remarry, ‘cos it wasn’t her fault 
                        and she’s a sweet girl, you know? 
                        But right now... right now all I 
                        want is a hot cup of coffee.
                             (turning to Nice, aside)
                        How’re you doing, “Nice”?

           He hands Nice a second COFFEE CUP, and she smiles.

                                 NICE
                        Hello “Waikiki”. I thought you were 
                        done?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Apparently not.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Oh, you know each other, huh? You a 
                        knight in shiny armor, bro, gonna 
                        protect her honor or some shit?

           Waikiki and Nice look at each other for a beat -- then both 
           BURST into laughter.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Oh, man. If you knew this lady -- 
                        knew what she could do to you with 
                        just that coffee mug? -- you would 
                        sit your ass down and keep yourself 
                        to yourself. Because I’m a 
                        professional -- but this lady is 
                        THE BUSINESS.

                                 NICE
                        À votre bon cœur, Sherman. 

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You got it. Now... this hot cup of 
                        coffee’s getting cold. And a cold 
                        cup of coffee ain’t on my list.
                             (then)
                        Play nice.

           Waikiki nods to Nice, then takes his coffee and exits.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Yeah, you run away, bro.
                                 WAIKIKI 
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Believe me, “bro”, if I could run 
                        away, I would’ve done it already.

           Acapulco turns back to Nice, who raises an eyebrow --  
           RATTLES her coffee mug at him pseudo-menacingly --

           -- then heads out into the corridor with a disdainful tut, as 
           Acapulco drops to his seat, WINCING at the pain.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        ...it’s official. The curfew has 
                        begun. As of now, the city of Los 
                        Angeles is on ProTec lockdown. 

           Acapulco pulls out a SMALL METAL BALL -- which he SQUEEZES. 

           CLICK. It suddenly transforms into a HOLOGRAPHIC CELLPHONE.

                                 BURBANK AERONAUTIC OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
                        Good evening, Burbank Aeronautic.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        This is Hampton Stone. I need a 
                        Sikorsky in downtown STAT.

                                 BURBANK AERONAUTIC OPERATOR
                        Downtown? Sir-

                                 ACAPULCO
                        I KNOW THERE’S A RIOT BUT I’M A 
                        PLATINUM MEMBER SO DO IT OKAY??

           ANGLE ON NICE

           Listening in, just outside the door -- and deeply intrigued.

                                 BURBANK AERONAUTIC OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Yes, sir. Sorry... I can have 
                        something within the hour.

           Nice checks her watch. Her eyes narrow. 

                                 NICE
                        Cela pourrait fonctionner.

           SUBTITLE: That could work.

           Then she looks at the coffee in her hand -- and SMILES.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - NIGHT

           The nurse is jumpy -- takes a swig from her Rye bottle as she 
           paces down the dimly-lit corridor, bag in SHAKING HAND.

           Suddenly, Waikiki appears from the TV room. 

           He sees the nurse and nods -- as she HIDES THE BOTTLE in her 
           cardigan.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Ah... how’s that patient?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Alive. Annoying. Standard.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I meant to say... you might want to 
                        let him know that his favorite 
                        hobby and a new liver ain’t gonna 
                        mix well. He’ll wanna ease up.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I’ll tell him. But you know how 
                        much he likes playing in traffic.
                             (then, concerned)
                        You okay? You’re breathing funny.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Just... I got a touch of asthma.

           BOOM

           Another explosion rocks the building. Waikiki frowns.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You sure you’re not worried? What 
                        if the gangs find us? Or the cops?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Son, I’ve got a bonesaw and a 
                        recurring coldsore my ex-husband 
                        gave me from sleeping with some 
                        hairdresser. The only thing worries 
                        me is what I’ll do to anyone who 
                        even TRIES to break into my 
                        hospital.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Huh. Well... okay then. 

           He nods respectfully, heads towards the BAR AREA.
           The nurse fills her lungs -- takes a last SWIG OF RYE -- puts 
           the bottle down quickly behind an old vase -- 

           INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           -- then quickly enters the MAINTENANCE DOOR, which is it 
           turns out is actually:

           A SECRET ELEVATOR

           The nurse steps inside the old-fashioned cage, and it SWAYS 
           and BUCKLES queasily -- clearly old and seldom-used.

           The nurse punches a button, and the elevator starts moving. 
           She holds out a hand. The shaking has gotten worse.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (to herself)
                        Okay, girl. You can do this.

           She quickly pulls headphones out of her pocket, presses PLAY.

           MUSIC KICKS IN FOR THE WHOLE SEQUENCE:

                             “California Soul” by Marlena Shaw

           The nurse starts nodding her head. Humming intently. We 
           follow the elevator down into --

           INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           -- an industrial tunnel. The nurse uses her clipboard to 
           navigate the system that keeps The Artemis secret: 

           A SERIES OF TUNNELS extending out from the basement of the 
           hotel to different blocks around Downtown.

           The nurse is hyperventilating now as she paces onwards, the 
           song BUILDING in her ears.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UNDERGROUND EXIT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Then -- we see BACK DOOR #4 up ahead. A gurney, first-aid 
           kit, blankets sit by the entrance, ready for use.

           The nurse is sweating, her breathing heavy. Her music is 
           still playing LOUD, as she tries to give herself confidence.

           She pulls out a PILL POT, throws some beta-blockers back. 
           Then, she grits her teeth, and PULLS OPEN THE DOOR to reveal:

           EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 

           A dark alleyway, festering with trash and detritus -- 

           -- with the RED MIST and VIOLENCE of the riot visible in the 
           distance. A Bosch-ian hell creeping closer.

           And there, a few feet away in a dark pool of blood --

           SERGEANT MORGAN DANIELS (40). Barely conscious. 

           The nurse pauses -- 

           -- then RIPS out her earphones, and the SONG ENDS ABRUPTLY. 
           The roar of diegetic sound crashes back in.

           IN THE NURSE’S POV:

           we see the doorway. But she just can’t cross the threshold. 
           Can’t even make her feet work to take her outside.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Shit.
                             (then)
                        Hey, you! You... hear me?

           The cop’s eyes open briefly. The Nurse quickly pulls THE 
           PHOTO from her cardigan pocket.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        See... this? Who... is it?

                                 MORGAN
                             (confused)
                        I... ugh...

                                 THE NURSE
                        COME ON. What’s... his name?

                                 MORGAN
                             (squinting)
                        Beau. It’s... Beau.

           The nurse almost gasps. She closes her eyes.

           It’s a name she hasn’t heard for a very long time. 

           BANG BANG

           -- out of nowhere, the nurse is BROUGHT BACK by the gunshots. 
           She looks up to see TWO GANG MEMBERS running towards them.
                                 RICARDO
                        Hey, old lady!

           The nurse desperately GRABS the blanket off the gurney next 
           to her in the tunnel --

           -- then throws it over Morgan’s COP UNIFORM as TARIQ (18) and 
           RICARDO (16) approach.

                                 RICARDO (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck going on here?

                                 THE NURSE
                        This girl... she’s hurt.

                                 TARIQ
                        Sounds like you caught some of that 
                        tear gas shit. They comin’ this 
                        way, you gotta-

                                 RICARDO
                        Woah. Wait up.

           Ricardo has seen the DOCTOR’S BAG. 

           The nurse spots him clock it, leaps for the bag -- but she’s 
           TOO LATE. He picks it up and his eyes WIDEN.

                                 RICARDO (CONT’D)
                        Like a CVS in here. 

                                 TARIQ
                        Give it back to her-

                                 RICARDO
                        We got a WHOLE lot of niggas 
                        hurtin’, son. An’ I don’t see this 
                        lady helping them.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (trying to stand)
                        I’m not on... anyone’s side. 
                        What’d’you... need?

           Ricardo’s bravado DROPS for a beat -- 

                                 RICARDO
                        Serious?

           The nurse nods.

           Ricardo suddenly looks like a little kid, as he lifts up his 
           t-shirt -- to reveal a bloodied MESS underneath.
                                 RICARDO (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        I, like, got clipped.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (gesturing for the bag)
                        May I?
                             (Ricardo hands it over)
                        I got... something that’ll help. 

                                 RICARDO
                        Th-thanks... they ain’t letting 
                        ambulances-

           BANG

           A shot suddenly TAKES OUT Ricardo’s chest, and he slams to 
           the ground. The nurse and Tariq look around --

           -- to see THREE PROTEC RIOT SOLDIERS, weapons raised.

                                 PROTEC TEAM LEADER
                        You two! Face down, hands on heads! 

           Tariq doesn’t miss a beat -- and BOLTS down an alley. SHOTS 
           FIRE OUT, but he’s gone. The troopers advance on the nurse.

                                 PROTEC TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
                        You! I said on the ground NOW!
                             (checking the body)
                        Who is this? Did you see them kill 
                        her?

                                 THE NURSE
                        No. I’m just... trying to help-

                                 PROTEC TEAM LEADER
                        There’s a curfew. You’re breaking 
                        the law. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        I’m a... sixty-four year-old woman! 
                        You think... I’m gonna riot?

                                 PROTEC TEAM LEADER
                        This don’t add up. Get her to the 
                        truck.

                                 THE NURSE
                        No! I’ve got people to look after!

                                 PROTEC TEAM LEADER
                        She says one more word, cuff her.
                             (to the nurse)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PROTEC TEAM LEADER (CONT'D)
                        You hear that, lady? Time to shut 
                        your fucking mouth-

           SMASH

           A SHOPPING CART SWIPES THE TROOPERS OUT OF SHOT.

           PULL BACK to reveal EVEREST -- swinging the cart like a club.

                                 EVEREST
                        Show some respect.

           The Protec trooper, on the ground, raises his gun, but --

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        Nope.

           -- Everest upends the cart, SLAMS the front down onto his 
           helmeted face, twice, really hard. He’s not getting up soon.

           As the PROTEC TEAM LEADER aims his weapon, Everest FLIPS the 
           cart -- and CRASHES it on top of him. His head and shoulders 
           are TRAPPED INSIDE the upside-down cart. Everest ROARS --

           -- and PUSHES the cart backwards into the alley wall. The 
           Team Leader SLAMS against the wall, ricochets forwards --

           -- then his face SMASHES into the front inside of the cart’s 
           metal. He drops to the ground, reeling.

           Everest casually DROPS THE CART on him, knocking him out.

                                 THE NURSE
                        E, I’m so-

                                 EVEREST
                        Inside. Now.

           INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Door #4 closes, and Everest throws Morgan onto a gurney.

           The nurse slumps to the floor, still finding it hard to 
           breathe, as Everest double bolts the door, then checks 
           through the observation panel that they weren’t seen. 

                                 EVEREST
                        Okay... now you say it.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I’m sorry.
                                 EVEREST
                        You broke the rules.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I had my reasons, okay big man? 
                        Please, just help me up-

                                 EVEREST
                        Looks like you need to sit-

                                 THE NURSE
                        She’s bleeding out. Help me up.

           A reluctant Everest lifts the nurse, and she holds onto the 
           gurney gingerly -- then starts wheeling it to the elevator.

                                 EVEREST
                        Wait, we’re taking her inside? 
                        She’s a COP-

                                 THE NURSE
                        She’s a patient. With, I’m 
                        guessing, a ruptured spleen, maybe 
                        some bone in the lungs. 
                        Inhalation’s real tetchy too.
                             (then)
                        Come on.

           Everest follows her reluctantly into the BACK-DOOR ELEVATOR --

           INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           -- and then he hits the button. Creaky hydraulics kick in.

                                 EVEREST
                             (tutting)
                        This thing on its last legs.

           There’s a beat of silence, then:

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        So. You tried to go outside for 
                        her. 

           The nurse nods.

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        How long’s it been?

           The nurse shrugs.

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cos I make it two years.
                                 THE NURSE
                        Little longer maybe.

                                 EVEREST
                        And how’d it work out?

           The nurse holds up a hand. Still shaking.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Couldn’t even get out the door.
                             (then)
                        It’s my own fault, you know? I let 
                        it get this far.

                                 EVEREST
                             (softer now)
                        So maybe this is a good thing. I 
                        keep telling you-

                                 THE NURSE
                        I’m old, sweetheart. It’s too late 
                        to change. Or too hard. 
                             (then)
                        I am what I am.

                                 EVEREST
                        I could help-

                                 THE NURSE
                        You do, babe. 
                             (smiling)
                        So long as you’re around to pick up 
                        the dry cleaning and swing by 
                        Famous Ed’s for a handle of Rye, 
                        why’d I ever need to leave?

                                 EVEREST
                        That ain’t what I meant.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I know.

           The elevator CRUNCHES to a halt -- as the nurse snaps to, 
           energized to be back in her haven.

                                 EVEREST
                        We AIN’T done on this.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Sure we are. 
                             (then)
                        Okay, here’s the plan. We get her 
                        to my room, fix her up, then get 
                        her straight back out of Dodge. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                        Or back into Dodge. Whatever. I 
                        don’t even care if she ever wakes 
                        up.

                                 EVEREST
                        How far out’s Niagara?

                                 THE NURSE
                        About twenty-five minutes.

                                 EVEREST
                        You can fix her that fast?

                                 THE NURSE
                        I have to.

                                 EVEREST
                        This... all this a big risk. If 
                        people find out we brought a cop in 
                        that’s the end of this place. We’ll 
                        never see another patient.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I know, babe.

                                 EVEREST
                        And if it’s Niagara finds out that 
                        we brought a cop in, it’s the end 
                        of us too. Meurto. No question. Not 
                        even I can stop that happening.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I know, babe.

           The nurse studies her clipboard -- a MAP of the building, 
           where everyone’s MEMBER CHIP SIGNALS show their positions.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Look, the chips say everyone’s 
                        where they should be. We’ve got a 
                        window. Let’s tango.

           Everest hesitates -- then helps her anyway.

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse and Everest push the gurney into the corridor, as 
           suddenly, Morgan REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS, and moans loudly.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (to Everest)
                        Sedative.
           Everest throws the nurse a Tranq pen, and she jabs her 
           patient’s neck -- then strokes her forehead soothingly --

           -- as ACAPULCO exits the TV room ahead.

                                 EVEREST
                        Shit.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Okay, into Honolulu. Now now now.

           Everest SWINGS the gurney into the Honolulu suite door --

           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           -- and in the darkness, the nurse and Everest wait nervously. 

           There’s a beat -- then we hear Honolulu’s DRUGGED-OUT SNORE.

                                 EVEREST
                             (sotto)
                        You got lucky.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Actually, I got a doctorate and a 
                        couple of medical degrees.
                             (holding up clipboard)
                        Heart-rate says handsome here’s 
                        unconscious, and heat sensors 
                        showed his brother’s in the bar.

           On the gurney, Morgan’s eyes open, truly confused...

                                 MORGAN
                        Mrs. Thomas?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Not for a long time. 
                             (smiling)
                        Hey, Morgan. How’s the folks?

           Morgan’s eyes MELT BACK into unconsciousness, as the pain 
           killers kick in. 

           The nurse turns, checks on Honolulu’s VITALS. Exhales softly.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        At least something’s going right 
                        tonight. Two more hours and this 
                        guy’s liver should be fully cooked.

                                 EVEREST
                        He the least of our problems.
                                 THE NURSE
                        They’re ALL our problems, babe. You 
                        know that. Now, grab the walking 
                        L.S., then do me a favor- 
                             (re: Morgan’s chest)
                        -squeeze down on her arterial 
                        valve, wouldya? She’s kind of-

           The nurse stares at the cops’s face. Triggering a memory.

           Then, out of nowhere, she loses her balance. 

                                 EVEREST
                        You okay? You need to rest?

                                 THE NURSE
                             (shaking it off)
                        What? No, not at all. What I need 
                        to do is work.

           And with that, they EXIT the Honolulu suite, pushing the 
           gurney and the WALKING LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE with them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OLD BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Waikiki sits at the old bar, drinking his coffee. The place 
           is themed like an OCEAN LINER, transporting its guests to the 
           various locations that make up each penthouse suite.

           He stares at a FOUNTAIN PEN in his hand; turning it in his 
           fingers -- creating a sound like a tiny rain stick.

                                 NICE (O.S.)
                        “Waikiki”.

           Waikiki looks up to see Nice at the door.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        “Nice”. You choose that name 
                        yourself?

                                 NICE
                        The nurse. Évidemment. 

           Nice sits down at the bar -- then speculatively puts a HALF-
           DRUNK BOTTLE OF RYE between them.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        I found this in the corridor. I 
                        think that old lady, you know-
           She mimes “likes a drink”. Then -- Nice checks her watch.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        I have a little time. You?

           Waikiki smiles, empties his coffee cup and passes it to Nice, 
           who fills it with whiskey -- then fills her own cup too.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Pleasant surprise, seeing you here. 
                        It’s been, what, 3 years? 

                                 NICE
                        That Dark Room in D.C...

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Baron House.

                                 NICE
                        What a shithole.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You think everywhere’s a shithole.

                                 NICE
                        Not true. Have you been to The 
                        Dressler in Berlin? 

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You know I only work domestic.

                                 NICE
                        You need to travel more. It’s the 
                        most luxurious D.R. you’ve ever 
                        seen. I mean, the towels-

           She lifts her hand, revealing a partially-missing digit.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        -almost worth losing a finger for.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Don’t be dramatic. You got a good 
                        half a finger left there. Maybe 
                        even two-thirds. 

           Nice smiles, as Waikiki nods to the TWENTY SMALL INCISIONS 
           that decorate her wrist.

                                 WAIKIKI (CONT’D)
                        Been working all over, huh?
                                 NICE
                             (with a shrug)
                        Not everyone trusts a woman to do 
                        the work, so I have to travel. Take 
                        what I can. Even jobs I should not.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        That’s how you wound up here?

           Nice exhales tetchily -- then picks up WAIKIKI’S PEN from the 
           bar. She draws on the napkin quickly --

                                 NICE
                        One mark, six guards. That was the 
                        intel. But I get there and then-

           She holds up the napkin -- a BIRD’S EYE VIEW of the room with 
           TWENTY markers for assailants, the target etc.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        That’s a three-person job minimum. 
                        Why’d you go in alone?

                                 NICE
                        My fault. I thought if I pull this 
                        off, I cash out. Quit the life, do 
                        some consultancy, see my kid more-

                                 WAIKIKI
                        How is she?

                                 NICE
                        Bigger. Living with her grandmere. 
                        Sings all the time, apparently.
                             (then)
                        I miss her.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Must get lonely out there.

                                 NICE
                        Sure. But... perhaps better than 
                        relying on other people.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Oh yeah.
                             (then)
                        So wait... did you complete?

           Nice looks at him. Thinks about telling him the truth. But 
           her pride, and her plans, mean that she can’t. So she lies.

                                 NICE
                        Of course. And your job?
                                 WAIKIKI
                        I think, yeah... we got enough. To 
                        cash out, I mean.

                                 NICE
                             (smiling)
                        Santé, Waikiki. Congratulations.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You too, Nice. Wow. Big moment.

           They CLINK and DRINK, holding eye contact --

           -- as in the background, THE NURSE and EVEREST see their 
           moment, and speed past towards the Los Angeles suite.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The door SMASHES open, and they rush Morgan inside. Everest 
           starts up the LIFE SUPPORT, RAMS a feed into Morgan’s arm.

           The nurse’s clipboard BLEEPS, and she looks at DOOR #4. Ilya 
           reaches it -- pistol in hand, oblivious to the cop that was 
           lying there not ten minutes earlier.

           The nurse breathes deeply -- they did it.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Okay, Everest. We’ve got twenty 
                        minutes, tops.
                             (then)
                        Microwave scalpel, set to 2 inches 
                        please. Chop, chop.

           Everest hands the nurse a SMALL MEDICAL WAND. She picks up a 
           piece of paper, HOLDS IT an inch from the wand -- nothing. 

           But as she moves it out to TWO INCHES, the paper IGNITES.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Aaaaand we’re off.

           As she goes in to OPERATE, a SIREN sounds outside.

           ON THE TV SCREEN: 

           an M1A1 Abrams TANK rolls over the 6th Street Bridge. The 
           ticker reads: “MARTIAL LAW IN FULL EFFECT”.
                                 EVEREST
                        Looks like they bringing in tanks 
                        and shit now.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (operating)
                        So drop the blast shields, then get 
                        me some more suction. This kid’s 
                        belly’s like the goddamn Campbell 
                        Soup factory and I’m real fond of 
                        this Persian rug...

           Everest HITS SOME BUTTONS on the nurse’s clipboard -- 

           VOOOOM

           -- and METAL PLATES slide down behind the windows. He rushes 
           to the nurse’s aid, grabbing the suction catheter as he goes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OLD BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT

           VOOOOM

           Waikiki and Nice’s mugs VIBRATE as the metal plates descend. 
           Nice looks up from DOODLING on her napkin...

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I guess we’re here for the night. 

           He pours them another. Nice hesitates -- 

                                 WAIKIKI (CONT’D)
                        C’mon -- Percocet and bourbon? It’s 
                        your favorite.

                                 NICE
                        L’apéro des champions.

           She glances at her watch. Grimaces... then looks up at him.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, one more. Vite.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        So... my Mom always said never ask 
                        a lady her age or her score. But 
                        when do you collect?

                                 NICE
                        Ah... tomorrow. In Michigan.
                                 WAIKIKI
                        Detroit mafia, huh? So the target 
                        was K-Town Triads? Or those 
                        Russians... the Tsars? I hear 
                        they’re taking over L.A. like they 
                        did in London.

                                 NICE
                             (miming a locked mouth)
                        I cannot say, Sherman. Non-
                        Disclosure Agreement.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Oooh -- wet work’s so fancy.

                                 NICE
                        No, just corporate. And 
                        increasingly unpleasant.

           Nice pulls a slim vintage wallet out her pocket -- opens it 
           to reveal a TINY RECEIVER.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        See, that thing? That’s fancy.

                                 NICE
                        They paid an extra three hundred 
                        thousand for me to wear this. To 
                        look into the target’s eyes while I 
                        slit his throat, and record it so 
                        they can watch it back later.
                             (then)
                        “Take your time” they said. “Enjoy 
                        it” they said.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Jesus. That is unpleasant.

                                 NICE
                        That’s why I need to get out.

           FROM OUTSIDE: we hear an AIR-RAID-STYLE SIREN BLARE.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Those kids... they’re tearing this 
                        goddamn city apart.

                                 NICE
                        But you are safe here, no?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Maybe. Or maybe I’m trapped. 
                        Depends how you look it.
                                 NICE
                        So do you have an exit strategy?

           Waikiki pulls a GARAGE CLICKER type-device from his pocket.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I mean, sure. Nothing fancy. I just 
                        stashed a fake-out nearby, set up 
                        like it’s trashed so nobody gets 
                        sticky with it. Soon as I can move 
                        Lev, we’re there.

                                 NICE
                             (with admiration)
                        You think things through. That’s 
                        the difference between you and me.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Getting out’s always tougher than 
                        getting in, right?
                             (then, slowly)
                        Hey, ah, listen... I lost my safe 
                        man tonight. And the car fits four 
                        people. So, y’know... 

                                 NICE
                        What?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I mean, job crossover, that’s 
                        asking for trouble. But seeing as 
                        we’re both getting out anyway... 
                        there’s a place if you want it.

                                 NICE
                             (genuinely touched)
                        That’s... very kind of you.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Um... no big deal. Corner of 5th 
                        and Stanford, just in case.

                                 NICE
                        Merci, Sherman. But I too have a 
                        plan. For once.

           Nice leans in -- holds his shoulders -- kisses him gently on 
           both cheeks. A tiny beat of something close to romance. 

           Then -- BEEP BEEP -- Nice’s WATCH goes off.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        Merde. I... need a cigarette.
           She gets up to leave urgently, heads for the door.

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (surprised)
                        You set your alarm to tell you when 
                        you need a smoke? That’s so fuckin’ 
                        French.

                                 NICE
                             (turning back for a beat)
                        Look, I may have to leave before 
                        you. If so... au revoir, Sherman.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Um, okay. Sure. See you around.
                             (then)
                        Wait. We’re out the game. Maybe... 
                        we won’t see each other around?

           She TAPS her breast pocket, where her heart is.

                                 NICE
                        That would be a shame.

           She plucks the CIGARETTE from behind her ear, and exits.

           Waikiki looks after her, truly confused. But then --

           -- he feels something in his own breast pocket. Sees that 
           Nice has put the NAPKIN in there when they embraced.

           He opens it up, sees the map of the HIT. Then he flips it 
           over -- to see a message written in Nice’s handwriting:

                                 You should travel more...

                                    Cafe Des Artistes
                                   231 Avenue Souvenirs
                                  Saint-Rémy-de-Provence
                                          FRANCE

           Waikiki frowns to himself. He tucks the napkin back in his 
           pocket -- then returns to his whiskey.

           Maybe things are going to be okay.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           CRUNCH
           The nurse puts a final staple into Morgan’s BELLY, and then 
           stands back from the table, shattered now.

                                 THE NURSE
                        What a mess. They stomped on her 
                        like they were making Merlot.

                                 EVEREST
                        She’s a cop. In a riot-

                                 THE NURSE
                        She’s community liaison. It’s her 
                        job to be out there.

                                 EVEREST
                        Oh. That how she knew about us? 

                                 THE NURSE
                        I don’t know. Maybe she heard 
                        something, put it together...
                             (hesitant)
                        I know her from back in the day. 

                                 EVEREST
                        The day before this place?

           Morgan COUGHS and her eyes open, coming to finally.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Easy, girl.

                                 MORGAN
                        You... you helped me?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Sure. It’s kind of what I do.

                                 MORGAN
                             (squinting)
                        This place...

                                 THE NURSE
                        What’s that?

                                 MORGAN
                        Thought it... was a myth.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Good. ‘Cos once we get you back 
                        outside, that’s exactly what you’re 
                        gonna think all over again.

           Morgan looks around at all the hi-tech equipment, as the 
           nurse FINISHES CLEANING UP around her stitches.
                                 MORGAN
                        All this... it’s for... criminals?

                                 THE NURSE
                        The ones who can afford it, yeah.

                                 MORGAN
                             (genuine, fuzzy)
                        Why?

                                 THE NURSE
                             (taken aback)
                        Um, well, there’s plenty people out 
                        there to patch up the good guys. 
                        Someone has to look after the rest.

                                 MORGAN
                        But... why?

           The nurse stares at her, like it’s a simple question she 
           can’t actually answer: why DOES she fix these people?

                                 THE NURSE
                        It’s a long story. Listen, we don’t 
                        have time to catch up. I’m gonna 
                        let these staples take hold, then 
                        we’ll get you out of here... but 
                        you’re going to have to be REAL 
                        careful. And to be clear: I just 
                        fixed the cute gal who ran a 
                        lemonade stand and came for 
                        sleepovers at my house. I did NOT 
                        fix a cop. Because I don’t do that. 
                        Capish?

                                 MORGAN
                        I... understand.
                             (then)
                        I’m sorry... about everything.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (cutting her off)
                        We all were. That’s just how it 
                        goes. I don’t want to go into it-
                             (then)
                        I gotta keep running.

           The nurse picks up her bag, checks her clipboard, then turns 
           matter-of-factly to Everest. 

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Niagara’s five minutes out -- I 
                        need to prep that room. Wait for my 
                        cue, then get her out pronto.
                                 EVEREST
                        Yes, nurse.

           Then she sweeps out of the room, closing the door behind her.

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse steps into the corridor, fighting something back. 

           Hyperventilating, like when she goes outside. She shakes her 
           head, puts in her HEADPHONES. Presses PLAY.

           HER MUSIC KICKS IN:

                              “One Way Glass” by Manfred Mann

           She STRIDES towards the lobby, focused on HER ROUTINE:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOBBY - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           First, the nurse grabs the LAST KEY from the hotel room hooks 
           -- the one that reads “Niagara”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE UP of the hotel suite door. The nurse unlocks it -- and 
           three sets of heavy steel bars shoot back into the frame.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “NIAGARA” SUITE - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Then she lets herself into the final suite -- the magnificent 
           fresco behind her is a faded version of a VAST WATERFALL.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “NIAGARA” BATHROOM - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Then she places a new toothbrush in the holder, next to a 
           fresh pot of Percocet. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. “NIAGARA” SUITE - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The nurse plumps a pillow, busies herself. But then -- 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Shit. C’mon, Jeanie... not now.

           She can’t help it.

           The nurse sits down hard on the bed, like she’s just realized 
           that she’s incredibly tired.

           Then, almost against her own will, she slowly takes the 
           CRUMPLED PHOTOGRAPH out of her pocket. 

           We finally see it:

           The nurse, 35 years ago. She’s crouched next to a 10-year-old 
           boy. Their arms are around each other, SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. 
           Smiling in the L.A. dawn. 

           VOOOOM

           Metal blast shields go down around the room’s windows, but 
           the nurse barely notices. 

           She stares at her son a while longer, framed by the backdrop 
           of the huge waterfall behind her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF - HOTEL - NIGHT

           KSSSSK

           CLOSE UP on Nice, finally taking a DRAG of her cigarette, as 
           she checks her watch impatiently.

           Next to her is the PANEL of the FUSE BOX that the CABLES led 
           to -- which has clearly been KICKED OPEN.

           And behind her is the FULL DEVASTATION the riots are wreaking 
           on Downtown. Buildings burn. Helicopter searchlights...

                                 ACAPULCO (O.S.)
                        Oh, GREAT.

           Nice turns to see a surly-looking ACAPULCO. She frowns -- and 
           steps in front of the BUST-OPEN ELECTRICAL PANEL.

                                 NICE
                        You’re on my roof.
                                 ACAPULCO
                        Whatever. I just wanna get out of 
                        here.

           He holds up his CELL-PHONE -- and we see the HOLOGRAPHIC MAP, 
           with a small HELICOPTER ICON heading across the city to DTLA.

                                 NICE
                        Your helicopter is early.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        That’s what happens when you’ve got 
                        a platinum card. 
                             (then)
                        How’d you know about the chopper?

                                 NICE
                        You’re American. You speak too 
                        loud.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Yeah, yeah. You know, baby girl, if 
                        you’d been even a TEENSY bit nicer, 
                        I might be offering you a ride out 
                        of here right now.

                                 NICE
                        That’s funny. You see, I wasn’t 
                        going to ask your permission.
                             (sighing)
                        The timing is all wrong now anyway.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        The fuck does that mean?

           Nice shrugs, and throws her cigarette off the edge -- then 
           SPOTS SOMETHING BELOW that makes her stop in her tracks.

           A CORTEGE of black SUVs parking up down the street.

           Nice looks at her watch, and nods appreciatively.

                                 NICE
                        Bon. At least someone is on time.

           Acapulco looks down, and they both stare and the procession.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        What’s THIS shit now?

                                 NICE
                        Voilà... comment il se termine.
           SUBTITLE: This... is how it ends.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “NIAGARA SUITE” - HOTEL - NIGHT

           BEEP BEEP BEEP

           Suddenly, the nurse’s clipboard rings an alert. She sits up 
           and looks at the CCTV feed.

           ON THE CLIPBOARD SCREEN:

           Ilya and SEVERAL HENCHMEN pile in through Door #1, make their 
           way to the central elevators. Carrying an unseen figure...

           The nurse stuffs the photograph back into her pocket, picks 
           up her doctor’s bag, addressing her WALKIE-TALKIE urgently:

                                 THE NURSE
                        Niagara’s here.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Finally. What we expecting? 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Code Red. Message I’ve got suggests 
                        there’s a lotta blood.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Ain’t there always?

                                 THE NURSE
                        I didn’t want to burst their 
                        bubble, make ‘em think they weren’t 
                        special. They’re on the way up... 
                        the moment we check Niagara in, get 
                        that gal out of here, will ya?

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        My pleasure.

                                 THE NURSE
                        And make sure those staples are 
                        bound and protected -- she’s right 
                        on the edge. 

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Yes nurse.

           She clicks off, then stands and looks at herself in the 
           mirror. Game face back on.
           Then the nurse picks up her bag, exits the room. Relieved, 
           clearly, to have the life-long distraction of her work.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “LOS ANGELES” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Everest looks down at Morgan, who STIRS on the gurney -- and 
           we see that she’s wearing a PLASTIC CASE around her torso.

           The orderly INJECTS her with something blue.

                                 EVEREST
                        Time to go.

                                 MORGAN
                        Go where?

                                 EVEREST
                        Back to the real world. Gotta get 
                        you juiced up on adrenal and a 
                        little amp so we can keep your 
                        system working-

                                 MORGAN
                        Wait, how’m I gonna explain 
                        amphetamine... to my Lieutenant?

                                 EVEREST
                        The hell do I care? Don’t even know 
                        why she let you in here.

                                 MORGAN
                        I... I knew her kid. You know what 
                        happened to him, right?

                                 EVEREST
                             (disinterested)
                        Nope.

                                 MORGAN
                        She never even mentioned him?

           Everest’s eyes narrow, and he drops his face down to 
           Morgan’s. Speaking with gravity now.

                                 EVEREST
                        Lady, this place got rules -- and 
                        they all about secrets. How you got 
                        here. How I did. The nurse too. The 
                        rules keep the outside world 
                        outside. That’s how it works.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVEREST (CONT'D)
                        So the question I got is can YOU 
                        keep a secret?

                                 MORGAN
                        Of course-

                                 EVEREST
                        You sure, “sergeant”? I mean, 
                        there’s a big promotion in the 
                        information you holding now- 

                                 MORGAN
                        I wouldn’t do that... to her. 

           Everest looks at her -- then nods.

                                 EVEREST
                        Good answer.
                             (then)
                        Check out time.

           And with that, Everest hoists Morgan onto a WHEELCHAIR.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Nice and Acapulco both look over the edge of the roof, down 
           at the BLACK SUVs. 

                                 ACAPULCO
                        That’s a hotel entrance, right? 
                        Must be someone important.

                                 NICE
                        It is.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        And how would you know?

                                 NICE
                        Because I only kill important 
                        people.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Wait... this guy was your target?
                             (grinning)
                        You must be kind of shitty at your 
                        job, sweetheart. I mean, it looks 
                        like he has a LOT of people, maybe 
                        too much for one little skank...

           Nice stands up. 
                                 NICE
                        You are right. He had more security 
                        than I anticipated. So... I 
                        improvised.
                             (turning to face him)
                        You see, none of his “people” are 
                        members. Just him. Tu comprends?

           Acapulco looks alarmed, as what she’s saying dawns on him:

                                 ACAPULCO
                        You put your fucking target here-?

                                 NICE
                             (smiling)
                        Oui. Tu comprends.

           SMASH

           Nice suddenly GRABS the back of his hair -- 

           -- KICKS his LEGS out from under him --

           -- then SLAMS Acapulco’s head down onto the edge of the 
           building, KNOCKING him unconscious.

           She stares at him on the ground with some satisfaction. Then 
           Nice stands up -- and turns her attention to THE FUSE BOX.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR RECEPTION - HOTEL - NIGHT

           THE NURSE 

           stands patiently at the elevators, like so many times before. 
           Clipboard, doctor’s bag... safe behind her hi-tech cage.

           It’s where she seems her calmest.

           7, 8, 9, 10... DING

           CRASH

           Pandemonium erupts. The gilded doors SLAM OPEN and TWENTY MEN 
           pile out of both elevators.

           The Russian mob -- THE TSARS -- are in black TRACKSUITS, with 
           ILYA at the front, and a figure hidden in the throng.
                                 THE NURSE
                        You know, guys, those elevators say 
                        6 people maximum. That’s 
                        regulation. You’re killing me here.

                                 ILYA
                        OPEN THE GATES!

           They pour down the corridor through the METAL ARCH. The white 
           light scans them -- and an ALARM EXPLODES INTO LIFE.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Rules say no weapons.

                                 ILYA
                        We leave guns in lobby-

                                 THE NURSE
                        -but I’m talking about the cutlery.

           ON THE CLIPBOARD SCREEN:

           We see the x-ray -- the mobsters are carrying an array of 
           knives decorated with Russian prison runes.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Pretty.

                                 ILYA
                        Those we keep. Traditional.

                                 THE NURSE
                        And I told you: that’s against the 
                        rules.

                                 ILYA
                        Let. Us. In. Or I will KILL you 
                        RIGHT NOW...

                                 THE NURSE
                        You ain’t the sharpest katana in 
                        the dojo, are you pal? If you kill 
                        me... who’s gonna fix him?

           The guards part to reveal ORIAN FRANKLIN aka NIAGARA (68). 

           Thick moustache and a pair of spectacles with one eye-glass 
           shattered. Balancing on crutches with a cut around his neck.

                                 NIAGARA
                        Ilya! Tupoy vlagalishche!
                             (then, to the nurse)
                        I apologize, Jean.
                                 THE NURSE
                        Nobody calls me that anymore.
                             (referring to Ilya)
                        Hey junior, do your daddy a favor 
                        and swipe him in.

           She indicates the WALL where the PALM SCANNING DEVICE pops 
           out. Niagara gestures to Ilya to help swipe his wrist. 

           Bleep.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Wasn’t so hard now, was it?

           She pulls out that LARGE METAL KEY, opens the gate, and KICKS 
           OUT a gurney. Niagara’s men hoist Niagara onto the stretcher.

           As she pulls in the patient, Ilya and gang surge forward --

           WOOP-WOOP-WOOP

           -- triggering an ALARM around the building.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Waikiki stares at his napkin, pondering a future that might 
           include this “Cafe Des Artistes”. 

           He pulls out his pen, and underlines the address:

                                   231 Avenue Souvenirs

           Waikiki smiles -- then, decisively, he twists the pen in 
           various directions, like a tiny safe. It CLICKS OPEN. 

           Inside are 8 SMALL DIAMONDS. 

           Waikiki nods, satisfied. They’re all still there...

           WOOP-WOOP-WOOP

           Suddenly, he’s startled out of his reverie by the ALARM. He 
           pockets both napkin and safe-pen, and frowns.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR RECEPTION - HOTEL - NIGHT

           The nurse TUTS, shakes her head at the noise:
                                 THE NURSE
                        Smart move, Charm School. Draw some 
                        more attention to us why don’t you?

           She taps something on her clipboard, and the siren stops. 

                                 ILYA
                        Listen to me-

                                 THE NURSE
                        You listen to ME. Visiting hours 
                        are “never”. You and the other 
                        Muppet babies need to get the hell 
                        out my hospital and go play Eye Spy 
                        A Riot for a while. 

                                 ILYA
                        My father needs protection.

                                 THE NURSE
                        And if you’d remembered that sooner 
                        he might not be here-

                                 NIAGARA
                        DOSTATOCHNO!

           The nurse jumps as Niagara’s bloody hand LANDS HARD on her 
           wrist. He SQUEEZES around it, tightly.

                                 NIAGARA (CONT’D)
                        This... is my son. You will afford 
                        him... some respect.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Wow. Okay, fine. But he ain’t 
                        coming in. That’s fucking final.

                                 NIAGARA
                             (to Ilya)
                        Zhdi zdes'.

           SUBTITLE: Wait here.

                                 ILYA
                        No... chto yesli ty ne vernesh'sya?

           SUBTITLE: But... what if you don’t come back?

           Niagara looks to his son -- squeezes his hand. 

           Then he looks up at the nurse and SMILES. But his words, to 
           his son, betray his true intentions.
                                 NIAGARA
                        To delat' to. Chto vam nravitsya s 
                        nim.

           SUBTITLE: Then it’s yours. Do what you like with it.

           Ilya turns to the nurse -- and GRINS.

                                 ILYA
                        We stay out here, I think.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Good call. No hard feelings, junior 
                        -- I just don’t trust you around 
                        sharp objects. 
                             (indicating the men)
                        Tell your clowns they can wait by 
                        the elevators, and I’m sorry 
                        there’s no crayons.

           Ilya turns back to the others, barks some orders in Russian, 
           and the men sit themselves by the elevators restlessly.

           The nurse YANKS her hand out of Niagara’s grip -- then 
           administers a shot of painkiller to his neck.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, “Niagara”? I’ve got a thirty-
                        year hangover and a box full of 
                        laser scalpels. Maybe don’t take 
                        that tone with me again.

                                 NIAGARA
                        I am sorry. It has been... a trying 
                        day.

                                 THE NURSE
                        You and me both, pal.

           The nurse grabs the gurney, and she pushes him at full speed 
           towards the last remaining room in The Artemis --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “NIAGARA” SUITE - HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The nurse rams the gurney into place, sticks a MORPHINE DRIP 
           into Niagara’s arm, stands back and takes stock:

                                 THE NURSE
                        Okay, what have we got... suspected 
                        olecranon fractures. Hemothorax in 
                        the chest wall. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                        And the daddy of them all... the 
                        beginnings laryngeal nerve damage.

                                 NIAGARA
                        Finally getting my money’s worth, 
                        Jeanie.

           The nurse sets up the HEAVY-DUTY ANAESTHETIC machine.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I told you, no-one calls me that 
                        anymore. And I fixed you plenty in 
                        the old days. Now keep talking, so 
                        I know when the sleepy juice kicks 
                        in.

                                 NIAGARA
                             (staring around)
                        I remember this place from the old 
                        days... when you started... before 
                        you were a legend.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (prepping her equipment)
                        Stop it, I’m blushing.

                                 NIAGARA
                        What was this first... a free 
                        clinic? 

                                 THE NURSE
                        For Skid Row users, yeah.

                                 NIAGARA
                        And then the chefs.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (smiling)
                        You remember that, huh? Yeah, there 
                        was a gap in the market, and it 
                        paid for the clinic’s methadone. 
                        Chefs like drinking all night, and 
                        hospitals don’t like fixing ‘em up 
                        next morning. So a saline drip 
                        here, some anti-nauseants there, a 
                        vitamin B shot in the ass...
                             (then)
                        One conversation started it, and 
                        suddenly we were a thing.

                                 NIAGARA
                        And then... we came along.

           Beat. The nurse inhales deeply.
                                 THE NURSE
                        Yes you did.

                                 NIAGARA
                        You managed... amazing things. This 
                        place... is your legacy.

                                 THE NURSE
                        We both know The Artemis ain’t 
                        mine.

                                 NIAGARA
                             (getting drowsier)
                        The families... we were never the 
                        owners. Just... investors, Jean.

           The nurse turns to him. Her face is harder now:

                                 THE NURSE
                        Oh yeah? I could’ve clocked out 
                        anytime and you guys would’ve been 
                        totally cool, huh? Wish I’d known.
                             (then)
                        And stop calling me that.

           Niagara SMILES, a little sadistically, at her annoyance -- as 
           he finally falls unconscious from the injection.

           The nurse immediately grabs her WALKIE-TALKIE:

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Big guy? You’re good to move. Just 
                        stay clear of the Russian State 
                        Circus in the lobby.

                                 EVEREST (ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
                        Yes, nurse. Copy that.

           Then, the nurse LIGHTS UP a SCALPEL. Looks down at Niagara on 
           the table. Then she sighs -- and APPLIES it to his ribcage.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Nice works methodically on the ELECTRICAL GENERATOR -- as in 
           the background, Acapulco lies unconscious.

           First she removes the cast on her arm -- and SMASHES it open.

           Then Nice takes off her watch, pulls a HIDDEN CABLE from 
           inside it, and rewires it into the BATTERY of the cast.
           It looks a lot like a homemade bomb.

           Without hesitating, Nice finds her CONTACT LENS, puts it in 
           her eye, stares into a PANE OF PLASTIC on the generator. 

                                 NICE
                        Confirm sync. Secure line.

           The wallet in her pocket quietly purrs. 

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        04.56pst. Update, attention D2T:

                        I incapacitated the Mark to require 
                        medical assistance, then utilized 
                        the riot to beat him to a Dark Room 
                        where he is an investor. I am now 
                        in a position to finish the job. 
                        However... I will require a 30% 
                        raise in fees due to inconvenience 
                        and loss of future insurance. Plus 
                        guaranteed coverage of all medical, 
                        travel and legal costs. This is a 
                        rare window, gentlemen. And I am 
                        not fucking around. You have 30 
                        seconds to respond. 
                             (then)

           Her wallet BLEEPS. Nice waits. She looks at her eyes in the 
           reflection. Bloodshot. Ugh. 

           Then -- in her POV, we see a text flash up:

                              “EXTENSION OF TERMS CONFIRMED”

           Nice takes a moment to acknowledge this minor victory -- then 
           picks up her cast, and sets a countdown on her watch. 

           She thinks for a beat, then smiles as she chooses a number -- 

                                          “231” 

           The street number of the CAFE DES ARTISTES.

           BEEP BEEP. As it starts to countdown, so does Nice, out-loud:

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        Deux cent trente... deux cent vignt-

           SUBTITLE: 230... 229... 228...
           Then she leaves the watch-bomb behind, and quickly makes her 
           way towards the fire escape, counting down to herself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Waikiki appears from the bar, carrying his mug. He’s 
           inquisitive -- looking around for the source of the alarm.

           Then, he passes the ENTRANCE LOBBY -- and sees ILYA and his 
           men, listlessly inhabiting the area just beyond the cage. 

                                 ILYA
                        What the fuck you looking at?

           SUBTITLE: Second-rate piece of shit.

           Waikiki looks at him quizzically.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        My Russian’s a little rusty, but 
                        I’m pretty sure you just said “I 
                        love you.” Which is sweet.
                             (then)
                        Enjoy your stay, pal.

           Waikiki turns and walks away, around the corner -- wondering 
           what’s going on out there. He turns ANOTHER corner and --

           INT. BACK CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           -- that’s when he sees Everest, loading Morgan’s wheelchair 
           into the SECRET ELEVATOR of the Maintainance Room.

           There’s a moment where both men look at each other.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Busy night, huh?

                                 EVEREST
                        Just... reassigning rooms.

           Waikiki looks at the secret elevator, then back to Everest.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Uh-huh.
                             (then)
                        What was that alarm?
                                 EVEREST
                        Malfunction, I guess. Cops got the 
                        electrics all messed up.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Not the furious Russians at the 
                        gate, then?
                             (checking out Morgan)
                        Got caught in the crossfire, huh? 

           Morgan looks up. Eyes bloodshot. Heart heavy.

                                 MORGAN
                        Didn’t... we all?

           Waikiki takes a beat. Looks Morgan up and down, then nods -- 

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Yeah. Yeah, I guess we all did.
                             (then, to them both)
                        Good luck out there. I hope you get 
                        where you need to go.

           EVEREST looks concerned, but pushes past -- and HITS the 
           button. Waikiki watches them go, smiling warmly. 

           Then he turns, and walks into the Honolulu suite --

           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           -- where instantly, his face HARDENS. He walks calmly to the 
           back of the room, methodically BOOT UPS the 3-D printer.

                                 HONOLULU
                        Sherm? What’s up?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Don’t freak out. But there’s a cop 
                        in the building. And the Russian 
                        mob. Heck of a party.

                                 HONOLULU
                        What the FUCK? You sure-?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        About the cop? Well, I just met a 
                        lady in the corridor, all messed up 
                        like she’d pissed off a riot, 
                        wearing regularly-polished, 
                        L.A.P.D. issue, Glendale area 
                        Bedford-brand boots.
           Waikiki pulls out the PRINTING CARD that we saw early. He 
           slots it into the 3-D printer, and it begins to whir.

                                 HONOLULU
                        It coulda been a con? Maybe that 
                        was her schtick, for a job-?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Maybe. But if I was working a con 
                        where I’d gone to the trouble of 
                        knowing what boots cops wore, I’d 
                        sure as shit ditch those boots in a 
                        Dark Room, just in case someone 
                        else like me knew what they meant.

                                 HONOLULU
                        Not everyone’s as smart as you.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        That’s why there’s a lot of dead 
                        thieves. But not many rich ones.

                                 HONOLULU
                        Oh, MAN, this is all I need. I’m 
                        hurting really bad here.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Just another couple of hours-

                                 HONOLULU
                        No, it’s the oxy, Sherm. I’m going 
                        cold-

                                 HONOLULU
                        But maybe that’s stopping me 
                        getting better? A little fix might 
                        help... you could ask the nurse-?

                        NO.

                        But... I promise you this. What I 
                        am going to do is get you home. To

                        your face. Then you’re gonna take a

                             (pointing to the wall)
                        -somewhere like this, where you can

           Waikiki rises, removes the card from the 3-D printer. He 
           opens up the cover -- revealing a pristine white shape.

           Then -- she spots a COFFEE MUG. Raises an eyebrow.

           injuries. But they’re on the move now at least.

           Everest looks down at the cop, who stares back at him. She 
           looks broken -- and Everest softens a little.

                        see if you can do it without 
                        getting beat up so much, okay?

                        I’ll try, Mrs. Thomas.

           The nurse smiles. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        You always were a cutie.

           Behind her -- Niagara starts to stir.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go. Get out safe, okay?

           The nurse HANGS UP.

           Then she turns and PRICKS A FINGER on the DNA lock, as 
           Niagara wakes up slowly in the background.

                                 NIAGARA
                        This place... still sucking your 
                        blood, huh?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Only thing that keeps it ticking. 
                        How’re you feeling?

                                 NIAGARA
                        It... all hurts.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I had to go in quick. You got 
                        lucky. Need to slow down, man of 
                        your age.

                                 NIAGARA
                        That... hurts more.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Seriously, you’ve got a whole sea 
                        of galoofs out there. How’d someone 
                        get close enough to do this?

                                 NIAGARA
                             (shrug)
                        There was a girl. With a short 
                        dress. But also... a contract.
                             (then)
                        An old man’s vanity.
                                 THE NURSE
                        Hey, I get it, honey. The last time 
                        someone flirted with me was 1987.

                                 NIAGARA
                        And how is that son-of-a-bitch ex-
                        husband of yours?

                                 THE NURSE
                        You’re kidding, right? He’s not 
                        spoken to me since... everything. 
                             (then)
                        I heard he’s been through two more 
                        wives since me. Two. Both nurses.

                                 NIAGARA
                        What an asshole. You want me to 
                        take him out?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Nah. He lives in Florida. Life took 
                        him out enough already.
                             (then, checking)
                        Y’know, your blood pressure’s 
                        pretty high too. Think about 
                        Statins. And eat more almonds. And 
                        get shot less.

           Niagara looks down at his body. All fixed up.

           Then he sees the nurse’s tired reflection in a mirror.

           A wave of real regret passes across his face, as the nurse 
           sets up a GAS AND AIR MASK.

                                 NIAGARA
                        We should have let you go, Jeanie. 
                        But you were too good...

                                 THE NURSE
                        Drop it, okay-?

                        dead now. Just me left. As far as 
                        I’m concerned-

                                 THE NURSE
                        No.

           She turns around -- all joking aside now.
                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        It’s too late, Orian. I’d old. This 
                        is all I know.

                        You guys built the cage, but I let 
                        it go up around me. Maybe I even 
                        wanted it. Now I can’t get out even 
                        if I wanted to.
                             (then)

           WE HEAR HER COUNTDOWN AS WE CHECK IN WITH EACH RESIDENT:

           ACAPULCO groggily WAKES to a bleep from his phone. He looks 
           in the generator window -- sees his forehead dry with blood. 

           He looks out over the edge -- and sees a HELICOPTER flying in 
           the direction of The Artemis’s LIT SIGN. His pick-up point.

           Acapulco looks out at the incoming helicopter. He gets up, 
           starts to smooth down that shiny suit -- and GRINS.

           BEEEEP

           There’s a sound behind him, and he looks around -- to see 
           Nice’s cast JAMMED into the generator. But it’s too late.

           BOOOOOM

           The whole generator explodes, throwing Acapulco backwards, 
           taking out one leg of the hotel sign. 

           Above Acapulco, the lights of the hotel’s name instantly go 
           dark, as it crashes down around him. His face drops...

           ...as in the distance, his helicopter PEELS AWAY.

           The Honolulu suite suddenly darkens around Waikiki -- and the 
           picture of Hawaii on the wall instantly DISAPPEARS.

           BEEEEP. Honolulu flatlines, and Waikiki swings around, gets 
           to his brother’s side. Every piece of equipment here is DEAD.

           The equipment fizzes and pops, as the lights above cut out -- 
           and the nurse and Niagara are plunged into black.

                                 NIAGARA

           There’s no answer. Just STATIC.

           Out of nowhere, the nurse’s CLIPBOARD is flashing BLUE --

           RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS spring to apocalyptic life all around 
           the nurse. She scrambles towards the Honolulu Suite.

           The door to the Niagara suite slams shut --

           -- to reveal Nice behind it. 

           Unseen, she tries the door. It opens to a gentle pull -- the 
           bolts inside having been disabled by the power outage.

           Nice’s plan has worked.

           The nurse RUSHES into the room to see Waikiki desperately 
           trying to resuscitate his brother.

           She looks around the suite -- realizes that SOMETHING IS 
           MISSING. The nurse shakes her head in frustration --

           The nurse pushes Waikiki aside, CLIMBS up next to Honolulu, 
           starts BEATING on his chest.

           Honolulu turns, and looks in his brother’s eyes -- then FOLDS 
           BACK onto the bed. 

           His eyes go DEAD.

           Ilya looks up through the cage, but all he sees are dark 
           shapes in the background. He SLAMS his foot on the gate -- 

           -- and this time there’s no alarm.

           Ilya looks at it, realizes that the gate is now de-powered. 
           He turns to his men, and ROARS an order:

                                 ILYA (CONT’D)

           SUBTITLE: Take this down... NOW!

           INT. “HONOLULU” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           The nurse BANGS on Honolulu’s chest, shattered from the 
           effort now. Looking for any sign. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Come on, buddy. Come on.

           But there’s nothing. She slows down. Then stops. He’s gone.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit.

           The nurse slumps down next to Honolulu, on her back.

           Waikiki looks across at his brother in shock and sadness.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Is... it over?

                                 THE NURSE
                        I’m sorry, son. I am. I really 
                        fucking am.

           Waikiki drops back onto a chair, as --

           BEEEEEEEEEEEP

           -- the nurse’s CLIPBOARD ACTIVATES AGAIN. She looks down at 
           it, and her face falls.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Orian?

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (looking up)
                        What?

                                 THE NURSE
                        He... he was goddamn STABLE... man, 
                        his kid’s gonna go nuclear... 

           WE PUSH IN ON WAIKIKI as it all falls into place. 

           He takes a deep breath. That pulls out the WHITE PLASTIC GUN.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Is Orian Franklin here?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Whoa there, pilgrim! That’s against 
                        the rules...
                                 WAIKIKI
                        So’s bringing in a cop. IS ORIAN 
                        FRANKLIN HERE?

                                 THE NURSE
                        I can’t tell you-

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Shit. That means... shit.

           He dry-washes his face with one hand -- gun in the other. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Whatever this is, son, think it 
                        through-

           Waikiki raises his head from his hands -- then COCKS the gun, 
           and SCRAMBLES to the door. The nurse grits her teeth:

                                 THE NURSE (ON WALKIE-TALKIE) (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Everest, I need you RIGHT 
                        NOW! Things are going to hell in a 
                        handcart full of blood and shit!

           But there’s still no answer. Just STATIC.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “NIAGARA” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Nice climbs down from Niagara’s dead body, wiping her hands. 

           She pulls out the CONTACT LENS, and drops it into the toxic 
           waste disposal, disgusted by the whole thing.

                                 WAIKIKI (O.S.)
                        You killed him.

           Nice TURNS AROUND -- to see Waikiki, gun raised.

                                 NICE
                        Sherman, what-?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Don’t. Don’t look at me. Turn back 
                        around.

                                 NICE
                        What is this? Are you working for 
                        someone?
                                 WAIKIKI
                        Lev was on a goddamn life support 
                        when you pulled the plug.

           The reality of the situation hits Nice. Her face crumbles.

                                 NICE
                        I... I did not know-

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Then you should’ve thought it 
                        through. But I guess that’s the 
                        difference between you and me.

           CLICK 

           He pulls back the hammer on his plastic gun.

                                 NICE
                        Don’t do this.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        This is all I know. All either of 
                        us knows, right? No-one really gets 
                        out-

           RACK FOCUS to Nice’s face. 

           She closes her eyes. Then, in the RED LIGHT -- she feels for 
           her MAKESHIFT CERAMIC KNIFE.

                                 NICE
                        Please. I’m better than you. You 
                        said it yourself.

           ANGLE ON WAIKIKI, his hand shaking, finger squeezing --

           -- as Nice just flicks a wrist --

           SHNIIIK

           -- and the ceramic LODGES itself in Waikiki’s shoulder. IN 
           the confusion, Nice SPINS WIDE around the bed, and flips back 
           around with a disarming ROUNDHOUSE KICK --

           -- that sends Waikiki flying, as the gun SPINS AWAY.

           Waikiki KICKS the wheeled LIFE SUPPORT into Nice’s legs, but 
           she side-steps. The two of them reeling, facing each other --

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        Please... believe me... I didn’t 
                        want this.
                                 WAIKIKI
                             (in shock)
                        Lev’s dead, Elodie. I mean -- what 
                        do I do now?

                                 NICE
                        You... live?

           The simple thought hits Waikiki’s mind, and he stops --

           BANG

           -- just as a BULLET hits his ribcage, and EXPLODES through 
           his shirt, spinning him backwards against the wall. 

           Nice turns to see --

           ACAPULCO

           Standing in the doorway, the printed gun in his hand. He 
           looks down at it, an annoyed professional:

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Patterned on the Glock 320-Z but 
                        the accuracy’s for SHIT. I was 
                        aiming for his head.

           Nice LEAPS at him -- but Acapulco lifts the gun again --

           BANG

           -- and blood sprays from her thigh as she drops to the floor.

                                 ACAPULCO (CONT’D)
                        See, and THAT was supposed to be a 
                        gut shot. What a piece of crap. I 
                        mean, who sells this stuff?

                                 NICE
                        Put it down... before I kill you.

                                 ACAPULCO
                        Shut up, bitch. I’ve had enough of 
                        your stupid, stuck-up bullshit. YOU 
                        FUCKED UP MY EVENING, you GET that? 
                        I was supposed to be SAFE in here! 
                        That’s what I PAID for! So now 
                        you’re gonna die like a good girl, 
                        right there on your knees where you 
                        fucking should be.

           He steps up to her, HOLDS THE GUN READY --
                                 WAIKIKI
                        Elodie!

           -- as Nice looks up to see Waikiki SPIN the MICROWAVE SCALPEL 
           across the floor and into Nice’s hand --

           -- and in a split second, she slices it across into 
           Acapulco’s foot, and he screams in pain, distracted --

                                 WAIKIKI (CONT’D)
                        AAAAAAARGH!

           Waikiki RISES UP and THROWS himself at Acapulco, and they 
           both reel messily into the medical equipment. 

           BANG

           The gun goes off again, wild, as Acapulco SLAMS Waikiki in 
           the face, busting his nose -- pointing the GUN at his head.

                                 ACAPULCO 
                        Dude, you are SO whipped.

           Acapulco goes to SHOOT HIM between the eyes --

           -- just as Waikiki sees a moment, and GRABS Acapulco’s 
           ponytail, JAMS it into the 3-D PRINTER. 

           He RAMS the credit card into the machine, and hits “PRINT”.

                                 ACAPULCO (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK.

           ZZZZZT. The laser starts to unrelentingly PRINT A PLASTIC 
           PISTOL into Acapulco’s neck.

           CRUNCH 

           And then his body goes limp. 

           Waikiki and Nice, stunned, stare at what just happened. 

                                 THE NURSE (O.S.)
                        Wow. Does nobody read the 
                        membership pack? “No killing the 
                        other patients”. It’s right there. 
                        Rule #1. I don’t know how much 
                        clearer I could be.

           REVEAL the nurse, mouth agape at the carnage. 

           Waikiki turns to the nurse -- REALLY woozy now -- 
                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Well, you were right. The trouble’s 
                        always on the inside.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I’ll... pay... for the damage...

                                 THE NURSE
                        Um, are you okay, son? You look 
                        like ALL the shades of shit.

           Waikiki nods --  lifts his shirt to reveal the BULLETPROOF 
           VEST he mentioned earlier. Taps it proudly --

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (in shock)
                        It’s fine... I got this.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Smart thinking. But what about the 
                        bullet in your waist?

           Waikiki looks down --  

           -- and sees a VAST RED PATCH spreading across his white shirt 
           above his waistline.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Shit.

           Then he BLACKS OUT, and SLAMS to the floor. 

           Nice rushes to his side, the nurse just behind her.

                                 NICE
                        Please, help him!

                                 THE NURSE
                        Give me some room...

                                 EVEREST (O.S.)
                        Nurse? NURSE!

           The nurse turns -- to see Everest in the doorway. Sweating, 
           panting hard.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Oh thank God. Did you get her out?

           Everest looks at the nurse. Then... beams.

                                 EVEREST
                        Yes, nurse.
                                 THE NURSE
                             (floods of relief)
                        Jeez... that is good news.

                                 EVEREST
                        But this ain’t.

           He points to her clipboard, and the CCTV CAMERA in the lobby. 
           We use the image on the SCREEN to MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR RECEPTION - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Twenty Russian mobsters SMASH at the security gate, kicking 
           it systematically -- the walls themselves CRUMBLING.

                                 ILYA
                        I’M COMING FOR YOU, BITCH!

           One of the men LIGHTS UP the wallpaper, which catches ALONG 
           THE WALL, INFERNAL in the red the emergency lighting.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “NIAGARA” SUITE - HOTEL - NIGHT

           ON THE CLIPBOARD SCREEN:

           We see that angry throng of Tsars, weapons raised.

                                 THE NURSE
                        That... is a heck of a Code Grey.

                                 EVEREST
                        Russians gonna tear this place 
                        apart. We need to go NOW!

                                 NICE
                        Can they get through?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Since someone turned the power 
                        off... sure.

           Everest GRABS Waikiki, and the nurse helps Nice to her feet -- 
           as they hustle into the corridor --

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           -- where the sounds of the marauders becomes louder.
           Everest LIFTS Waikiki half-onto the nurse, who strains under 
           the bank robber’s weight. Everest points down the corridor --

                                 EVEREST
                        Y’all are going out the back. 
                        Emergency elevator got its own 
                        power.

                                 THE NURSE
                        What about you?

                                 EVEREST
                        Three person maximum in that broke-
                        ass thing-

                                 THE NURSE
                        It can take more-

           DOWN THE CORRIDOR

           the din of the incoming murderous throng is growing.

                                 EVEREST
                        Listen, they get down here while we 
                        all in that elevator, they gonna 
                        kill everyone of us. Ducks in a 
                        barrel.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Then I’ll stay. Stop them.

                                 EVEREST
                        You’re a little old lady, you ain’t 
                        gonna stop shit. 

                                 NICE
                        Then let me. It is my fault-

                                 THE NURSE
                        She’s right-

                                 EVEREST
                        NO. French girl’s all kinds of 
                        fucked up. It’s gotta be me. 
                             (re: Waikiki)
                        You wanna get the patients out or 
                        not? They ALL our problems.

                                 THE NURSE
                        That’s... that’s not what I meant.

                                 EVEREST
                             (smiling)
                        I know.
           The nurse sighs -- knows he’s not going to be argued with -- 
           and that he’s doing this for her, not the patients.

           So she fishes in her pocket -- puts the DOOR KEY in his hand.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Hell of a mess to clean up 
                        tomorrow.

                                 EVEREST
                             (smiling)
                        Yes, nurse. See you in the morning.

           He turns, and runs off down the corridor.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (shouting after him)
                        Damn skippy you’ll see me in the 
                        morning... someone’s gonna have to 
                        patch your stubborn ass up! YOU 
                        HEAR ME, EVEREST? WE AIN’T DONE ON 
                        THIS!

                                 EVEREST
                             (over his shoulder)
                        SURE WE ARE!

           He rounds the corner and then he’s gone. The nurse and Nice 
           watch for a beat. Nice frowns -- then turns to the nurse.

                                 NICE
                        There is a street exit near 6th and 
                        Stanford, yes?

                                 THE NURSE
                        What? Sure. Gate 3.

                                 NICE
                        Okay... good.

           She lifts Waikiki onto the nurse’s shoulder. Nice puts a hand 
           in Waikiki’s pocket -- and pulls out that GARAGE OPENER.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        You need to take him there.
                             (handing her the clicker)
                        He has a car, disguised... a burn-
                        out... this will... undisguise... 
                        ah, I can’t think of the English!

                                 THE NURSE
                             (quietly)
                        I can’t.
                                 NICE
                        You have to.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I can’t go out there.

                                 NICE
                        You HAVE to -- the orderly needs 
                        help. 
                             (nodding to Waikiki)
                        Please... tell him that I did this.

           The nurse nods.

                                 NICE (CONT’D)
                        Merci.

           Nice pulls out the printed gun, COCKS the weapon. 

           Then she runs around the corner -- and into the noise and the 
           darkness. The nurse shakes her head --

           -- then tries to pick up Waikiki on her own. 

           TOO HEAVY. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Fucking Wednesdays.

           So the nurse reaches into her bag, pulls out a WIDE SYRINGE. 
           She stares down at her hand. It’s starting to wobble again.

           The nurse shakes her head -- then STABS Waikiki in the heart.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR RECEPTION - HOTEL - NIGHT

           SMASH

           The hotel lobby is an INFERNO now, the gate almost broken. 

                                 EVEREST (O.S.)
                        You guys got visitor passes?

           Ilya looks up to see Everest, casually fixing up his orderly 
           outfit. He straightens out his badge...

                                 ILYA
                        WHERE IS MY FATHER?
                                 EVEREST
                             (shrugging)
                        Can’t save everyone.

                                 ILYA
                        I TOLD THE BITCH IF HE DIE I BURN 
                        THIS PLACE TO GROUND.

           Everest raises an eyebrow -- then PUNCHES THROUGH a box on 
           the wall beside him, removing a FIRE AXE. 

                                 EVEREST
                        You know what, esé? In hospitals, 
                        we got codes. Tells the other 
                        medical types what’s going on, 
                        without scaring the civilians. 
                        “Slow code” means a patient already 
                        dead, but we need to make a show of 
                        it, ease the family into that idea.

           SMASH

           That cage almost entirely compromised now.

                                 ILYA
                        The FUCK do I care?

                                 EVEREST
                        ‘Cos you a Slow Code. You dead, but 
                        the people round you just don’t 
                        know it yet.

           SMASH

           The cage BURSTS open, and the mob surge at Everest -- who 
           SWINGS the axe into a Tsar’s neck. He SCREAMS.

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        Compliments of the Artemis, 
                        chingada madre.

           Everest wipes the axe on his leg -- turns to the rest.

                                 EVEREST (CONT’D)
                        This next one, it what they call a 
                        Code Red. Here’s why.

           There’s a roar, and TWENTY ASSAILANTS attack Everest -- and 
           our man mountain is TOTALLY CONSUMED by the invading horde -- 

           -- as from around the corner, NICE enters the fray --

           BANG BANG
           But unseen by either defender, under cover of the fracas -- 

           -- Ilya DUCKS PAST them, and into the Artemis itself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Waikiki’s eyes finally OPEN -- then he convulses with pain.

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (remembering)
                        What happened? My brother...

                                 THE NURSE
                        We’ll talk about it later. Right 
                        now I promised to get you out of 
                        here. Elevator’s this way.

           The nurse helps him up, now almost able to carry him, as --

           BANG BANG

           -- shots ring out from the elevator lobby.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Wait, where’s Elodie?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Nice decided... to stay.

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (weakly)
                        NO. We have to help-

                                 THE NURSE
                        She’s gone... nothing you can do 
                        except get out of here. That’s what 
                        she wanted.

           She cajoles him around the corner, both staggering --

           INT. BACK CORRIDOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           -- and we see the MAINTENANCE DOOR up ahead. 

           But between them and the door stands a figure. His back is 
           turned, but that long, ornate knife is unmistakable.

           ILYA turns around -- and smiles.
                                 ILYA
                        What, you think I not know entry 
                        and exit of my own building?

           He pulls forward the blade, drags it along the wall.

                                 ILYA (CONT’D)
                             (to the nurse)
                        You. You first.

           Waikiki is woozy -- but his eyes COME INTO FOCUS. He STEPS in 
           front of the nurse, between her and Ilya --

           -- as quietly, the nurse INDICATES something in her doctor’s 
           bag to Waikiki. He nods -- SLIPS his hand inside --

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Let... us... through.

                                 ILYA
                        I don’t think so.

                                 WAIKIKI
                             (stepping closer)
                        Let us through... or I’ll break you 
                        like a dollar bill... and keep the 
                        fucking change.

           There’s a beat --

           -- then Ilya LUNGES for Waikiki, who DUCKS and SIDESTEPS, 
           landing hard on the wall -- but spinning around --

           -- with a FISTFUL OF FULL SYRINGES. He RAMS THEM into Ilya’s 
           back, and uses his other hand to SLAM the plungers down.

           Ilya SCREAMS -- as his eyes go wild, and he TURNS -- then 
           just SMIRKS. Barely affected by what’s in his system.

           Ilya goes to attack -- then suddenly CONVULSES -- and slams 
           to the floor. DEAD.

                                 THE NURSE
                        That... is the “daddy was a 
                        zookeeper” shit.
                             (then, to Waikiki)
                        Come on.

           And with that, the nurse opens the door to the elevator, and 
           the two stumble inside. She pulls the cage closed -- 

           -- then hits the “DOWN” button. 
           INT. FRONT ELEVATOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse looks down at her hand. Her shakes getting worse. 
           She tries to get pills out of her pocket, but SPILLS them.

           Next to her, Waikiki SLUMPS to the floor -- adrenalized, in 
           pain, shaking his head... and putting stuff together.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I got a question.
                             (then)
                        The back-up life support... in my 
                        brother’s room. Where’d it go?

           The nurse doesn’t answer.

                                 WAIKIKI (CONT’D)
                        It was in with that cop, right?

           The nurse shrugs gently.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I’ve said it before... you’re a 
                        smart guy.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        So... did you know her?

                                 THE NURSE
                             (nodding)
                        She was friends. With my son. He 
                        died a long time ago but... I..
                             (breathing heavily)
                        I’m sorry I couldn’t save your 
                        brother.

           Waikiki focuses for a second. Takes this in.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        It’s alright. He’d been gone a 
                        while.

           The nurse tries to nod in thanks -- 

           -- but her breathing sounds tighter.

                                 WAIKIKI (CONT’D)
                        You okay? Your asthma?

                                 THE NURSE
                        It’s not asthma.
                             (then)
                        Agoraphobic. Anxiety attack. I... I 
                        can’t leave this place.
                                 WAIKIKI
                        You have to...

                                 THE NURSE
                        Can’t. Long story... and it doesn’t 
                        have... a happy ending. But I’ll 
                        get you... to the door. 
                             (then)
                        For her.

           DING

           The elevator reaches the bottom and the nurse opens the door.

           She SWINGS Waikiki onto her shoulder, grabs her bag. It’s 
           difficult, but she manages to take a few steps.

           INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse is wheezing, a fresh panic attack beginning -- as 
           she desperately carries Waikiki towards DOOR #3.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        The car-

                                 THE NURSE
                        Yeah, she told me. I’ve got... the 
                        bleeper.

           They reach the door, and the nurse rests Waikiki against the 
           wall. She opens an OBSERVATION PANEL, sees what’s outside:

           CARNAGE

           A riot in full effect. ProTec in armor, tear gas everywhere, 
           smoking fires, sky flares. Hundreds of people at war.

           The nurse rolls back next to Waikiki on the wall.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. You... go.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        No-

                                 THE NURSE
                        Kid-

                                 WAIKIKI
                        NO.

                                 THE NURSE
                        I can’t do it, son. I’ve tried.
                                 WAIKIKI
                        Then I’ll help you. We’ll help each 
                        other.
                             (gesturing at the door)
                        This is the way out. For both of 
                        us. From... just ALL of it. 

           He painfully laces an arm underneath hers. Shoulder to 
           shoulder. The two huddled together, in the L.A. dawn.

           Then -- Waikiki nods to the door. The nurse shakes her head, 
           but still... she takes a deep, deep breath -- and unlocks it.

           EXT. ARTEMIS DOOR #3 - NEAR DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           BOOM

           It swings open, and we see the riot in the near distance - 
           gangs victorious, pushing ProTec out of the area.

           IN THE NURSE’S POV

           She sees the doorway. But the whole world looks like it’s 
           folding in. She’s rooted to the spot, hyperventilating.

           Waikiki squeezes her hand. You can do this.

           He points beyond an upside-down ProTec vehicle -- to a 
           blackened, wheelless BURNT-OUT MUSTANG.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        There’s the car... it’s not far. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Please-

                                 WAIKIKI
                        I can’t do this without you.
                             (then)
                        Getting out’s always tougher than 
                        getting in.

           Waikiki picks her up -- and the nurse does the same for him.

           Then they step outside.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NEAR DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           The nurse and Waikiki, two incongruous figures, limp through 
           the thick smoke past the detritus of the riot.
                                 WAIKIKI
                        You’re doing good.

           The nurse bites her lip, looks up at The Artemis. The top 
           floor GLOWS DEMONICALLY, fire gutting it from the inside. 

                                 THE NURSE
                             (to herself)
                        Come ON, Jeanie. Come ON.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        That your name? Jeanie?

                                 THE NURSE
                        Not... for a while.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        HOLD UP.

           Out of the smoke comes an EIGHTEEN-YEAR OLD GANG MEMBER, 
           ROCCO, with an SHOTGUN raised in his hands. 

                                 ROCCO
                        What you doing here? You cops?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Do we look like cops?

           Behind him: THIRTY MORE GANG MEMBERS APPEAR.

                                 ROCCO
                        Get their shit.
                             (to Waikiki)
                        Talk back to me like that again, 
                        you’re dead, and she goes down 
                        next.

           Three gang members step forward, push the nurse and Waikiki 
           to the ground. They feel in Waikiki pockets -- 

           -- and FIND THE PEN and THE GARAGE OPENER. They throw them up 
           to Rocco, who examines them.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Gimme those back-

                                 ROCCO
                        Nigga, you REALLY wanna go-?

                                 TARIQ (O.S.)
                        ROCCO!

           Rocco turns -- and TARIQ, the gang member that the nurse 
           helped in the alleyway, pushes forward out of the crowd.
                                 TARIQ (CONT’D)
                        Let them pass, man. I know her.

                                 ROCCO
                        You know her?

                                 RICARDO
                        Yeah, she fixes people. She ain’t 
                        the problem.
                             (then, to the nurse)
                        You ain’t the problem. Go on...

           Rocco takes a beat -- then nods to the other gang members to 
           give them their stuff back -- her bag, his clicker...

           ...but keeps hold of the pen. Examines it admiringly.

                                 ROCCO
                        Nice. Think I’m gonna keep this.

           Waikiki goes to argue -- then he just shakes his head.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You do that, kid. I’m done with it 
                        anyway.
                             (then)
                        It’s heavier than you’d think.

           Rocco frowns, waves them past, as Tariq leans into the nurse:

                                 TARIQ
                        You be careful.

           -- and the gang members PART, allowing a confused Waikiki and 
           the nurse to walk through them. 

           Unharmed, and into the smoke towards --

           EXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - NEAR DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           THE WRECK OF A CAR, propped up on bricks. The nurse looks at 
           Waikiki, unconvinced.

           Waikiki shrugs -- hits the clicker, and -- 

           -- the wheels FOLD DOWN from inside the car, and we see that 
           it’s just been painted and engineered to look busted.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Huh. Smart guy-

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Not really.
           CLICK

           From out of nowhere, there’s a GUN at Waikiki’s head.

           PAUL PENG. 

           Looking even more beat-up than before.

                                 PAUL PENG
                             (to Waikiki)
                        You COCKROACH... I knew you’d be 
                        back if I stuck around long enough.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Easy... do what you like to me... 
                        just let her take the car...

           Paul Peng turns his gun on the nurse.

                                 PAUL PENG
                        Oh, you mean this one? The old lady 
                        who sent me outside to die?

                                 THE NURSE
                        And I am TRULY sorry about that, 
                        Slick. How’s the neck?

                                 PAUL PENG
                             (sarcastic)
                        Actually, you know what, it’s a 
                        little fucking sore. But hey, c’est 
                        la ... whatever...

                                 THE NURSE
                        C’est la guerre. It’s a fancy 
                        French way of saying you gotta 
                        accept the shit and move on.

                                 PAUL PENG
                        Oh, you think you can move on, huh? 
                        Just drive off into the sunset and 
                        leave everything behind now? Well, 
                        sorry, that’s not how it works...

           Paul Peng raises his weapon.

           He pulls the trigger.

           BANG

           A HOLE APPEARS in Paul Peng’s forehead, and he drops down. 

           The nurse swings around, to see NICE. 
           Balanced on Niagara’s old crutch, ProTec-issue gun raised.

                                 NICE
                        Your accent... needs work.

           Nice WOBBLES -- and Waikiki swings around and grabs her.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        You okay?
                             (Nice shrugs, in pain)
                        We’ll get you out...

                                 THE NURSE
                        Wait... did Everest make it?

                                 NICE
                        I... think so. It got messy... but 
                        he told me to tell you... there’ll 
                        be nothing left... tomorrow. 
                             (then)
                        Said it’s time you took a vacation.

           The nurse looks up at The Artemis. 

           The whole top floor is burning now.

           The nurse smiles -- 

           -- then takes a deep breath. It’s normalized. Deep, even. 

           Behind her, Waikiki helps Nice into the back seat. 

                                 THE NURSE
                        Where are you guys headed?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Detroit, maybe. Hawaii. France. Any 
                        place... just out of HERE.

           The nurse looks around her at the chaos. 

           Seems oddly calm.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Know what? It’s a nice morning. I 
                        think I’ll take a walk.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        What’re you talking about??

           BOOM

           Explosions ring out around them. 
           The nurse takes out a bundle of medication from her bag, 
           hands them to Waikiki.

                                 THE NURSE
                        That’ll get you both up the coast. 
                        There’s a decent Dark Room in 
                        Nevada -- The Apache, it’s called.

           She pulls off her ARTEMIS TAG, and scribbles a quick note on 
           the back of it, then hands it to Waikiki.

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Stop in there, tell them I sent 
                        you... they’ll fix you up.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        Are you kidding me? We got OUT!

                                 THE NURSE
                        I know. And it feels great.
                             (with a shrug)
                        But what am I going to do in 
                        Detroit? Or Hawaii? Or France?

           She gestures to the gangs -- carrying their injured. 

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        And who else is going to fix them?

                                 WAIKIKI
                        C’mon, I can’t leave you here.

                                 THE NURSE
                             (smiling)
                        You’re a sweet kid. But I’m old. 
                        This is all I know.
                             (then)
                        And I’m good with that.

           The nurse puts an arm around him, gives him a hug. 

           Holds him for a few seconds longer than he expects. 

           Then -- she lets him go.

           Waikiki, frustrated, looks at Nice in the back. The sound of 
           distant sirens can be heard...

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           Waikiki reluctantly swings inside the Mustang --
           INT. MUSTANG - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           -- and guns the engine. He looks across to Nice.

                                 WAIKIKI
                        “Nice”.

                                 NICE
                        “Waikiki”.

           She manages a smile, and gestures to the road. Waikiki looks 
           back in the rear view mirror once more to see -- 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           THE NURSE

           who turns to watch Waikiki go, gives them a little wave.

           The burnt-out jalopy screeches off, cutting a swathe through 
           the debris, and the nurse smiles sadly:

                                 THE NURSE
                        Namaste, babe.

           She watches for a beat until they’re gone.

           Then... she reaches into the pocket of her bloody cardigan. 
           Pulls out her headphones, puts them on, presses play:

                                 “Band Of Thieves” by Cher

           The nurse looks pleased with the choice, and nods along.

           Then, bag in hand, with that same serene quality as when she 
           waited for the elevators at the start --

           -- she turns towards the riot.

           A small, noble figure against all the destruction.

           Her song crescendos, and the nurse steps forward into the 
           night. As the smoke engulfs her, we can just hear her words:

                                 THE NURSE (CONT’D)
                        How can I help?

                                                        SLAM CUT TO CREDITS

                                         THE END
