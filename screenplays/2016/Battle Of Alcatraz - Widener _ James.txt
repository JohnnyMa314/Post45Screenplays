           A SEAGULL 

           Flying in the air... Free.

           This bird is one of MANY, SOARING over the foggy ocean. A 
           lyrical image, which soon becomes a REFLECTION in...

           A BEDROOM WINDOW

           Curtains dance in the breeze, framing an OLDER MAN. He looks 
           out to the water... watching this swirling FLOCK OF BIRDS.  

           As we take in his face -- one of fine lines and salty hair -- 
           the SOUND of the tide GROWS... BUILDING in force... Until --

           INT. BEDROOM - OCEANFRONT HOUSE - DAWN

           -- The man turns from the window. Meet JAMES JOHNSTON (60s).

           ON HIS BED, a TWEED SUIT and WOVEN TIE are laid out for him. 

           IN THE MIRROR, we’re overtaken by quick images: A RAZOR on 
           stubble... A tie LOOPED... Spectacles ADJUSTED... Then... 
           Johnston again. Staring into the mirror. Ready for the day.

                                                                CUT TO:

           PANCAKES. Stacks of them on a kitchen table...

           INT. KITCHEN - OCEANFRONT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnston moves through the kitchen, noticing his breakfast.

                                 JOHNSTON
                        You know I’m late, Ida. 

           AT THE STOVE, meet his wife: IDA MAE. She wears an APRON & 
           PEARLS. Glamorous, yet humble. She flips another pancake.

                                 IDA MAE
                        Even late people need to eat.

                                 JOHNSTON
                             (grabs a mug of coffee)
                        Ever think they’re called pancakes 
                        for a reason? It’s cake for 
                        breakfast. Better off without ‘em. 

           Ida smiles to herself, amused by his gruff demeanor.

           INT. FRONT FOYER - OCEANFRONT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnston gathers his BRIEFCASE, unhooks his HAT.

                                 IDA MAE
                        We have our luncheon with Barbara 
                        today. She’s bringing Richie...
                                 (MORE)
                                 IDA MAE (CONT'D)
                             (off his silence)
                        ... Don’t tell me you forgot.

                                 JOHNSTON
                             (changing the subject)
                        Did I mention how nice you look? 

           Ida takes his hat from his hands, puts it on his head.

                                 IDA MAE
                        There are some things flattery 
                        can’t fix. 

                                 JOHNSTON
                        That a saying?

                                 IDA MAE
                        I said it. Just now.

           Johnston’s stoic exterior softens... offering a small grin. 

                                 IDA MAE
                        Be safe out there.

           Johnston nods. He will. And with that --

           EXT. OCEANFRONT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- he opens the front door and steps outside. As Johnston 
           walks down the steps, we begin to PULL BACK...

           ... SOARING HIGH ABOVE the mission-style home. And soon... we 
           see a surprise. His front yard overlooks not a lawn, but... 

           A SUPER-MAX PRISON 

           And as we RISE over the forboding structure of iron & cement, 
           we finally understand: this is no regular prison. Rather, the 
           unmistakable shape of an ISLAND. A TITLE making it all clear:

                                 B A T T L E   O F   A L C A T R A Z  

                                                                 BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   Inspired by true events. 

           ANOTHER TITLE:      Thursday. May 2nd, 1946. 5:30 AM. 

           OVER BLACK... a SOUND. An unsettling one. The BUZZ OF FLIES. 
           And soon, WARM LIGHT pools onto cement... as we realize --

           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT - CELLHOUSE - MORNING

           -- we’re in a JAIL CELL. A metal TRAY OF FOOD sits untouched. 
           A HOLE IN THE CONCRETE serves as a toilet. And before long -- 
           -- A HAND reaches into the light. It rummages around, dirty 
           fingers retrieving a TIN CUP from the ground. They fish 
           around inside, pulling out... a pair of DENTURES. 

           Shaken dry, they’re raised to a TOOTHLESS MOUTH. And as they 
           CLICK into place, we finally reveal...

           AN INMATE 

           Leaning against the cement wall. He shuffles, standing into 
           the beam of sun, which sneaks in through a BARRED WINDOW. Now 
           in the light, we get a better look. His face is disarming. 
           His features gaunt, but handsome. This is BERNIE COY (40).

           He closes his eyes, moving the RAY OF SUN around his face, 
           relishing the warmth. And soon, he LISTENS. SOUNDS GROWING...

           The CRASH of waves. The faint BELLOW of foghorns. The CALL of 
           gulls. Life on the outside... But as Coy OPENS HIS EYES -- 

           -- his face displays no such warmth. Only tired desperation. 
           As we linger on his vacant expression, a VOICE PRELAPS:

                                 A VOICE 
                        Mornin’, Warden --

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - MORNING

           -- With a TIP of his hat, we’re back with Johnston, entering 
           a bustling office space. TAPPING TYPEWRITERS punctuate the 
           silence. As Johnston walks past ROWS OF DESKS lined with 
           OFFICE WORKERS, we finally understand --

                                 TYPIST 
                        Mornin’, Warden.

           -- Johnston is the Warden of Alcatraz.

           Suddenly, his SECRETARY swoops in, speaking a mile a minute. 
           She’s short, compact, with hair that hugs her jawline. As she 
           FLIPS through her DATEBOOK, meet RITA BERTRAND (30). 

                                 RITA
                        Been looking all over for you!
                        Ferry’s gonna be here any minute. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Rita... know how I told you to bug 
                        me? You’re gettin’ a little too 
                        good at it.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

           Johnston enters his office, flopping down his briefcase. 
           Multiple phone lines BLINK on an organized DESK. 
           As Johnston sits, he notices two curious items: A TOY TUGBOAT 
           and a BOTTLE OF BOOZE... both WRAPPED in RED BOWS. 

                                 RITA
                        Gifts. From you.
                             (checks her date book)
                        The Mayor’s staff in the morning. 
                        Your grandson at lunch.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (picks up the bottle)
                        I appreciate the effort. But is my 
                        grandson old enough to drink?

                                 RITA
                        It’s for what’s-his-name... I 
                        assume he likes brandy?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        It’s scotch. And what’s-his-name 
                        runs the Bureau of Prisons. My 
                        boss. Meaning he’s definitely your 
                        boss. So learn his name. 

                                 RITA
                             (shrugs her shoulders)
                        Well, hopefully he likes scotch... 

           Johnston looks to Rita, unamused... as we’re overtaken by --

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

           -- ACTIVITY. The bustling ISLAND PORT now lined with SHIPS. 

           Rita follows Johnston through the crowd as PRISON PERSONNEL 
           make landfall, FERRIES chug to port, LINES are thrown ashore.

           AMIDST THE BUSTLE, we find a YOUNG GUARD saying goodbye to 
           his PREGNANT WIFE. Meet ERNEST & JANICE LAGESON (late 20s). 

                                 JANICE
                        We still doing the nursery tonight?

                                 ERNEST
                        Got the paint. Got the brushes...

           As Ernest places his hand on her pregnant bump, Janice hands 
           over a THERMOS OF COFFEE... then sees him off with a long 
           KISS. Suddenly, a sharp WHISTLE interrupts the moment.

                                 ERNEST
                             (breaks away)
                        Shit, gotta go... Love you.

           Janice smiles, amused... as Ernest spins to find Johnston, 
           waving him over. Quickly, the young guard sheathes his billy 
           club and approaches... shuffling to keep up. 
                                 ERNEST
                        Sir? I mean, Warden -- 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Don’t piss yourself, Ernest. You 
                        didn’t forget anything. I just need 
                        an escort for the morning. Couple 
                        of mainlanders.

                                 RITA
                        James Bennett, Bureau of Prisons. 
                        Robert Kenny, Attorney General. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Claim to be visiting for a parole 
                        hearing, but these guys have been 
                        up my ass ever since that article 
                        hit the papers.
                             (to Ernest)
                        Just make ‘em feel safe. Twirl your 
                        club. Look professional.
                             (changing the subject)
                        So, have I been hearing right? Ida 
                        says your wife’s havin’ a boy?

                                 ERNEST
                        I think that was supposed to be a 
                        surprise, boss.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Oh... Well, you’re thirty now. 
                        Gettin’ too old for surprises. Did 
                        you a favor, kid... 

           ON THE DOCKS, TWO SUITED MEN step off the FERRY. Briefcases 
           in hand, they make their way for Johnston. Meet JAMES BENNETT 
           (Bureau of Prisons) and ROBERT KENNY (Attorney General). 
           One’s tall, the other’s short. Both very well groomed. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Quite the view out here, Warden. 

           Johnston digs into his vest, FLIPPING OPEN... a POCKETWATCH. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You boys are late.

           The men smile, amused by Johnston’s gruffness.

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        Would’ve been on time if it wasn’t 
                        for me. When the Mayor calls...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Well, Gentlemen, on this island... 
                        time is all we have.
           TICK-TICK-TICK... CLICK! Johnston SHUTS the pocketwatch. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Welcome to Alcatraz.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           A SOARING AERIAL. Sea-green waves roll beneath the red steel 
           of the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE. And soon, on the horizon, like 
           some mysterious battleship anchored in the bay, we SEE IT... 

           ALCATRAZ ISLAND. A specter of activity, obscured by thin 
           sheets of passing fog. Chimneys thrust plumes of smoke into 
           the air. BUSTLING CROWDS report to work. A city on the water. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        ... Half a mile long. Quarter mile 
                        wide. A base of solid granite...

           EXT. CLIFFSIDE TRAIL - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - MORNING

           The group winds their way up a TRAIL, passing WATCHTOWERS 
           patrolled by RIFLEMEN GUARDS. Johnston leads the way...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Where you made landfall, that’s 
                        the eastside of the island. The 
                        “dockside.” We call the northside 
                        the “Industries,” where our inmates 
                        work. We’re now on the west end. 
                        Also known as the “cliffside.” Not 
                        much out here but water and rock. 

           Bennett scans the area: JAGGED CLIFFS and overgrown SHRUBS.

                                 BENNETT
                        Hence... “The Rock.”

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (mildly amused)
                        Not my nickname.

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        The Chronicle’s started to call it 
                        “Devil’s Isle.” Have to say, 
                        Warden: This island prison is 
                        getting a hell of a reputation.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Ever stop to think the ‘Devil’ 
                        isn’t the prison... but the men 
                        inside it?

           The politicians swap quizzical looks... Then:
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Question this place all you want, 
                        gentlemen, but stick close. Because 
                        up there...

           Johnston clocks his gaze to a jagged CLIFF FACE, where high 
           on the ROCKY PLATEAU... sits the forboding CELLHOUSE. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... one false step will cost you 
                        your life.

                                                                CUT TO:

           C-THUNK! Cell bars UNLATCH, SLIDING OPEN. ROWS OF INMATES --

           -- shuffling out of their cramped CELLS. Johnston enters,  
           Ernest escorting the politicians as they take in...

           THE CONTROL ROOM. A semi-circle of reinforced glass. BUSTLING 
           GUARDS. BLINKING SWITCHBOARDS. COMPLEX EQUIPMENT... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        We call this Times Square. It’s how 
                        we speak to the inmates... and each 
                        other.

           A UNIFORMED MAN exits the control room. Johnston notices him, 
           introducing the group:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        And this... is Associate Warden 
                        Miller. 

           As the ASSOCIATE WARDEN lands, we take in the imposing man. 
           His swarthy skin, his bulldog features. Miller sizes up the 
           suits, SLAPPING a SHAKE into their hands.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        I’ll remember three things when I 
                        die: My first beer. My first lay. 
                        And my first time on Alcatraz... 

           Ernest just shakes his head. Johnston is mildly amused. 

                                 BENNETT
                        We’re... thrilled to be here.

           As the politicians absorb the scenery, clearly nervous... 
           Johnston waves everyone forward, the group following behind.

           INT. A-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           RIIING! The Associate Warden hits a COUNTBELL, cueing ANOTHER 
           GUARD, who PULLS a LEVER as -- C-THUNK! -- more cells OPEN. 
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON 
                        I created this system... but it’s 
                        Mr. Miller who enforces it. Every 
                        man on the island belongs to him. 
                        Guards & inmates alike. He tells 
                        them when to eat... When to 
                        sleep... What is wrong... And helps 
                        reinforce what is right. 

           As Johnston leads the men past ROWS OF CELLS, an assembly of 
           GUARDS pass out TOOTHBRUSHES. The morning routine in motion. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        The cellhouse holds three hundred 
                        inmates, comprised of four blocks. 
                        This is A-Block, where we keep the 
                        “A” students. By the time you get 
                        to D-Block, well... I’m sure you 
                        can use your imagination.

           As Johnston TURNS A CORNER, the group enters a new block...

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ... A long corridor of steel bars and mint-green paint. We 
           pass VARIOUS CELLS, absorbing snapshots of inmates’ lives. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’d like to think we provide what 
                        other prisons can’t. Cleanliness. 
                        Order. Silence. Maximum security... 
                        with minimum privilege.

           Our group continues as more whistles SOUND, orderly LINES OF 
           INMATES marching in sync. Johnston the master of his domain.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        In short, we’ve found a way to tame 
                        the animals.

           SCREAMS ECHO OUT... as MEDICAL GUARDS subdue a STRAIGHT-
           JACKETED INMATE. Johnston tightens, squinting the sight. But 
           all appears under control. He turns back to the politicians:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON 
                        Unfortunately... some of these men 
                        are beyond our help.

           As the politicians respond with anxious nods, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MIRROR’S REFLECTION. INMATES shuffling out from cells. 
           Deafening silence punctuated by the soft marching of shoes.
           INT. C-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           As our group traverses the space, the SILENCE is palpable. 
           Eerie. The soft ECHO of keys. The faint RING of countbells...

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        Help us understand, Warden. These 
                        men are in five-by-seven cells for 
                        most of the day. Then... only 
                        allowed to speak during meals? 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        It’s a system... created to enforce 
                        good habits. If these men get in 
                        the habit of doing things right... 
                        there’s no room to do what’s wrong.

                                 BENNETT
                        If it’s enforced, it’s not a habit.

           ON JOHNSTON, growing irritated. He knew this was coming.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        This is about that article...

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        ... Five in the last year. The 
                        harsh conditions. The rule of 
                        silence. Multiple inmate suicides.

                                 BENNETT
                        The war’s over, Johnston. When the 
                        people of San Francisco crack the 
                        Sunday paper, they want to read 
                        about the 49ers... not the horrors 
                        of Alcatraz. Frankly, people are 
                        beginning to question if this 
                        institution is building up sinister 
                        ambitions among these men.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                             (interjecting)
                        These men had sinister ambitions 
                        long before they got here.

           As Johnston stops at a STEEL DOOR, Miller looks to a MIRRORED 
           VISION PANEL. Seeing all’s clear, he TILTS HIS GAZE to...

           THE GUN GALLERY 

           A barred-off balcony WRAPPING the perimeter of the cellhouse, 
           patrolled by ARMED GUARDS. Off his cue --

           -- A KEY RING is LOWERED on a CABLE, dropping down to Miller.  
           As he begins to UNLOCK a complex door, Bennett continues:
                                 BENNETT
                        Warden... No one’s questioning the 
                        job you’re doing, but the headlines 
                        have become worrisome. Look no 
                        further than Henri Young. He does a 
                        stint in solitary, then plunges a 
                        sharpened spoon into an inmate’s 
                        neck. The press had a field day. 

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        Or Edward Wutke. After complaining 
                        about the conditions... he cuts his 
                        jugular with a pencil sharpener.

                                 BENNETT
                        Let’s not forget Rufe Persful. Due 
                        to the mental anguish caused by the 
                        isolation... the man chops off four 
                        of his fingers. Need I continue? 

           Johnston listens, stoic. He tumbles the point, until --       
           C-CLUNK! -- the key UNLOCKS the door. Miller SLIDES IT OPEN.   

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Johnston leads them into the next block, his tone unwavering: 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Gentlemen, I can’t control what the 
                        papers want to print. The country 
                        gives us the worst... and we’re 
                        simply doing our best. Just have a 
                        look around...

           C-CLUNK! The cell door locks behind them. A deep echo... 
           Bennett surveys the space... his gaze met by a rogues gallery 
           of INMATES. Depraved, dangerous. Locked away from the light. 
           In here, even Miller & Ernest are a bit tense...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        This is D-Block. Murderers... 
                        Rapists. Pedophiles. Capone was in 
                        here. Machine Gun Kelly. Doc Baker.
                        When you’re dealing with men like 
                        this... there is no balance. 

           Bennett absorbs the statement, Johnston’s point sinking in. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON 
                        While this place might seem harsh, 
                        it needs to be. Because when these 
                        men know their time is up...

           Johnston FLIPS OPEN his POCKETWATCH. TICK-TICK-TICK...
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... they cease to care if they live 
                        or die. Meaning they certainly 
                        don't care if you live or die. So 
                        the people of San Francisco need to 
                        ask themselves: Do they want these 
                        men doing time in here with me... 
                        or out there with them? 

           TICK-TICK-TICK... CLICK! Johnston SHUTS his pocketwatch. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON 
                        Time for those parole hearings.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A PLAYGROUND... filled with cheerful CHILDREN.

           EXT. CIVILIANS’ ROW - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           Ida Mae & Ernest’s wife, Janice, stroll an idyllic path. They 
           pass lush gardens, quaint buildings, a busy SCHOOLHOUSE...

                                 IDA MAE
                        Ernest & you decide on a name?

                                 JANICE
                        Doesn’t even know we’re having a 
                        boy yet... 

           Her hands gently rest on her PREGNANT BUMP. 

                                 IDA MAE
                        Well, before you know it... you’ll 
                        be dropping off a little one of 
                        your own. 

           The school bell RINGS as giggling CHILDREN slide down slides, 
           jump off swings... running inside. Janice eyes them, pensive.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CIVILIANS’ ROW - LATER

           Arms filled with GROCERIES, Ida & Janice walk the bustling 
           MAIN STREET. As they do, we absorb the quaint strip...

           A GENERAL STORE, POST OFFICE, SODA FOUNTAIN... A HAND-PAINTED 
           SIGN sums up the vibe: “ALCATRAZ...  A small town with a big prison.” 

                                 JANICE
                        ... When we first moved here, 
                        Ernest was relaxed. With a kid on 
                        the way... he seems different.

                                 IDA MAE
                        You’re not the first guard’s wife 
                        to worry about raising a child 
                        here. But that’s the life... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 IDA MAE (CONT'D)
                        He’ll get used to it. I know James 
                        did...
                             (a reassuring smile)
                        Let’s get these groceries on ice.

           They turn the corner, heading for a ROW OF APARTMENTS nestled 
           on the coastline. And soon... we’re overtaken by --

           INT. GUARD APARTMENTS - CIVILIANS’ ROW - MOMENTS LATER

           -- THE FACES OF WOMEN. Shoulder-to-shoulder in a quaint 
           apartment. Some of them cradling young BABIES. Suddenly... 

           A key JOSTLES in the lock. The women begin to HUSH, as -- 

           -- Ida & Janice enter the apartment to find: DECORATIONS, 
           GIFTS, A CAKE. Janice looks to Ida Mae, surprised, confused.

                                 IDA MAE
                        Didn’t think we’d let you by 
                        without a baby shower, did you?

           Overwhelmed, Janice sets down her groceries. But before she 
           can speak... she’s swarmed by the GUARDS’ WIVES: 

                       MRS. MORRIS 
                                                       MRS. BURCH 
           We’re hearing it’s a boy!
                                              You’re about ready to pop!

                                                      MRS. STITES 
                      MRS. WEINHOLD 
                                              You don’t look 7 months!   
           Love that materity dress!

                                 JANICE
                        I can’t... thank you ladies enough.

                                 MRS. STITES
                        Come now, it was all Ida Mae. 
                             (turns to Ida)
                        She’s the “First Lady” of Alcatraz.

           The women break into laughter. Everyone but...

           JANICE. Who just STARES blankly at the MOUNDS of BABY GIFTS 
           piled on her kitchen table. Then... she BURSTS INTO TEARS.

           The women gather up, trying to console her. But Janice just 
           WALKS AWAY... headed for a WINDOW. And soon, she SEES IT...

           THE CELLHOUSE. In plain sight from her apartment’s view. She 
           turns back around, squinting the women through her tears:

                                 JANICE
                        How do you all do it? Your kids...

           BEAT. The women are silent, pensive... Then:

                                 MRS. STITES
                        It gets easier with the second one.
           The women smile at Janice, empathetic... then Ida approaches: 

                                 IDA MAE
                        That prison should be the least of 
                        your concerns. Really... We have it 
                        safer than the others across the 
                        bay. Their criminals walk the 
                        streets. On Alcatraz... we know 
                        exactly where they are.

                                                                CUT TO:

           VIOLENT SCREAMS... echoing the cellhouse, as --

           INT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT - CELLHOUSE - MORNING

           -- INMATES are released from solitary confinement... 

           Soon, we RECOGNIZE one of them, dragged across the ground... 

           BERNIE COY

           Stumbling to his feet, we finally see just how FRAIL Coy 
           really is. Ribs protruding. Cheeks sunken. Eyes dark and 
           socketed. With a slicked-back tuft of hair, shorn close on 
           the sides, he looks like some sort of starved hyena. 

           AT NEIGHBORING CELLS, Miller & his guards brace a high-
           pressured HOSE, beginning to pummel SCREAMING INMATES... 

           Coy can only watch, horrified, as OTHER INMATES are BLASTED 
           by the FORCEFUL STREAM OF WATER. He stares, absorbing this 
           cruel display, anger building within him. Then... he speaks:

                                 BERNIE COY 
                        Why don’t you quit it...

           Miller & his men turn around, stunned by the comment. Miller 
           marches across the room. Other INMATES watch, scared for Coy.  

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        What the hell did you just say?!
                             (silence from Coy...)
                        Maybe your time in the hole made 
                        you forget the goddamn rules. Are 
                        you pieces of shit allowed to speak 
                        in here? Well...? Are you?!
                             (more silence from Coy)
                        Hear you’re going in front of the 
                        parole board, Coy... Allow me to 
                        wish you luck --

           -- CRACK! Miller NAILS Coy in face with his CLUB. Hitting the 
           floor, BLOOD pools on Coy’s brow. And as Miller continues -- 
           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! -- the STRIKES OF HIS CLUB become...
           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - MORNING

           ... the CLINKING OF ICE CUBES. Scotch POURS into a tumbler. 
           As a BOTTLE is set on the desk, we recognize the RED BOW.

           WIDER, Bennett takes a soothing sip. Pacing Johnston’s 
           office, he inspects a pedestaled MODEL of ALCATRAZ ISLAND. He 
           picks up a miniature GUARD FIGURINE, amused. Then continues:

                                 BENNETT
                        It’s a hell of a facility you’ve 
                        built, Warden. Hope we didn’t 
                        overstep our bounds earlier...

           Gently, Johnston takes the figurine. Returns it to its place. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You have your job. I have mine.

           The Attorney General passes Johnston a scotch, but he waves 
           it away. The politicians nod. They respect that.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Got a long morning, gentlemen.
                        We ready for the first..?

           Off their looks, Johnston PRESSES a BUZZER on his desk. 
           Miller enters, marching in a familiar inmate... Bernie Coy. 

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Inmate number four-one-five. 
                        Reporting for parole hearing.

           Coy is escorted to a chair and seated across from Johnston. 
           Johnston sizes him up, noticing Coy’s brow... now SPLIT from 
           the beating. He glances to Miller, but says nothing of it.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        That’ll be all.

           As Miller leaves the room... Johnston focuses his attention 
           back on Coy. His emaciated appearance, his injured brow... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        What happened to your face?

           Coy shuffles in his seat, then speaks. A shy, southern drawl.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        It was... my fault, sir.

           Johnston fixes his gaze on Coy, absorbing the statement... 
           then opens a CASE FILE.

           CLOSE ON COY’S CASE FILE: A MUGSHOT. MEDICAL HISTORY. NOTES.
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (looks up from file)
                        I see you’re seven years into a 
                        twenty five year sentence. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Yessir.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        And you’ve been working in the 
                        library. Making good marks. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Trying, sir.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Coy, I think you know why Associate 
                        Warden Miller sent you to solitary.
                             (looks to Bennett)
                        He was sneaking books to inmates. 
                        More than the allotted amount.

           Bennett nods, scribbling notes of his own.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        The books were my mistake, Warden. 
                        I know that now. And I had a lot of 
                        time to think in that hole. Some 
                        guards even had mercy on me. Gave 
                        me some reading materials. Used my 
                        time to read up on Freud, Jung... 
                        Trying to understand why I been 
                        making so many mistakes. I bring 
                        this up... hoping you’ll see my 
                        continued effort to right myself.

           But Johnston just nods, skeptical. Soon, Bennett interjects:

                                 BENNETT
                        Bernie, is it...? 
                             (off Coy’s nod)
                        It’s not every day you hear an 
                        inmate talk about Karl Jung.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (interjecting)
                        “A man is not what happened to him. 
                        He’s what he chooses to become.” 

           Coy nods. He knows the quote well... Then: 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        I prefer: “He who looks outside, 
                        dreams. He who looks inside... 
                        awakes.” 

           Johnston nods, mildly impressed. Then gets down to business.
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Coy, you’re here today... because 
                        you requested to be transferred to 
                        a minimum security prison.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Yessir.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Inmates showing signs of 
                        rehabilitation have been granted 
                        transfer to such facilities. But in 
                        light of your recent transgression, 
                        I personally don’t believe you’re 
                        ready for it. Never the less... I 
                        received your letter. And for the 
                        record, the parole board will 
                        consider it.

           Johnston unfolds a HANDWRITTEN LETTER. Adjusting his glasses, 
           he SCANS the words... then looks up to Coy: 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        It’s your letter... You read it.

           As it’s passed over to Coy, he looks at it, jaw clenched. 

           Johnston fixes his gaze, waiting. Then... Coy begins to read:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Since my incarceration, I have a 
                        record that would be envied by any 
                        inmate. I’m obedient. Never sullen. 
                        And set an example that would be 
                        commendable in any society... 

           WE PUSH IN on Coy, his vulnerability palpable...

                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... Please believe me sincere in my 
                        regret, as I’m now a firm believer 
                        in a disciplined life. If you see 
                        this in me too, please allow for my 
                        release to a minimum security 
                        lockup. Your system has changed me 
                        alright. More than this, no man can 
                        promise. Sincerely, Bernard P. Coy.

           Bennett & the Attorney General soak in the sentiment. Then...
           Coy looks up from the letter, locking eyes with Johnston.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Before the board makes a decision, 
                        anything else you’d like to say?
                                 BERNIE COY
                             (a beat, meekly)
                        I just... regret that my request 
                        comes on the heels of solitary. 
                        It’s not the most favorable 
                        reflection of my character.

           Johnston trades a look with Bennett... then -- 

           -- THUD! A STAMP comes down, inking a single word: DENIED.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BERNIE COY. Marched through the cellhouse by Miller...

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           As shackles DRAG on the ground, Miller speaks to Coy, calm 
           and condescending. Coy marches forward. A man without hope.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Lucky for you, the Warden’s a 
                        reasonable man. Wants you back in 
                        the library today. Thinks your 
                        better off keepin’ busy... 
                             (beat)
                        But know this: You give me lip 
                        again -- much as a peep -- gonna 
                        bust more than your head...

           CLOSE ON COY, a deep rage building within him. But as he 
           passes a FELLOW INMATE mopping up the floor, we soon 
           understand that his anger might actually be... determination.

           Our two inmates LOCK EYES, Coy offering a inconspicuous NOD. 
           Nothing more. Nothing less... And as the INMATE returns a nod 
           to Coy... we sense something very important just happened.

           As Miller ushers Coy along... we hang back, FOLLOWING the 
           other INMATE. His MOP BUCKET rolling across the cement for:

           INT. MESSHALL KITCHEN - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Pots BUBBLE on a stove. A PRISON CHEF stirs various sauces. 
           Wearing a CHEF’S HAT & COAT, meet MARVIN HUBBARD (34).  

           Soon, the INMATE enters the kitchen, casually mopping the 
           tiles... And soon, we quietly hear it:

                                 INMATE JANITOR
                        That thing for Coy. Need it today.

           Hubbard nods. Message received. And as the inmate continues, 
           pushing his mop & bucket, Hubbard curiously begins to 
           UNBUTTON his chef’s coat. He takes it off... and tosses it 
           into a CANVAS BAG of DIRTY CHEF’S WHITES. 
           Quickly, he SCRIBBLES a note on an ORDER SLIP. Then picks up 
           the LAUNDRY BAG, carrying it for...

           A LAUNDRY CHUTE

           The bag plummets down the shaft -- THUD! -- landing in:

           THE LAUNDRY ROOM

           Steam HISSES as GUARDS supervise WORKING INMATES, who tumble 
           SACKS OF CLOTHING into huge VATS of boiling water... 

           A YOUNG INMATE approaches the laundry chute... grabbing the 
           bag. Inside, he sees HUBBARD’S NOTE. It reads: EXTRA BLEACH. 
           Pocketing it, he hollers to a GUARD:

                                 LAUNDRY INMATE
                        Kitchen needs fresh whites.

           Off the guard’s NOD, the inmate moves to a long TABLE dotted 
           with STACKS of FOLDED LAUNDRY. Once there, he locks eyes with 
           an OLD INMATE, indiscreetly putting down a PACK OF CIGS. 

                                 YOUNG INMATE 
                        Need that thing for Coy.

           With a nod, the old inmate reaches for a very specific PARCEL 
           bound with TWINE. Picking it up, the Young Inmate heads for:

           A STAIRWELL

           He walks the stairs -- a plan in motion -- surfacing in:

           THE MESSHALL

           Watchful GUARDS track his moves as he works his way into...

           THE KITCHEN

           Hubbard tastes some sauce, pleased with his work, when... 

           THUD! The package is dropped. Hubbard offers a nod, then 
           delicately opens the parcel: A crisp, bleached CHEF’S COAT. 

           Satisfied, he puts it on. Then slowly reaches into the FRONT 
           POCKET... taking out an ITEM. Here, we finally understand 
           what was just smuggled in: a small ALLEN WRENCH.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BELLOWING FOGHORN. The chimney of a FERRY pumps smoke as --

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- Johnston walks Bennett & the Attorney General up its ramp.
                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        Met some fascinating men today. 
                        Troubled... but fascinating. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You know, counselor... we have a 
                        few open cells. Maybe you can spend 
                        the night. Get to know them better.

           The politicians tighten up, but can’t help but be amused by 
           Johnston’s sarcasm. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Warden... we didn’t come here to 
                        tell you how to run your show. But   
                        you know how this goes -- 

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        -- We need Alcatraz out of the 
                        headlines. No more suicides. No 
                        more scandals. We need the public 
                        to feel secure. It’s how they stay 
                        in our city. And pay taxes. And re-
                        elect our boss... who signs your 
                        paycheck. Because without that...  
                        how would you ever keep your 
                        beautiful home?

           As he gestures to the WARDEN’S HOUSE on the hill, the silence 
           is deafening. Johnston stews... but behaves himself. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Glad we understand each other.
                        And Warden, I know you said you’ve 
                        found a way to tame the animals. 
                        But don't forget: even a tamed 
                        animal has been known to bite.

           As Johnston chews on the notion, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BABY BIRD... cradled in a man’s hand. Its wing appears  
           INJURED, wrapped in GAUZE. Soon, it’s FED a CRUMB OF BREAD. 

           WIDER, we reveal an INMATE feeding it. He’s bald. Pale. One 
           might even say birdlike in features. Meet ROBERT STROUD (56), 
           also known as... “THE BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ.”

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Why the guards always turnin’ a 
                        cheek to the Birdman’s pet?

           INT. MESSHALL - CELLHOUSE - MORNING

           WIDENING OUT, we meet the MAN talking... JOE CRETZER (35). 
           A button-nosed inmate at a table with a CREW of others. He 
           peers across the messhall, watching Stroud FEED his bird.

                                 CRETZER
                        Ain’t kiddin’ around here. I want 
                        to know... 

           Next to him, an IRISH INMATE responds. MIRAN THOMPSON (29).

                                 THOMPSON
                        All the screws are afraid of him. 
                        Crazy bastard likes killin’ guards. 
                        Heard he offed one with a hammer. 

           Next up: A baby-faced NATIVE AMERICAN. CLARENCE CARNES (19).

                                 CLARENCE
                        Hear he likes killin’ convicts too.

                                 CRETZER
                        Convicts. Guards. The nutbar don’t 
                        discriminate. Tell ya what though:
                        Next time they serve turkey for 
                        dinner, steer clear of the Birdman!

           The table stifles their LAUGHTER. Everyone but... a pale man 
           with a buzzed head and stony eyes. This is SAM SHOCKLEY (37). 

                                 CRETZER
                        Come on, Shockley. Tellin’ me that 
                        wasn’t funny?! You might be a dumb 
                        mute, but I know you ain’t deaf. 

           Faint activity REGISTERS behind his vacant gaze, then... he 
           offers a modest SMILE. A grin grows on Cretzer’s face:

                                 CRETZER
                        Knew that shit was funny. 

           Suddenly, Clarence interjects, gesturing across the messhall:

                                 CLARENCE
                        Look, they let Coy outta the hole.

           IN THE LUNCH LINE, Coy shuffles forward, a STACK OF BOOKS 
           beneath his arm. 

           NEARBY, Miller and a GROUP OF GUARDS keep a watchful eye...

           As Coy extends his TRAY, a familiar PRISON CHEF serves him. 

                                 HUBBARD
                        Good to see you back, Coy. Here’s 
                        some extra chow for your troubles --

           -- As Hubbard places a BISCUIT on Coy’s tray, we sense a 
           moment between them. AN UNSPOKEN NOD. This is important.
           BACK AT THE TABLE, MOMENTS LATER...

                                 CRETZER
                        I’ll be damned, Coy. Welcome back.

           Offering a nod, Coy sets down his books and slides in with 
           his tray. As the crew extends a warm welcome, Cretzer grabs 
           one of Coy’s books, squinting the TITLE. It’s a TRAVEL BOOK.

                                 CRETZER
                        “The Exotic World of My-an-mar.” 
                             (confused)
                        What the hell’s a My-an-mar?

                                 BERNIE COY
                        It’s a place. Myanmar. That book 
                        says bananas grow right on trees. 
                        I’m gonna go there some day... 

                                 CRETZER
                        Bananas? Who ever gave two shits 
                        about bananas? It say anything 
                        about beer growing on trees? Ha!

           Eyeing the book, Cretzer notices TORN SCRAPS of PAPER marking 
           various pages. We think they’re BOOKMARKS, until Cretzer 
           SLIPS ONE OUT, and starts to SMELL IT. Deep and reflective.

                                 CRETZER
                        Mmmmm. Smells like a blonde. 
                             (more deep sniffs)
                        Scratch that... A brunette.

           Coy stares at Cretzer, unamused. And without a word uttered 
           from Coy... Cretzer knows to hand it back. As he does, Coy 
           RELAXES, delicately tucking the PAPER back into his book.

                                 CLARENCE
                        The hell are those?

                                 THOMPSON
                        Called tearsheets, kid. Pieces of a 
                        perfumed letter. Closest thing in 
                        here to a piece of ass.

                                 CRETZER
                        Coy, you’re not careful with those, 
                        you gonna wind up back in the hole.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Awful kind of you to worry. But 
                        none of us ever going there again. 
                        No more writin’ the parole board. 
                        No more dreamin’ about home...
                             (then)
                        Today’s the day. 
           The statement carries weight. His crew knows what this means. 
           As the men LEAN IN, Coy looks around, reaching for his tray. 

           Curiously, he grabs the BISCUIT Hubbard gave him. They watch 
           as Coy SPREADS it open, FEELS AROUND, finally PULLING OUT...

           THE SMALL ALLEN WRENCH

           As the crew regards it, we understand: this means everything. 

           Coy clocks towards the kitchen, watching Hubbard serve food.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        I know Hubbard’s in.

           Coy turns back to his men... His face demands an answer.

                                 CRETZER
                        Count me in, Coy...

                                 THOMPSON
                        ... Me too.

           They all look to Shockley... who offers an imperceptible NOD.

                                 CRETZER
                        Shockley’s in.

           Coy’s men finally turn to... the baby of the bunch: Clarence.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        How ‘bout you, old-timer? 

           Clarence is filled with uncertainty, but offers a faint NOD.

           CLOSE ON COY, offering a nod of his own. A man filled with 
           purpose. Today’s the day...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   11:55 AM. 

           OVER BLACK... a SOUND. A loud one. The BELLOW of a FOGHORN.

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           A LONE FIGURE waits on the docks, watching a FERRY approach. 
           It’s Johnston, deep in thought. Suddenly, Rita walks up --

                                 RITA
                        -- How’d you beat me?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (looks to pocketwatch)
                        You’re four minutes late.
           Rita reaches into her bag... handing over the TOY TUGBOAT. 

                                 IDA MAE (O.S.)
                        Rita, how thoughtful of you...

           Ida enters, regarding the gift. Johnston kisses her cheek:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        How was your morning?

                                 RITA
                        Phone’s ringing off the hook, boss. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (gestures to Ida)
                        I was talking to my wife.

                                 RITA
                             (taps her datebook)
                        San Quentin called. They have two 
                        hot ones for transfer. One’s in for 
                        double-murder. One’s an agitator -- 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Rita. Can we table this? My 
                        daughter will be here any second. 
                        My grandson as well... 

           Rita closes her datebook. She smiles, understands.

                                 RITA
                        Probably worries them, huh...?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Probably does.

           ON THE DOCKS, the FERRY makes landfall. And off steps...

           JOHNSTON’S DAUGHTER & GRANDSON. Meet BARBARA (30) and RICHIE 
           (8). Johnston approaches, sharing a warm EMBRACE. Then, he 
           KNEELS DOWN, presenting the TUGBOAT to his grandson.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Just like the real one...

           As the kid lights up, Johnston teases him:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        No school today?

                                 RICHIE
                        I’m visiting you, grandpa.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I see. But when you get back, 
                        how’re you gonna explain you spent 
                        the day in the slammer?
           The kid shoots a worried look to his mother.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (amused)
                        Don’t worry. If you’re extra good, 
                        I can grant you a pardon.

                                 RICHIE
                        What’s a pardon?

           Johnston grins. Barbara & Ida Mae can’t help but be amused. 

                                 RICHIE
                        Can we see the starfish now?

                                 IDA MAE 
                        Maybe in a bit. First... we eat. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FAMILIAR HOUSE on the coastline. QUIET JAZZ PRE-LAPS...

           INT. STUDY - WARDEN’S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Inside, we’re confronted by the FACE of WARDEN JOHNSTON... 
           rendered in OIL PAINT. WIDENING OUT, reveals... 

           A FRAMED PORTRAIT OF JOHNSTON, hanging in a room of carved 
           oak. A POT ROAST steams on the dining room table. Silverware 
           softly clanks on porcelain. The Johnstons enjoying lunch...

                                 IDA MAE
                        ... And how’d today go... with the 
                        Mayor’s people?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        If there was a slice of bread for 
                        every idiot the Mayor hired... we’d 
                        cure world hunger.

           Ida humors him with a supportive nod, then turns to Barbara:

                                 IDA MAE
                        Means a lot. You coming out here.

                                 BARBARA
                        Richie loves it here. Just wish Dad 
                        could’ve taken the day off...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... You know how it is, Barbara.

           By the look of Barbara’s face, she knows all too well. Soon, 
           a quiet NOISE breaks the silence...

           BUBBLES. Forming in Richie’s MILK. A stern look from Barbara 
           and Richie stops. As he goes back to sipping his straw -- 
           -- he eyes the PORTRAIT of Johnston above the mantelpiece.  

                                 RICHIE
                        That looks like you, grandpa.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        An inmate painted it. Guards found 
                        it during a cell check, gave it to 
                        me at last year’s Christmas party.
                             (amused, to Ida)
                        These men have their memories. 
                        Their dreams. And their hobbies. 
                        Anything that keeps ‘em busy...

                                 IDA MAE
                        Actually grown quite fond of it.

                                 BARBARA
                        But isn’t that stealing...?

           BEAT. Johnston clocks to Barbara, stern. A tense moment, 
           then... he goes back to eating. But Barbara isn’t finished:

                                 BARBARA
                        You’re not going to answer me? It 
                        wasn’t yours to take... 
                             (silence... then:)
                        It’s not enough that you spend all 
                        day in that place. But you have to 
                        bring a piece of it home? Make Mom 
                        eat amongst it? 

           Upset, she gets up from the table, beginning to CLEAR the 
           dishes. As Ida helps, Richie looks to Johnston, confused. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Guess she didn’t like the panting.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CRASHING WAVES, framing Ida & Barbara as they walk the 
           plateaued lawn. Barbara stops, staring off into the distance.

           EXT. BACKYARD - WARDEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           ALONG THE SHORE, a CIVILIAN GUARD has a smoke, keeping an eye 
           on Richie... who plays with his TUGBOAT at the water’s edge. 

                                 IDA MAE (O.S.)
                        Richie’ll be fine with him. 

           Ida’s voice brings Barbara’s attention back around. Mother 
           and daughter share a look... then:

                                 BARBARA
                        You know... every time I’m here, I 
                        think about Richie running around 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        this island. Can’t imagine him 
                        calling this home... 

           The statement catches Ida off-guard. Before she can respond, 
           Johnston approaches from the house. A tense beat... then:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        We should take Richie to the 
                        lighthouse. You used to love it up 
                        there when you were a kid...

           With a conflicted smile, Barbara looks to the island’s 
           LIGHTHOUSE in the distance. She holds her gaze, nostalgic. 
           Turning back to her father, a silent moment’s shared... Then:

                                 BARBARA
                        Why do you stay here, Dad? Day 
                        after day with these people. You 
                        could retire...

           Taken back, Johnston turns to Ida...

                                 IDA MAE
                        ... It’s a fair question, James.

           Unresponsive, Johnston just looks off to the crashing waves.

                                 BARBARA
                        You know, this is exactly why Paul 
                        doesn’t speak to you anymore...

           BEAT. Johnston tightens. Hearing that name affects him...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Your brother’s choices are his own.

                                 BARBARA
                        And your choices? They affect us 
                        too, Dad. You made us grow up like 
                        this. Here. Among this. And now you 
                        still put Mom through it. Stuck on 
                        this island --
                             (she stops, calming)
                        We just worry about you, Dad.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        This... is the job. And while your 
                        brother chooses not to accept what 
                        I do... I’m thankful you’ve always 
                        been so understanding. 

           Barbara knows she’s hurt his feelings. But before she can 
           speak, Johnston takes out his pocketwatch. TICK-TICK-TICK...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Have to be getting back to work. 
                        We’ll talk at dinner. We will...
           CLICK. He SHUTS his watch, offering Barbara a soft smile.   
           As Barbara watches her father leave, we’re overtaken by...

           A STARK WIDE, tracing the crest of the hill. And as Johnston 
           walks away from his home, we PRE-LAP the SHARP RINGS of --

           INT. CELLHOUSE - DAY

           -- THE CELLHOUSE COUNTBELL. Inmates turn attentively as 
           Ernest follows Miller, conducting the afternoon HEADCOUNT. 

           TRACKING PAST CELLS, we glimpse familiar inmates: THOMPSON, 
           resting on his cot... HUBBARD, looking to the clock... 
           SHOCKLEY, shining his shoes... CLARENCE, gripping his cell 
           bars... CRETZER, doing push ups on the concrete... THE 
           BIRDMAN, working on SKETCHES of his INJURED BIRD. And soon...

           COY, in his cell. We immediately notice it’s filled with 
           PAINTING SUPPLIES and CANVASES. Most of his paintings are 
           LANDSCAPES of far-away lands... But one of them is different. 
           A PORTRAIT of a WOMAN. Coy stares at it... until -- 

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER (O.S.)
                        -- Coy, you’re back on work-duty...

           C-THUNK! His cell RACKS OPEN. Coy turns from the painting... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A STEAM WHISTLE. Shrieking as LINES OF INMATES are --

           EXT. REC YARD - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- marched out of the cellhouse and across the REC YARD... 
           shuffling to work at the island’s seaside FACTORIES.

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           THUNK! CAPTAIN MORRIS (older, paternal) LOCKS the REC YARD 
           DOOR behind the last inmate, then turns & walks, KEY IN HAND.

           INT. LIBRARY - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Clarence pushes a LIBRARY CART as Coy PULLS various books 
           from cluttered shelves...

                                 CLARENCE
                        Appreciate it... always requesting 
                        my help in here.

           Coy stacks more TRAVEL BOOKS onto the cart -- BERMUDA, FIJI, 
           BARBADOS -- soon whispering to Clarence. Intense, resolute:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        You feelin’ up to this, old-timer? 
           Clarence stalls, indecisive... Just then, Coy HEARS IT: the 
           FINAL BELL. Quickly, he PEEKS around a shelf, spying...

           A VISION PANEL. Reflected in its mirror: THE GUN GALLERY.

           Coy watches as the GALLERY GUARD -- BURCH (younger, skinny) -- 
           SCANS the block. No movement. No activity. Business as usual.

           Satisfied, Burch quickly moves to the EXIT DOOR. OPENS IT --

           EXT. CATWALK - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- emerging onto a suspended walkway. In a blink, he pulls a 
           CIGARETTE. LIGHTS IT. Takes a soothing DRAG, as --

           INT. CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- WHAM! The door SHUTS behind him, ECHOING the block.

           IN VARIOUS CELLS, Cretzer, Thompson, Hubbard and Shockley all 
           FREEZE at the sound. They know what it means...

                                                                CUT TO:

           CAPTAIN MORRIS, approaching the MAIN DESK, eyes tilting to --

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           -- THE GALLERY above, but... Burch is gone. Morris just 
           shakes his head, POCKETING THE KEY before taking a seat.

           INT. LIBRARY - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Coy methodically OPENS the travel books. Each of them is 
           HOLLOWED OUT. Inside: METAL PARTS: PIPES, WASHERS, SCREWS. 

           Quickly, Coy ASSEMBLES them using... THE ALLEN WRENCH. 
           SLIDING pipes. SPINNING washers. TWISTING bolts into some 
           kind of METAL CONTRAPTION.

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (clocks to Clarence)
                        Hang back and keep an eye on those 
                        mirrors... All’s gonna be fine. You 
                        just remember what I said ‘bout 
                        them banana trees.

           Anxious, Clarence offers a NOD. He’s ready. With that, we 
           PUSH IN on Coy, eyes filled with purpose...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE CELLHOUSE CLOCKFACE

           Its SECOND HAND sweeping around, soon MATCH-CUTTING TO...
           JOHNSTON’S POCKETWATCH

           Satisfied, he SNAPS it shut, hiking in the shadow of...

           THE CELLHOUSE

           Inside, Coy turns his BOOK CART, SQUEAKY WHEELS headed for...

           TIMES SQUARE

           But as Morris HEARS IT, clocking his head, we’re back on...

           THE WATERFRONT

           Where the Civilian Guard springs up, PANICKED, eyeing...

           RICHIE’S TUGBOAT

           bobbing in the water. The boy nowhere to be seen. Soon...

           THE LIBRARY CART

           nears the MAIN DESK. Focused, Coy REACHES, surfacing with...

           THE METAL CONTRAPTION

           gripped tight in his hand. The cart QUICKENS, speeding for:

                                 CAPTAIN MORRIS
                        Shift’s over, Coy. Back in your --

           -- but as Morris steps forward, Coy SWINGS THE CONTRAPTION --

           -- WHAM! -- CLOCKING THE GUARD WITH A BRUTAL IMPACT.

           Morris DROPS to the floor. An unconscious heap. For a moment, 
           Coy just stands over him, stunned. No going back. Then...

           Coy snaps out of it. MOVING QUICKLY, he pulls his SHIRT OFF, 
           then OPENS another HOLLOW BOOK. Within it... a GLASS JAR.

           He UNSCREWS it. Scoops BLACK GREASE from inside. SMEARS it 
           over his back & torso. Finished, Coy BITES the METAL 
           CONTRAPTION in his teeth. Steps atop the desk, then --

           -- LEAPS UPWARD, GRABBING the low-hanging CAGE BARS of the 
           GUN GALLERY, PULLING HIMSELF UP, CLIMBING rung-over-rung.

           INT. VARIOUS - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cretzer, Thompson, Hubbard, and Shockley PRESS THEIR HEADS 
           against their cell bars, STRAINING to see Coy, while...

           IN THE LIBRARY, Clarence watches the VISION PANELS. Soon -- 
           INT. GUN GALLERY CAGE - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- Coy REACHES THE TOP, 30 feet off the ground. Balancing on 
           the CAGE ROOF, he takes the CONTRAPTION from his teeth --

           -- and carefully WEDGES it BETWEEN TWO BARS. And as he TURNS 
           the metal handle, it hits us... This is a bar-spreader.

           With EACH ROTATION, the BARS SPREAD ever-so-slightly. Coy 
           grins, getting aggressive. He CRANKS A TURN, but -- PLING! --

           -- the spreader SLIPS LOOSE, FALLING. COY GRABS FOR IT!

           IN THE LIBRARY & CELLS, Coy’s men GASP. BREATHS HELD...

           ON COY, eyeing his CLOSED FIST. Slowly opening it reveals...

           THE BAR SPREADER. Coy exhales. Close call...

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNSTON, trekking a cliffside footpath. Soon, he passes --

           INT. GUARD SHACK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- the window of one of the island’s small, wooden outposts, 
           where Ernest looks up from marking times on a CHARGE SHEET. 
           The young guard eyes Johnston. Suddenly, he hears a SHUFFLE --

           -- Ernest SPINS. It’s Miller, unfolding a NEWSPAPER as he 
           kicks back in a chair. Off his SCOWL, Ernest returns to work.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FINAL CRANK. Finished, Coy eyes an 8-inch GAP in the bars --

           INT. GUN GALLERY CAGE - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           -- Satisfied, he BREATHES DEEP... then EXPELS ALL HIS AIR --

           -- SQUEEZING HIS BODY THROUGH THE BARS. His greasy midsection 
           slips through. But suddenly... the bars CATCH ON HIS RIBS.

           Coy STRUGGLES.... If he takes a breath, he’ll be stuck.

           EXT. CATWALK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Burch STAMPS OUT his finished cig. Grabs the DOOR HANDLE --

           -- but STOPS, PANNING the quiet island. Empty REC YARD. Gulls 
           squawking from GUARD TOWERS. Business as usual. With that --

           -- Burch RELEASES the handle... LIGHTING another cigarette.
           INT. GUN GALLERY CAGE - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           ON COY, nearly out of air. A FINAL, PAINFUL PUSH... then --

           -- WHUMP. His FEET drop to the gallery floor. He’s in.

           FROM THEIR CELLS, Coy’s men PAN THEIR GAZE as their leader 
           JOGS the wrap-around level like an indoor track, DUCKING low 
           behind the gallery’s waist-high METAL SHIELDING.

           Reaching the CATWALK DOOR, Coy quickly CLIMBS a wall pipe. 
           Now ABOVE THE DOOR, he STOPS. Waiting... Waiting...

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNSTON, still on the move, HIKING for a ROCKY OVERLOOK...

           EXT. CATWALK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           ... MID-DRAG, Burch spots Johnston across the island. Shit. 
           Quickly, he DROPS his cig, OPENS THE CATWALK DOOR, ducking --

           INT. GUN GALLERY - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- inside. As the DOOR SHUTS... COY DROPS, TACKLING BURCH!

           In a blink, Coy CINCHES the guard’s NECKTIE tight. Burch 
           CLAWS, STRAINING for his PISTOL, GASPING as he loses air...

           IN VARIOUS CELLS, prisoners HEAR the struggle, clocking to 
           the GALLERY. Looks are swapped. Confusion... then shock as --

           -- WHAM! Coy PINS THE GUARD FACE-DOWN, HOLDING TIGHT until...

           Burch GOES LIMP. Coy rips the NECKTIE loose. TIES it around 
           the unconscious guard’s mouth -- A GAG -- then unloops his 
           BELT, PULLING IT TIGHT, securing Burch’s hands to the pipe.

           Finished, Coy grabs Burch’s RIFLE, PISTOL, and RING OF KEYS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ERNEST, eyes fixed on a WALL CLOCK as it clicks to --

           INT. GUARD SHACK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT

           -- 1:34pm. Restless, Ernest debates... then turns to Miller.

                                 ERNEST
                        Burch is late checking in, sir.

           Slowly, Miller LOWERS HIS NEWSPAPER, revealing a cold glare.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        How late?
                                 ERNEST
                        Four minutes.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Four... minutes? Ernest, unless 
                        there’s a real problem, let me 
                        enjoy the one thing that keeps me 
                        from hanging myself on this island.
                             (FLIPS paper up)
                        He’s probably just having a smoke.

           Ernest checks the clock again... then STANDS, faking a smile:

                                 ERNEST
                        Think I’ll go have one myself.

           As Ernest steps out, Miller’s eyes track him, suspicious...

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           COY’S FEET hit the floor. RIFLE SLUNG and PISTOL in his 
           waistband, he MOVES to a wall-mounted LEVER BOX...

           Using a KEY from the ring, Coy UNLOCKS IT. Scans the GEARWORK 
           inside, then swiftly... PULLS FOUR HANDLES.

           INT. VARIOUS CELLS - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           KA-THUNK! Cretzer’s BARS SLIDE OPEN. KA-THUNK! Thompson’s. KA-
           THUNK! Hubbard’s. KA-THUNK! Shockley’s. The men BOLT OUT...

           Shockley & Thompson beeline for Times Square, while Hubbard 
           ducks IN THE KITCHEN, grabbing A BUTCHER KNIFE. But Cretzer --

           -- PAUSES as he passes THE LIBRARY. INSIDE, Clarence just 
           stands there, unsure. In a blink, Cretzer YANKS the kid --

                                 CRETZER
                        Get your ass movin’!

           -- into the open cellhouse, SHOVING HIM for Times Square.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coy pulls his SHIRT back on... just as his men RUN IN: Six 
           strong. He TOSSES THE PISTOL to Cretzer, who catches it.

           Together, the cons DRAG Morris to his feet. Cretzer SLAPS the 
           guard across the face. Morris COMES TO... shaking his daze.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Wake up, Morris. Time to visit some 
                        friends-a-yours.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A RADIO. Wood-trimmed. Tinny speakers emitting --
           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           -- Frank Sinatra’s “Five Minutes More.” FOUR CONTROL GUARDS 
           hum along, filling out paperwork. Business as usual. Until...

           A TAP ON THE GLASS. The guards CLOCK to the sound, seeing...

           CAPTAIN MORRIS. Bloody face pressed against the exterior 
           pane. Cretzer holds a PISTOL to his head, flanked by Coy and 
           the others, VOICES MUFFLED by the bulletproof glass.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Open the door. Or you’ll be wiping 
                        his skull right off of this glass.

           A guard REACTS, reaching for an ALARM SWITCH, but Cretzer 
           DIGS the pistol into Morris’s temple. He HOWLS in pain.

           BACKING OFF, the guard HITS ANOTHER BUTTON. The DOOR UNLOCKS.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        On the ground, on the ground!

           Coy ENTERS, RIFLE TRAINED. Hubbard swings his KNIFE as the 
           cons FAN OUT, guards DROPPING to their stomachs.

           Sinatra’s CROONING CONTINUES as Shockley YANKS UP the guard 
           closest to a THICK STEEL DOOR at the back of the room.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        The combination.

           The guard glances to his colleagues. They shoot him looks: 
           Don’t do it. The guard hardens, shaking his head: No.

           CHK-CHUK! COY COCKS HIS RIFLE. AIMS IT AT THE GUARD’S HEAD.

                                 CONTROL GUARD
                        Alright, alright!

           The guard is SHOVED for the HANDWHEEL. He SPINS it left. 
           Right. Left again. THUNK! The door GRINDS OPEN, Sinatra 
           belting his finale as Coy ENTERS the room, taking in the --

           INT. ARMORY - CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- ARSENAL OF WEAPONS. Machine guns. Sniper rifles. Sidearms.

           A GRIN creeps across Coy’s face as the song CRESCENDOES.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. PANNING the vista, we slowly settle...

           EXT. OVERLOOK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           ... on Warden Johnston, taking it in. A man deep in thought. 
           SOUNDS filter in. The tide, SPLASHING against rocks. Birds, 
           CHIRPING in the sky above. Calm... broken by HURRIED STEPS.

           Johnston turns. Ernest approaches, face flush with concern.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Ernest. What is it?

                                 ERNEST
                        It’s Burch, sir --

           But before he can finish... Miller steps in.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        -- He just forgot to fill out some 
                        of his charge sheets. But Ernest is 
                        taking care of them.
                             (turning to Ernest)
                        Aren’t you?

           With a stern look, Miller waves Ernest along. For a moment, 
           Ernest pauses, debating... Then buckles. Eyes on the ground, 
           he shuffles off, Miller close behind.

           As Johnston fixes a curious gaze on his departing guards, we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           THUNK! A CELL DOOR OPENS. The FIVE CAPTIVE GUARDS are --

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           -- violently SHOVED inside. Feet & hands BOUND with rope. 
           Mouths GAGGED. Captain Morris’s eyes widen as he takes in...

           COY & HIS MEN, armed to the teeth. Guns in every hand. Ammo 
           bandoliers slung. They look like a military unit.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        So long, fellas.

           The guards SCREAM through gags as the CELL DOOR SLAMS SHUT.

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           SPRINTING, Coy & his men SKID to a stop at the REC YARD DOOR.

           Moving like a well-oiled machine, Coy readies the KEY RING 
           while Cretzer & Shockley BREAK WINDOWS with their RIFLE BUTS, 
           AIMING BARRELS through the holes... at distant WATCHTOWERS.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Both towers, same time. Screws’ll 
                        think it’s a backfire from the 
                        Industries. Once we’re over the rec 
                        yard wall, make a break for 
                        Civilians’ Row. One hostage each.
                          CRETZER
                                                        THOMPSON
           Can’t wait to find me a 
           pretty one.
                                              Have had my eyes on that 
                                              little blonde number.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        This is business. Remember that.

           Coy levels a cold stare. Cretzer returns to his SCOPE POV: 
           Lining up a TOWER GUARD’s HEAD in his CROSSHAIRS.

           ON COY, brow furrowing as he JINGLES through the ring’s KEYS, 
           one after another. Soon, an eerie VOICE filters in...

                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ (O.S.)
                        It is said that observation is the 
                        key to understanding. True in 
                        science, true in life, true in men.

           FROM HIS CELL, The Birdman calmly watches Coy flipping 
           through KEY... after KEY... after KEY.

                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ
                        I’ve been observing you, Coy. 
                        Months ago, you stopped eating... 
                        so that when the time was right, 
                        you could fit through those gallery 
                        bars. A brilliant plan, I admit.
                             (beat)
                        You’re smart, Coy. Likely smarter 
                        than every man in here... save for 
                        me, of course.

           Coy ignores him, frantically SEARCHING. Something’s wrong...

                                 THOMPSON
                        The hell’s the matter, Coy?

                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ
                        But from experience, I must tell 
                        you all... even the smartest men 
                        cannot account for everything.

                                 CRETZER
                        ‘Nuff from you, Stroud! 
                             (squinting his SCOPE)
                        On my mark. Three... Two... One --

                                 BERNIE COY
                        -- Wait. It’s not here.

           The cons slowly CLOCK to Coy... who looks up... in disbelief.

                                 CLARENCE
                        What’s not?

                                 BERNIE COY
                        107. The yard key. It ain’t here.
                                 CRETZER
                        Well, where the hell is it?

                                                                CUT TO:

           CAPTAIN MORRIS, gritting teeth, fighting his binds to reach --

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           -- INTO HIS POCKET. Straining, his BLOODY FINGERS retrieve...

           A SINGLE KEY. “107.” The one we saw him pocket earlier.

           The OTHER GUARDS quickly SHUFFLE Morris to the back of the 
           cell, where he TOSSES the key into the TOILET with a SPLASH!

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER (PRELAP)
                        Go behind my back to Johnston again 
                        and you’re finished, got it?

           INT. GUARD SHACK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           ON ERNEST, seated in a chair while Miller BERATES HIM:

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        You been on The Rock, what... one, 
                        two years? And before that, you 
                        were some kinda school teacher.
                             (off Ernest’s surprise)
                        Guards talk, Ernest. Now take it 
                        from me, keep to yourself if you --

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        -- Associate Warden --

           -- Just then, ANOTHER GUARD enters. Oddly panicked.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Christ, what is it now? Did the 
                        goddamn janitor forget to check in?

                                 GUARD
                        No sir... the Control Room.

           PUSHING IN on Miller as his angry mug melts into... concern.

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           THUNK! The guards’ cell OPENS. Coy & Clarence RUSH IN.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Where’s the key?

           Morris MUMBLES through his gag. Coy YANKS HIM UP, glaring:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Don’t lie to me.
           But Morris doesn’t flinch. The moment lingers, until...

           ... Coy’s eyes drift to THE TOILET. DROPS OF WATER on the 
           metal seat. He THROWS Morris to the floor. Then --

           -- THRUSTS HIS ARM into the bowl, REACHING DEEP. Soon... 
           SPLASH! Coy REELS IN HIS ARM. OPENS HIS HAND. In it...

           THE KEY. Coy & Clarence swap relieved grins.

                                 ERNEST (PRELAP)
                        We should really tell the Warden...

           INT. GUARD SHACK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - CONTINUOUS

           Ernest’s eyes dart the room as THREE OTHER GUARDS work 
           swiftly, trading their PISTOLS for BILLY CLUBS. RIOT STICKS.

                                 GUARD WEINHOLD
                        And get our boys written up?

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Besides, it’s probably just a 
                        scuffle. Some con off his pills.

                                 GUARD BRISTOW
                        We need a fourth. To cover exits.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        You’ve got one.

           Miller slaps a “GAS BILLY” in Ernest’s hands. Overwhelmed, he 
           eyes the heavy club’s TRIGGER MECHANISM.

                                 GUARD WEINHOLD
                        Pull that and cons’ll get quite the 
                        surprise. Nasty stuff, gas pellets.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Just make it quick... and quiet. I 
                        want that cellhouse clear before 
                        the Warden gets back. Now, move.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A KEY. JAMMED into the rec yard door lock. But PULLING BACK --

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           -- reveals it’s not 107... but the KEY RING, held by Cretzer.

                                 CRETZER
                        Dammit, one-a-these’s gotta be it!

           He FORCES another key in, STRAINING TO TWIST IT. Suddenly --

           -- Coy & Clarence ROUND A CORNER just as the KEY TURNS OVER --
                                 BERNIE COY
                        No, WAIT!!

           -- THUNK-THUNK-THUNK. A chain reaction unfolds, DEADBOLTS 
           POPPING into place, SEALING the door shut. A failsafe lock.

           Stunned to the core, Coy DROPS KEY 107 to the floor. CLANG!

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE CIVILIAN GUARD, running through a garden footpath --

           EXT. GARDEN - WARDEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           -- soon coming upon Ida Mae & Barbara, snipping flowers. They 
           LOOK UP as the guard RUSHES IN, out of breath.

                                 IDA MAE
                        Richie have fun at the lighthouse?

                                 CIVILIAN GUARD
                        Been looking all over for you, 
                        ma’am...

           Seeing the guard alone, Barbara STANDS, DROPPING her flowers.

                                 BARBARA
                        Where’s Richie?

           INT. MAIN GATES - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           With stealth, Ernest and the GUARD TEAM slip through the MAIN 
           GATES, easing the doors CLOSED, pausing as they see...

           THE EMPTY CONTROL ROOM. Swapping looks, they PUSH ON.

                                 CRETZER (PRELAP)
                        What now, Coy?

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           ON COY, back against the yard door. Gut-checked. Mind racing.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        I’m thinking...

                                 CRETZER
                        Well get finished thinkin’ real 
                        quick. We ain’t got time.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        If you hadn’t jammed the lock, we’d 
                        have all the time we need!

                                 CRETZER
                        I don’t like your tone.
                                 CLARENCE
                             (stepping in)
                        Careful, Dutch --

                                 CRETZER
                        -- Watch your mouth, Injun.

           That triggers Clarence. He SPRINGS, PINNING Cretzer. WHAM!

           INT. BROADWAY - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Ernest and the guards EMERGE into the cellhouse, passing the 
           MAIN DESK. No Morris. Just a BOOK CART, GREASE JAR, and...

           BLOOD. Splattered across the floor. Grave looks are traded.

                                 GUARD WEINHOLD
                             (hushed, to Ernest)
                        Wait here. Watch the exit.

           Ernest stays behind as the guards DRAW CLUBS... ADVANCING.

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Coy YANKS Clarence off Cretzer, who RISES, GUN AIMED. SO DOES 
           CLARENCE. BARRELS in each other’s faces. A stand-off.

                                 CRETZER
                        Gimme a reason, kid.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Why, can’t find your own?

           Coy STEPS IN.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Listen to me. We’ve got less than 
                        ten minutes ‘till the shift change.

           ON CRETZER & CLARENCE, neither backing down. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        There’s gotta be another way out --

           -- But suddenly, Coy’s POV RACKS FOCUS from the men, to...

           THE GUARD TEAM, which ROUNDS THE CORNER at that very instant.

           EVERYONE FREEZES. A surreal moment of utter silence. Then...

           Cretzer RAISES his machine gun, TAKING AIM --

                                 BERNIE COY
                        NO! THEY’LL HEAR!

           -- B-B-B-BAM! Cretzer SQUEEZES HIS TRIGGER. A FLASH! --
           -- then a SCATTERSHOT SPRAY OF WILD BULLETS -- PING-PING! -- 
           SHELLS RICOCHET cellhouse walls -- GUARDS DIVING FOR COVER.

           E/I. VARIOUS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT

           ON THE OVERLOOK, Johnston spins to the sound.

           IN THE GUARD SHACK, Miller springs up from his chair.

           AT CIVILIANS’ ROW, Ida Mae & Barbara freeze, hearing it.

           IN THE ADMIN BUILDING, Rita & staff look up from typewriters.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           In a blink, Ernest DUCKS BEHIND the MAIN DESK, terrified.

           EXT. OVERLOOK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT 

           PUSHING IN on Johnston, SCANNING his island. Quiet once more. 
           Eerily so. Mind racing, his gaze lands on... A WATCHTOWER.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Ernest PEEKS from behind the desk as ANGRY SHOUTS ECHO the 
           block. Sounds of struggle. Pain. Then, he SPOTS...

           WEINHOLD. CRAWLING onto Broadway from behind C-Block. Ernest 
           SPRINGS UP, RUNNING for his fellow guard, fifty yards ahead.

           INT. WEST WATCHTOWER - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           A TOWER GUARD snaps up in his chair as Johnston finishes 
           CLIMBING the ladder, surfacing into the tower.

                                 TOWER GUARD
                        Warden, I didn’t know you were --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Binoculars.

           The guard scrambles for a pair of BINOCS. Hands them over.

           JOHNSTON’S BINOC POV: SCANNING the cellhouse WINDOWS. INSIDE, 
           there’s... MOVEMENT. Blurry figures chasing others. 

           INT. BROADWAY - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Ernest NEARS Weinhold, SLOWING as he sees the man is BLEEDING 
           from a bullet hit. Weinhold SPOTS HIM, waving him off.

                                 GUARD WEINHOLD
                        Get outta here, dammit! Get help!

           Just then, Cretzer RUSHES IN, spotting Ernest down the block.
                                 CRETZER
                        Sam! Get him!

           Ernest U-TURNS, BOLTING for the MAIN GATES. Shockley SPRINTS 
           after him, TAKING THE CUT OFF, GAINING. Soon, HE LUNGES --

           -- FINGERS NICKING Ernest, but our guard’s too fast. He’s 
           nearly reached the end of the block... when Coy SPOTS HIM.

           Thinking fast, Coy runs to the LEVER BOX. YANKS A HANDLE.

           A CELL DOOR SWINGS OPEN -- THUNK! -- CLOCKING ERNEST, mere 
           feet from safety. The young guard GOES DOWN with a THUD!

           INT. WEST WATCHTOWER - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT

           Johnston LOWERS his binocs, uncertain, thinking. Soon... his 
           eyes settle on the tower’s... ROTARY PHONE.

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           WHAM! Ernest, Weinhold, and the guard team are THROWN into 
           the cell with the others. The BARS CLOSE... THUNK!

                                 CRETZER
                        How’s it feel, screws? To be on the 
                        other side of them bars?

           Cretzer RUNS HIS GUNBARREL across the bars. KLNK-KLNK-KLUNK.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Cretzer, that’s enough.

                                 CRETZER
                        Think I’m joking? I want an answer.

           Cretzer AIMS HIS GUN. The guards COWER BACK, Ernest briefly 
           locking gazes with Clarence, the young men’s eyes telling us: 
           They didn’t sign up for this. Tension peaks, when suddenly --

           -- RIIIIIIIING! The sound ECHOES the space. Coy & his men 
           SWAP PERPLEXED LOOKS... turning their heads to the:

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The RINGING continues as Coy steps inside, his men behind 
           him. On the CONSOLE, a light blinks, labeled: “WEST TOWER.”

           ON COY, eyeing the RECEIVER. Uncertain, thinking...

           INT. WEST WATCHTOWER - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT 

           ON JOHNSTON, receiver to ear. No answer. He HANGS UP.

                                                                CUT TO:

           WINGTIPS ON CONCRETE as Johnston quickly winds the path --
           EXT. OCEANFRONT PATH - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- soon joined by Miller, anxious, out of breath.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Control room’s not answering.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Probably just a glitch with the 
                        phone lines. Shift change isn’t for 
                        another ten minutes.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Seven.

           Miller looks to his watch. He’s right...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (determined)
                        We do this by the book. Secure the 
                        island... then we send a team in.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                             (reluctant but firm)
                        ... I already did. Four men.

           BEAT. Johnston STOPS, stunned. Miller braces for a response.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Without consulting me?...
                             (off Miller’s nod)
                        And what about Ernest?

           No response from Miller. His silence says it all.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (grave)
                        Man’s got a kid on the way...

           Our Warden shakes his head, simmering... then LOCK EYES:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Issue a lockdown order. Perimeter 
                        established. All boats sent to sea. 
                        Civilians’ quarters secured. Make 
                        us an island, Mr. Miller.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Yes, sir. The siren?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        No need to show our cards just yet. 
                        In the meantime, ring every damn 
                        post in that cellhouse.
           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           RIIIIIING! Suddenly, another ring ECHOES across the building, 
           from the kitchen. Coy & his men CLOCK in its direction.

           RIIIIIING! Another one, this time from the gun gallery. Then 
           more, FROM ALL OVER the cellhouse.

           PUSHING IN on Coy, face flush with growing dread.

           EXT. VARIOUS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           IDA & BARBARA are on the move, panicked... when suddenly, 
           they’re blind-sided by a flood of PRISON PERSONNEL, their 
           path BLOCKED as Johnston’s order travels the island:

           PATROL GUARDS receive calls. Bark into RADIOS.
           TOWER GUARDS AIM RIFLES at the cellhouse.
           GUARDS MOUNT UP, holstering GUNS & GAS BILLYS.
           MEN FAN OUT, perched on rocks, behind brick walls. 

           ... All forming a secure perimeter around the cellhouse.

           INT. INDUSTRIES BUILDING - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           A WHISTLE BLOWS! Heavy machinery WINDS DOWN: CONVEYOR BELTS, 
           DRILL PRESSES. Inmates STOP THEIR WORK as GUARDS ADVANCE.

                                 INDUSTRIES GUARD
                        Everyone, tools down! Now!

           Guards quickly CONFISCATE hammers, awls, nails... everything. 

                                 INDUSTRIES GUARD
                        You’re all to remain at your 
                        stations until further notice.

                                 INDUSTRIES INMATE
                        The hell’s going on?!

                                 INDUSTRIES GUARD
                        Relax. You just got the day off.

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           PROPELLERS CHURN FOAM as the island’s BOATS -- a supply 
           barge, the midday ferry, trawlers -- all head for OPEN WATER.

           EXT. CIVILIANS’ ROW - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           Guards HERD women & children into the APARTMENTS. Amid the 
           frenzied bustle, we spot... the very pregnant JANICE LAGESON.

           INT. CELL BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           THROUGH WINDOWS, Coy and his men watch guards -- a hundred 
           strong -- settle into place around the island, GUNS AIMED.
           Stepping back, the cons SWAP GRAVE LOOKS. The jig is up...

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           Johnston ENTERS. His staff quickly buzzes back to work, 
           clearly on edge. Rita approaches, but he keeps moving.

                                 RITA
                        Warden, what’s going on?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- In a minute, Rita.

           Johnston enters his office, abruptly SHUTTING THE DOOR.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

           Quieter now. Johnston paces alone... deep in thought.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           Coy’s men FOLLOW HIM as he frantically LOOKS THROUGH WINDOWS. 
           EACH POV reveals MORE GUARDS, GUNS AIMED. No way out...

                                 HUBBARD
                        Shit, they’re everywhere...

                                 CRETZER
                        We gotta blast out right now, 
                        before they send in more screws. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        We take one step outside and we’re 
                        as good as dead, understand? Now 
                        god dammit, let me think.

           PUSHING IN on Coy, tumbling options amid the EERIE QUIET.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - THAT MOMENT

           PUSHING IN on Johnston. A decision. He GRABS HIS DESK PHONE.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Suddenly, RIIIIIING! AN INCOMING CALL breaks the silence.

                                 CLARENCE
                             (pleading)
                        Bernie, let’s just call it off.

           ... But as his men continue to ARGUE, Coy looks to the 
           console. A LIGHT BLINKS by a new label: “WARDEN’S OFFICE.”

                                 CRETZER
                        Too late. Guards’ve seen our faces. 
                        Either we’re dead... or they are.
           ON COY. A decision. He SNATCHES the phone. His men FREEZE, 
           silent. But Coy says nothing... Just holds the receiver.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

           For a moment, quiet. Then Johnston speaks:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Who is this?

           INTERCUT with Coy in THE CONTROL ROOM:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Jung had it backwards, Warden... 
                        “He who looks inside, dreams. He 
                        who looks outside... awakes.”

           ON JOHNSTON as it hits him. The voice belongs to:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Coy...
                             (a grave beat)
                        Jesus, what have you done?

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (hardening)
                        I’d be more worried about what we 
                        might do... to your guards.

           A gut punch. But Johnston maintains composure, unwavering:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        How many?

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Nine of ‘em. Captain Morris --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (calculating)
                        -- Burdett, Bristow, Sundstrom, 
                        Baker, Weinhold, Simpson, Corwin...
                             (shakes his head)
                        ... and Ernest.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Not bad, Warden.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Think I don’t know my own prison?

           Johnston’s cold delivery unsettles Coy, but he pushes on:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Then you must know Burch ain’t 
                        respondin’ from the gallery. We’ve 
                        got his keys, and helped ourselves 
                        to a few treats from the armory.   
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNIE COY (CONT'D)
                        A shame Weinhold took a hit when he 
                        stuck his nose in our business.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Alive?

                                 BERNIE COY
                        At the moment.

           Johnston shifts, uneasy... Our unshakable Warden taken aback.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Those men have families. Children. 
                        Some they’ve yet to meet...

           PUSHING IN on Coy... The statement seems to land with him.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        No one has to get hurt, Warden. But 
                        that’s up to you. Like you’ve said, 
                        this island’s all about rules. And 
                        nothing’s changed ‘cept the ones 
                        givin’ em. And here’s ours.
                             (beat)
                        Rule one. None of your men come 
                        inside the cellhouse. We like ‘em 
                        right where they are.
                             (beat)
                        Rule two. No one alerts the police. 
                        Let’s keep this our little secret.
                             (beat)
                        Rule three. We make demands, you 
                        grant ‘em. No questions asked.

           Coy’s men swap looks, impressed. Coy’s in control... 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Break any of the rules, we start 
                        killin’ guards. And I know you 
                        don’t want that.

           For a moment, Johnston simmers. Moments pass... then:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Neither do you.
                             (beat, intense)
                        You want to talk rules? Let’s talk, 
                        Coy. Know the penalty for the 
                        murder of a penal officer? I’d 
                        wager you only need one guess.

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (pushing through)
                        A boat. That’s our first demand. We 
                        were gonna take one without asking, 
                        but now you’re gonna find it in 
                        your heart to give us one.
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I asked you a question, Coy.
                             (stern)
                        At San Quentin, I oversaw more 
                        executions than I care to remember. 
                        Watching inmate after inmate in the 
                        gas chamber... choking on poisoned 
                        air. Struggling against their 
                        binds. And just before the light 
                        went out of their eyes... I could 
                        see each man regretted everything 
                        that brought them there.
                             (beat)
                        If Weinhold dies... you’re sitting 
                        in that chamber by Christmas, Coy.

           The cons watch as Coy’s confidence seems to evaporate.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You want a boat. I want my guard. 
                        Now, before my man bleeds out... I 
                        need you to make a choice. And I 
                        need you to make it quickly.

           Coy fidgets... covering the receiver... turning to his men:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        The Warden wants Weinhold.

           Furious, Cretzer shakes his head: No. Coy glances OUT THE 
           WINDOW, eyeing the PERCHED GUARDS... then resumes the call:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        ‘Spose we agree... what about our 
                        boat?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Weinhold lives... and we’ll see 
                        about your boat. You have my word.

           CLOSE ON COY, weighing the options. He locks eyes with 
           Cretzer, who stews... then Clarence, who panics. Finally:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Alright, Warden. But here’s how 
                        it’s gonna work. You send in one 
                        screw through the main gates. We 
                        search him and if he’s unarmed, 
                        we’ll let him walk out with 
                        Weinhold. That’s the deal.
                             (looks to the clock)
                        You have ten minutes.

           With that... CLICK. Coy HANGS UP.
           Slowly, Johnston receivers the phone. Methodically, he pulls 
           his POCKETWATCH -- TICK-TICK-TICK -- setting its timer to ten 
           minutes. Soon, our Warden’s eyes fall on...

           THE ALCATRAZ MODEL. Johnston walks to it. Puts his hands on 
           its edge, absorbing the island. His prison. His home. And 
           with that, he PUSHES THE WHEELED MODEL through the doors --

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

           -- into the BULLPEN. Everyone STOPS THEIR WORK, eyeing 
           Johnston and the MODEL, now in the center of the room.

           He waits for quiet, then gestures to the model:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I won’t mince words. A group of 
                        inmates has escaped, seized the 
                        cellhouse, armed themselves... and 
                        taken nine guards hostage. 

           His staff GASPS, shocked. Rita beyond concerned. Just then --

           -- DOORS SWING OPEN. Miller walks in. More guards follow.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Island’s secure, Warden.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Good. This building will serve as 
                        our base of operations.
                             (turns, addresses all)
                        Make no mistake, Alcatraz no longer 
                        belongs to us. But I promise you 
                        all... if we do our jobs, work 
                        together, and follow protocol... it 
                        will be ours again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           WHAM! Coy’s SLAMMED against the GLASS by Cretzer. It CRACKS.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - DAY

                                 CRETZER
                        I’m startin’ to think maybe you’re 
                        playing us for fools, Coy.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Was the only way to get our boat!
                             (gasping, choked)
                        If this goes south... and we got a 
                        dead guard on our hands... we all 
                        get the chamber. You know it, Joe.

           COY’S EYES find his men. They REACT, RIPPING Cretzer off him, 
           SHOVING the beast back. Coy STANDS TALL, FUMING:
                                 BERNIE COY
                        Until I’m dead... I’m leading this 
                        outfit. So you either kill me... or 
                        fall in line.

           ON CRETZER, spooked by Coy’s intensity. Finally... he NODS.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        If y’all keep your cool and do what 
                        I say, we’ll get outta here... and 
                        nobody’ll have to get hurt. Got it?

           No one objects. CLICK! Coy slaps a clip into his machine gun. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Spread out. I want every inch of 
                        this cellhouse covered.

           With that, Coy’s men BREAK, FANNING OUT across the cellhouse.

           ON CRETZER, taking position at B-Block. As he readies his 
           RIFLE, Johnston’s VOICE-OVER trickles in...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        Joe Cretzer. Five counts of bank 
                        robbery. Attempted escape from 
                        McNeil island. First degree murder. 
                        Serving a life sentence.

           ON HUBBARD & THOMPSON, taking position in the mess hall.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        Marvin Hubbard. Kidnapping, murder. 
                        Fifty years. Miran Thompson. 
                        Robbery, murder. Ninety-nine years.

           ON SHOCKLEY, eyes drawn to a SPIDER crawling up the wall.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        Sam Shockley. Armed robbery, 
                        kidnapping. Diagnosed with 
                        schizophrenia. Has the mental 
                        capacity of an 8-year-old child.

           ON CLARENCE, keeping watch on the guards. He LOCKS EYES with 
           Ernest, who WRAPS Weinhold’s torso with a MAKESHIFT BANDAGE. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        Clarence Carnes. Manslaughter, 
                        kidnapping. Life sentence. Youngest 
                        inmate to ever serve at Alcatraz.

           ON COY, taking a seat in the control room. Alone.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        And Bernie Coy...
           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - THAT MOMENT

           Johnston references MUGSHOTS, pinned to a CORKBOARD.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Bank robbery. Two counts. 
                        Career criminal... and a soldier, 
                        too. Served with the Army in WWI.
                             (beat)
                        The fact is: Coy and his men are 
                        armed... and extremely dangerous.

           Rita, the staff, Miller, and more guards all look on.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Now, we need to work fast. They’ve 
                        given us rules. No interference, no 
                        authorities. For the moment, I mean 
                        to follow them.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        And why’s that, Warden? Sounds like 
                        we’re taking orders from cons now.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Weinhold’s been shot.

           Everyone MURMURS. Miller fidgets as Johnston LOCKS EYES:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        And it’s up to us to get him out.

                                                                 BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   2:45 PM. 

           OVER BLACK, a sound. The stark SHUFFLING OF ITEMS as --

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           -- Coy RUMMAGES through desk drawers. Paperclips. Time cards. 
           Rubber bands. Finally, he finds what he was looking for...

           A PAD, A PENCIL, ENVELOPES. A quick look to make sure he’s 
           alone... then Coy POCKETS the items, eyes heavy.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER (PRELAP)
                        We do what Coy expects. Send a 
                        guard in through the front door... 

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - MOMENTS LATER

           Miller and the guards are gathered around Johnston’s ALCATRAZ 
           MODEL. Our Warden looks on as Miller presents his plan.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        But here’s what he won’t expect...
           He taps the elevated CATWALK, leading to the GALLERY DOOR.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        At the same time, a squad slips 
                        into the gun gallery and hides 
                        behind the shield. Once Weinhold’s 
                        out safe, they’ll unleash hell on 
                        the cons, but it’s just a trap. 
                        While they’re playing “OK Corral” 
                        with our gallery squad...

           Miller points back to the MAIN GATES.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        ... another wave comes in. By now, 
                        the cons’re cornered and we --

                                 GUARD BERGEN
                        -- We? You’re coming, too?

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Wouldn’t miss it for the world.

           Johnston eyes Miller, who stifles his grin, continuing:

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        We blast those bastards into the 
                        dining hall... and lock the doors.

           A slender, mustached guard speaks up: HAROLD STITES (49).

                                 GUARD STITES
                        Then what?

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                             (satisfied)
                        On my signal... we gas ‘em.

           The guards swap grins... all except Stites, who’s clearly 
           unsettled. Soon... Johnston looks up from the model:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Perhaps you’ve confused our beaches 
                        with those of Normandy, Mr. Miller.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Don’t see any other way, Warden. 
                        Take it from the man who deals with 
                        these bastards, day in and day out. 
                        If we go into that cellhouse 
                        unprepared... it’ll be our last 
                        mistake.

           A challenge. Johnston eyes his subordinate. As tension hangs, 
           the office door slowly CRACKS OPEN... Rita peeking in:
                                 RITA
                        Excuse me, Warden...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (ignoring, to the guards)
                        While the Associate Warden has a 
                        point, let us not forget these men 
                        are violent and unpredictable. I’ve 
                        seen many escape attempts. Ones 
                        fueled by rage, fear, revenge --

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                             (not backing down)
                        -- And which kind is this?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        One of desperation.
                             (beat, grave)
                        And we cannot afford to act 
                        desperately ourselves.

                                 RITA
                        Warden...

                                 GUARD STITES
                        We really should call the cops.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Coy made it clear. No police. If
                        sirens hit this island, who knows 
                        what they’ll do. You don’t corner a 
                        rabid dog.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        No... you shoot it.

                                 RITA
                        Warden Johnston...

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        -- James!

           Johnston finally looks as Rita OPENS THE DOOR, revealing... 
           IDA MAE, BARBARA, and the CIVILIAN GUARD.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You all really should be inside --

           -- But Johnston’s tone shifts as he notices the TEARS in 
           Barbara’s eyes. Slowly, she holds out... RICHIE’S TUGBOAT.

           ON JOHNSTON, face falling as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           VROOM! A rusty PICKUP TRUCK’s engine rattles to life as --
           EXT. DRIVEWAY - WARDEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           -- Miller RUNS IN, speaking to Johnston through the window.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Warden, if we don’t do something 
                        quick... we’re gonna lose Weinhold.

           PUSHING IN on Johnston at the wheel, tumbling options. He 
           pulls his WATCH -- TICK-TICK-TICK -- only two minutes left.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (decisive)
                        Very well. Proceed, Mr. Miller. 
                        Just get our men out safe.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Yes sir. We will...

           Miller nods, scurrying off. Now Ida Mae and Barbara step in. 
           His daughter’s beside herself... but his wife stays strong.

                                 IDA MAE
                        I’m coming with you, James.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Ida... it’s too dangerous. Take 
                        Barbara and stay inside the house.

           PUSHING IN on Johnston, calm and steady...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’ll find him.

           With a reassuring nod, Johnston REVS the engine... and the 
           old truck begins BOUNCING DOWN the SERVICE ROAD.

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - DAY

           The ROOM BUZZES, TYPEWRITERS RATTLING as Miller enters, 
           gesturing to a GROUP OF GUARDS, including GUARD BERGEN. 
           Quietly, they all gather around the ALCATRAZ MODEL. 

                                 GUARD BERGEN
                        What is it, Ed?

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                             (voice hushed)
                        Old man finally came to his senses. 
                        We’re taking the cellhouse.

           The guards swap looks, surprised... but then GRIN, eager.

                                 GUARD BERGEN
                        What about Stites?

           They glance across the room, where Rita confers with Stites.
                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Just get the squads ready. I’ll 
                        handle Stites.

                                                         MOMENTS LATER:

           Miller approaches Stites & Rita. His look: dead serious.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Harold... Warden’s orders. He wants 
                        you pulling Weinhold out.

                                 RITA
                             (crosses her arms)
                        That’s news to me.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Ma’am... that’s because you’re his 
                        secretary.
                             (looking to Stites)
                        I’d go myself... but Warden trusts 
                        you more than anyone.

           PUSHING IN on Stites, gears spinning. Then... he pulls his 
           PISTOL from his holster, handing it over to Miller.

                                 GUARD STITES
                        Weinhold would do the same for me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNSTON, driving past perched GUARDS, his head on a swivel --

           I/E. TRUCK / SERVICE ROAD - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- when suddenly, he BRAKES near a patch of ROCKY SHOALS.

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           THUNK! The guards’ cell OPENS. Coy looks on as Hubbard & 
           Thompson DRAG Weinhold out, his shirt now soaked with BLOOD.

                                 HUBBARD
                             (to Weinhold)
                        Your lucky day, screw.

           Ernest and the guards RUSH THE BARS, but -- CRACK! -- they’re 
           KNOCKED BACK by Cretzer. WHAM! THE CELL RACKS SHUT.

           EXT. MAIN GATES - CELLHOUSE - DAY

           As STITES walks for the cellhouse’s MAIN GATES --

           EXT. WATER TOWER / CATWALK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT 

           -- A SQUAD OF GUARDS, led by Bergen, emerges from behind the 
           WATER TOWER, creeping up METAL STAIRS, surfacing onto --
           -- THE CATWALK. Crouching low, they SHUFFLE ACROSS.

           EXT. ROCKY SHOALS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           Johnston SCRAMBLES over dark rocks, hit by FOAMY WAVES.

           The warden’s WINGTIPS slip. He TUMBLES on the JAGGED STONES, 
           but soldiers on, ROUNDING A BEND, EXHALING as he sees...

           RICHIE, exploring TIDE POOLS. He looks up, spotting Johnston:

                                 GRANDSON
                        Look, Grandpa!

           The boy holds up a dried-out STARFISH. RUSHING OVER, Johnston 
           can’t help but sigh with relief. Quickly, he PICKS UP Richie.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Come on, now. Your mother is 
                        worried sick.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           THUNK! The main gate CLOSES. Stites WALKS IN, hands up...

           Within moments, he’s GRABBED and SEARCHED by Hubbard & 
           Thompson, hidden on either side of the entrance. All clear.

           As Stites is PUSHED FORWARD... Weinhold comes into view, 
           propped against the cellhouse desk. Coy stands nearby.

                                 GUARD STITES
                        Hey there, Henry.

                                 GUARD WEINHOLD
                             (pained)
                        Hey there, Harold.

           FROM CELLS, prisoners strain to watch... Silent, on edge.

           INT. GUN GALLERY - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Bergen & his men quietly ENTER the gallery, FANNING OUT, 
           still ducked low, nearly hidden by the METAL SHIELD.

           Bergen PASSES Guard Burch, still tied to the pipe, mouth 
           gagged with his necktie. His EYES WIDEN as he sees --

           -- the squad reach their positions. Coiled. RIFLES AIMED. 
           Then suddenly, we’re startled by a LOUD WHAM! But it’s just --

           EXT. ROCKY SHOALS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT 

           -- Johnston’s truck door CLOSING, Richie seated safely 
           inside. Our Warden STARTS THE ENGINE. It PUTTERS. DIES...
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Piece of shit...

           STARFISH in hand, Richie SNAPS to his grandfather, frowning.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Sorry. Don’t tell your mother.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE / GUN GALLERY - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Coy HELPS Weinhold loop his arms around Stites’ shoulders.

           PUSHING IN on Cretzer, watching the display of mercy...

           IN THE GALLERY, guards watch, FINGERS ON TRIGGERS, as Stites 
           TURNS for the exit -- tension high -- but then he STOPS:

                                 GUARD STITES
                             (turning to Coy)
                        Thanks, Bernie.

           Coy nods. Cretzer LOOKS ON, fuming. But suddenly, his 
           expression changes. Glancing to a VISION PANEL, he spots...

           THE GALLERY SQUAD. GUARD HATS peeking over the shield.

           PUSHING IN on Cretzer. Confused, betrayed... furious.

                                 CRETZER
                        Hey Stites... You forgot something.

           Stites TURNS BACK as Cretzer APPROACHES. Suddenly, the con 
           RAISES HIS HAND. In it, a PISTOL. A moment of silence, then --

           -- BOOM! CRETZER SHOOTS STITES IN THE CHEST. POINT BLANK.

           Stites FALLS, Weinhold COLLAPSING beside him. Coy is frozen 
           in SHOCK. A split-second of STUNNED SILENCE, then...

           IN THE GALLERY, Bergen SCREAMS, SQUEEZING HIS TRIGGER!

           BULLETS SPRAY THE CELLHOUSE FLOOR, GUARDS FIRING FROM ABOVE.

           The cons REACT. RETURN FIRE. MACHINE GUNS FLASHING as --

           -- BULLETS RICOCHET THE GALLERY SHIELD -- WINDOWS SHATTER --

           EXT. SERVICE ROAD - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - CONTINUOUS

           -- PINGGG! THE TRUCK’S SIDE-VIEW MIRROR SPIDERWEBS, hit by a 
           rogue bullet. Richie SCREAMS! Johnston DUCKS HIM DOWN --

           -- as the truck’s WINDOWS EXPLODE. Crouched low, Johnston 
           TURNS THE KEY. The engine WHINES... FINALLY TURNING OVER --

           -- VROOOOM! -- WINGTIP TO PEDAL, JOHNSTON GUNS IT!
           EXT. VARIOUS / ISLAND PERIMETER - CONTINUOUS

           BAM-BAM-BAM! ALL OVER THE ISLAND, perimeter guards FIRE ON 
           THE CELLHOUSE. A deafening barrage.

           INT. SCHOOLHOUSE - CIVILIANS’ ROW - CONTINUOUS

           RAT-RAT-RAT! GLASS BREAKS. TEACHERS DUCK as CHILDREN TAKE 
           COVER under their desks, floorboards ERUPTING around them.

           EXT. MAIN GATE - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Miller and his squad CHARGE through the MAIN GATES --

           INT. CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- RAMPAGING into the cellhouse. SHOTGUNS BLASTS split our 
           ears as they ADVANCE. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Soon, they spot...

           STITES, WRITHING in pain, GASPING for air, BLOOD POOLING 
           beneath his body. Guards rush for him, PULLING him away as --

           -- Coy FALLS BACK, leaving Weinhold behind in the frenzy, his 
           men swiftly DUCKING behind cell blocks as BULLETS RICOCHET.

           IN CELLS, prisoners TAKE COVER under their cots. The Birdman 
           retrieves his GULL, cradling it gently as he COWERS BACK.

           IN THE GALLERY, Burch WINCES as BULLETS MISS HIM BY INCHES.

           IN COY’S EMPTY CELL, BULLETS SHRED HIS PAINTINGS TO BITS.

           BEHIND B-BLOCK, Coy MAKES A MOVE, UNLEASHING HELL WITH HIS 
           RIFLE -- BUT THWICK! -- A BULLET HITS HIM -- HE FALLS BACK --

           -- Clarence CATCHES HIM, all sound replaced by AWFUL RINGING. 
           Coy touches his head. BLOOD POURS. As SOUND RETURNS, we PULL 
           BACK, revealing... half of Coy’s ear has been blown off!

           EXT. SERVICE ROAD - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT 

           RICHIE SCREAMS as Johnston WEAVES the truck, BULLETS 
           RICOCHETING the road. FSSSH! A TIRE IS HIT, SPILLING AIR, the 
           truck now RUMBLING on three good wheels. Just then, AHEAD --

           -- BULLETS CLIP the METAL CHAINS securing a pallet of OIL 
           BARRELS. The links SNAP LOOSE, BARRELS TUMBLING DOWN THE 
           ROAD, right for Johnston’s truck!

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        HANG ON!!!

           Johnston SHIFTS. SLAMS THE PEDAL. The TRUCK ZOOMS BACKWARDS, 
           our Warden navigating with nothing but the REAR-VIEW MIRROR!

           BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! THE BARRELS GAIN. But at the last second --
           -- Johnston SWERVES INTO AN ALCOVE. The barrels BOUNCING PAST 
           THEM, HITTING ROCKS, LAUNCHING THEM into the OCEAN. SPLASH!

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Miller DUCKS into the Control Room. GRABS A RECEIVER.

           INT. GUARD SHACK - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT

           A PHONE RINGS. One of two GUARDS answers it. Over the BARRAGE 
           OF GUNFIRE, he hears a GARBLED VOICE:

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER (OVER RADIO)
                        ... Do n--... --lease... Gas!!!...

                         GUARD #1
                                                        GUARD #2
           I think it’s Miller!
                                              Hit the gas!

           The guard SLAPS A BUTTON on the shack’s console.

           INT. MESSHALL - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           With a HISS, GAS SLITHERS from the hall’s VENTS --

           INT. CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- NOW POURING into the cell block. Within moments, it 
           ENVELOPS THE SPACE. Everyone HACKS and COUGHS --

           -- STILL FIRING THEIR WEAPONS -- RAT-TAT-TAT! -- FLASHES OF 
           LIGHT PIERCING THE THICK HAZE. A cellblock engulfed in fog.

           ON MILLER, GUN UP, handkerchief to mouth, STALKING the block.

           Suddenly, he’s GRABBED FROM BEHIND. GUN KNOCKED AWAY.

           It’s Cretzer. He HOLDS A PISTOL TO MILLER’S HEAD. 

                                 CRETZER
                        So long, screw...

           But Miller STRAINS for his belt, SNAGGING... HIS GAS BILLY.

           Off-balance, Miller WHIPS THE CLUB towards Cretzer, but 
           MISSES -- PSSSHH! -- PELLETS EXPLODING IN A BURST OF SPARKS!

           CRETZER STUMBLES BACK, DAZED. MILLER SURFACES, and we see his 
           face... CHARRED, skin BURNT, PEELING OFF in bloody layers.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                             (screaming in agony)
                        FALL BACK! FALL BACK!!!

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - WARDEN’S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           SCREEEEECH! Johnston SKIDS the truck into the driveway.
           SMOKE DRIFTS PAST, escaping from the cellhouse. Richie 
           COUGHS, covering his mouth. AHEAD, Ida & Barbara RUN OUT --

           -- gathering the boy, HERDING him inside. In this moment, 
           Johnston STOPS, TURNING BACK... taking in the carnage.

           A STARTLING WIDE SHOT: Gas drifting from the cellhouse. The 
           echoing POPS of gunfire. Johnston’s worst nightmare...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE STUNNED FACE of a MOTORIST. Jaw agape, until --

           -- WHAM! He RAMS a car in front of him. Whiplash. WHAM! WHAM! 
           MORE CARS join the fender-bender. We CRANE UP, revealing...

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           We’re on the Golden Gate Bridge. Slowly, DRIVERS exit their 
           vehicles, looking to the BAY, stunned faces taking in...

           ALCATRAZ ISLAND. ERUPTING with the FLASH of GUNFIRE...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE SAME IMAGE. Now seen through the PANORAMIC WINDOW of --

           INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE - DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           -- a posh high-rise building. BENNETT and the ATTORNEY 
           GENERAL watch the distant carnage, in shock... as the sounds 
           of muffled GUNSHOTS mix with SOFT MUSIC from a record player.

                                 BENNETT
                             (snapping to an AIDE)
                        Get Presidio on the line... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A RINGING MILITARY PHONE. Soon snatched up by an --

           INT. OFFICE - PRESIDIO MILITARY BASE - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           -- ARMY LIEUTENANT. He LISTENS, eyes widening as he looks...

           OUT HIS WINDOW, where MARCHING SOLDIERS suddenly FALL OUT OF 
           SYNC, stunned gazes fixed on... ALCATRAZ, under siege.

           The Lieutenant lowers the phone, turning to another OFFICER:

                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                        Corporal... Find the General. Now. 

           As the man RUSHES OFF, the RHYTHMIC POPS of GUNFIRE become --
           INT. NEWSROOM - SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - DAY

           -- the SLAMMING OF TYPEWRITER KEYS. PULLING BACK reveals...

           STANLEY SULLIVAN (40s). A slender newsman with weasly 
           features. Grey fedora capped with a PRESS CARD.

           We GLIMPSE what he’s typing: A GOSSIP COLUMN. “Star Scoop! 
           Ingrid Bergman necks with Humphrey Bogart in SF...”

           But soon, he notices COLLEAGUES RUSHING BY in the hallway.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Hey, hey, hey! Where’s the fire?!

           A COLLEAGUE STOPS, leaning into Sullivan’s office.

                                 COLLEAGUE
                        Alcatraz! Damn thing’s gettin’ lit 
                        up. Looks like a fireworks show!

                                                               SLAM TO:

           A SOBERING HELICOPTER SHOT. SMOKE drifting from --

           EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- the shattered windows of the cellhouse, shot to hell.

           Slowly, the gunshots DISSIPATE -- POP-POP-POP!... POP-POP... 
           Pop... Soon replaced by... an eerie silence.

                                                                 BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   5:30 PM. 

           OVER BLACK... a forboding sound. The WAIL OF SIRENS, as --

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - SUNSET

           -- CROWDS OF CIVILIANS flood the foggy docks of Alcatraz. 
           INJURED GUARDS are evacuated on COTS. Panicked MOTHERS cradle 
           their CHILDREN, hurriedly boarding FERRIES... 

           AMIDST THE CROWDS, Johnston rushes in with his wife, 
           daughter, and grandson... scanning the growing CHAOS.

                                 IDA MAE
                        How bad is it?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I need you to keep families calm. 
                        Get them onto any boat with room. 
                             (looks to his daughter)
                        Call me when you get to the city.
                                 BARBARA
                        You’re staying?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        As long as we have men in that 
                        cellhouse -- 

                                 BARBARA
                        -- Mom, this is crazy. Talk to him.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’m not asking, Barbara. Get on 
                        that ferry. 

           Ida can see the determination in her husband’s eyes... Then:

                                 IDA MAE
                        Listen to your father. I’ll be 
                        close behind.

           Johnston huddles everyone together, the family sharing a hug. 

                                 RICHIE
                        I lost my boat, grandpa.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        But now you get to ride a real one.

           Richie offers a faint smile. And as they release... Barbara 
           shares a last look with her father, then heads for the ferry. 

           Johnston turn backs to Ida, a tender gaze shared.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You should go...

                                 IDA MAE
                        I hope you know what you’re doing.

           Suddenly, Miller & his men come limping in from the distance. 
           They’re battered, bloodied. Miller’s face covered with BURNS.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        Plans went to hell! Cellhouse 
                        turned into a damn war zone!

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Weinhold...? 

           The men share a solemn look, SHAKING their heads... Then:

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        It’s Stites, sir.... 

           As he steps aside, we see Stites... held up by guards.

                                                                CUT TO:
           STITES’S BODY. Carefully lowered onto the Warden’s couch...

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - MOMENTS LATER

           In his office, people are HUDDLED around: MILLER. GUARDS. THE 
           ADMIN STAFF. RITA. JOHNSTON. The silence is thick...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Give him some room!

           Johnston TEARS off his jacket, draping it over Stites. And 
           here... we finally see: Stites is alive... but barely. His 
           chest riddled with bullets, bloodied, gasping for air. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Henry...

           ... But that’s it. His eyes become dull. His breath... gone. 

           CLOSE ON JOHNSTON, his face flushed with shock, staring at 
           Stites’s empty expression. Suddenly, COMMOTION is heard...

           GUARDS’ WIVES push into the office. Familiar faces filled 
           with panic, confusion. Then, they see it --

           -- STITES, lying dead. And before Johnston can do a thing 
           about it... STITES’S WIFE begins to break down.

           Ida tries to console her. The sound of her muffled anguish 
           digs into Johnston as he sees... all eyes are looking to him.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’m sorry... but we did what we had 
                        to. Our men were in that cellhouse. 
                        Still are. We’re gonna get ‘em out.

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                        I’ll be damned if I put any more of 
                        my men in danger. You simply don’t 
                        know what these cons are capable 
                        of. Never have, Warden.
                             (points to Stites’s body)
                        Stites said it himself! We shoulda 
                        called the damn police. But you 
                        buckled to Coy’s demands. Tried to 
                        play the damn hero -- 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Now is not the time for this.

           The guards’ wives look on, distraught...

                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER
                             (points to guard’s wives)
                        They deserve to hear this. Every 
                        day you operate this place from 
                        behind a damn desk...
                                 (MORE)
                                 ASSOC. WARDEN MILLER (CONT'D)
                        Pretending you know how it works. 
                        And when shit hits the fan... what 
                        do you do? You send us into that 
                        cellhouse -- to risk our lives -- 
                        while you take care of your own.
                             (a heavy beat)
                        If Stites’s blood is on anyone’s 
                        hands... it’s yours.

           The guards’ wives stare at Johnston. And with that... Miller 
           & his men walk away, EXITING the room.

           CLOSE ON JOHNSTON, tumbling Miller’s point. Disturbed by the 
           notion. But before it can sink in, he’s SNAPPED out of it:

                                 JANICE (O.S.)
                        Warden...? 

           Johnston clocks his gaze... and sees Janice Lageson step 
           forward, hands on her pregnant bump. He can see her concern. 

                                 JANICE
                        Ernest. He’s been with you, right? 

           Johnston expression provides little comfort.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        We’re... gonna get him out, Janice. 

           BEAT. Silence blankets the room. Janice stunned to the core.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        In the meantime, there are ferries 
                        going to the mainland --

                                 JANICE
                             (holds it together)
                        -- I’m not leaving without my 
                        husband.

           Ida look over to Janice... and something clicks. A deep 
           realization. And with a resolute gaze, Ida turns to Johnston:

                                 IDA MAE
                        I’m staying too. We all are...

           BEAT. Johnston scans the guards’ wives, their firm eyes 
           staring back at him. He digs deep... then nods to the women:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Go to your homes, lock the doors. 
                        We’re gonna get your husbands out.

           As the wives clear out, Rita waves MEDICS into the office. 
           They load Stites onto a COT. And soon, all that’s left is... 
           THE COUCH, stained with Stites’s blood. Alone now, Johnston 
           looks to it. Disturbed. Then... peers out his WINDOW.

           ON THE DOCKS, Miller and his guards file onto a ferry. A 
           heavy beat, then... Johnston turns back. Rita’s still here.

                                 RITA
                        They’re taking Stites’s body to the 
                        mainland. Ida’s helping with his 
                        wife. The arrangement and such.
                             (silence... then:)
                        Don’t listen to Miller, sir. This 
                        wasn’t your fault. You ask me... no 
                        one could’ve seen it coming.

           Johnston nods. And soon... he’s struck by a thought. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Coy’s file... you still have it 
                        pulled from earlier?

           Rita approaches his desk, rummaging around, surfacing with 
           THE FILE. Johnston sits down and opens it: Coy’s MUGSHOT 
           staring back at him. Johnston absorbs his face... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’ve dealt with breakout crews my 
                        whole career. At Leavenworth. San 
                        Quentin. Here. 79 escape attempts 
                        from different lockups. 178 cons in 
                        total. And they all had one thing 
                        in common... Violent offenders.
                             (scanning the file)
                        Didn’t strike me earlier... but 
                        something’s different about Coy.

           Processing, Johnston rotates Coy’s file towards to Rita...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        He doesn’t fit the profile. 
                        Robbed some banks. Zero casualties. 
                        Before today... never hurt a fly.

                                 RITA
                        But what does that means for us?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        It means... maybe he can be 
                        reasoned with. 

           As the idea washes over him, an OFFICE WORKER rushes in: 

                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        Sir... we’ve got company.

           CIRCLING AROUND JOHNSTON, his anxious gaze finds the 
           window...
           ON THE OCEANFRONT, a FLEET of MILITARY VESSELS part the dense 
           fog... barreling down for Alcatraz Island.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           ARMY BOOTS. Touching down on the island with definite force. 
           As BATTALIONS of TROOPS storm The Rock, we BOOM UP to find --

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DUSK

           -- a gruff MILITARY GENERAL leading the charge. With wire-
           rimmed glasses, a battered campaign hat, and a face that 
           means business... meet “Vinegar Joe” Stilwell (60s). 

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Make a hole! 

           Troops scatter as he marches inland, barking orders...

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Listen up, shitbirds! I want a 
                        dozen men spying me a perimeter. I 
                        want intel on enemy forces. And I 
                        want it yesterday!

           Moving briskly, Stilwell blows right past Johnston.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Major -- 

           -- But it falls on deaf ears. As Stilwell MARCHES ON, 
           Johnston FOLLOWS behind, struggling to keep up. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Major...

           Weaving troops, Stilwell ignores him, barking more orders:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Any guards on firewatch, relieve 
                        them of their posts. Pronto!

           Johnston weaves through PLATOONS, which fan out all around. 
           Finally catching up with Stilwell, he TAPS his shoulder:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Major --

           The General spins around, facing Johnston.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        -- It’s General. And if you want to 
                        live to see another day... never 
                        creep up on me again.

           With that, Johnston backs off... 
                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        See all them boats? Get on one. 
                        That’s an order.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’m not a civilian... I’m the 
                        Warden of Alcatraz.

           The General grits his teeth, sizing him up.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        So... you’re the man responsible 
                        for this shitshow.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’m the man in charge. 

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        You telling me you command a prison 
                        detail dressed like... that?

           Stilwell curiously eyes Johnston’s tweed suit... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Not sure I follow.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Three-piece suits. One piece is for 
                        wiping your mouth. The other’s for 
                        wiping your nose. Guess what the 
                        third one’s for?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (unamused)
                        I don’t think you understand what 
                        we’re up against.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Wrong. You lost control of your 
                        post.  Now we have an armed 
                        conflict on our hands. And frankly, 
                        I don’t care if you are the damn 
                        Warden... you’re in my world now.

           Stilwell sarcastically SLAPS Johnston’s back, and WALKS AWAY, 
           disappearing into bustling scores of TROOPS. 

           Johnston watches him go, a determination brewing. And soon -- 

           EXT. OCEANFRONT PATH - CLIFFSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           -- our Warden is back on the move. Tracing the shoreline, 
           getting a better look at the Army’s activity. As he scans the  
           growing ENCAMPMENT from afar, he’s abruptly BLINDED BY...

           FLASHBULBS. Erupting from the water. Aboard a PRESS BOAT, we 
           recognize a familiar REPORTER flanked by NEWS PHOTOGRAPHERS.
                                 SULLIVAN
                        Have to say, Warden... Alcatraz is 
                        the gift that keeps on giving. 

           Johnston shields his eyes from the BRIGHT FLASHES to find... 

           Sullivan, amidst scores of PRESS BOATS circling the island. A 
           full-blown MEDIA CIRCUS. Johnston SHOUTS to Sullivan’s boat:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Slow news day, Sullivan? Or you 
                        just here to drag my prison through 
                        more mud?

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Where there’s a story... there’s 
                        Sullivan. You know this, Warden.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Guess I underestimated your passion 
                        for journalism. 

           As Johnston continues up the path, weaving ARMED TROOPS, the 
           PRESS BOAT keeps pace... following from the water. 

                                 SULLIVAN 
                        Stilwell’s a tough cookie, huh? 

           Johnston continues to walk, more annoyed by the second.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        I hear they call him “Vinegar Joe.” 
                        Peaceful negotiation... not his 
                        style. You guys working together?
                             (silence from Johnston)
                        From where I’m standing, it looks 
                        like you couldn’t handle the heat.
                        So they brought in the big guns. 
                        Care to comment, Johnston...?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Screw you, Sullivan. And you 
                        can quote me on that. Now don’t 
                        make me remind you of the rules --

                                 SULLIVAN
                        -- Yeah-yeah. Fifty feet from 
                        shore. We know the drill.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I see you an inch closer, and I’ve 
                        got a cell with your name on it.

           ON THE PRESS BOAT, Sullivan scowls, watching Johnston walk 
           off into the distance. After a beat, he raises his MIC... and 
           FLIPS the “LIVE” SWITCH on a RADIO BROADCAST TRANSMITTER:
                                 SULLIVAN
                        Tonight, as fear grips the nation, 
                        one question is on all of our 
                        minds... Will the Warden contain 
                        this Alcatraz blast-out? Or will 
                        the inmates escape, bringing their 
                        abject violence to the peaceful 
                        shores of the Frisco Bay...

           As Sullivan looks to the island, his VOICE BRINGS US TO --

           INT. GUARDS APARTMENTS - THAT MOMENT 

           -- A humble kitchen. Ida Mae, Janice, and the group of 
           guards’ wives work away, assembling SANDWICHES for dinner... 
           while VARIOUS CHILDREN gather around the RADIO:

                                 SULLIVAN (V.O.)
                        Some call it “The Rock.” I call it 
                        ”Devil's Isle.” But for the six 
                        convicts that called it home, today 
                        will forever be a day of infamy...

           WE MOVE ACROSS the children’s faces, held rapt by the 
           broadcast... pensively nibbling away at their sandwiches.

                                 SULLIVAN (V.O.)
                        ... And boy, what a seedy little 
                        cocktail of despair. Bloodlust... 
                        with a splash of depravity. Violent 
                        criminals who wanted out. And a 
                        desperate Warden struggling to keep 
                        them in. You heard it here first, 
                        folks. This is Sullivan, reporting 
                        from the “Battle of Alcatraz.” 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A STOVETOP OF BUBBLING POTS... SAUCES being STIRRED as -- 

           INT. MESSHALL KITCHEN - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           -- Hubbard prepares a humble dinner. Tasting some broth, he 
           seems satisfied, HUMMING along to a TUNE on the RADIO. As the 
           MUSIC ECHOES, we PULL AWAY... drifting into -- 

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- the dim cellhouse. Moving across the cement, we soon pass 
           the body of GUARD WEINHOLD, lying in a pool of blood. And as 
           our camera drifts further, it finally comes upon...

           FLICKERING LIGHT, beaming through the darkness. Moving 
           closer, we realize... it’s the BULB of a FILM PROJECTOR. 

           Cretzer, Shockley, and Thompson are watching a MOVIE. 
           PROJECTED ON THE WALL: “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”   
           As GRUMPY frowns to SNOW WHITE, Thompson & Cretzer howl with 
           LAUGHTER. Shockley just stares. His gaze vacant and still.

           Crezter looks over to the mess hall... yelling to Hubbard:

                                 CRETZER
                        We’re gettin’ hungry, chef!

           ACROSS THE ROOM, Clarence has various CELL KEYS spread out on 
           a table. He studies them, grouping them together by numbers.

                                 THOMPSON
                             (to Clarence)
                        We already tried those, kid.

           Cretzer points to the SEVEN DWARFS projected on the wall.

                                 CRETZER
                        Always thought Carnes was Bashful. 
                        Now I’m realizing... he’s Dopey!
                             (laughs, then:)
                        Come on, kid, make yourself useful. 
                        Go check on the screws.

           Begrudgingly, Clarence stands, grabs a PISTOL, and moves for:

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           The guards are quiet, tired. Young Ernest sits in the corner, 
           pensive. He watches Captain Morris, who appears to be... 
           WRITING ON THE WALL. Intricate NOTES scrawled in pencil.

                                 ERNEST
                        What’re you doing, Captain? 

                                 CAPTAIN MORRIS
                        Shhhh.

           Other guards stand, beginning to gather around. They inspect 
           Morris’ notes, and finally understand --

           -- He’s recording the NAMES of their captors: COY, CRETZER, 
           SHOCKLEY, HUBBARD, THOMPSON, CARNES...

                                 ERNEST
                             (panicked)
                        They’ll kill us if they see this.

                                 CAPTAIN MORRIS
                        If they do kill us, the Warden’ll 
                        know. Ringleaders and all...

           With that, Morris CIRCLES three names: CRETZER. HUBBARD. COY.

                                 CLARENCE (O.S.)
                        The hell you all doing? --
           -- STARTLED, the guards SPIN AROUND to find... CLARENCE. His 
           pistol AIMED directly at them. He’s nervous, shaky...

           The group of guards shuffle together, their bodies blocking 
           the notes on the wall. Ernest locks eyes with Clarence:

                                 ERNEST
                        We were just... tending to Morris. 

           Clarence pans to Morris. Sees a bloody GASH on his forehead. 
           Clocking back to Ernest, they share a silent look -- two 
           young men, both overwhelmed -- then, Clarence lowers the gun.

                                 CLARENCE
                        You all just behave in here. Or I’m 
                        gonna have to get Coy...

           As Ernest NODS, and the guards sit down, we finally come to:

           BERNIE COY

           in a quiet corner of the cellhouse. His face carries the 
           weight of the world. And as we WIDEN OUT, we understand -- 

           -- he’s in his own cell, working at a small desk. His 
           paintings & books are SHREDDED from bullets. However...

           A FAMILIAR BOOK is still intact: “The Exotic World of 
           Myanmar.” The pages are spread open as Coy pulls out the TEAR 
           SHEET bookmarks... methodically organizing them on the desk.

           CLOSER, we see Coy is TAPING THEM BACK TOGETHER. CLUSTERS OF 
           WORDS forming... a LETTER. And as the top corner gets 
           completed we finally see that it’s an ADDRESS in Kentucky. 

           Also on the desk: a familiar NOTE PAD, now filled with 
           writing. A NEW LETTER. Coy removes the sheets from the pad. 
           FOLDS them methodically. And slides them into an ENVELOPE. 

           ON THE ENVELOPE, he COPIES DOWN the address. And as Coy 
           finishes scrawling the word “KENTUCKY” -- 

           -- he looks up to a familiar PORTRAIT. The WOMAN rendered in 
           paint. And as he stares at it, becoming lost in her image... 
           COMMOTION rings out from afar. Coy SNAPS UP, panicked.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coy RUSHES IN, only to realize: his men are giving the chef a 
           STANDING OVATION... Hubbard presenting a LARGE POT OF STEW.

                                 HUBBARD
                        Dinner... is served.

           Off Coy’s relieved face, we...

                                                                CUT TO:
           BURNING FLARES. Red SMOKE snaking into the foggy night.

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - NIGHT

           Johnston winds through the frenzied rec yard as WORKLIGHTS 
           IGNITE, vehicles MOTOR UP, heavy artillery UNLOADS. The rec 
           yard now a makeshift ARMY BASE. As he moves through it --

           -- Rita swoops in, following behind, walking & talking:

                                 RITA
                        You have a call at the office --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Tell them to hold. 

           Walking faster, he OPENS his POCKETWATCH. TICK-TICK-TICK...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You should be evacuating. I want 
                        everyone in the office on that 
                        ferry before it’s too late.

           ... CLICK! He slams his watch SHUT. 

                                 RITA
                        My staff & I are staying, sir --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Rita --

                                 RITA
                        -- The phones are ringing off the 
                        hook. And sir, the call --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Is it Coy?

                                 RITA
                        No, but --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Then tell them to hold, Rita.

           Through this gauntlet of personnel, Johnston finally spots... 

           THE GENERAL. BINOCS to his eyes, speaking to his LIEUTENANT. 

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        ... I need status on all known 
                        enemy artillery. On the double.

           As SOLDIERS scatter to his demands, Johnston approaches...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        General, we’re not finished.
                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                             (drops his binocs)
                        Still here, Warden? Thought you 
                        left with the jokers & smokers.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’m not going anywhere.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        You’re really becoming a thorn in 
                        my ass, you know that? 

           With that, Stilwell marches off, Johnston following behind. 

           EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

           The BRIGHT BEAM of the LIGHTHOUSE circles through the night. 

           BELOW, the General approaches, Johnston following him inside.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I demand to know what you’re doing.

           INT. STAIRWELL - LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Entering... they wind up the corkscrewed stairwell. 

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Now he demands. The inmates have 
                        the castle keep. I need a high 
                        vantage point. Gonna neutralize the 
                        threat...

           Reaching the top, Stilwell surfaces into --

           EXT. TURRET - LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- the turret, overlooking the cellhouse. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        And how do you plan to do that?

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Sometimes the only way to catch a 
                        fish is to disturb the water.  
                        We’ll give them a chance to 
                        surrender. But if they don’t... I 
                        I’m gonna bomb that cellhouse. 
                        Scorched earth...  

           Stilwell walks the turret, raising his binocs, spying a look 
           inside the cellhouse. But Johnston isn’t finished...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I tried using force on these men... 
                        and all I have to show for it is a 
                        dead guard -- 
                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        -- Such are the casualties of war --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Nine more of my men are inside. 
                        And I need this conflict to be 
                        handled peacefully.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                             (drops his binocs)
                        Peaceful conflict. In my world, 
                        that doesn’t exist.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You’re not hearing me. Let me talk 
                        to Coy. You start firing on his men 
                        and they’re gonna execute the 
                        hostages. Coy has the upper hand -- 

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        -- No. Coy’s got a couple of boys -- 
                        with a couple of guns -- making you 
                        look like a fool. And I don’t care 
                        if John Wayne himself’s in there, 
                        I’m gonna hit that cellhouse so 
                        hard with tracer rounds, their 
                        asses gonna pucker. 

           Johnston stews, staring at the stoic General. A stalemate. 
           The General locks eyes, amused by his new adversary.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Ever serve, Warden?
                             (off Johnston’s silence)
                        Just did a long tour in Burma 
                        myself. Ever been to Burma...?
                             (another silence)
                        I’ll tell you: makes this rock look 
                        like shore-leave in Tahiti. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Well this isn’t Burma, General. But 
                        to many of us... it’s home.

           Johnston looks to the distance. Stilwell clocking his gaze... 

           ON THE COASTLINE, we see Civilians’ Row. Apartments lit up in 
           the foggy night sky.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        That goes for the guards held in 
                        the cellhouse. Goes for me as well.

           Johnston holds his gaze, finding his home. He can see Ida Mae 
           pacing the porch. A speck in the distance. It weighs on him. 
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (back to Stilwell)
                        So I’m asking you to tread lightly. 

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        That warms my heart. It does...  
                        But you treaded lightly, Warden. 
                        And that’s why I’m here... 

           With that, the General walks away, marching down the stairs. 
           Johnston’s head sinks. But soon, SOMETHING catches his eye...

           ON THE TURRET WALL: WORDS CARVED IN WOOD. He kneels down, 
           memories heavy, reading the inscription: BARBARA & DAD, 1934. 

           As Johnston stares at his daughter’s carved handwriting, a 
           tinge of desperation washes over his face...

                                 CRETZER (PRE-LAP)
                        I’ll say it again: Damn good meal.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           Desks have been pushed together. On them: the humble DINNER 
           prepared by Hubbard. Coy’s men feast, savoring every bite.

                                 CRETZER
                        Let’s hope this ain’t our last one. 
                        With the Army here... never know!

           Cretzer laughs. The men grin, amused. Everyone but...

           COY. He’s pensive, withdrawn. He just stares down at a 
           familiar ENVELOPE. Mind active. Food untouched.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Better than the chow they serve on 
                        death row. Be sure ‘bout that. 

                                 HUBBARD
                        Credit goes to my mom. We was poor. 
                        Pops pulled me outta school to 
                        help. Didn’t want to work the 
                        fields. So worked the kitchen. 
                        Learned how to fry. Sauté. Roast.

           Hubbard reaches for a GLASS JUG on the table, POPS the cork.

                                 HUBBARD
                        Learned how to make this too. 

           As he POURS GLASSES, the men tip back the home-brewed hooch, 
           savoring the burn of liquor. Hubbard pours a glass for Coy. 
           He looks up. Stares at it, hesitant... 
                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... My Dad used to make this stuff. 
                        Wasn’t around much. But he let me 
                        try it once.

                                 HUBBARD
                        Drink up, Coy. Your days of 
                        squeezing through bars are over.

           The men chuckle. Coy nods, amused. A faint grin appearing.

                                 CRETZER
                        Pfft. You boys had it easy. I had 
                        my older brother raisin’ me. 
                        Bastard came outta the womb a 
                        criminal. Sharing a roof with that 
                        nut was like being in the clink. 
                        Always bossing me around. Telling 
                        me what to do... 
                             (turns to Bernie)
                        Kinda like Coy here.

           Coy clocks a cold gaze at Cretzer. A tense silence... Then:

                                 CRETZER
                        Gotcha!
                             (chuckles, raises a glass)
                        A toast... to Coy! Without him, 
                        we’d still be in our cells.

           Coy’s hesitant... but lightens. He grabs his glass, raises 
           it. The men SWIG back their booze. After a beat -- 

           -- Coy does the same. He relishes the burn... Then:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Gonna check on Clarence.

           Coy stands. Grabs a plate of food. Shoulders his rifle... 

           As Coy leaves, Cretzer’s face tightens. He trades a look with 
           Shockley. Their steely expressions clocking back to the crew.

                                 CRETZER
                        We gotta do something about Coy.

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coy moves towards Clarence, who stands watch outside of the 
           guards’ cell. He hands him the plate of food. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Eat up. You’ll need it, old-timer.

           Clarence takes the plate, thankful... but anxious: 
                                 CLARENCE
                        Birdman’s been asking for you, Coy. 
                        Didn’t wanna leave my post... but 
                        he won’t leave me alone.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Stay clear of that nut. I’ll deal. 

           Coy looks into cell 403... eyeing the captive guards. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        They behavin’?

                                 CLARENCE
                        Been keepin’ pretty quiet.

           As Coy notices young Ernest in the corner... he softens.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Tell Hubbard to bring them some 
                        dinner. If he asks, tell him I said 
                        so. Imagine they’re gettin’ hungry.
                             (off Clarence’s nod)
                        This’ll be over soon, old-timer. 
                        Just keep thinkin’ about them 
                        banana trees.

           Coy pats Clarence on the back, then... walks up Broadway.

           INT. C-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Coy passes VARIOUS PRISONERS, still locked up. As he walks...

           ... some PLEAD to him. Some CURSE HIM OUT. Other RATTLE their 
           bars and SPIT with anger... But Coy marches forward 
           unaffected, ignoring them. As he finally ROUNDS THE CORNER --

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- he sees the Birdman’s cell. Coy approaches with caution... 
           the Birdman ANNOTATING a detailed SKETCH.

                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ
                        I always see you reading, Coy.
                        Ever read any of my books? 

           Coy looks to the STACK OF BOOKS on the Birdman’s desk.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Can’t say I have. What’d you want?

                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ
                        I recently published a digest on 
                        the diseases of birds. Words 
                        written in sweat and blood... 
                        But not my own. I held many sick 
                        birds, dead by my own errors... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ (CONT'D)
                        But I knew if the sacrifice of one 
                        could save thousands of others... 
                        my actions would not be in vain. 
                        But I’m afraid yours have been.

           The Birdman stands, walking towards the bars... 

                                 BERNIE COY 
                        This ain’t over. I have the Warden 
                        exactly where I want him.

           But the Birdman just stares at Coy, not convinced. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        You might be smarter than I am. But 
                        I’m not as dumb as you think.

                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ
                        Not dumb, Coy. I’ve simply been 
                        here longer. Seen things. I hear 
                        there are tunnels. They built this 
                        over a Civil War fort, you know.

           The Birdman moves for the wall of his cell, reaching for... 

           A BRICK. He begins to JOSTLE it loose, revealing: a TWIG NEST 
           in the hollow crevice. Inside: his PET BIRD with the mended 
           wing softly CHIRPS. He picks it up, cradling it in his hands.

                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ
                        Larus dominicanus. Also known as 
                        the kelp gull. Gentle, but still an 
                        omnivore. Reminds me of you, Coy... 
                             (looks to his bird)
                        Overlooked. Unsuspecting. But when 
                        in the wild, their true nature 
                        comes to fruition... There are 
                        accounts of single gulls killing 
                        baby seals. They will peck out 
                        their eyes, then feed on its blind, 
                        helpless carcass. And when these 
                        birds group together... their power 
                        magnifies. Flocks have been known 
                        to bring down entire whales. Sharp 
                        beaks pecking their hide to death. 
                        Feeding on the blubber...

           Coy is silent, disturbed by the thought.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        You know... you’re as crazy as they 
                        say you are.

           The Birdman briskly moves for the bars:
                                 BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ
                        You were smart enough to get this 
                        far, Coy. But you have made errors. 
                        Just as I did. Errors that don’t 
                        have to be in vain. Look no further 
                        than what I said about the gulls. 
                        Your men & you are only six. But 
                        let me out -- let all of us out -- 
                        and we could be a flock. Only 
                        then... can we take down the whale. 

           CLOSE ON COY, we see the wheels turning... When suddenly -- 

           -- THE LIGHTS SHUT OFF. Coy PANICS... readying his rifle. 

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coy RUNS IN... His men are FRENZIED, TAKING UP ARMS, as --

           -- FLOODLIGHTS IGNITE, cutting through the windows. A DEEP 
           RUMBLE BEGINNING TO GROW... 

           The men TILT to the ceiling, guns POINTED. DUST FALLING. The 
           entire cellhouse SHAKING. 

                                 CRETZER
                        What the hell is going on?!

                                                               SLAM TO:

           MILITARY FIGHTER JETS... screaming over Alcatraz. Low 
           altitude flybys GRAZING the cellhouse. While on the ground --

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - NIGHT

           -- Stilwell barks orders into a SHORTWAVE RADIO:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        You keep giving that cellhouse a 
                        haircut until I say retire!  

           Johnston enters the encampment, weaving troops to find 
           Stilwell. The Warden screams over the deafening sound:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (pointing up to the jets)
                        You never said anything about that!

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Sometimes you have to stomp the 
                        grass to scare the snake!

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        An hour ago they were fish!
                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Semantics! I’m giving them a 
                        choice. They can surrender by 
                        attrition! Or die by fire!

           As the GENERAL gestures to the REC YARD, Johnston SEES IT...

           ROWS OF GRENADE LAUNCHERS being prepped for action. 

           CLOSE ON JOHNSTON, taking in the artillery... Then:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        General, you can’t go bombing my 
                        damn cellhouse! The hostages... 

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        We have no proof of life!

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        And what about the hundreds of 
                        inmates who had no part in this? 
                        There are rules, General. That why 
                        they call it the prison system --

           -- Suddenly, Johnston is struck with an idea. And as we PUSH 
           IN on this moment of realization --

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - MOMENTS LATER

           -- Johnston ENTERS his bustling office. The staff CLOCKS to 
           the battle-worn Warden as he makes his way across the room -- 

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

           -- rushing for his desk. He opens DRAWER after DRAWER, 
           searching for SOMETHING... When -- 

           -- Rita barges in... screaming over the ROAR of JETS:

                                 RITA
                        -- Sir!

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You seen my little red book?! 

                                 RITA
                        The call, sir! I told them to hold!

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        And I told you to leave --

                                 RITA
                        -- Will you shut up!
                             (beat)
                        ... It’s what’s-his-name. Bennett. 
           Johnston PAUSES his rummaging. EYES RITA. Then... the 
           BLINKING LIGHT on his phone. He calculates. Then PICKS IT UP:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Warden Johnston.

                                 BENNETT (O.S.)
                        Where in god’s name have you been?!  

           INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE - DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO - CONTINUOUS

           In the plush office, we find two familiar politicians -- 
           Bennett & the Attorney General -- each on receivers.

           INTERCUT WITH THE WARDEN’S OFFICE:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I had my hands full.

           Phone to ear, Johnston continues to RUMMAGE through drawers.

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        Is it true what we’re hearing?! 
                        Earlier you’re bragging to us about 
                        your perfect prison... and now 
                        inmates are shooting up the damn 
                        cellhouse?! 

           ON JOHNSTON, distracted, as he finally surfaces with...

           A SMALL RED BOOK. “Directory of California Penal Codes.”

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (into the phone)
                        Gentlemen... consider the situation 
                        under control.

           Bennett and the Attorney General swap confused looks... Then:

                                 BENNETT
                        Johnston?! Johnsto --

           -- But Johnston is already gone... leaving nothing but the 
           phone’s receiver resting on his desk.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           WINGTIPS IN MUD. Johnston marching through puddles --

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - NIGHT

           -- weaving the troops, the Penal Directory gripped firmly... 

           Stilwell studies a MAP OF ALCATRAZ, suddenly interrupted by:
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (O.S.)
                        Penal Code, section four, article 
                        nine...

           The General spins to the Warden. Johnston FLIPS through the 
           book. Finds the page. TAPS his finger, resolute.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... As long as you’re on California 
                        penitentiary grounds, the Warden 
                        has jurisdiction. Meaning, those 
                        are my prisoners. My hostages. And 
                        if you have a problem with that... 
                        mark my words: I’ll have you court-
                        martialed.

           Jaw clenched, Stilwell looks Johnston over. His tattered 
           suit, his cracked glasses. He can see Johnston means 
           business. Then, Stilwell relents, offering a response:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        What now, Warden?

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           The arching beam of the LIGHTHOUSE passes through the 
           cellhouse as more flybys RATTLE the room. Coy and his men 
           gather together, rifles at the ready, mid-argument...

                                 CRETZER
                        ... Damn it, Coy! This is the Army. 
                        We’re not talking about Johnston 
                        and his idiot guards. We need to 
                        show ‘em we’re serious. 

                                 THOMPSON
                        Cretzer’s right. We need to make a 
                        statement. Or we’re all dead.

           Shockley offers an imperceptible nod.

                                 CLARENCE
                        What if Coy’s right? And we can 
                        still bargain our way out?! 

           Coy’s mind is going a mile a minute, trying to process. 
           Cretzer COCKS HIS RIFLE. All business.

                                 CRETZER
                        No surrender. We’re going out first 
                        class. Right Coy...? Coy!

           Coy finally raises his eyes to his men. A decision weighing 
           on him. The crew stares, waiting for an answer... Then --

           -- THE PHONE RINGS. The men spin around to the Control Room.
           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Entering the Control Room... Coy picks up the call. 

           INTERCUT WITH THE WARDEN’S OFFICE:

           Johnston LISTENS, tense. Nothing but QUIET BREATHS from... 

           ... Coy on the other end. And soon... he speaks:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        That you, Warden...?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... How you doing in there, Bernie? 
                             (off Coy’s silence)
                        Mind if I call you that...?

           ON COY, his eyes narrow. What’s Johnston up to?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        No need for all the formalities. We 
                        can just be two men talking here...

                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... A smart man once said: “The 
                        meeting of two people is like two 
                        chemical substances. There’s a 
                        reaction. And both are transformed. 
                        An irreversible change...”

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Believe that’s Jung, Bernie.
                        You like Jung... don’t you? I was 
                        impressed to learn that. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Don’t think I’m gonna sit here and 
                        listen to you preach to me about 
                        free will. In here, there’s will 
                        alright... but ain’t nothing free 
                        about it. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Maybe we can change that. You tell 
                        me what I need to do. Maybe we can 
                        get your family on the line. You 
                        have anyone you can call in 
                        Kentucky?

           ON COY, something registers in his eyes...

                                 BERNIE COY
                        How’d you know about Kentucky?

           ON JOHNSTON, scanning COY’S FILE on his desk.
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You grew up there. Born to a family 
                        of farmers. Father left early. 
                        Raised by a single mother...  

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (realizing)
                        Says all that in my file, huh? 
                             (off Johnston’s silence)
                        Let me ask you this: if you know so 
                        much about me... tell me what my 
                        life’s like in here. Not being able 
                        to speak. Or breathe. Spending my 
                        whole damn life watching the clock.

           CLOSE ON JOHNSTON, his mind turning. Thoughts heavy, Johnston 
           opens his pocketwatch. TICK-TICK-TICK...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        We’re all doing time, Bernie. Not 
                        in the same place. Or in the same 
                        way. But in this life, we’re doing 
                        time... until we’re not.

           ... CLICK. Johnston delicately shuts his watch. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Easy for you to say. You’re on the 
                        outside looking in... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Bernie, I know you’re upset about 
                        earlier. I realize it was unfair... 
                        The terms of your parole. Maybe we 
                        can talk about that? 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        What’s there to talk about?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        What if the state looked at your 
                        sentence? Got you to a minimum 
                        security facility. Like you wanted.
                             (more silence)
                        We could argue that you were too 
                        harshly sentenced. I know you’re 
                        not like the others on this island. 
                        Never hurt anyone. Never killed...

           Coy softens a bit... Johnston’s empathy getting to him.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        I’m nothing like these men in here. 
                        I used to be a painter, you know. 
                        Did sides of barns in Kentucky. 
                        Even did people’s portraits. 
                        Figurative portraitures... 
           ON JOHNSTON, something registering in his eyes...

                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... But that dried up with 
                        everything else when the Depression 
                        hit. Couldn’t find work...
                             (memories heavy)
                        Let me ask you, Warden: If you came 
                        on hard times... and had a family 
                        to feed... what would you have 
                        done? Let ‘em starve? Give up like 
                        some coward? I wager you’d find a 
                        way to put food on the table... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... So you did what you had to.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Just took some stuff that didn’t 
                        belong to me. Never hurt no one, 
                        like you said. But I end up here.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I know... And I think I can help, 
                        Bernie. Let’s see what we can do. 
                        Get you to the right facility. Get 
                        you visiting privileges. Could try 
                        to contact your mother. As a 
                        parent... I know I’d want to hear 
                        from my child. 

           CLOSE ON COY, something stirring within him...

           THROUGH THE CONTROL ROOM WINDOW, Cretzer & crew look on:

                                 CRETZER
                        Coy better not be going soft on us.

           BACK WITH COY:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        What do you say? We have a deal?

                                 BERNIE COY
                        How do I know you’re not just gonna 
                        trick me again... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        No tricks, Bernie. I need you to 
                        trust me. You deliver those 
                        hostages alive --

                                 BERNIE COY
                        -- I already trusted you, Warden. 
                        And like a fool I listened. Then 
                        you called in those damn guards to 
                        shoot up the cellhouse! --
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- That wasn’t my fault -- 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        -- Those were your men! --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- Bernie... they’re gone now. I 
                        need you to listen to me --

                                 BERNIE COY
                        -- No. You listen to me, Warden.
                        All you’ve done is lie. You promise 
                        a boat and then bring in the Army?! 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Nothing has changed here, Bernie --

                                 BERNIE COY
                        -- Everything has changed! 

           Johnston is taken back by Coy’s outburst. When suddenly...

           Cretzer BURSTS into the Control Room. Manic, impatient: 

                                 CRETZER
                        What the hell’s Johnston sayin’?!

           Coy holds up his hand... covering the phone. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        You have to trust me on this one.

           IN THE WARDEN’S OFFICE

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON 
                        Bernie...? Bernie, you there!?

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM

           Cretzer stews, rifle gripped. And with a silent look shared:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        I got this handled. I do...

           Soon, Cretzer calms. Offering a NOD to Coy, he leaves... 

           Coy watches through the window as Cretzer & crew slink away. 
           Coy gathers himself... then uncovers the phone:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        My men are getting anxious, Warden.
                        You remember them rules?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I do... But you need to tell me 
                        what you want. We can end this now.
           Coy is silent. From his pocket, he takes out the taped-
           together LETTER. Looking to it, something stirs within him.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        I want you to bring me someone.
                        To Alcatraz. I wanna speak to them. 

           As Coy speaks, Johnston SCRIBBLES DOWN the demands.

           Bernie looks back to the taped-together letter. Focusing on 
           the ADDRESS BLOCK, Coy relays the info:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Her name’s Sheila McDonnell. 
                        Mockingbird Lane. Kentucky. 
                        You bring her here... and I’ll give 
                        up this whole mess. You get your 
                        men back. Your cellhouse. I just 
                        need you to find her. Can you do 
                        that for me, Warden...?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Sure thing, Bernie.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

           Johnston hangs up. The weight of the world on his face. 
           Soon... the door opens, his STAFF easing into the room.

           All eyes look to our Warden, expectant. Rita beyond anxious. 
           Then, Johnston displays his NOTES to the room:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Tonight... our only job is to find 
                        this woman. We have a name. A 
                        state. And an address.
                             (beat)
                        I know the day has been long. I 
                        know we’re all tired. But I’m 
                        counting on you. We fail... and 
                        more people may very well die. But 
                        if we can find her, this might be 
                        our last chance. Let’s just pray 
                        I’m right about Coy.

           With that, the office comes to life. Secretaries FLIPPING  
           pages, fingers DIALING numbers, keys TYPING words...

                                                                 BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   Friday. 7:30 AM. 

           OVER BLACK... a soft sound. THE STATIC OF A RADIO -- 
           INT. KITCHEN - GUARD APARTMENTS - DAWN

           -- as IDA MAE spins TUNING KNOBS on a RCA. Soon, the correct 
           channel CLICKS into place... and a FAMILIAR VOICE filters in:

                                 SULLIVAN (V.O.)
                        ... It’s day two of the harrowing 
                        hostage situation on Alcatraz 
                        Island... 

           Ida Mae & familiar guards’ wives gather around, held rapt.

           And as we PUSH IN on Janice... the broadcast brings us to --

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           -- HER HUSBAND... Ernest. Hands gripping bars of his cell.

                                 SULLIVAN (V.O.)
                        ... With nine guards still captive  
                        -- fighting for their very lives -- 
                        this is a morning wrought with pins 
                        & needles...

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           ... MOVING from small wooden speakers... we come upon Coy, 
           listening in the Control Room. His face is pensive, serious.

                                 SULLIVAN (V.O.)
                        The question on everyone’s mind: 
                        What do these violent inmates plan 
                        to do? And who is their leader... 
                        this Bernie Coy? Some think he’s 
                        mentally ill. Others say a 
                        psychopath. But while things are 
                        tight-lipped on these foggy shores, 
                        I’ve learned that authorities have 
                        buckled to their demands --

           EXT. OCEAN - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT 

           -- A COAST GUARD BOAT cuts through the ocean, bouncing waves 
           for Alcatraz. As it approaches, we pass... 

           A PRESS BOAT. Flashes POP as Sullivan holds his RADIO MIC:

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Stay tuned, ladies & gents. And let 
                        us hope that today will bring peace 
                        to the island they call Alcatraz. 

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - THAT MOMENT

           AN AMERICAN FLAG flaps half-mast amid the foggy blue morning. 
           CROWDS dot the docks as the boat approaches. Johnston waits 
           with Rita. Next to him, Stilwell sips coffee from a tin mug.
                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        The man in charge asked for a lady? 

           Johnston offers a stoic nod.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        So you think: give this Coy fella 
                        what he wants, and he’ll cooperate. 
                        But sometimes... it’s not so easy 
                        to lure a tiger from the mountain. 
                        There’s only one tactic here... 
                             (beat)
                        Use this lady against him. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (considers, then:)
                        But would that be fair to her?

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        You know, for a man who runs ‘The 
                        Rock’... I thought you’d have more 
                        intestinal fortitude.

           Johnston stews... Suddenly, A FOGHORN snaps his attention to:

           THE DOCKS, where the Coast Guard boat pulls up. It’s quickly 
           anchored, and off steps... 

           A YOUNG WOMAN. With a plaid dress and a pale face of 
           freckles, meet SHEILA MCDONNELL (30s). As we get a closer 
           look... we recognize her from the PORTRAIT in Coy’s cell.

                                 RITA
                             (extends a hand)
                        Sheila. We spoke over the phone.
                             (gestures to Johnston)
                        This is the Warden.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (tips his hat)
                        Ma’am... 

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - DAY

           Johnston drapes his blazer over Sheila’s shoulders and sits 
           her down at his desk. He sits across from her... then:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        We were hoping you’d be able to get 
                        through to Coy. Being his 
                        sweetheart and all...

                                 SHEILA
                        ... I’m not Coy’s sweetheart. We 
                        used to be married... but that was 
                        a long time ago. Wrote to him a bit 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEILA (CONT'D)
                        when he first got locked away in 
                        Atlanta. This... was a surprise.

           Johnston nods, understands. He looks to Rita:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Can we get her something before we 
                        start... Water, coffee?

                                 SHEILA
                        Just want this to be over, sir.

           Johnston offers a comforting look, then picks up the PHONE. 
           He gestures to Sheila, who picks up the SECOND RECEIVER. 

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           The phone line BLINKS... followed by a STARK RING -- 

           -- Coy SITS UP in his chair. He gathers himself, calms his 
           nerves... then picks it up. It’s SILENT... until:

                                 SHEILA (ON PHONE)
                        ... Bernard? That you?

           At the mere SOUND of her VOICE, emotion overtakes Coy’s face. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        You came...

           INTERCUT WITH THE WARDEN’S OFFICE:

                                 SHEILA
                        ... Didn’t give me much choice...

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (grins)
                        ... Guess I didn’t. 

           Coy looks to the taped-together letter on the desk.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Kept your letter, ya know? Got me 
                        through some dark days, thinking of 
                        our times together. Still even 
                        smells like that perfume of yours.

                                 SHEILA
                        Wish you’d forget that. That was a 
                        long time ago...

           Phone to ear, Johnston listens... whispering to Sheila.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Ask him what he wants.
                                 SHEILA
                             (nodding, back to call)
                        What you want me coming here for?

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Cretzer & crew shuffle awake. Looking across the cellblock, 
           they SEE IT: Coy in the control room... on the phone again. 

                                 CRETZER
                        Day two... and all that bastard’s 
                        doing is talk, talk, talk. 
                             (looks to his men)
                        Bet he got the Warden thinkin’ 
                        we’re damn fools in here.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Or worse... Cowards.

                                 CRETZER
                             (light bulb)
                        What if this whole time Coy’s been 
                        buyin’ time with the Warden to save 
                        his own skin? Working to get 
                        himself out... only to leave us in?

           The crew suddenly tightens... looking to Cretzer. Panicked.

           Even Clarence is conflicted, clocking across the room to Coy.

           IN THE CONTROL ROOM

                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... I had plans, you know. Once I 
                        broke out, was coming to see you in 
                        Kentucky. Coming to meet my son...

           BEAT. Johnston clocks to Sheila, finally understanding what 
           this is about. And it hits a nerve. 

                                 SHEILA
                        ... Bernie, as far as your son’s 
                        concerned... he has no father.

           Johnston cringes, signaling to Sheila. She pivots --

                                 SHEILA
                        -- But maybe we can change that.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        See those big army planes out 
                        there? Was thinking, once I got you 
                        to this island, I’d demand one of 
                        those. Then we could go somewhere 
                        nice with the kid. You know, 
                        there’s these far-away places you 
                        can pick fruit right off trees...
           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Clarence is beyond concerned as Cretzer & his men TAKE UP 
           ARMS. They shoulder ammo, ready their rifles... marching for:

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, the guards are lying down, resting... Until:

                                 CRETZER
                        Get up, you damn screws!

           Cretzer RUNS HIS GUNBARREL across the bars -- KLNK-KLNK-KLNK  
           -- as the guards shuffle to their feet. Then...

           ... he SLAPS a pistol in Clarence’s hands.

                                 CRETZER
                        If the Warden don’t know we mean 
                        business... he’s gonna keep yappin’ 
                        with Coy. Do it, Clarence.

           Confused... Clarence RAISES the gun. Captain Morris steps 
           forward, now in front of the other guards, shielding Ernest.

                                 CAPTAIN MORRIS
                        Son... this ain’t worth it. 

                                 CRETZER
                             (clocks to Clarence)
                        This is the only way we get out.

                                 ERNEST
                             (to Clarence)
                        Even if you get outta here, they’re 
                        gonna shoot you anyway. Won’t even 
                        make it to the water’s edge.

                                 CRETZER
                        Don’t matter. You’ll still be the 
                        first sons-of-bitches to go. 

                                 CAPTAIN MORRIS
                             (resolved)
                        Then thank God we only die once.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Coy grips the phone... his voice delicate, soft:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... I know, Sheila. I know they’re 
                        not just letting me outta here.  
                        But if I give myself up, will you 
                        visit me? Will I get to meet my 
                        son...?
           Sheila wipes tears from her cheeks. Johnston listens, just as 
           affected. Then... Sheila says what she must:

                                 SHEILA
                        Of course you will.

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (a regretful smile)
                        Nice for you to say as much... but 
                        I can hear it in your voice. There 
                        won’t be no visit...

                                 CRETZER (PRE-LAP)
                        Do it, Clarence! --

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           -- Clarence’s finger TREMBLES on the trigger... Then:

                                 CLARENCE
                             (lowers his gun)
                        I... can’t.

           Cretzer is FUMING... But soon, Shockley turns to him, and to 
           our surprise... speaks:

                                 SHOCKLEY
                        ... No witnesses, Joe...

           Stunned, Cretzer stares at Shockley... and with a faint nod,  
           he RAISES his RIFLE at the guards, and -- BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! -- 
           he fires into the cell, A CHAOTIC RICOCHET OF BULLETS --

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - THAT MOMENT

           -- SHOTS ECHO through the PHONELINE, Johnston TURNING PALE.

           INT. GUARD APARTMENTS - CIVILIANS’ ROW - THAT MOMENT

           Panicked wives -- Janice included -- RUN for the window...

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           COY IS PARALYZED, DROPPING the phone. He GRABS his gun as --

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           -- MORE SHOTS RING OUT -- Cretzer EMPTYING ROUNDS -- bullets 
           RICOCHETING the small cell. As the guards MOVE for cover, men 
           are CLIPPED, bodies FALLING to the ground in the violent 
           STROBE of SMOKE and MUZZLE FLASHES.

           And as Cretzer’s rifle finally CLICKS empty...

           A stark beat of SILENCE, then -- CRACK! -- Coy CLOCKS him 
           with the butt of his rifle, collapsing him to the floor.
           CLOSE ON COY, EYEING the mayhem: A cell misted with blood. A 
           tangle of guards on the ground. Then, he TURNS BACK TO...

           CRETZER. Whose nose is SPLIT, cowering on the ground. 

                                 CRETZER
                        We had to...

           Coy shakes his head. Raises his rifle again. And SNAPS -- 
           CRACK!-CRACK!-CRACK!-CRACK! -- pummeling Cretzer to a pulp.

           Coy’s men are shocked by the outburst. And as Coy finally 
           RELENTS, Cretzer lies face down in a POOL of his own blood.

                                 HUBBARD
                        Shit, Coy... Think you killed him.

           As Coy TURNS back to them, it’s clear who’s in charge again.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - THAT MOMENT

           The office is abuzz with anxious chatter. When, suddenly...

           THE WARDEN’S PHONE RINGS. Johnston rushes across the room, 
           quieting his personnel. He picks up the phone, and hears it: 

                                 BERNIE COY 
                        Guards are dead, Warden. All of em.

           Johnston’s head sinks.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Bernie... what have you done?

           INTERCUT WITH THE CONTROL ROOM:

           Remorse dances across Coy’s face. Emotions bubbling up... 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Hope you don’t think any less of 
                        me. Making such a mess of your 
                        island. Sure as hell never wanted 
                        them people to die. Guess that’s 
                        what happens when you pick the 
                        wrong partners. But whether you 
                        believe me or not... 
                             (beat, buries his emotion)
                        ... this has to be over now. I need 
                        that boat waiting at sunrise. It’s 
                        gonna take us to one them planes 
                        we’ve been hearing. And a pilot. 
                        And I’m not asking twice. We still 
                        got plenty of prisoners we can off. 
                        So you better believe this can 
                        still get worse. Clock’s still 
                        ticking, Warden --
           -- With that, Coy grabs the phone and SHATTERS it against the 
           wall...

           ... Johnston sits, phone to ear. Nothing but a DIAL TONE. 
           Distraught, he hangs up. Then looks to Sheila, heart heavy: 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Sorry you had to come down here...
                             (turns to Rita)
                        Please make sure Ms. McDonnell gets 
                        home safely. Then call the Mayor’s 
                        office. Tell them this is no longer 
                        a negotiation.

                                                                 BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   9:30 PM. 

           OVER BLACK. A violent sound. The CRUNCH OF STEEL, as --

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - NIGHT

           -- GRENADE LAUNCHERS SLAM to the ground. Rows of them loaded 
           with MORTARS. Moving past the HEAVY ARSENAL, we find...

           THE GENERAL, reading a TELEGRAM. He passes it to Johnston. 

           CLOSE ON THE TELEGRAM: it’s SIGNED by The Mayor. 

           Johnston looks up to Stilwell. He knows this is the end.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Like it or not, I have my orders. 
                        By force, fire, or fate... those 
                        men are coming out.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Here’s to better luck than I had.

           And with that... Johnston walks away, defeated. As he does, 
           Stilwell looks on with a tinge of solidarity...

           EXT. OCEANFRONT PATH - CLIFFSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnston walks the oceanfront path, FLASHBULBS igniting from 
           press boats, Sullivan still trying to get his attention:

                                 SULLIVAN
                        How about that statement, Warden?!

           But Johnston keeps his eyes forward, ignoring him. Soon, a 
           NEW VOICE gets his attention. It’s Rita, catching up. She 
           eyes his belongings. He’s gathered his briefcase... as well 
           as the bottle of scotch, the red bow still intact.

                                 RITA
                        You’re leaving?! 
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        We got a bunch of guards’ wives who 
                        just became widows. They deserve to 
                        hear that from me. Then I’m taking 
                        my wife off this island. Like I 
                        should’ve done in the first place.

                                 RITA
                        But... I can’t just let you leave.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (tired, amused)
                        You know, my daughter’s your age. 
                        And she’s the only one with the 
                        gall speak to me like that.

                                 RITA
                        Sorry, Warden. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Don’t be. That’s why I hired you. 
                        You remind me of her.

           Rita is taken aback. She shares a look with her boss... Then:

                                 RITA
                        She’s probably worried about you...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (nods... then:)
                        You did good. Go home now.

           Johnston offers a tip of his hat... and walks away.

           INT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - THAT MOMENT

           The General paces in front of a PLATOON lining the rec yard. 
           Hundreds of hardened faces awaiting his word...

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Coy groups up with his men, loading an arsenal of guns.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        They’re gonna come at us strong.

                                 HUBBARD
                        Then we’ll need more than guns.

                                 THOMPSON
                        And how the hell we figure that?

                                 HUBBARD
                        Food ain’t the only thing I know 
                        how to cook...

                                                                CUT TO:
           CLEANING PRODUCTS. Cannisters, tins, jugs...

           INT. MESSHALL KITCHEN - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           ... all filled with colorful liquids. Hubbard POURS them into 
           a METAL LAUNDRY MACHINE, mixing a murky soup of chemicals. AN 
           IMPROVISED BOMB. As he does -- 

           INT. CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           -- Coy and his men sprint through the cellhouse, taking up 
           arms. As they SECURE POSITIONS, Stilwell’s VOICE trickles in:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL (V.O.)
                        Tonight... we go to war. Those men 
                        get out, we will have let enemies 
                        encroach on free American soil...

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - THAT MOMENT

           MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF TROOPS... General Stilwell paces 
           in front of the encampment, addressing his men:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        On pure principal, it is our duty 
                        to prevent that. So let us not 
                        waste good American blood...

           INT. VARIOUS - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           WE MOVE PAST THOMPSON, prepping a ROW OF MOLOTOV cocktails...

                                 GENERAL STILWELL (V.O.)
                        I know many of you. Not by name. 
                        But by the faces of wartime... 

           HUBBARD, wheeling the WASHING MACHINE across the cellhouse...

                                 GENERAL STILWELL (V.O.)
                        And I trust you to deliver me enemy 
                        screams in the ocean air tonight.

           CLARENCE, loading his revolver, beyond concerned...

                                 GENERAL STILWELL (V.O.)
                        You give me that. And you will 
                        forever have my gratitude. Now... 
                        I would not ask for you to follow 
                        me, if I was not ready to lead... 

           COY, assembling a MACHINE GUN. Methodical... 

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - INDUSTRIES

           MOVING ACROSS ROWS OF MORTARS... we finally land on Stilwell:
                                 GENERAL STILWELL 
                        ... So take it from a man who 
                        toured the burned-out districts of 
                        Yokohama. Take it from a man who’s 
                        stood above the arrogant, the dead, 
                        and the defeated. Tonight, we will 
                        stand above these enemies the same.

           INT. MESSHALL - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Coy’s men are huddled around the WASHING MACHINE BOMB. The 
           crew shares a look of solidarity as Hubbard SETS the bomb’s 
           TIMER. Finished, he SLIDES OPEN a STEEL DOOR to reveal...

           THE DUMBWAITER. Coy’s men help him wheel it inside. Then... 

           COY HITS THE BUTTON. The BOMB LOWERING DOWN THE SHAFT...

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - THAT

                                 GENERAL STILWELL 
                        ... And with no further mercy, we 
                        will pummel them into submission. 
                        Until their defeated corpses are 
                        one with the island dirt... 

           And as the TROOPS snap to a synchronized SALUTE --

           INT. DUMBWAITER SHAFT - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           -- BOOM! -- the washing machine IGNITES...

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - CONTINUOUS

           ... A WAVE OF FLAMES TUNNELING FROM THE CELLHOUSE. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CIVILIANS’ ROW - NIGHT

           Johnston walks up main street, solemnly taking in the bullet-
           riddled storefronts. And just as he turns to THE GUARDS’ 
           APARTMENTS...

           BOOM! THE MUFFLED SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION RUMBLES IN.

           Johnston spins to find: BOMBS BURSTING in the distance, as... 

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - THAT MOMENT

           ... Stilwell’s troops begin to UNLEASH their assault. 

           As GRENADES are LAUNCHED, we FOLLOW ONE -- SOARING INTO...

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ... the cellhouse, where -- CLINK-C-CLINK-CLINK -- it bounces 
           down Broadway... rolling to a STOP... then -- 
           -- BOOM! Rattles the cells with an ear-piercing detonation. 

           Coy and his men are TOSSED off their feet, sliding across the 
           floor in a CLOUD OF RUBBLE. Without warning, they SEE IT -- 

           -- AN ONSLAUGHT OF TRACER ROUNDS tearing through the space. 

           JAILED INMATES flip mattresses in their cells -- rounds 
           tearing them to shreds -- feathers EXPLODING into the air.

           Coy’s men shake their daze, ready their guns, and UNLOAD -- 
           RAT-TA-TAT! -- EXPLODING cellhouse windows. But it’s no use --

           -- A WAVE OF BOMBS continue to pummel the space. A demolition 
           force. Cement SHATTERING. Pipes BURSTING. FLOWS OF WATER 
           beginning to overtake cells. Alcatraz now a war zone.

           WE PUSH IN ON Coy, illuminated by the chaotic glow of 
           explosions & dancing debris. He knows it’s over...

                                                               SLAM TO:

           A SOARING AERIAL. Alcatraz a blurred rainbow of chaos. RED 
           TRACER ROUNDS painting the night sky. HOT BURSTS becoming --

           EXT. PRESS BOAT - COASTLINE - THAT MOMENT

           -- THE EXPLOSION OF FLASH BULBS. Sullivan holds his mic, 
           screaming over the commotion into his radio mic: 

                                 SULLIVAN
                        The Battle has officially begun!
                        This is all-American carnage that 
                        will forever be died in the wool of 
                        our nation! War on Alcatraz Island!

                                                               SLAM TO:

           GUARDS’ WIVES SCREAMING in horror. Covering their ears as --

           INT. GUARD APARTMENTS - CIVILIANS’ ROW - NIGHT

           -- the apartment RUMBLES. And soon, they CLOCK to the door.

           JOHNSTON RUSHES IN. He looks to Ernest’s wife across the 
           rattling room. And the expression on his face says it all... 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... I’m sorry...

           Janice begins to BREAK DOWN, burying her face in Johnston’s 
           chest. He consoles her. And as her SCREAMS PEAK, we...

                                                               SLAM TO:

           QUIET. Johnston returns home... walking up his front steps.
           INT. FRONT FOYER - WARDEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sounds of DISTANT BOMBS rumble as Johnston enters... and 
           hangs up his hat. Off his defeated face, we’re overtaken by --

           INT. STUDY - WARDEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           -- THE FRAMED PORTRAIT. In his den, Johnston stares at his 
           own face rendered in oil paint. He looks to the bottom...   
           Lo & behold, a SIGNATURE scrawled in red paint: B. COY.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I’ll be damned...

           He stares at it for a moment... then lowers himself into his 
           chair, dumbfounded. Eyes fixed on the painting, he grabs the 
           bottle of scotch. Pops the cork. Pours a nip into a tumbler. 
           And takes a cathartic SIP. A deep exhale... Then:

                                 IDA MAE (O.S.)
                        One drink on duty won’t kill you.

           Johnston turns to see his wife at the door. A welcome sight. 
           She shares a look with her husband... Then: 

                                 IDA MAE
                        Did you eat?

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FRIDGE SWINGING OPEN... revealing the LEFTOVER PANCAKES.

           INT. DINING ROOM - WARDEN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           At the dining room table, Johnston eyes the steaming plate of 
           pancakes. Then looks up at Ida Mae, seated across from him.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        They smell good, Ida. 

                                 IDA MAE
                        Waste not, want not.

           Johnston offers a small grin, then takes a bite. Soon... he 
           notices something in the foyer: Ida’s packed some LUGGAGE.   

                                 IDA MAE
                        Barbara’s expecting me tonight...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... Was thinking I’d come, too.

           BEAT. Ida is taken aback. Looking to her discouraged husband:

                                 IDA MAE
                        You’re leaving...? 
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (a moment, then...)
                        You know, the man behind the 
                        breakout... he had some bank 
                        robberies under his belt, but 
                        compared to most of the men in 
                        Alcatraz... he was a saint. But he 
                        washes up on this island, and does 
                        worse things than he ever did when 
                        he was free.
                             (thoughts heavy)
                        What does that say about what I’ve 
                        been doing here...? 

                                 IDA MAE
                        ... I don’t know, James... 

           Ida stares at her husband. She can see his regret... Then:

                                 IDA MAE
                        What are you going to do about your 
                        men...? 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        ... They’re gone.
                             (disturbed)
                        Heard the shots over the phone. 
                        It’s over.

                                 IDA MAE
                        We all heard the shots... But how 
                        can you be certain? You see them?

           BEAT. Johnston looks up... her question giving him pause.

                                 IDA MAE
                        James... I’ve heard you talk about 
                        these inmates for years. You never 
                        trusted their word before... why 
                        are you trusting it now? 

           Johnston tumbles the notion... 

                                 IDA MAE
                        I know you feel responsible for 
                        what Coy’s done. But what about 
                        everyone else...?
                             (beat)
                        This place might not be perfect... 
                        but it’s still our home. And if 
                        there’s any chance those guards are 
                        alive in there... you can’t give up 
                        on them. 

           BEAT. A small ember of determination ignites within Johnston. 
           With that, Ida stands up from the table and walks into the 
           foyer. She stops at the coat rack... and unhooks his HAT.

                                 IDA MAE
                        So... you can choose to be the man 
                        who built this place, and gave up 
                        on it. Or the man who lost control 
                        of it... but took it back. 

           Johnston looks to his wife, then... he stands. Walks over to 
           her... and takes his hat. Ida looks to him, hiding her 
           concern with a loving smile.

                                 IDA MAE
                        Be safe out there.

           Johnston nods. He will. And with a final look shared --

           EXT. WARDEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- Johnston opens the door and steps outside. As he walks 
           down the front steps, we begin to PULL BACK...

           ... HIGH ABOVE the mission-style home. And soon, come upon --

           -- ALCATRAZ PRISON... dancing with smoldering flames. 

                                                                 BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   Saturday, 2:00 AM. 

           Suddenly, A DEAFENING BLAST! We FOLLOW A MORTAR as it’s --

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - NIGHT

           -- LAUNCHED into the black sky. For a moment, we GLIMPSE the 
           lights of THE BAY... TWINKLING STARS... and then --

           -- BOOOOOM! IT EXPLODES AGAINST THE CELLHOUSE. A FIERY BURST.

           FROM HIGH ABOVE, we take in MORE FLASHES. MORE EXPLOSIONS. 
           One after another. The bombardment almost monotonous by now.

           ON STILWELL, regarding the blasts with stoic indifference. 
           Soon, his Lieutenant RUNS UP, SHOUTING over the noise:

                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                        General, they haven’t returned fire 
                        in over an hour!
                             (no response, desperate)
                        Sir!

           CLOSER ON Stilwell, thinking... thinking... Then, a decision:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Cease fire.
                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                             (immediately into radio)
                        CEASE FIRE! ALL UNITS, CEASE FIRE!

           ALL ACROSS THE ISLAND, Marines hear the order, SHOUTING as 
           bombardiers STOP BLASTING, guns turrets WINDING DOWN...

           Soon... Alcatraz is quiet. Its cellhouse now completely --

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- dark. QUICK SHOTS: the KITCHEN, decimated. The LIBRARY, 
           torched. The CONTROL ROOM, rubble. No movement. No sound.

           We PUSH IN on a PILE OF DEBRIS. Suddenly, it JOSTLES... as a 
           man CLIMBS OUT. Coy. SURFACING, he LOOKS AROUND...

           ... taking in the stark DEVASTATION. Then suddenly --

           -- Coy hears WEEPING... echoing from across the cellhouse.

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coy PEEKS around a corner, peering into A CELL...

           INSIDE, The Birdman SOBS. Leaning closer, Coy eyes the BABY 
           GULL cradled in the Birdman’s hands. Unmoving. Dead.

           Quietly, Coy backs away... Then a thought hits him. He 
           frantically SEARCHES his pockets, finally finding...

           HIS LETTER. Envelope torn & battered, but still in one piece.

           INT. MESSHALL - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           GROANING, Clarence, Shockley, and Thompson STRUGGLE to their 
           feet. Caked with plaster, the dazed men SPIT and COUGH.

           Soon, Thompson’s eyes land on a PRONE MAN across the way...

           HUBBARD. A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL lodged in his chest. Dead.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Marvin!

           They all RUSH OVER, footsteps ECHOING the cellhouse as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           ERNEST’S FACE. Bloodied. Lifeless. Until suddenly...

           INT. CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           ... his eyes OPEN. Our young guard LISTENS intently as the 
           cons’ hurried footsteps FADE AWAY, replaced by... quiet.
           Moving slightly, Ernest WINCES. Looks to HIS ARM: a BULLET 
           WOUND. He’s hit, but not that bad. He looks up, whispering:

                                 ERNEST
                        Fellas... coast is clear.

           Just then... MOVEMENT. ANOTHER GUARD shifts in the cell. Then 
           another. And another. Incredibly, the hostages... are alive.

           Quickly, Ernest SPRINGS TO ACTION. He PROPS the men up. 
           ASSESSES their wounds. RIPS fabric from his COAT. CINCHES 
           TOURNIQUETS: one around Guard Bristow’s BLOODY NECK.

                                 ERNEST
                        Nicked a femoral artery. Another 
                        centimeter and you’da been a goner.

           Wincing, Bristow looks at Ernest, perplexed.

                                 GUARD BRISTOW
                        The hell kinda teacher were you?

                                 ERNEST
                        Biology.

           Off Ernest’s wistful SHRUG, Bristow glances across the cell.

                                 GUARD BRISTOW
                        Morris, get up. Cons’re gone. No 
                        sense playin’ possum any --

           -- But Captain Morris doesn’t move. Face-down, BLOOD pools 
           around his body. Swiftly, the guards FLIP him over --

           -- to find VACANT EYES staring back at them. Morris is dead.

           As Ernest’s head drops, gut-checked, we find ourselves...

           INT. VARIOUS CELLS - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           ... inside BATTERED CELLS, where slowly, PRISONERS surface 
           behind mattresses and makeshift barricades. But soon, they --

           -- FREEZE, frightened eyes TRACKING... Coy as he LIMPS BY.

                                 RITA (PRELAP)
                        You’re going in, aren’t you?

           INT. ADMINISTRATION BLDG. - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - NIGHT

           Incredulous, Rita looks on as Johnston frantically SEARCHES 
           cabinets, drawers, finally pulling out... a CROWBAR.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Someone has to.
           Johnston catches his reflection in a MIRROR. A mess. Quickly, 
           he straightens his tie. Licks a hair back into place. Better.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        And Rita, didn’t I tell you to go 
                        home?

                                 RITA
                        Decided to stick around. Who else 
                        was going to bug you?
                             (serious now)
                        Warden. Even if the men are alive, 
                        those prisoners will shoot you dead 
                        before you get --

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Rita, I appreciate your concern --

           Johnston TURNS, surprised to find his ENTIRE STAFF has 
           gathered, looking on, worried. He softens... eyeing Rita:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        -- In fact, I always have.
                             (to everyone)
                        Now listen, all of you. While I’m 
                        gone, Ms. Bertrand will be your 
                        superior. She speaks... you listen. 
                        She tells you do something... you 
                        do it. Understood?

           ON RITA, touched by the man’s trust. The staff quickly NODS. 
           Satisfied, Johnston walks for the door, pausing by Rita:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        If I don’t come back, tell my 
                        wife... I’ll miss her pancakes.
                             (off her puzzled look)
                        Don’t worry, she’ll understand.

           He moves to leave, but Rita GRABS HIS ARM, pleading:

                                 RITA
                        Warden... you can’t just walk in 
                        there.

           PUSHING IN on our Warden as he offers a knowing look:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Who says I’m walking in?

                                                                CUT TO:

           SPLASH! On hands & knees, Johnston CRAWLS --

           INT. DRAIN PIPE - CELLHOUSE SEWERS - NIGHT

           -- through a cramped, murky sewer pipe. A man on a mission.
           INT. MESSHALL - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Coy enters, slowing as he spots Hubbard’s BODY in Clarence’s 
           arms, flanked by Shockley & Thompson. Their faces... grim.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Hubbard... He’s dead.

           ON COY, offering a solemn nod, simmering. His men look on, 
           waiting... then finally, Coy speaks:

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Spread out, all-a-you. Look for any 
                        weapon you can find --

                                 CLARENCE
                             (desperate)
                        -- Bernie... It’s over.

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (determined)
                        This ain’t over.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE GENERAL. Rising from a seat, EYES WIDE as he spots --

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - NIGHT

           -- MOVEMENT from inside the cellhouse. SHADOWS bustling 
           about. Soon, a look of spite washes over Stilwell’s face.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                             (clocking to his Lt.)
                        Prepare another assault.

                                                                CUT TO:

           SLIVERS OF LIGHT, piercing the blackness from above. Soon --

           INT. DRAIN PIPE - CELLHOUSE SEWERS - NIGHT

           -- Johnston SPLASHES in. A REBAR LADDER HANGS from a STEEP 
           SHAFT ABOVE. Quickly, Johnston BEGINS TO CLIMB...

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           We PAN the quiet, empty room... when suddenly --

           -- A TILE MOVES. Rubble SHIFTS as it’s PRIED LOOSE by a 
           CROWBAR. SLID across the floor. And from the HOLE surfaces...

           WARDEN JOHNSTON. Eerie moments linger as he eyes the OPEN 
           ARMORY. BLOOD smeared against the glass. Snapping out of it --
           -- Johnston DRAGS THE TILE back into place, then clocks to 
           the CONSOLE, and a tangle of... COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT.

                                                                CUT TO:

           FRENZIED ACTIVITY. Mortars loaded, ammo rounds clipped, as --

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - NIGHT

           -- Stilwell PACES the yard, SHOUTING into a radio:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        I want those launchers up in five, 
                        or your ass is on a platter, hear 
                        me? I will be god-damned if the 
                        United States military can’t 
                        exterminate some island rats. Copy?

                  SERGEANT #1 (OVER RADIO)
                                                 SERGEANT #2 (OVER RADIO)
           Copy, General.
                                              We copy, General.

           Suddenly, a VOICE CRACKLES over the radio:

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (ON RADIO)
                        Pains me to say it, but... I do not 
                        copy, General.

           ON STILWELL, taken back. He BARKS into the radio, incensed:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Who is this?

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (at the console)
                        “That thorn in your ass,” as you 
                        put it. And I’m afraid it just got 
                        a whole lot deeper.

           INTERCUT with Stilwell in THE REC YARD:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Johnston...?

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Warden... Johnston.

           Ear to receiver, the Lieutenant gets Stilwell’s attention.

                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                        Call’s coming from inside the 
                        cellhouse.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                             (snapping into radio)
                        How the hell did you get in?
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Think I don’t know my own prison?

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                             (half-impressed)
                        That son of a bitch...
                             (beat, into radio)
                        What do you want, Johnston?

           Johnston thinks for a moment, then pulls out his POCKET 
           WATCH. He opens it. TICK-TICK-TICK...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Time.
                             (beat)
                        One way or another, I’m putting 
                        eyes on my men... then I’m going to 
                        speak with Coy, face-to-face. See 
                        if he can be reasoned with. I need 
                        time to do that... and you’re the 
                        only man who can give it to me.

           ON STILWELL, gritting his teeth, tumbling options. Then...

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Very well, Warden.
                             (beat)
                        Thirty minutes. By then, sun’ll 
                        rise, fog’ll clear, and my men’ll 
                        have a clean shot at the cellhouse. 
                        I’m sending my finest company in to 
                        end this once and for all, whether 
                        you’re out or not. Make no mistake, 
                        the fine people of San Francisco 
                        will be enjoying peace of mind with 
                        their morning coffee. Copy, Warden?

           Quickly, Johnston moves his watch’s TIMING HAND to thirty 
           minutes before -- CLICK! -- snapping it shut.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I copy, General.

                                                                CUT TO:

           COY... digging through RUBBLE, pulling out A PISTOL. Nearby, 
           Shockley & Thompson UPEND A DESK. Beneath it, MACHINE GUNS. 

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Rounding a corner, Clarence spots a LOOSE RIFLE. But as he 
           GRABS IT, he HEARS A SHUFFLE. Clarence SPINS, GUN AIMED AT...

           ERNEST. In cell 403 with the OTHER GUARDS. All are FROZEN.

           With his HANDS UP, Ernest calmly EASES to the front of the 
           cell, shielding the guards... just as Morris did.
                                 CLARENCE
                             (stunned)
                        How...?

                                 ERNEST
                        Thank God ricochets only got some 
                        of us. But I have men bleeding out 
                        in here. Now put that thing down...

           ... As Clarence LOWERS HIS WEAPON, their VOICES --

           INT. D-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           -- REVERBERATE through the cellhouse. Coy SPINS to the sound. 
           So do Shockley & Thompson. They swap looks... What was that?

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNSTON, easing his aching bones into a seat. Soon, his...

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           ... weary eyes settle on a console panel labeled “INTERCOM.”

           Slowly, we PUSH IN on our Warden... as he tumbles a decision.

                                                                CUT TO:

           COY, SHOCKLEY & THOMPSON, on the move. They SKID to a stop --

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           -- finding Clarence in front of CELL 403. And INSIDE... a 
           surprise: the guards have survived.

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (shock, relief)
                        Jesus, they’re alive...

                                 ERNEST
                             (speaking up, defiant)
                        Except Captain Morris.
                             (looks at Cretzer’s body)
                        Your friend made sure of that.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Cretzer’s aim ain’t worth a shit, 
                        but he had the right idea.

           Coy slowly turns to Thompson, who grips his gun, intense:

                                 THOMPSON
                        We gotta finish the job. No 
                        witnesses. These bad pennies can’t 
                        turn up again.

           Ernest and the injured guards swap GRAVE LOOKS, afraid.
                                 BERNIE COY
                        Kill ‘em and we all get the 
                        chamber. Keep ‘em alive and we 
                        still have leverage. We take these 
                        hostages as insurance. The Warden 
                        will listen to us --

                                 THOMPSON
                        -- The Warden? Johnston’s been 
                        playing you for a fool, Coy. He 
                        don’t care about you... He cares 
                        about his prison! His rep-u-tation! 
                             (cold)
                        Cretzer was right. You never had 
                        the guts to see this thing through.

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (colder)
                        Try it... and you’ll wind up just 
                        like him. I ain’t kiddin’.

           Coy & Thompson LOCK STARES. Clarence & Shockley LOOK ON. 
           Tense moments... Then suddenly, in a split second --

           -- THOMPSON AIMS HIS MACHINE GUN AT THE GUARDS --

           -- COY PULLS HIS PISTOL, POINTING IT AT THOMPSON --

           -- SHOCKLEY AIMS AT COY -- CLARENCE AIMS AT SHOCKLEY --

           -- BUT... No one fires. A four-way Mexican standoff.

           Ernest and the guards COWER BACK as the cons TRADE LOOKS.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Fellas... to each their own, but 
                        believe me when I say, I’m walking 
                        out of this prison. With or without 
                        you. And that’s a goddamn promise.

           No one speaks. Just QUICK CUTS as we GLIMPSE their faces: 
           Coy, resolute. Thompson, furious. Shockley, stoic. Clarence, 
           panicked. Each man REACHES FOR THEIR TRIGGER, when suddenly --

           -- A VOICE CRACKLES FROM THE INTERCOM, ECHOING THE CELLHOUSE:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Gentlemen...

           Every man FREEZES. Coy. His men. The guards. 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Christ, it’s Johnston...

           PUSHING IN on Coy. Stunned. Realizing...
                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... That’s the intercom. He’s in 
                        the damn cellhouse.

           INTERCUT Johnston in THE CONTROL ROOM, checking his watch:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        In ten minutes, the army’s coming 
                        in. And when they do, they’ll kill 
                        all of you... unless you surrender.

           Coy and his men SWAP LOOKS...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Think it over... But for your sake, 
                        I suggest you do it quickly.

           Johnston CLICKS OFF the intercom. He sits still... pensive.

                                                                CUT TO:

           PACING FEET. Coy’s. The men look on as, oddly, their leader --

           INT. CELL BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           -- slows, KNEELING beside GUARD WEINHOLD’S BODY, mind racing.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Dammit Coy, he’s dead! And we will 
                        be too if just sit here, thinkin’!

           Coy picks up the guard’s HAT. Turns it in his hands...

           PUSHING IN on Coy as suddenly, an idea flashes in his eyes.

           Quickly, he begins to PULL OFF Weinhold’s JACKET & SHIRT.

                                 CLARENCE
                        What’re you doing, Bernie?

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (voice low, determined)
                        You heard Johnston. Army’s stormin’ 
                        in... and when they do, I’m gonna 
                        set everyone free. Guards, cons... 
                        it’ll be a goddamn madhouse. 
                        Marines sure as hell ain’t shooting 
                        a man in uniform. Hell, they won’t 
                        be shooting anyone.

           Thompson & Shockley SWAP GLANCES. Perplexed, overwhelmed.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        We’ll slip out, swim to one of 
                        those press boats. You’ve seen them 
                        newsmen... Like vultures ‘round a 
                        kill. They’ll take us to the bay 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNIE COY (CONT'D)
                        for an interview before they even 
                        think about handin’ us over.

           He pulls on Weinhold’s SHIRT. Buttons it halfway...

                                 CLARENCE
                        Bernie... It won’t work.

           ... Coy grabs the LETTER ENVELOPE from his old shirt...

                                 BERNIE COY
                        East side ain’t got no docks. 
                        Army’s staged in the rec yard. No 
                        one’s watchin’ the cliffs.

           ... tucking it inside the pocket of his new one.

                                 CLARENCE
                             (grabbing Coy’s arm)
                        Bernie, you go out there, they’re 
                        gonna shoot you dead.

           WHAM! In a blink, Coy PINS Clarence against a wall. But 
           instead of anger, he speaks with sadness. Pain.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Then at least it won’t be in here.

           ON CLARENCE, searching Coy’s eyes before... offering a NOD. 
           He understands. Soon, they turn to Thompson & Shockley...

           Their faces: hopeless. Looks of defeat. To them, it’s over.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A LEVER. Pulled by Coy. C-THUNK! CELLS BARS SLAM SHUT on --

           INT. A-BLOCK CELL - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           -- Clarence, Thompson, & Shockley. Soon, Coy steps in... and 
           THROUGH THE BARS, they share FINAL LOOKS with their leader.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Don’t worry, I ain’t a rat. Things 
                        go south, I’ll tell ‘em I worked 
                        alone. Long as you’re locked in 
                        this cell, they can’t prove 
                        nothin’.

           Thompson & Shockley trade glances, surprised... and grateful.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Guess I was wrong about you, Coy. 

           Coy offers a firm nod... then turns to Clarence.
                                 CLARENCE
                        Hope you find them banana trees.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Can taste ‘em already. So long, old-
                        timer.

           Coy & Clarence share one last look... then Coy BOLTS OFF.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TICK-TICK-TICK... Johnston’s WATCH shows seven minutes left.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - NIGHT

           CLICK. He SHUTS IT, mind racing as he tumbles... a decision.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CROWBAR GRIPPED TIGHT, Johnston quietly EMERGES onto --

           INT. TIMES SQUARE - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           -- the cellhouse floor, stunned to the core as he takes in...

           THE WAR ZONE. Rubble. Embers. WATER dripping off walkways.

           INT. B-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Johnston EASES around a corner. The coast looks clear. He 
           takes a step, but BUMPS into something. He looks down...

           It’s CRETZER. Bloodied. Splayed across the floor. Johnston 
           NUDGES the man with his shoe... but he doesn’t move.

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                        Warden...

           Startled, Johnston SPINS... the voice came from CELL 403. 
           INSIDE, a FIGURE rises, stepping into the light. It’s...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (disbelief)
                        Ernest?

           Johnston RUSHES OVER, stunned to see OTHER GUARDS struggling 
           to their feet, covered in makeshift BANDAGES & TOURNIQUETS. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Thank God, you’re alive...

                                 GUARD BRISTOW
                        Wouldn’t be if not for him.

           Bristow pats Ernest on the back, grateful. Johnston nods:
                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Save your strength, boys. I’ll get 
                        you outta there.

           Johnston moves to leave... but Ernest GRABS HIS ARM.

                                 ERNEST
                        Careful. They’re still out there.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNSTON, on the move. Winding corners, soon PEEKING OUT --

           INT. C-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           -- from behind a CUT-OFF, eyeing a LEVER BOX, fifty yards 
           away. Bingo. But suddenly, something catches his eye...

           A GUARD... looking through a window at the end of the block. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                             (perplexed)
                        Weinhold...? That you?

           But as he takes a step forward...

           the guard SPINS from the window, PISTOL DRAWN --

           -- Johnston FREEZES. HANDS UP. EYES WIDE as he sees...

           It’s Coy. Fully dressed in Weinhold’s UNIFORM. And now...

           ... standing in a SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT, our warden & prisoner 
           LOCK EYES... for the first time since the parole hearing.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Hell of a morning...

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Ain’t mornin’ yet.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Will be soon. Then they’re coming 
                        in... and you’ve got no way out.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        I didn’t. Till you gave me one.
                             (beat, adding it up)
                        Control Room. Clever, Warden. Heard 
                        about those tunnels... Right under 
                        our feet the whole damn time. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        You won’t walk out of here alive... 
                        even in that uniform. The only way 
                        you live is to let those men go... 
                        and walk out with me.
           Coy LOWERS THE GUN. Shaking his head, amused. Then...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Bernie... I know why you’re doing 
                        this.

           ON COY, stunned eyes finding Johnston’s. Moments pass, then:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Your son.

           Suddenly, Coy ADVANCES... raising his gun to Johnston’s head. 

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        I have one, too. About your age. 
                        His name’s Paul. Lives in a little 
                        town called Santa Maria, four and a 
                        half hours down the coast. Know how 
                        I know that? 
                             (Coy DIGS THE GUN deeper)
                        Know how I know that?

           ON COY, conflicted as Johnston soldiers on, baring his soul 
           in a way we’ve not seen until now...

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Because every few weeks I drive 
                        down there... but only get halfway. 
                        Two hours and fifteen minutes, on 
                        the dot... Then I turn around and 
                        drive back home.

           Johnston’s emotion is palpable. Coy’s expression shifts. From 
           anger... to sadness.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        It’s been eight years since we’ve 
                        spoke. I’m afraid of what he’ll 
                        say. Hell, I’m afraid he won’t have 
                        anything to say.
                             (ashamed)
                        I’m a free man... and don’t even 
                        have the courage to drive another 
                        two hours and fifteen minutes.
                             (can’t help but laugh)
                        You?... You took on the Army.

           Johnston looks up, LOCKING EYES with Coy. Resolute.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Remember... You’re what you choose 
                        to become... and you still have a 
                        choice.

           Coy’s GUN TREMBLES, finger INCHING FOR THE TRIGGER...
                                 BERNIE COY
                        ... I’ve made my choice.

           Then, without warning... Coy LOWERS HIS GUN...

                                 BERNIE COY
                        So long, Warden.

           With that, Coy simply WALKS AWAY, disappearing behind the 
           cell block, leaving Johnston alone... in the SHAFT OF LIGHT.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BINOULARS POV. Panning the cellhouse. No movement...

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - NIGHT

           Stilwell LOWERS the binocs. Turns to his Lieutenant. NODS.

                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                             (into radio)
                        All units, prepare to engage.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CELLHOUSE - THAT MOMENT 

           Coy enters, SCANNING the room. Begins STOMPING TILES with his 
           feet. THUMP... THUMP... THUD. One sounds different...

           Kneeling, Coy SLIDES the tile away, revealing...

           THE SHAFT BELOW. A GRIN creeps up his face. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SPLASH! BOOTS HIT WATER as Coy LANDS, scanning the PIPES...

           INT. DRAIN PIPE - CELLHOUSE SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

           ... LIGHT reflects at the end of one. Moving quickly, he 
           DROPS TO HANDS & KNEES... CRAWLING through the muck.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE LEVER BOX. Johnston throws it open, GRABBING A HANDLE --

           INT. C-BLOCK / CELL 403 - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- PULLING it with all his might... but it won’t budge.

           IN CELL 403, Ernest & the guards look on THROUGH VISION 
           PANELS, soon swapping GRAVE LOOKS. They’re trapped. But --

           -- Johnston TRIES AGAIN. Gritting teeth, he YANKS the 
           handle... it WIGGLES... WIGGLES some more...
           CLOSE ON Ernest & the guards, breaths held...

           ON JOHNSTON, straining... almost there... when suddenly --

           -- CRACK! THE WARDEN IS SUCKER-PUNCHED FROM BEHIND!

           Johnston DROPS, HITTING THE FLOOR. In his place stands...

           CRETZER. Awake. Alive.

           IN CELL 403, Ernest SCREAMS, HANDS SHAKING BARS as Cretzer --

           -- BEGINS TO BEAT OUR WARDEN. BRUTAL PUNCHES TO THE FACE, 
           OVER... AND OVER... AND OVER. JOHNSTON HOWLS IN AGONY AS 
           BLOOD SPLATTERS CEMENT WITH EVERY HAYMAKER.

           IN VARIOUS CELLS, Clarence, Thompson, Shockley, Birdman, 
           other prisoners... they all HEAR JOHNSTON’S SCREAMS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           COY... crawling. He looks up. AHEAD, the LIGHT BRIGHTENS. He 
           DOUBLE-TIMES IT, SCRAMBLING as fast as he can. Soon --

           EXT. CLIFFSIDE - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - CONTINUOUS

           -- the PIPE ENDS. Coy SQUIRMS OUT, lowering himself into a 
           ROCKY ALCOVE. And then, Coy LOOKS UP. And sees it...

           THE SUNRISE

           Golden rays bathing the bay in WARM LIGHT. His first view of 
           San Francisco not obscured by wire or bars.

           ON COY, overwhelmed. He CLOSES HIS EYES. And hears it...

           The tide, SPLASHING against rocks. Birds, CHIRPING in the sky 
           above. And then... soft at first, A NEW SOUND...

           A SCREAM. 

           Coy OPENS HIS EYES... listening. Soon... ANOTHER SCREAM.

           Coy SPINS to the DARKNESS of the drainpipe, the sound ECHOING 
           from deep within the cellhouse. For a lingering moment, we --

           -- PUSH IN on Coy. Searching his mind. His heart. His soul.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLOOD. Painting rubble red as Cretzer lands a FINAL PUNCH --

           INT. C-BLOCK - CELLHOUSE - MORNING

           -- across Johnston’s jaw. Skull rocking cement, the Warden 
           MOANS. Lips split. Eyelid swelled shut. Nose pouring BLOOD.
           RACKING FOCUS reveals... Johnston’s POCKET WATCH on the 
           floor. Glass face SHATTERED. Hands stopped, frozen in time.

           Cretzer moves to a RUBBLE PILE. Sifts through it, finding...

           A LOOSE PISTOL

           Johnston COWERS BACK, GURGLING BLOOD as he stammers:

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Don’t... please...

           CRETZER COCKS THE GUN.

                                 CRETZER
                        Sorry, Warden...

           PRESSES IT AGAINST JOHNSTON’S HEAD.

                                 CRETZER
                        ... life sentence.

           JOHNSTON GRITS HIS TEETH. This is it.

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        HEY!

           Cretzer SPINS TO THE VOICE, PISTOL RAISED, GLIMPSING...

           BERNIE COY

           BOOM-BOOM! COY FIRES HIS PISTOL.

           BOOM-BOOM! SO DOES CRETZER. A split-second FLASH OF BULLETS.

           CRETZER GOES DOWN. WHAM. Dead on the rubble.

           ON JOHNSTON as he clocks from Cretzer to Coy... who slowly 
           LOWERS HIS PISTOL. The man just saved his life.

           The two men LOCK EYES. A moment of stillness. Then --

           -- Coy STUMBLES BACK... landing against A WALL, SLIDING DOWN 
           it, leaving a TRAIL OF BLOOD behind.

           As Johnston RUSHES to Coy, the cellhouse drops to UTTER 
           SILENCE. The guards, the prisoners... no one makes a sound.

           Reaching Coy, Johnston PROPS HIM UP. Blood soaks his hands.

                                 BERNIE COY
                             (with effort)
                        Can’t blame me for tryin’.

           Johnston’s speechless. Coy cracks a smirk, faintly amused:
                                 BERNIE COY
                        Least I can say I licked The Rock.

           Our Warden steadies Coy as he strains, BLOODY HAND reaching 
           into his SHIRT POCKET, pulling out... HIS LETTER.

           For a moment, Coy eyes the BLOOD-SOAKED ENVELOPE... then 
           places the letter in Johnston’s hands.

                                 BERNIE COY
                        For my son. See that he gets it.

           CLOSE ON their hands, both gripping the letter. 

                                 BERNIE COY
                        Can you do that for me, Warden?

           Johnston offers a nod. A promise.

                                 WARDEN JOHNSTON
                        Sure thing, Bernie.

           With that... Coy RELEASES... looking skyward.... his body 
           going limp. Pupils losing focus. And like a candle blown 
           out... Bernie Coy is gone.

           As Johnston cradles Coy in his arms, we PULL BACK...

           ... HIGHER & HIGHER... RISING to the ceiling, the vast 
           cellhouse filled with nothing... but silence.

                                                               SLAM TO:

           SOLDIER’S FACES. Sergeants, gunners, infantry. Armed, coiled, 
           ready. All looking to -- 

           EXT. ARMY CAMP - REC YARD - MORNING

           -- General Stilwell. He slowly clocks from the cellhouse to 
           his Lieutenant, who approaches, RADIO IN HAND.

                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                        No word from the Warden.

           Stilwell solemnly nods. Takes the radio. SPEAKS into it.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Commence firing on my mark...

           QUICK CUTS as GUNNERS COIL, FINGERS INCHING FOR TRIGGERS.

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        Three... Two... One --

                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                        -- Wait, General!
           Stilwell SPINS to his Lieutenant, looking through BINOCS:

                                 ARMY LIEUTENANT
                        We’ve got movement!

           Stilwell CLOCKS BACK to the cellhouse, just as...

           WARDEN JOHNSTON emerges, flanked by ERNEST, both men helping 
           the INJURED GUARDS limp out. The General cracks a half-grin:

                                 GENERAL STILWELL
                        That son of a bitch...
                             (barking into radio)
                        All units, stand down. Repeat... 
                        stand down.

           EXT. MAIN GATE - CELLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           PUSHING IN on Johnston as he watches THE ARMY STAND DOWN.

           Our Warden turns to Ernest, putting a hand on his shoulder. 
           The men share a look... of utter relief. Off this, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A HELICOPTER SHOT. Circling the island, SUN FLARING from 
           behind the smoldering cellhouse, somehow... still standing.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           A TITLE FADES IN:   Saturday, 8:30 AM.

           TILTING DOWN from the SHINING SUN, we find ourselves within --

           EXT. DOCKS - ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- SOBERING CHAOS. Soldiers. Police. Rita BARKING ORDERS as 
           her STAFF keeps the SHOUTING PRESS at bay. LIGHT BULBS FLASH, 
           but Sullivan remains stoic as he speaks INTO HIS RADIO MIC:

                                 SULLIVAN
                        After two nights and three days of 
                        war-torn terror, the Battle of 
                        Alcatraz... is over. Three men are 
                        in custody... The death toll still 
                        unknown...

           Thompson, Shockley, and Clarence are MARCHED BY IN HANDCUFFS. 
           We HOLD on Clarence’s face. Somehow older, weary, eyeing...

           STRETCHERS. Carried across the wharf. White sheets draped 
           over DEAD BODIES. Prisoner or guard... impossible to tell.

           ON JANICE as the stretchers are carried past. She looks on, 
           in shock. Unimaginable grief. But suddenly --
                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        -- Janice...

           ... Janice turns. Sees Ernest. A moment of utter shock, then 
           she RUSHES into his arms. He HOLDS her tight.

                                 ERNEST
                        ... I hear we’re having a boy.

           As Janice’s SMILE shines through her tears, we PAN TO...

           THE SURVIVING GUARDS, filtering into the crowd, reunited with 
           their families. Tears of relief. But soon, we land on...

           IDA MAE. Anxious as she SEARCHES the bustling crowd.

           Unbearable moments pass...

           Then finally, framed by sunlight & smoke...

           HER HUSBAND EMERGES. Tweed suit filthy. Speckled with blood.

           Johnston and Ida don’t run or rush. Too old for that. Been 
           through too much. Instead, they simply pace to each other...

           ... and fall into an EMBRACE. One that says what words can’t.

           Wife in his arms, Johnston looks to the water, spotting...

           A SEAGULL

           Flying in the air... Free.

           One of MANY, SOARING over the foggy ocean. A lyrical image, 
           over which TITLES APPEAR...

                      On May 4th, 1946, at 9:40am, the Battle of 
                      Alcatraz came to an end.

                      Following the events, Ernest Lageson moved to 
                      Inland California with his wife and son, where 
                      he resumed his job as a high school teacher. 

                      Sam Shockley & Miran Thompson both received 
                      the death penalty. Their final breaths were 
                      taken in the gas chamber of San Quentin.

                      Clarence Carnes' life was spared, due to his 
                      mercy towards the captive guards. He served a 
                      life sentence and died in prison.

                      The body of Bernie Coy was never claimed by 
                      his family. His remains were buried in an 
                      unmarked grave in San Mateo County, 
                      California.
                      Two years later, James A. Johnston retired as 
                      Warden of Alcatraz. Before his tenure was 
                      over, he abolished the rule of silence, did 
                      away with solitary confinement, introduced 
                      rehabilitation programs, and wrote books on 
                      prison reform.

           Finally, the bird lands on solid ground --

           EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

           -- among many others, on Alcatraz Island. Modern day.

           Gulls nest all over the island, near CRUMBLING BUILDINGS and 
           BULLET-MARKED WALLS. The remnants of the battle, which remain 
           to this very day. And soon, our final TITLES APPEAR...

                      Following decades of scrutiny, Alcatraz Prison 
                      was closed in 1963... the same year Bernie 
                      Coy’s sentence would have ended.

                      Today, the island serves as a bird sanctuary.

                                                              FADE OUT.
