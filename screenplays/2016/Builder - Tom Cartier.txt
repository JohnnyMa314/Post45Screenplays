           TITLE: 1952. QUEENS, N.Y.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           A very, very wealthy family lives here, but still- 

           Our formidable 6’2” patriarch works alone. Wearing a Salvador 
           Dali mustache and overalls, he rewires an electrical outlet.  

           Beyond him, an entire WALL has been removed. Fresh spring air 
           flows in, and a SCAFFOLD, TOOLS and SUPPLIES are visible as 
           he labors on an extensive D.I.Y. renovation.  

           This is FREDRICK ‘Fred’ CHRIST TRUMP SR. (43)

           His youngest son, ROBERT TRUMP (3) skinny and blonde, bawling 
           his eyes out, scurries in.

                                 ROBERT
                        Daddy! Donny stole all my blocks 
                        again! 

           Fred Sr. kneels down to comfort Robert, and then sternly, 
           with a gruff New York accent. 

                                 FRED SR.
                        Did he!? 
                         (yells to another room!)
                        DONNY!
                         (back to Robert)
                        Let’s go see if we can get ‘em 
                        back, eh? 

           Clearly, this is a recurring issue. 

                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                         (towards that room again!)
                        If I have to come in there one more 
                        time! 

           Fred Sr. takes Robert by the HAND and together they march off 
           towards the living room. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           As Fred Sr. and Robert enter this comfortable space both 
           their mouths drop open.  

           They see a dense, chest-high MONOLITH, that’s as ornate and 
           imposing as alphabetized wood blocks can achieve.   

                                 FRED SR. 
                        Goddammit!

           Standing by this structure, marveling its magnificence-

           YOUNG DONALD ‘Donny’ TRUMP

           At 5, he too is blonde, and tall for his age, as Fred Sr. 
           strides toward this tower, ready to dismantle it. 

           Donald desperately blocks Fred Sr’s path-

                                 YOUNG DONALD
                        No, dad! It’s all mine. I built it!  

           But Fred Sr. shoves past him and grabs at the top block, only 
           to find that it won’t budge. It’s fixed in place. He reaches 
           for another. IT WON’T MOVE EITHER! 

                                 FRED
                        What is this?! 

           Fred Sr. glares at Donald, scans the room and sees it: 

           AN EMPTY TUBE OF SUPER GLUE...

           YOUNG TRUMP HAS TOTALLY SEALED HIS VERY FIRST ‘BUILDING’ 
           TOGETHER! 

                                 FRED SR.
                        WHY DONNY?! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU 
                        DOING?!

           Fred Sr. SLAPS Donald hard across his face! 

           Donald’s cheek reddens but his gaze remains locked upon this 
           structure in a fierce, unflinching stare-

                                 OLDER DONALD (PRE-LAP)
                        Look, I don’t do this for the 
                        money, Freddy. That I can tell you. 

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:

           DONALD (now 25) wearing that same intense look.    
           TITLE: TWENTY YEARS LATER 

           EXT. HOUSING COMPLEX - DAY

           Now 6’2” himself. Still the blonde mop of hair. Wearing well-
           worn coveralls, Donald fast-walks down a cement path carrying 
           an over-sized PIPE WRENCH. 

           He’s followed by his older brother FREDDY TRUMP JR. (33) who 
           smokes a butt. Even though he’s the older brother, Freddy is 
           the one who hangs back.  

           He seems softer, too reserved, a bit un-Trump-like. If 
           anything, he over-thinks before he speaks.

                                 DONALD
                        You wanna know why I do this? 

           Freddy rolls his eyes at his little brother’s big talk. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I do this to do it. Real estate is 
                        my calling. It’s in my blood. Other 
                        people paint beautifully on canvas 
                        or write wonderful poetry. 

           Ragged and depressed conditions surround them: abandoned 
           furniture, garbage strewn about, rusting cars.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Me? I build buildings, preferably 
                        big ones. That’s what I do.

           They hustle towards a red brick tower off Avenue Z in 
           SHEEPSHEAD BAY, NY: the outermost of the Outer Boroughs.

                                 FREDDY
                        Donny, I just don’t want you to get 
                        your hopes up too high.  

           INT. HOUSING COMPLEX - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Barging into this low-income lobby, striding down a hallway, 
           they pass a cheap PLAQUE with TWO WORDS written very small:  

           TRUMP VILLAGE

                                 DONALD
                        Can we stay positive here? Keep a 
                        positive attitude? Isn’t that what 
                        I always say? 
           This is their father’s legacy development, their namesake:

           A cheap, plain, utilitarian HOUSING PROJECT totally free of 
           extravagance, color and character, built up solely from 
           functional brick, concrete and wrought iron. 

           INT. STAIRCASE/HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Donald bounds up a staircase, two steps-at-a-time as Freddy 
           follows: BANG! - through a beige, rusting door, they finally 
           land in a hallway, at another rusting, battle-scarred DOOR:  

           UNIT #704-A, but before approaching it, Donald pulls Freddy 
           aside, trying to stay quiet.

                                 DONALD
                        The City of New York is going to 
                        award us that development package 
                        on the new convention center. It 
                        will happen. It has to happen. 

           For all Donald’s stubbornness, Freddy smiles at his kid 
           brother, admires his passion; Donald smiles too.

                                 FREDDY
                        Dad and I haven’t developed so much 
                        as a garage in over ten years. 
                        You’ve never actually built 
                        anything. And the City of New York 
                        just happens to be on the verge of 
                        bankruptcy. 

           Freddy pats Donald on the back; there’s real affection here.   

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m just preparing you. We probably 
                        don’t get this one. 

                                 DONALD
                        You’re dead wrong, Freddy.

                                 FREDDY
                        Fine, don’t believe me. But dad’s 
                        saying it too. He never built 
                        anything in The City. Ever. But 
                        somehow you will!?  

           Donald gestures to his pipe wrench; their sad surroundings. 

                                 DONALD
                        That’s right. ‘Cause I can’t keep 
                        doing this shit. Not here. Not like 
                        this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        And I’m not going to spend my life 
                        stuck in dad’s shadow. I’m just 
                        not!  

                                 FREDDY
                        And I am?! 

           Freddy struggles to find the right response. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Donald, this business... The real 
                        estate business is bullshit. It 
                        really is. Especially in Manhattan. 
                        That’s all I’m gonna to say. 

           Freddy tosses his butt; Donald frowns at this filthy habit.  

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s get back to work, ok? 

           Donald reluctantly nods as they tip-toe over to Unit #704-A. 

           Like two homicide detectives tracking a serial killer, Donald 
           and Freddy split off to the sides of the door.

           And then slowly, Donald raises the pipe wrench, exposing only 
           his HAND to what lies behind it and KNOCKS -- CHOK! CHOK!     

           They wait...       No answer...     Until finally...

           They trade nervous glances at one another, and then steel 
           themselves for the most vicious part of their jobs-

                                 DONALD
                        Here to collect the rent!  

                                                   HARD CUT TO:

           Soaring aerial images of the MANHATTAN skyline of the 1970’s-

                                 HARRISON J. GOLDIN (PRE-LAP)
                        And now, for the development 
                        package on Manhattan’s new 
                        convention center...

           Light Applause follows this ANNOUNCEMENT- 

           Cross dissolve from this gleaming kingdom to DONALD’S EYES. 

           Squinting. Transfixed on these words, transfixed on the 
           magical realm that is New York City-
           INT. MANHATTAN, NY - HEARING ROOM - DAY

           A large WINDOW looks out at this iconic SKYLINE that Donald 
           gazes at, as New York City Comptroller, HARRISON J. GOLDIN, 
           70’s, a waspy white, Ivy League factotum drones from a three-
           ring BINDER in front of a poster of PRESIDENT GERALD FORD. 

                                 HARRISON J. GOLDIN
                        To be built in the heart of the 
                        West Side at the 34th Street Rail 
                        Yards. We’ve seen two excellent 
                        bids, from two great companies.  

           Seated in a gallery, Donald hangs on every word, with Freddy 
           and Fred Sr. (now 63) beside him, and a coterie of other:

           REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS, BROKERS, CONSULTANTS, EXECUTIVES, 
           AIDES, LAWYERS, CITY PLANNERS, REPORTERS, PUBLICISTS, 
           BANKERS, ARCHITECTS, INTERNS, one DEPUTY MAYOR and a former 
           SENATOR, JACOB K. JAVITS, all various ages.

           Donald, a mere face in this crowd, turns to his father- 

                                 DONALD
                         (sotto voce)
                        This is it. Here we go.  

           The entire ROOM homing in on this decision. 

                                 HARRISON J. GOLDIN
                        But in the end, New York City will 
                        be awarding the winning $250 
                        million project to Richard Ravitch 
                        at H.R.H Construction.  

           Donald freezes; this news drives a stake through his heart! 

                                 DONALD
                        What!?

                                 HARRISON J. GOLDIN
                        He and his team will assume all 
                        real estate development 
                        responsibilities immediately. 

           Donald stands to interject but a HUBBUB dominates the room.  

                                 DONALD
                        Excuse me, that’s incorrect. 

           A suited AIDE (20) approaches a MAN (30’s) sitting four seats 
           down from Donald and HANDS him a thick stack of CONTRACTS.  
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I need to speak with... 

           But the Suited Aide ignores Donald, striding away as the 
           COMMOTION envelopes this MAN- 

           Donald observes him in slow motion: RICHARD RAVITCH- 

           Tight crew-cut, an offensive lineman’s body; and he is now 
           the sun around which all others in this room orbit as the 
           high ranking Professionals press the flesh with him.

                                 RAVITCH
                        Thanks. We’re going to do great 
                        things here. 

           Ravitch milks it for all he’s worth, schmoozing away. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        This is the kind of project that 
                        will rescue our City. 

           Studying Ravitch, Donald darkens; he’s irate. Then, looking 
           beside him, he sees Fred Sr. and Freddy have disappeared.

           EXT. MANHATTAN, NY - WEST 34TH STREET RAIL YARDS - DUSK

           Donald stands over the spot where New York City will erect 
           its new convention center: The West Side Rail Yards-

           A vast network of train tracks funneling into PENN STATION. 
           Freight engines expire in its dust. The mighty HUDSON RIVER 
           eddies by, and rising over it all: the towers of Manhattan.  

           Amidst this expanse, Donald stares into the dying sunlight.  

           Beyond him, Freddy leans against a white ‘68 CADDY; Fred Sr. 
           sits behind its wheel. 

                                 FREDDY
                        HEY! Let’s go! We’re gonna hit 
                        traffic! 

           Donald gives one last look at all this: his dashed dream. And 
           then he stands; stalks towards his older brother, wiping his 
           hands on a handkerchief as he goes. 

           Cleanliness: an obsession with Donald. He’s a clean freak.   

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Now you see what Dad and I have 
                        been up against.    
           Donald opens the car door, extreme disgust on his face.    

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t just build something that 
                        big in Manhattan three years outta 
                        college. That’s not how it works. 

           An awkward silence: it hangs in the air. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m gonna walk. 

                                 FRED SR. 
                        Come on. Get in. 

                                 DONALD
                        No fucking way. 

           Donald SLAMS the door! Stomps back to towards his beloved 
           Rail Yards.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had enough of you two and your 
                        small-minded bullshit!

                                 FREDDY
                        Donny.

                                 DONALD
                        FUCK OFF! 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BROADWAY & 45TH STREET - NIGHT

           TIMES SQUARE. The 1970’s. A neighborhood with a death wish. 

           SIRENS, JACKHAMMERS and YELLING BLAST the ear drums! XXX PORN 
           THEATERS, PEEP SHOWS and a FLEA CIRCUS compete for attention 
           with JUNKIES, PROSTITUTES and DERELICTS.  

           Donald evaluates all of this acute URBAN DECAY like the IVY 
           LEAGUE GRADUATE that he is, absorbing every nuance. 

           Piles of garbage... Buckling Broadway theaters... A residue 
           of smoke in the air as jumbles of different striving NEW 
           YORKERS scamper to and fro at Rush Hour. 

           THE BIG APPLE: he adores it even as he recoils at the stench. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN, NY - EAST 42ND STREET - NIGHT

           On foot, Donald roams east down a steep urban canyon, past 
           GRAND CENTRAL STATION, to finally shuffle by- 
           THE COMMODORE HOTEL

           Soot-covered PIGEONS flap past this crumbling, limestone 
           cavern; it looms over him. An inebriated African-American 
           VAGRANT panhandles along its sidewalk. 

           But behind this Beggar, young urban PROFESSIONALS steam-roll 
           out of the Grand Central Terminal. Time and time again, they 
           BY-PASS The Commodore Hotel en-route to swankier digs: 

           A cabal of STOCK BROKERS rush past it; as does a phalanx of 
           mid-west SALESMEN: a bevy SECRETARIES. There are PEOPLE 
           galore, but they avoid this sad hotel like the plague.

           And Donald notes this as his Trump-sense starts tingling- 

                                 DONALD
                        Wait a second. Wait just a second! 

           And then his feet start jogging, an IDEA forming. He’s 
           running due east now, faster and faster, running home. 

           INT. JAMAICA ESTATES, QUEENS - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Donald enters his childhood home. Judging from the tools and 
           cans of paint, Fred Sr. is working on the space, yet again.  

           He hears WEEPING & SNIFFLING.

                                 DONALD
                        Anyone seen pop? Fred...

           Donald’s mother MARY (61) sits at a TV, bawling her eyes out. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 

           From a nook, Donald’s kid brother ROBERT (23) chuckles. 

                                 ROBERT
                         (mouths)
                        Royal wedding. 

           Twenty years later, Robert is still what’s known as a BOSTON 
           TRUMP: long on academia, short on aggression.  

           Mary turns from the televised wedding of PRINCESS ANNE and 
           MARK PHILLIPS, dabbing her eyes. 

                                 MARY
                         (Scottish brogue)
                        Just imagine: he goes to bed an 
                        equestrian and wakes up a prince. 
           Donald pulls up a chair, laser-focused on the TV:   

           Glittering, gold-plated hyper-extravagance and pageantry: the 
           ROYAL FAMILY and their regal outfits; their resplendent 
           excess pours over Donald.  

                                 DONALD
                        It’s beautiful. 

           Robert throws his napkin at Donald’s head. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        What? It is.
                         (gestures excitedly)
                        That’s exactly the kind of fucking 
                        grandeur New York City needs right 
                        now! It’s tremendous! 

                                 MARY
                        Donald, your language. 

                                 DONALD
                        Sorry, ma, but it’s so beautiful. 
                         (kisses Mary on the cheek)
                        I love it too. 

           Donald studies the TV a few moments longer. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        So where are they? Where’s dad?  

                                 ROBERT
                        Avenue Z. Collecting the rents. 
                         (sees Donald frowning)
                        Why? What’s up? 

                                 DONALD
                        Nothing. Just tell them... I took a 
                        day off. 

           Donald steps away; grabs and dials a wall phone. RINGING. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Roy Cohn’s office. 

                                 DONALD
                        Yes, it’s Donald Trump. Is he in?  

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry. He’s on a call. 

                                 DONALD 
                        I need to speak to him immediately. 
                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Who is this again? 

           Donald’s temperature rises-

                                 DONALD
                        Donald Trump!

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Hold please.

           She puts Donald on hold for an ETERNITY; offensive MUSAK. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, but where does he 
                        know you from?

           Donald’s teeth grind in anger- 

                                 DONALD
                        He’s met me before. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                         (pause)
                        And what’s this call in regard to?  

           Donald boils over!   

                                 DONALD
                        Tell him it’s Fred Trump’s son!  

           And now, a very quick wait-

                                 ROY (O.S.)
                        This is Roy.

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - TOWNHOUSE - ROOFTOP PATIO - DAY

           Follow a well-built BOY’S (18) ass as it swaggers over to ROY 
           COHN (43) ensconced on a patio overlooking Central Park. 

                                 ROY
                        Manslaughter. Six-to-seven. You’ll 
                        be out in four.

           With his blue eyes and pug nose, the infamously notorious 
           Cohn currently works as New York City’s #1 legal fixer. 

                                 GOTTI
                        What about the jury? 

           Roy sits with JOHN GOTTI (29) pompadour, bowling shirt. He’s 
           a rising, blue collar mafioso. This Boy offers them lemonade. 
           Roy and John take the drinks; Roy pats the Stud on the butt. 

                                 ROY
                        That looks delicious. Thanks. 
                         (to Gotti)
                        The Judge assures me they’ll be 
                        sequestered. Totally untouchable.  

           The Boy strides away -- Gotti grimaces, pauses, isn’t happy. 

                                 GOTTI 
                        I didn’t clip ‘im. 

                                 ROY
                        They have witnesses. We can’t go to 
                        trial here. This is the best we do.  

                                 GOTTI
                        It ain’t the best anything.

           Roy looks at his watch as Gotti rubs a hand through his hair. 

                                 ROY
                        Just sleep on it. And call me in 
                        the morning.  

           They both stand.  

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta another meeting. 

           Gotti kisses Roy on both cheeks as DONALD steps out a door.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Donald sits across from Cohn who is tucked between a garish 
           red desk and deafeningly tacky Zebra-print wallpaper. 

           If Roy’s patio is gorgeous, his corner office is a mess: 
           stacks of bills, paint-peeled walls, a brown leaky ceiling. 

                                 ROY
                        ...and the real estate business is 
                        a disaster. But more importantly, 
                        your dad’s been on the builder shit 
                        list forever.  
                         (Donald cringes)
                        It’s no secret he favored some 
                        rather... experimental accounting 
                        methods. 

           Roy rises from his seat to escort Donald out the door. 
                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Probably better to sit tight on any 
                        projects right now. Wait this whole 
                        city-bankruptcy thing out. 

                                 DONALD 
                        You don’t understand, Roy. I’m 
                        going to be big. Bigger than 
                        LeFrak, Zeckendorf. Bigger even, 
                        than Harry Helmsley.  

           Roy cocks an eye-brow at this upstart Trump.

                                 ROY
                        We got a lot of talkers in this 
                        town. None of it means shit unl...  

                                 DONALD
                         (interrupting)
                        It’s not talk. 

           Donald stands too, stepping to the window to see: THE CITY. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And this isn’t just about me 
                        developing something in Manhattan. 
                        It’s about building an idea, a 
                        feeling.  

           Roy sees the passion and intensity in Donald’s eyes.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I love the people of this city, but 
                        they’re angry, Roy. They’re sick of 
                        all the bullshit. This recession. 
                        The politics. They want something 
                        fresh. Different. They really do. 

                                 ROY
                        A nice speech, but I got my own 
                        Uncle Sam issues. Big ones.  

                                 DONALD
                        You see? We all share it.

           Now Donald’s really rolling. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And these politicians: they’re 
                        idiots, right? So very, very dumb. 
                        And because of it, we’ll finally 
                        beat them at their own game. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        With their bankrupt programs and 
                        corrupt tax abatements, we will 
                        force these fucking bureaucrats to 
                        pay for every single brick! 

           Donald reaches into a pocket to share a few pieces of paper. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        That’s what the people want!

           Roy scans Donald’s flimsy paperwork, his grand plan.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And when New York bounces back, you 
                        and I will be perfectly positioned 
                        to take advantage of... 

           Roy THROWS up his hands to try and slow Donald’s pitch.  

                                 ROY
                        Okay. Okay! You might be on to 
                        something. I’ll look into it. But 
                        there’s just one thing.
                         (then)
                        What exactly are we trying to build 
                        here? 

                                 FRED SR. (PRE-LAP)
                        The Commodore-fucking-Hotel?!? 

           INT. ELIZABETH TRUMP & SON - OFFICE - DAY

           Fred Sr. sits at a plain desk, surrounded by framed press 
           clippings that celebrate all of his massive housing projects.

                                 FRED SR.
                        Rebuild that piece of shit?! S’like 
                        buyin’ a seat on the Titanic. 

           But otherwise, the space is functional and colorless, replete 
           with cheap furniture and fake plastic plants. Freddy sits in 
           the corner. Donald stands before both of them, pitching.  

                                 DONALD
                        Do you know why, dad? I’ll tell 
                        you: hotels are my thing.
                         (beat)
                        I can make The Commodore sizzle. 
                        Give it Style. Romance. Luxury. 
                        Turn it into a Mid-town paradise 
                        that people will flock to. By the 
                        time I’m finished, I’ll make The 
                        Waldorf look like an outhouse. 
           Donald moves closer to them; connecting, showing his passion. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Dad. Trust me. This is the biggest 
                        opportunity of your life. 

           Several moments of silence pass as Fred Sr. looks to Freddy.  

                                 FRED SR. 
                        What do you think?  

                                 FREDDY
                        Hmm. First it’s convention centers, 
                        now hotels, tomorrow, who knows?

           Donald scowls at his older brother who glares back:  

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        What? Donny?! Dad kicked in good 
                        seed money on that convention 
                        center bid, and now you want to 
                        follow it with bad.  

                                 FRED SR.
                        And there’s no credit out there. 
                        The interest rates are impossible. 

                                 DONALD
                        Then we refinance. Every building 
                        we own if we have to. 

           Fred Sr. whistles, speculates on these figures in his head.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Look, this isn’t about: can we 
                        afford to do this? It’s about: can 
                        we afford not to do it? 

                                 FRED SR.
                        I don’t see us pulling off a major 
                        hotel renovation. I just don’t. 

           Freddy stands, perturbed at Donald’s cocksure attitude. 

                                 FREDDY
                        And where do you get off, hunh!? 
                        Thinking you can just waltz in and 
                        work miracles after we’ve been 
                        stymied on everything. 

           Donald paces around the room. 
                                 DONALD
                        Because I love that City. Only 
                        certain people make it there; I 
                        will be one of them. Because I know 
                        hotels. And because I’m a builder 
                        and you’re not. 

           The room goes ice-cold as Freddy’s face reddens. 

                                 FRED SR. 
                        Hey, ease up, Donny. 

                                 DONALD
                        No! He doesn’t give a shit about 
                        this business! Hasn’t done shit! So 
                        he should just get the fuck out! 

                                 FRED SR.
                        You gonna take that? 
                         (sardonic grin)
                        From your baby brother!? 

                                 FREDDY
                         (flustered)
                        I’ve... I’ve busted my ass, I just- 

           Freddy looks to his father for support; sees only cold eyes.  

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        None of our projects panned out. 
                        You know...? It’s not my fault. 

           Fred Sr’s disgusted with his eldest son; he looks to Donald. 

                                 FRED
                        Have your proposal on my desk in 
                        the morning.

           As Donald nods, Freddy stares at his feet, humiliated. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - THE COMMODORE HOTEL - STREET - DAY

           Donald and Roy scout the dilapidated Commodore Hotel as a few 
           snowflakes float and sparkle through crisp, winter air. 

                                 ROY
                        I made some calls.  

           Roy carries a briefcase and thick stack of newspapers.  

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        I think we can pull off this plan 
                        of your’s.
           A few Homeless wander by. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        But you gotta learn: building in 
                        this City takes more than talk. It 
                        takes real bricks and mortar. 

           Roy hands Donald The Times, NY Post and Wall Street Journal. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        It takes headlines, leaks and smear 
                        campaigns. These... 
                         (Donald looks at the 
                          newspapers)
                        They’re your marketing department. 
                        Get ‘em to write what you want, 
                        when you want it, and you could 
                        rebuild the entire skyline. 

           Roy scrunches his brow, glowering at this bleak hotel. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Judging by the state of this shit-
                        hole, it’s gonna be a grind. So 
                        play offense; you always attack, 
                        and never apologize. You got that?   

           Donald nods as Roy stamps his feet to warm them up. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        But most important of all: quid-pro-
                        quo. 

           Roy breaks off pieces of The Commodore’s crumbling limestone 
           and brick exterior. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Without access to the right people, 
                        without favors, there’s no heist. 
                        There’s no nothing. 

           INT. THE COMMODORE HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           A decaying ambience unsettles all who enter as Donald and Roy 
           duck a rope that bars access to a condemned area.

                                 DONALD
                        That’s why I called you, Roy. To 
                        get this all figured out.

           Donald studies the moldings, windows, staircases: everything. 
                                 ROY
                        No, actually, it’s not. 

           Now they pass a seedy massage parlor and the sketchy 
           Clientele creeping in and out of its neon-lit doors.  

           EXT. THE COMMODORE HOTEL - STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Beneath a cardboard lean-to on the sidewalk, Donald and Roy 
           observe a delirious SQUATTER with a WIFE, CHILD and DOG.   

                                 ROY
                        You hired me because you want your 
                        teeth marks on this deal. ‘Cause 
                        this one’s personal. 

           Donald moves to speak, but Roy stops him: his show right now. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Which is all fine and good, but  
                        I need some assurances here. I need 
                        to know you’ll take care of me on 
                        this. This is not a small thing. 

                                 DONALD
                        After The Commodore, there are 
                        going to be more deals. Believe me. 
                        More than you could ever imagine. 

           Roy raises a threatening finger-

                                 ROY
                        And no lawyer touches them but me? 

                                 DONALD
                        Absolutely. That I can promise you. 

           Donald offers Roy a hand to shake, after which, he wipes his 
           clean with an ever-ready handkerchief. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        So tell me, how do we pull it off? 

           INT. THE COMMODORE HOTEL - RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           From his briefcase, Roy pulls out a thick file folder. 

                                 ROY
                        Kid, in this town, the Who is far 
                        more important than How.

           Donald grabs it; stares at an FBI-style trove of Intel:
           Surveillance photos, resumes, dossiers and newspaper 
           clippings on five different big city insiders- 

           JANICE BRIGHTLY... VICTOR PALMIERI... MICHAEL DEPHILLIPS... 
           DER SCUTT... JAY PRITZKER... 

           Roy short-hands them for Donald as he points to each face. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        She’s the Money & The Power. He 
                        controls the Property. Michael is 
                        our Press. Der’s on Design. And 
                        Jay: The Operator. 
                         (then)
                        We’ll need each one, plus a whole 
                        lotta luck. 

                                 DONALD
                        I know Victor. We almost came to 
                        blows over the convention center.

                                 ROY
                        Good. ‘Cause it’s time to get 
                        reacquainted. 

           Donald pages through these files as Roy gets up to go. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        You know why they’re essential. You 
                        know your pitch. Give ‘em your best 
                        shot. And make sure they all attend 
                        the press conference. 

                                 DONALD
                        Press conference? 

                                 ROY
                        Yeah, the one we’re throwing right 
                        here, in four weeks time. 

           Roy gives him a wink and heads out the door.

           PRE-LAP: A CHEERING CROWD! 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Hidden in the backstage shadows, a MAN (50) observes HUGH 
           CAREY, the new Governor of New York, at a podium celebrating 
           a primary victory, in black-tie.     

                                 HUGH CAREY
                         (on stage)
                        Thank you! Thank you! 
           This Man staring at Carey is HOWARD SAMUELS -- the runner up. 

                                 HUGH CAREY (CONT’D)
                        Our victory here happened because 
                        of some very special people! 

           Then a Female Voice pipes up from behind Samuels. 

                                 JANICE (O.S.)
                        Is it safe to leave yet?  

           SAMUELS turns to see a rotund, 30-something woman in a pastel 
           pantsuit and thick glasses. This is JANICE BRIGHTLY, the 
           kingmaker behind every power politician in New York. 

                                 SAMUELS
                        No one dare skip one of your 
                        parties, Janice. 
                         (they peck cheeks)
                        Congratulations. 

                                 JANICE
                        Hugh will be delighted to see you. 

                                 SAMUELS
                        He’s a good man... 
                         (sizes up Carey on stage)
                        But if I’d kept you on my team, I 
                        might be the one bound for Albany. 

                                 JANICE
                        You’re too kind. Let’s hope 
                        politics are about more than fund-
                        raising. 

                                 SAMUELS
                        Let’s hope. 

           They share a final smile as she looks at Carey on stage.  

                                 SAMUELS (CONT’D)
                        Knock ‘em dead. 

           As if on cue, Carey turns from his podium, beckoning Janice.   

                                 CAREY
                         (on stage)
                        ...so let’s thank my top aide and a 
                        great friend, Janice Brightly!  

           Janice steps out onto the stage as the Crowd applauds!  
           INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - BAR - LATER 

           Janice sashays through New York’s political Swells: the 
           impeccably dressed Well-Wishers offering kisses and hugs.  
           She finds the only open spot at the bar; it’s next to Donald. 

                                 DONALD
                        Quite a following you’ve got. 

                                 JANICE
                        A nice enough bunch. Sometimes I 
                        can get them to behave. 

           Donald beams a smile down at her as she tallies him up.  

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a Trump. And, don’t tell me.
                         (processing)
                        Real estate.

           Donald nods. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                         (big smile)
                        My father was in real estate. 

           With some legerdemain, he produces a full WINE GLASS for her. 

                                 DONALD
                        Pino Grigio?

                                 JANICE
                        How did you know? 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s my job to know everything 
                        there is to know about you. Cheers. 

           They toast as Janice closes her eyes and recites:

                                 JANICE
                        Your father gave Hugh Carey $8,000 
                        in ‘69. Five grand in ‘71. But, he 
                        also put $9,000 down on Howard 
                        Samuels, our opponent, a month ago. 

                                 DONALD
                        Very impressive. 

                                 JANICE
                        I never forget a campaign donation. 

           Donald toasts again. 
                                 DONALD
                        Here’s to bipartisanship. 

           After they touch glasses, she polishes off hers.

                                 JANICE
                        I take it you’d like to see Hugh?  

                                 DONALD
                        In due time, but tonight isn’t 
                        about Hugh Carey. It’s about you.

                                 JANICE
                        Is it? 

                                 DONALD
                        Yes, what can Trump do for you? 

                                 JANICE
                        If that’s the case: get me out of 
                        Albany and into real estate. 

                                 DONALD
                        Done and done.  

                                 JANICE
                        Just like that?

                                 DONALD
                        Just like that. 

                                 JANICE
                        Good. I’d like to build something 
                        other than hot air for a change. 

           Janice sizes up Donald, debating whether he’s for real. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        And what about Hugh? 

           She nods over to Hugh Carey, swarmed by Sycophants.

                                 DONALD
                        You’ll work for both of us. 

                                 JANICE
                        Really? At the same time? How nice. 
                        I’ll be your double agent, 
                        infiltrating corridors of power. 

                                 DONALD
                        Exactly. 
                                 JANICE
                         (flirtatious)
                        And what else will we all be doing? 

                                 DONALD
                        Rescuing Manhattan. 

                                 JANICE
                        From? 

                                 DONALD
                        From politicians like Hugh Carey. 

           Janice practically spits out a bar snack.  

                                 JANICE
                        How bold. But I think you’re going 
                        to need a lot of help with that.  
                         (beat)
                        I think you’re going to need a 
                        whole army. 

                                 DONALD
                        No, actually I won’t. 

           Donald hands her his card. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what I’ll really need? 
                        Only one thing. 

                                 JANICE
                        And what’s that, Mr. Trump? 

                                 DONALD
                        Emotion. 

           Janice looks his card: DONALD TRUMP: THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. 
           Its hyper-tacky, with raised, shining, golden calligraphy 
           that suggests he’s the King of England.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Meet me at The Commodore Hotel in 
                        10 days and you’ll hear everything.   

           Janice positively genuflects, beguiled by Donald. 

           INT. ‘21’ CLUB - DAY

           Toy Mobil Oil trucks, Pan-Am jetliners and other tiny emblems 
           of industry hang from the ceiling of this iconic bar.   

           Big League Deal-makers graze over prime cuts of sirloin. 
           Their murmurs of commerce float about the space as Donald 
           swaggers in to shake hands with New York City’s preeminent 
           real estate consultant: VICTOR PALMIERI.

           In his 50’s, Victor’s solemn eyes are fixed on his watch. 

                                 VICTOR
                        My condolences on the demise of 
                        your convention center bid. 

                                 DONALD
                        That deal actually marked our 
                        biggest success to date. 

                                 VICTOR
                        The same one Richard Ravitch just 
                        broke ground on? 

                                 DONALD
                        Absolutely. It’s opened up several 
                        huge opportunities. 

           Donald rips off a piece of bread, dips it in olive oil.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        So, what can I do for you? 

                                 VICTOR
                        You called us for this meeting. 
                         (under his breath)
                        Only about 200 times. 

                                 DONALD
                        My office girl might have. About 
                        The Commodore, right? I may be able 
                        to help you there.  

           The Waiter arrives to take their order. 

                                 VICTOR
                         (seething)
                        Just the Caesar for me. 

                                 DONALD
                        The steak, please. 

           The Waiter leaves as Donald sips his water.  

                                 VICTOR
                        We already have a developer for The 
                        Commodore.  
                                 DONALD
                        And how much time are they really 
                        giving you?  

           Donald sees his question give Victor pause; he leans in.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Victor, we both know The Commodore 
                        is in deep-shit. You need to get 
                        out fast, with the best price, or 
                        you and your client end up with 
                        pennies on the dollar.

           Victor casually sips his water, sizing Donald up. 

                                 VICTOR
                        And what would you do with it?  

                                 DONALD
                        I’d build you the best hotel in New 
                        York. Save Mid-town. And give you 
                        all the credit, ‘cause frankly, 
                        that’s what I do for my friends. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Like I said, we already have a 
                        developer. 

                                 DONALD
                        No. You don’t. Otherwise you’d have 
                        left the second I showed up late. 

           Donald shifts into hard-core pitch mode, Trump-style.   

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I know Mid-town Victor, inside and 
                        out. Its financial position. Its 
                        people. They’re calling out for us; 
                        they need a savior.   

           Victor’s pulse quickens as Donald’s words sink in.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I walk these streets every single 
                        day. I love to walk, by the way. 
                        And I see people of all types, 
                        stepping off subways and trains. 
                        They’re primed, ready to take over. 

           Donald gestures to their surroundings: to all Manhattan.
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        They’re... We’re the future of 
                        Manhattan, which means we’re the 
                        future of this planet. And we’ll 
                        gladly step over you and your 
                        client to rebuild it. So you’re 
                        either going to work with us or 
                        we’ll blow you out of the water. 
                        Take your pick.  

           Victor raises a white napkin of surrender to wipe his mouth.  

                                 VICTOR
                        I can get you full control of The 
                        Commodore; the rest, you’ll have to 
                        handle yourself. 

                                 DONALD
                        Deal.

           INT. BROOKLYN, NY - OFFICE - DAY

           Stationed out at Fred Sr’s office on Avenue Z, DONALD dials a 
           phone. It RINGS, and RINGS, several more times until- 

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.) 
                        Talk! 

                                 DONALD
                        Michael DePhillips? 

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Speaking. 

                                 DONALD
                        This is John Barron from The Trump 
                        Organization. I have Donald Trump 
                        calling for you. 

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Make it quick. 

           INTERCUT 

           INT. MANHATTAN, NY - NEW YORK TIMES - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           At 26, MICHAEL DEPHILLIPS is a young but balding, bleeding-
           heart liberal, up-and-coming writer busily typing away in a 
           tiny cubicle at the world’s most prestigious newspaper. 
                                 DONALD
                         (pause)
                        My apologies but Mr. Trump had to 
                        jump to a call from George 
                        Steinbrenner. Can we try you back? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Depends on what he’s calling about.

                                 DONALD
                        You’ve received an invitation to 
                        our press conference?

           Michael scans an impenetrable mess on his desk. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        S’around here somewhere. 

           He fishes out an over-the-top gaudy envelope. 

                                 DONALD 
                        We wanted to see if you’ll be able 
                        to attend. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                        It’s possible.

           Inside, Michael finds a super-tacky, gold invitation.  

                                 DONALD 
                        We’ll be making a major 
                        announcement regarding The 
                        Commodore Hotel. It’s going to be 
                        tremendous. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who’s the architect? 

                                 DONALD
                         (ignoring the question)
                        And best of all. I’m very very 
                        pleased to say that our President 
                        Donald Trump will be in attendance. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        The architect? Before I hang up. 

           Donald smiles into the phone, holds up a copy of 
           Architectural Digest, its cover story featuring-

                                 DONALD
                        Der Scutt. 
           The name gives Michael pause; he digs through the clutter to 
           find his own copy of that same magazine.  

           He scans Der Scutt’s face and the innovative, modernist black 
           structure featured behind him. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                        Hmm. I love Der. I might be able to 
                        fit it in. 

                                 DONALD 
                        We’d appreciate that. We really 
                        would. 

           Michael pauses again; unsure if this John Barron is for real. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure, why not. 

                                 DONALD
                        You won’t be disappointed. That I 
                        can promise you. 

           CLICK! Donald hangs up, speed-dials a new number. RINGING.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Der Scutt’s office.

                                 DONALD
                        I have Donald Trump calling for Der 
                        Scutt, please. 

           INT. MANHATTAN - DINER - DAY

           Behind the cracked, dirty windows of this greasy spoon 
           restaurant, Donald eats with the tall, German-born architect-
           of-the-moment: DER SCUTT.

           They analyze the woeful Commodore Hotel across the street. 

                                 DONALD
                        Perfect, right? 

           In his 30’s, wearing heavy black rims and a stylish suit, Der 
           Scutt peers over his lowered glasses for a closer look.    

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And she’s only going for about $10 
                        million bucks. 

                                 SCUTT
                         (hint of irony)
                        Ya, quite a steal. 
                                 DONALD
                        The design has to feel exciting, 
                        Der. And modern. That’s what the 
                        public wants. Nothing quaint or old 
                        fashioned will do. No way. 

           Scutt shovels a fork-full of pancake into his mouth. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got Grand Central next door. 
                        The Chrysler up above. There’s no 
                        reason to take on that, right? 
                        They’re fantastic buildings, by the 
                        way. Very, very great structures. 
                        But The Commodore is going to be 
                        even better. You’ll see. 

           Scutt puts his fork down, nodding, for the first time. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        So rather than compete with all 
                        that history, I want to stand out 
                        from it. And reflect it. 

           And now, Der pulls out a pen and picks up the menu. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Reflect The Energy. The Commerce. 
                        The Beauty. Of New York City. I 
                        want people to literally see 
                        themselves in my building. They’re 
                        the biggest part of it, a huge part 
                        of what Trump is all about. 

                                 SCUTT
                        So how do you do that? 

                                 DONALD
                        That’s where you come in. We can’t 
                        just tear it down because it sits 
                        on top of a train station, so we 
                        build over the existing structure, 
                        wrapping this entire frame in...
                         (wait for it)
                        Sleek, jet-black, reflective glass!

                                 SCUTT
                        You see everything on its surface. 

                                 DONALD
                        Exactly. People going in and out of 
                        Grand Central stop and look up at 
                        these two massive, black cubes. 
                        They’re blown away. Mesmerized! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        They can’t take their eyes off it! 
                        Can’t take another step without 
                        going in!  

           In response, Der scribbles along the margins of the menu.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And inside, a spacious atrium. A 
                        huge ballroom. The restaurant, 
                        Trumpets! It hangs in the air over 
                        42nd Street, a gorgeous ballet of 
                        glass and steel. This whole hotel, 
                        Der, looks and feels like nothing 
                        else in the entire world!  

           Scutt holds up his finished sketch; it looks fucking awesome.

                                 SCUTT
                        Kind of like that? 

                                 DONALD
                        Precisely like that. 

                                 SCUTT
                        Count me in.

           INT. MANUFACTURER’S HANOVER BANK - DAY

           A fancy back room, the one reserved for private clients. 
           Exquisitely carved wood, antique furniture, a beaux-art 
           tapestry: Old or New, this is where Money banks.  

           A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, 50’s, Ivy League polish, walks a 
           stack of files, and a final piece of paper over to Fred Sr. 
           for his signature. He then exits the room. 

           Fred Sr. opens these files up for Donald, seated next to him.  

                                 FRED
                        You wanted everything? 

           Donald positively glows in the presence of so many zeroes. 

                                 FRED SR.
                        That’s what it looks like. 

           Fred Sr. pages through his wealth.

                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                        The titles to all my buildings. The 
                        leases. The cash. The mortgages. 
                         (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                        Everything. You could finance two 
                        hotels with this if you’re smart.

           Donald loads these treasures into his briefcase. 

                                 DONALD
                        Thanks, pop. 

           But Fred Sr. YANKS Donald’s tie! He’s up in Donald’s face!   

                                 FRED SR.
                        No, not thanks. Get this thing 
                        done! The right way! ‘Cause you 
                        can’t fuck this up. This is all we 
                        have. Do you understand?  

                                 DONALD
                        I do. 

                                 FRED SR.
                        No funny business. No personal 
                        guarantees. If you can’t go out and 
                        find an interest rate of five and a 
                        half, six. You walk. You wait. Sign 
                        nothing. And find another project. 

           Donald raises his right hand, giving his solemn oath. 

                                 DONALD
                        You have my word. 

           INT. BOWERY SAVINGS & LOAN - OFFICE - DAY

           Donald enters, shakes hands with BANKER #1 (20’s).  

                                 DONALD
                        I’m looking for a loan.

                                 BANKER #1
                        Today’s your lucky day. 
                         (checks some papers)
                        I got at a 30-year fixed that’s 
                        running at about 23.2%.  

                                 DONALD
                        I’ll take it. 

           Donald slaps Fred Sr’s precious collateral down on a table! 

           MONTAGE: Hands shake, papers drawn, signatures scribbled...
           INT. BANK OF MANHATTAN - OFFICE - DAY

           Donald sits inside the office of another new, even younger 
           BANKER #2 (20’s) blue Brioni suit.  

                                 DONALD
                        I need a line of credit. 

           Banker #2 taps his CALCULATOR, its roll of paper un-spooling.

                                 BANKER #2
                        With a personal guarantee, I can 
                        get you a one-time deal at 29%. 

                                 DONALD
                        Done. 

           MONTAGE: Hands shake, papers drawn, signatures scribbled...

           INT. EQUITABLE REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS - OFFICE

           Donald sits down with BANKER #3, the youngest in all of 
           Manhattan (late teens). Slicked hair. Thick New York Accent. 

                                 DONALD
                        What kind of lending rates you 
                        offering?

                                 BANKER #3
                        Depends what you’re looking to 
                        finance? 

                                 DONALD
                        Real estate development. 

                                 BANKER #3
                        Horrible bet. The second you break 
                        ground, you’ll lose your shirt. 

                                 DONALD
                        That’s why I think there’s 
                        opportunity.

                                 BANKER #3
                        Ha. Try anyone else? 

           Donald nods sheepishly. 

                                 BANKER #3 (CONT’D)
                        Yeah...? And what kinda asshole 
                        rates they quote you? 
           INT. - HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Donald slumps behind his father’s desk. Through a window, he 
           sees his FAMILY enjoying a barbecue outside. 

           Piles of paperwork surround him and the dark circles under 
           his eyes suggest he hasn’t slept for days as Freddy enters.

                                 FREDDY
                        Hey. 

                                 DONALD 
                        Hey. 

           Silence. 

                                 FREDDY
                        You coming outside?

                                 DONALD
                        I don’t know. Pretty busy in here. 
                        This Commodore deal and all.

           The air is thick with tension.  

                                 FREDDY
                        You know I really wish you hadn’t 
                        said that stuff about me to dad. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m sorry. I really am.  
                         (puts his pen down)
                        It’s just... I love this work, 
                        Freddy. Every day is different. 
                        Every day, a new deal. A new idea. 
                        It’s complicated. Big. Creative. 
                        And it could become very, very 
                        lucrative. 
                         (rubs his eyes)
                        I don’t want to take a break, have 
                        lunch or even sleep. I just want to 
                        do this. And when you go trashing 
                        it, I get upset.   

                                 FREDDY
                        I want you to do well, but it’s 
                        just dad... You know? He pulls all 
                        that same shit... All the time.    

                                 DONALD
                        You have so much potential, Freddy. 
                        You really do. I want you to make 
                        something of your life. 
                                 FREDDY
                        That’s exactly what I’m talking 
                        about!  

           Freddy blindly paces around the room, agitated- 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m eight years older than you. 

           Only to find himself arriving at the wet bar for a refill. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        And I come in here to make peace 
                        and you’re talking down to me like 
                        I’m some fucking infant. 

           Donald sees Freddy’s point as he observes the alcohol washing 
           over his brother.  

                                 DONALD
                        We’re brothers. Best friends. Why 
                        can’t we just talk to each other? 

           The booze loosens Freddy; gets him feeling better, stronger. 

                                 FREDDY
                        You wanna talk? I’m here let’s 
                        talk. 

           But Donald only sees the drinking; a quiet rage brews and he 
           shifts their conversation back onto himself. 

                                 DONALD
                        My Commodore deal. It’s not coming 
                        together for me like I need it to.

           Donald sifts through his paperwork. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        The construction financing’s dicey. 
                        My interest payments are almost 
                        due. I got no blueprints. No votes 
                        approving our tax abatement... And 
                        I meet with Hyatt Hotels tomorrow 
                        morning. 

                                 FREDDY
                        Jay Pritzker?

           Donald nods solemnly; Freddy offers an impressed nod back.  

                                 DONALD
                        It’s only impressive if I close the 
                        deal. No hotel operator, no hotel.   
                                 FREDDY
                        I read somewhere that Jay’s old man 
                        is this giant swinging dick. Needs 
                        everyone to know it 
                         (frowns)
                        Come to think of it, the guy 
                        actually sounds a little like dad.

           As Donald ponders Freddy’s words we CUT TO:  

           INT. JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY

           A hand-written SIGN reading: JAY PRITZKER. Donald holds it up 
           at the terminal surrounded by several other Drivers, mostly 
           immigrants.  

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Jay Pritzker, Hyatt Hotels. 

           Donald turns to see a stout, dark-haired MAN (50’s) in a 
           linen suit holding out sweaty hand. He is JAY PRITZKER: The 
           visionary CEO of The Hyatt Corporation.  

           Donald grimaces at the soggy touch of their handshake.

                                 DONALD
                        Donald Trump. The Trump 
                        Organization. 

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND - DAY

           Parked off the boardwalk, Donald directs Jay’s eyes towards 
           the towers of Shore Haven: another massively hideous Fred 
           Trump Sr. development overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.   

                                 DONALD
                        My father and I finished Shore 
                        Haven when I was still in grade 
                        school. I must have been about six. 
                        I’ve always worked hard for my 
                        father no matter how young I was.    

           Jay pauses, sniffs, unimpressed by this monstrosity.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And a few miles down, there’s Beach 
                        Haven. We completed that in ‘63. I 
                        was even younger. 

                                 JAY
                        Nice. 
           Jay abruptly pivots towards the car as Donald runs after him. 

                                 DONALD
                        Did I mention we did a case study 
                        on Hyatt when I was at Wharton? 

                                 JAY
                        No. But I can’t imagine you learned 
                        too much.   

                                 DONALD
                        71% of business travelers want a 
                        real home on the road. That’s why 
                        they choose your brand. 

           Jay halts at the car, hairy-eye-balls Donald over the roof.  

                                 JAY
                        Did your case study show you what a 
                        Hyatt Hotel actually looks like? 

                                 DONALD
                        I love your designs. I really do. 
                        They’re why I’ve been calling your 
                        office twice a day for three 
                        straight weeks. 

                                 JAY
                        Then show me you can deliver that. 

           INT. NEW YORK CITY - LE CIRQUE - LATER

           Donald and Jay dine at this decadent hot spot, surrounded by 
           colorful murals, baroque clown masks and beautiful people.   

           From his jacket pocket, Donald produces Der Scutt’s makeshift 
           menu sketches of The Commodore Hotel.  

                                 DONALD
                        I had these sketches drawn up by 
                        the hottest architect in New York, 
                        Der Scutt. You should meet him. 
                        You’d love him. A great friend of 
                        mine. He’s the very very best. 

           Jay flips through these cool but unprofessional thumbnails. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I’m seeing a large atrium. Just 
                        like the Hyatt in Atlanta. 

                                 JAY
                        Donald.
           Jay holds up his hand, struggling for words.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Donald, Hyatt wants hotels in New 
                        York. A lot of them. But we’re not 
                        paying New York prices. And we have 
                        to be on the same page.

                                 DONALD
                        The Trump Organization will 
                        deliver.  

                                 JAY
                        We’re in talks with other 
                        developers. The Commodore may not 
                        be our cup of tea. 

           BANG! Donald HAMMERS a fist on the table, nearly toppling it!

                                 DONALD
                        It has to be! 

           Several Patrons STOP eating. Jay looks around, mortified.  

                                 JAY
                        No, it most certainly does not. 
                         (then)
                        This meeting’s over, Donald. 

           As Jay signals for the check, Donald rubs his face. 

                                 DONALD
                        You don’t understand, my father, he 
                        built an empire. I have tremendous 
                        respect for my father, but...  

           Donald struggles to maintain his composure. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        There’s incredible pressure too. To 
                        live up to that legacy. 

                                 JAY
                         (softening)
                        A father can only open the door. 
                        You have to walk through it. 

           Donald softens too, his words: an authentic confession.  

                                 DONALD
                        That same pressure’s killing my 
                        brother. He drinks way too much. 
                         (beat)
                        I idolized him growing up. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        He’s fantastic with people. And my 
                        God, so smart. Freddy’s very, very 
                        smart. And to top it all off, he’s 
                        got... the world’s greatest, most 
                        incredible smile. 
                         (emotion escalating)
                        But ever since college he’s lived 
                        this... cautionary life because 
                        he’s so scared of our father. 

           Donald’s actually close to choking up, the pain so raw.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                         (a whisper)
                        Why couldn’t he ever fight back? 

           Jay is speechless; he gives Donald a moment. 

                                 JAY
                        I’m sorry. 

           With Jay now rapt, Donald ramps back up into pitch-mode. 

                                 DONALD
                        The very first Hyatt Hotel was 
                        attached to a Fat Eddies coffee 
                        shop in Los Angeles. You knew it 
                        was a great opportunity; your dad 
                        disagreed. Bitterly. 

           Donald flattens out the crinkles on his sketches. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        But still, you scribbled out an 
                        I.O.U. on a napkin and bought it on 
                        the spot without his approval. 

           Jay nods at Donald’s knowledge of the Hyatt origin story.   

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Ten years later, after every 
                        competitor passed on the atrium 
                        hotel concept, you pounced. And 
                        that day, Hyatt was truly born. 
                         (proudly)
                        I’m going to carry on that vision 
                        of excellence and luxury. For you. 
                        For Hyatt. For everyone. 

           Jay smiles at Donald; he’s warming up to this Trump kid.  

                                 JAY
                        Okay. You get us a big tax 
                        abatement, you’ll get Hyatt. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                         (then)
                        But in the meantime, feel free to 
                        use our name. 

           INT. MANHATTAN, NY - THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT

           Donald, Roy and Janice power-lunch at this classic eatery. 

                                 ROY
                        Who let that faggot in?  

           Janice frowns at this comment as Donald swivels to see:

           ED KOCH (50’s) Bald. Perpetually grinning. Mayor-To-Be. He’s 
           a rising star, and he’s followed by a very unwelcome guest, 
           Richard Ravitch. 

                                 KOCH
                        How’m I doin, Roy? Janice? 

                        ROY
                                                 JANICE
           Congressman. 
                                        Mr. Mayor. 

           Roy and Janice look at each other awkwardly as they stand.

                                 KOCH (CONT’D)
                        Mayor soon enough. Thank you 
                        Janice. 

                                 ROY
                        We’ll see about that. 

                                 KOCH
                        Yeah, we sure will. 

                                 ROY
                        This is Mr. Trump. He’s in real 
                        estate. 

           All shake hands, with Donald wiping his: the clean freak.  

                                 KOCH
                        That a fact? Mr. Ravitch here is 
                        the best developer in The City. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m not so sure about that. For the 
                        time being... Maybe. 

           All fake laugh, as Donald and Ravitch glare at each other. 
                                 RAVITCH
                        Of course, Donald. We both bid on 
                        the convention center, right?  

           Donald winces, a painful awkwardness until Janice breaks it. 

                                 JANICE
                        A pleasure to see you Richard. 

                                 KOCH
                        Governor Carey’s just appointed 
                        Richard to head up The Urban 
                        Development Corporation. 
                         (beat)
                        And he’s going to be on the lookout 
                        for all the usual suspects, like 
                        you three. 

                                 JANICE
                        Oh, you can’t toss me in with this 
                        lot, Ed. 

                                 KOCH
                        You’re here, arn’cha? 

           An interminable silence lasts until finally...

                                 DONALD
                        We’ll be ready for anything he’s 
                        got, thanks. 

                                 KOCH
                        Well, if you’ll excuse us...
                         (gesturing to Roy)
                        Oh, and please make sure our friend 
                        here behaves himself. We all know 
                        how he gets. 

                                 DONALD
                        I wouldn’t dream of it.

                                 KOCH
                        Then it’ll be my pleasure. Roy 
                        knows what I’m talking about, 
                        dontcha, Roy?

                                 ROY
                        I haven’t the foggiest idea. 

           Koch and Ravitch move on to schmooze the next table. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        Gentlemen, Mrs. Brightly. 
           The conversation ends as Janice sits down with a scowl.  

                                 JANICE
                         (sotto voce)
                        You two looking to ruin everything? 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s under control, Janice. 

                                 JANICE
                         (still under her breath)
                        Koch’ll be mayor in eight months; 
                        The Urban Development Corporation

                        than six. We need both of them.  

                                 ROY
                         (chews; unconcerned)
                        No, we’re fine. We just have to 
                        move faster. If he gets into 
                        office, Koch’ll tear apart any deal 
                        I’m involved with.  

                                 JAY (PRE-LAP)
                        Hyatt looks forward to partnering 
                        with The Trump Organization... 

           EXT. THE COMMODORE HOTEL - STREET - DAY

           Donald and Freddy stand behind a makeshift stage - erected at 
           Lexington Ave and 42nd Street. Behind them, Jay Pritzker 
           speaks atop this stage to a growing crowd. 

                                 JAY 
                        On many projects in the future...

           For the first time, Freddy looks different. Tired. Unhealthy. 
           He chain-smokes with abandon. 

                                 DONALD
                        This is it, Freddy. I’m actually a 
                        little nervous. 

                                 FREDDY
                        Wanna a smoke?  

           Freddy holds out his lit cigarette. Donald shakes his head. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        S’what I thought. You’ve hit the 
                        big time, kid. Now go get ‘em. 
                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        So please welcome Donald Trump! 

           NEW ANGLE

           Donald strides onto the stage and looks out at the CROWD: 
           REPORTERS, CAMERAMEN, CITY OFFICIALS, plus-

           JANICE BRIGHTLY... DER SCUTT... VICTOR PALMIERI... MICHAEL 
           DEPHILLIPS... FRED TRUMP... The only absent player: ROY COHN. 

           The Commodore Hotel towers above Donald at this very pubic 
           press conference unfolding right there on the sidewalk.

                                 DONALD
                        Twenty years ago, I began my 
                        journey as a builder. I followed my 
                        father from property-to-property. 
                        Working. Studying. Learning the 
                        trade. 

           Donald pauses as more everyday NEW YORKERS stop by to listen.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And let me tell you something: 
                        little did I realize that I was 
                        honing my skills for a great 
                        battle, the battle to rescue the 
                        city that I love! New York City. 
                        But it’s in trouble right now, on 
                        the brink of ruin! It really is, 
                        and I don’t like to say that. 

           As Donald works his magic, the crowd grows bigger and louder. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        It’s been devastated! Devastated by 
                        the very officials we elected to 
                        lead it. Isn’t that incredible? We 
                        voted these people into office and 
                        they’re killing us. Just killing 
                        us. These are the dumbest people on 
                        Earth. They’re not smart.  

           The crowd buzzes in agreement! 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        For over a decade now, New York has 
                        watched its economy fail. Seen its 
                        manufacturing jobs dry up. And 
                        witnessed its neighborhoods get 
                        burned to the ground! But no more!
           Donald holds up the NY Daily News; it features PRESIDENT 
           FORD, and that infamous headline: FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        That indifference! That corruption! 
                        The lies and the greed stop now! 
                        Today we won’t back down. Today we 
                        fight! And take back Mid-town! 
                        Today, we start a war to take back 
                        all of New York City!  

           ON JANICE BRIGHTLY -- She’s never seen this: a born-Caesar 
           stoking up his foot soldiers like gas on a brush fire. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        When Richard Ravitch and his U.D.C. 
                        Board convene in six weeks to vote 
                        on The Commodore Hotel’s tax 
                        abatement, they will unanimously 
                        approve our proposal. They will 
                        finally wake up and join our 
                        efforts to rescue the world’s 
                        greatest city, once and for all! 

           AND NOW, THE CROWD GOES ABSOLUTELY BERSERK FOR TRUMP! The 
           Reporters scramble over themselves for access.  

                     REPORTER #1
                                               REPORTER #2
           Mr. Trump! A question! 
                                        Donald! Over here! 

           INT. COMMODORE HOTEL - LOBBY - LATER

           Not one to rest of the laurels of his first blockbuster press 
           conference, Donald works a pay phone hard. Laughing. Smiling.   

                                 DONALD
                        Roy, I wish you could of been here. 
                        It was fantastic. Yeah... Yeah...  
                         (beat)
                        And now? 
                         (then)
                        Well, now that we have the press on 
                        our side, I agree with you: Fuck 
                        Hyatt, we can do whatever we want!

           Michael DePhillips approaches, surprising Donald as he turns.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                         (seeing Michael)
                        Roy, I gotta go. 
                         (hangs up)
                                 MICHAEL
                        Nice speech up there. 

                                 DONALD
                        It needed to be said.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure, but whoever thought we’d hear 
                        it from a real estate guy. 

           Michael holds out a palm. They shake. Donald wipes his hands. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Michael Barrett, New York Times. 
                        Your assistant John Barron told me 
                        to meet you here. 

                                 DONALD
                        A great man, John. I love him. But 
                        he’s back at the office. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Got time for a couple more 
                        questions? 

                                 DONALD
                        How about an exclusive? 

           Michael smiles at Donald’s bravado. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure, we could do a Sunday Times 
                        profile? Put you on the cover. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’d like that. An exclusive 
                        interview with Manhattan’s biggest 
                        and best new developer. It’s a 
                        magnificent idea. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I was kidding. 

                                 DONALD
                        Michael, what can I say? I’m in 
                        demand.
                         (beat)
                        And more importantly, this is a 
                        chance for your paper to write 
                        about a project that’s going to 
                        help The City.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        As long as it’s the truth. 
                                 DONALD
                        My story’s better than the truth. 

           Michael ponders the opportunity. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        How ‘bout I file this first one. 
                        Then we’ll talk. 

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - STREET - DAWN

           Donald walks across Madison Ave and 62nd Street on the posh 
           Upper East Side unfurling the morning’s The New York Times. 

           He savors the heroic picture of himself at the press 
           conference, and positively salivates over his article:

           DEVELOPER DONALD TRUMP CALLS OUT U.D.C. HEAD RICHARD RAVITCH

           Written by Michael DePhillips

           Donald slaps the article down on the STREET -- face up --  so 
           that whomever lives here gets a morning dose of Trump. 

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - STREET - LATER

           Richard Ravitch steps out of his front door and picks up this 
           paper with its accompanying Trump article.

                                 RAVITCH (PRE-LAP)
                        Today guys, we’re talking about 
                        Donald Trump...

           INT. URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Ravitch, now wearing a three-piece suit and horn-rimmed 
           glasses, slaps six thick Trump tax proposals down on a table 
           in front of his fellow U.D.C. BOARD MEMBERS.  

                                 RAVITCH
                        In order to rebuild the Commodore 
                        Hotel, he’ll need us. The vote of 
                        every single person in this room.
                         (then)
                        Without that, he’s finished. 

           This is his team of bureaucrats: JASON HALLER, TOM HARNETT, 
           NED EICHLER, MALCOLM JACKSON and JOHN MANES:

           All together, they are six elite, lily white men (40’s to 
           60’s) Manhattan born & bred, establishment figures. 
                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        So, opening up to page one...

           All of them turn to the first page of Donald’s tax proposal 
           as Ravitch walks them through the details and WE INTERCUT: 

           INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Donald tacks an index card up on a white wall inside this 
           tiny office space. The card is labeled, U.D.C. VOTE. 

                                 RAVITCH (O.S.)
                        He’s proposing to purchase The 
                        Commodore outright for $10 million. 
                        When that happens, he wants us to 
                        use the cash to pay off the hotel’s 
                        outstanding, $7 million tax debt. 

           Beneath it, Donald tacks up those same U.D.C. names along 
           with their pictures:

           JASON HALLER, TOM HARNETT, NED EICHLER, MALCOLM JACKSON, JOHN 
           MANES and RICHARD RAVITCH.

                                 RAVITCH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        With the hotel out of arrears, he 
                        then wants to sell the property to 
                        The City for a single dollar bill.

           These U.D.C. guys look around, unsure they heard it right. 

                                 RAVITCH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        After that transaction, he plans to 
                        lease The Commodore back from New 
                        York for a term of ninety-nine 
                        years. It’s a very clever ploy...

           INT. ‘21’ CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           At ‘21’ Club, Roy and Donald pitch U.D.C. Board Members Tom 
           Harnett and Malcolm Jackson really hard. 

           Donald awes them, practically jumping through flaming hoops, 
           wildly gesticulating his ideas! 

                                 RAVITCH (O.S.)
                        Because with this tax burden 
                        removed, he then plans to become a 
                        tenant paying rent - not a business 
                        paying taxes. Rent that he alone 
                        plans to control. 
           Note: no money changes hands throughout this whole sequence. 
           No bribes: it’s all about the energy of Trump’s Vision. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back with Ravitch, the different Board Members turn the pages 
           of their proposals, listening as their Chairman continues:  

                                 RAVITCH
                        And according to Donald, his ‘rent’ 
                        isn’t due for the first 39 years of 
                        this deal. 

           INT. MET MUSEUM - ROOF GARDEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Janice hob-nobs with U.D.C. Board Member Jason Haller at a 
           gala fund-raiser. 

                                 RAVITCH (O.S.)
                        As an actual real estate developer, 
                        Donald is a novice. He’s yet to 
                        erect so much as a cardboard box in 
                        this City.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back with Ravitch as he lectures his Board Members:  

                                 RAVITCH
                        But he still thinks he can tackle a 
                        1,700 room, $80 million hotel 
                        renovation with no contracted hotel 
                        operator, no designs and financing 
                        that’s a time bomb ready to blow.  

           INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           Donald and Board Member John Manes ride around in the back of 
           a limo as Donald points out Fred Sr’s building projects.   

                                 RAVITCH (O.S.)
                        Bottom line: he’s got no skin in 
                        this game, no track record as an 
                        actual builder and The City pays 
                        for everything, even though - last 
                        time I checked - it’s not in the 
                        hotel business. 
           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS

           Beside a gorgeous putting green Donald pontificates about his 
           grand plan as he chips balls with Board Member Ned Eichler.   

                                 RAVITCH (O.S.)
                        Now, I offered him $70 million 
                        worth of tax incentives, a fair 
                        deal, and he said ‘no’. He refuses 
                        to consider anything but this full 
                        $111 million tax abatement.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back with Ravitch, as the various Board Members close the 
           proposals in front of them. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        Which if we vote to approve, earns 
                        Trump upwards of $19.2 million in 
                        profits per year. Totally tax free. 

           Ravitch removes his glasses to rub his eyes. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        Look guys, as you all know, my 
                        company and I have benefitted from 
                        certain exemptions, but this is 
                        insane. The City will bounce back 
                        eventually - he knows this - and so 
                        he’s looking to manipulate us to 
                        ensure he can buy low now, so can 
                        charge ridiculously high rents 
                        later. And worst of all, he’s using 
                        The City’s pending bankruptcy to 
                        avoid paying taxes!  

           Ravitch picks up the proposal and tosses it in a trash can!  

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        For all these reasons, this is the 
                        single worst tax give-way in real 
                        estate history.   

           He looks out at the nodding faces in front of him. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        So, with all that in mind, I’d like 
                        to take a preliminary vote.
           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s late. Like 11:00 PM. Donald and Janice stare, exhausted, 
           at this WALL of U.D.C. votes. She checks off two measly 
           names: Eichler & Haller. 

           After all that, they’ve secured only two (out of six) votes.  

                                 JANICE
                        These Board Members don’t know you. 
                        You’re the new kid on the block. 
                        What’s more, you’re Fred Trump’s 
                        kid, the profiteer’s kid. 
                         (thinking)
                        You’re going to have to go deeper. 
                        Really show them who you are and 
                        what you’re capable of. 

                                 DONALD
                        How do I show them anything if they 
                        won’t get behind this?

                                 JANICE
                        I don’t know. But it’s not just you 
                        as a builder. They need to know who 
                        you are as a person as well. 

           Donald glares at this wall, the name: Ravitch: his obsession.

                                 DONALD
                        I need a stiff fucking prick here, 
                        Janice. I thought you were someone 
                        who could get things done. 

           Donald steps right up into her face. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I moved you back to New York. Gave 
                        you an apartment, this huge 
                        opportunity. You need to show me 
                        what you’re capable of. 

                                 JANICE
                        I’m not sure I know what you’re 
                        talking about. 

                                 DONALD
                        I think you do. 

                                 JANICE
                        I’m already compromised here. My 
                        work with you is a total conflict 
                        of interest and I won’t do any more 
                        than that! 
                                 DONALD
                        I don’t give a shit about your 
                        ethics.

                                 JANICE
                        You don’t talk to me like that. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’ll talk however I please. 

           Donald’s practically on top of her now. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You better think of something 
                        quick.

                                 JANICE
                        Or what?!

           From across the war room, Fred Sr. enters, carrying two cups 
           of coffee, SLAMMING the door behind him! Seeing Fred Sr, 
           Donald pivots, turning on the charm.

                                 DONALD
                        Just in time. We need your help. 
                        With our mutual friend Richard 
                        Ravitch. 

           Fred Sr. glumly stabs his finger at Ravitch’s name. 

                                 FRED SR.
                        He’s the reason you don’t build in 
                        Manhattan you dumb fuck! 

                                 JANICE 
                        W-we actually think we’ll get to 
                        him. Eventually. 

           But Fred Sr. isn’t buying it; he looks directly at Donald. 

                                 FRED SR.
                        You took on more debt. Bad debt. 
                        At interest rates, my God...  

           Janice looks at them for an explanation. 

                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                        You fucked this whole thing to 
                        hell! 

                                 DONALD
                        I did nothing of the sort!  
                                 FRED SR.
                        We’ll never pay back that kind...

                                 DONALD
                        ENOUGH!

           Donald raises his hand to keep Janice from hearing more.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you?! Outside! 
                        Right now! 

           Donald grabs Fred by his shoulder; hustles to the door. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                         (to Janice)
                        Don’t leave. We’re not finished 
                        here. 

           They exit, deserting Janice, in an office, in the wee hours. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN, NY - STREET - NIGHT 

           A chilly night. Donald and Fred Sr. stand on a corner, 
           breathing out misty air.  

                                 FRED SR.
                        We’re talking over $6 million a 
                        month in debt service?! 

                                 DONALD
                        The money’s under control. When The 
                        Commodore happen... 

                                 FRED SR.
                         (interrupting)
                        Fuck the Commodore! It’ll need to 
                        make two million a day just to 
                        cover the interest! 

           Fred Sr. stamps his feet together to warm up. 

                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                        And if this City takes another nose 
                        dive, that’s it! We’re finished! 

           Donald grabs his father and shakes him!  

                                 DONALD
                        I’m a dealmaker! You hear me?! The 
                        best this town’s ever seen! The 
                        Commodore will succeed! 
           Fred Sr’s eyes widen; like he’s seeing himself in a mirror. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You know I can do this.

           Fred Sr. nods at the truth behind this statement. 

           He looks at his shoes -- makes to talk, stops, then...

                                 FRED SR. 
                        Donny, it’s not just the money. 
                         (beat)
                        It’s Freddy... He quit last week. 

           Fred Sr. struggles, loath to show weakness, but presses on. 

                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                        And the drinking. It’s out of hand. 
                        Your mother’s worried sick. He 
                        disappears for weeks on end. 
                         (then)
                        He’s killing himself. 

                                 DONALD
                        Christ.

           Donald looks up at the tall buildings that offer no solace. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I can help, but I need a couple 
                        days. Maybe a week.  

                                 FRED SR.
                        Donny, he needs us. He needs you. 
                        Right now. 

                                 DONALD
                        I know. I know. But when I close 
                        this deal, our whole world changes. 
                        Freddy changes too. It’s all gonna 
                        be different after this deal, pop. 
                        I promise. 

           Donald wraps Fred Sr. up in a hug. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Please. I’ll find him and talk to 
                        him, okay...? 

                                 FRED SR.
                        Thanks. 

           Fred Sr. gestures back to the war room and that imposing WALL 
           Donald is struggling to bust through.  
                                 FRED
                        Take another look at Manhattan 
                        Plaza, Ravitch’s next development. 
                        He’s a builder at heart and you 
                        know what I always say: wherever 
                        there’s a builder breaking 
                        ground...

                                 DONALD
                         (grins; finishing)
                        There’s dirt. 

           EXT. HELL’S KITCHEN - STREET - DAY

           A light snow falls. Donald plods through a far West Side 
           wasteland of crumbling tenements and pillaged vehicles.  

           He carries a CAMERA, and wears a tacky 70’s suit and overcoat 
           as two heavily made-up junkie PROSTITUTES toss him come-
           hither looks.  

           CLICK! Donald snaps their pictures, then rounds a corner to 
           see a gigantic construction site. He aims his camera up at 
           this half-built residential tower:  

           MANHATTAN PLAZA - CLICK! 

           Two burly Construction Workers and a FOREMAN erect a small 
           scaffold, but overall, this job looks closed down, desolate.  

                                 DONALD
                        The biggest project in The City 
                        right now and you got three guys on 
                        it!? 

           This Foreman, 40’s, full-on NY attitude, turns to Donald.  

                                 FOREMAN
                        What’s it to you? 

           The Foreman stomps right up to the lens, but Donald doesn’t 
           back down. He fast-flips out his wallet, FLETCH-style.  

                                 DONALD
                        John Barron, Local 92, Home-
                        Wrecker’s Union. Your paperwork, 
                        please? 

                                 FOREMAN
                        I don’t have to give you shit. 

           Donald CLICKS! another shot and starts walking away. 
                                 DONALD
                        Fine, I’ll take it up with the 
                        building commissioner. 

           As Donald departs this Foreman rethinks his strategy, looking 
           around at his dormant project that should be robust. 

                                 FOREMAN
                        Hang on a second. 

           The Foreman rummages through his pockets. 

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        They’re right here. 

           Donald looks over the proffered union contracts and building 
           permits, and then hands them back. 

                                 DONALD
                        Where’s your manager? 

           Donald SNAPS several more pictures.  

                                 FOREMAN
                        That’s me. Promoted yesterday. 
                         (resigned)
                        Listen, I got enough problems here, 
                        big ones, but do me a favor: take 
                        it up with H.R.H, okay?  

           Donald pauses, thinks it over, and then finally: 

                                 DONALD 
                        I plan to. 

           He calmly frames up one more shot - CLICK!

           EXT. SUBURBAN PENNSYLVANIA - AIRPORT - ROOFTOP BAR - NIGHT

           A warm night. Seen from a rooftop patio, tiny Cessna and 
           Sandpiper planes flit across a brilliant red-orange sunset.

           Freddy regales a group of PILOTS and STEWARDESSES with his 
           spot-on W.C. Fields impression, drunk, sweating heavily.  

           Around his arm, LINDA BALDWIN, a stewardess (30’s) smiles. 

                                 FREDDY
                         (W.C. Fields quote)
                        As I always say, if you can’t 
                        dazzle them with brilliance, baffle 
                        them with bull! 
           This CROWD CHORTLES with delighted laughter, yelling for more 
           as Freddy turns to see Donald walking up a flight of stairs.

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Donny! 

           Donald pulls at Freddy’s elbow, hustling him away from Linda, 
           towards a railing, spilling Freddy’s drink the process.

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Woah, fuck.

                                 DONALD
                        What is this out here, Freddy? 

           Donald’s stern tone causes the friends to disperse, and 
           Freddy to try and compose himself. 

                                 FREDDY
                        I thought I was just having a 
                        drink? 

           Freddy reclaims his arm from Donald’s grasp. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                         (more drunken W.C. Fields)
                        ‘cause, you know, this one time, 
                        during Prohibition I was forced to 
                        live for days on nothing but food 
                        and water. 

           Donald signals a Waitress for a cup of coffee. 

                                 DONALD
                        Cut it out. Please. 

           Donald gives Freddy the coffee, he sips it. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been gone for weeks. No 
                        one’s heard from you. We’re 
                        worried.   

           Freddy looks out at the small airfield full of planes.

                                 FREDDY
                        At LeHigh, I used to fly planes. 

                                 DONALD
                        Yeah? 

                                 FREDDY
                        So I’ve been thinking about... been 
                        taking a few lessons.

                        I’m gonna be an airline pilot. 

           Donald throws his hands on top of his head, flabbergasted.

                                 DONALD
                        How old are you now? 33?!  

           Freddy wobbles, still drunk, he looks terrible. 

                                 FREDDY
                        Old enough to take care of myself, 
                        dad. 

                                 DONALD
                         (ignoring the dig)
                        I love you, Freddy. I want to help, 
                        but I can’t be here. My own 
                        life’s... not exactly perfect and 
                        I’m running out of time. This deal 
                        of mine happens now or it dies. 

                                 FREDDY
                        I was supposed to be the one... 

                                 DONALD
                        That’s why it’s so important to us! 

                                 FREDDY
                        Not us. You! And only you!

                                 DONALD
                        That’s enough. 

                                 FREDDY
                        I fucking hate you! 

           Freddy SWINGS an inebriated RIGHT HOOK! DONALD easily dodges 
           the drunken blow, cuffs Freddy, grapples him down.

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Offf! 

           Donald bear-hugs his big brother, easing him onto a couch. As 
           Freddy passes out, Donald looks around-  

           Linda: she watched this dust-up, embarrassed. Donald drapes 
           Freddy’s arm around him and shuffles him down the steps. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Donald drives, his wiper blades whip away a slight drizzle. 
           With a cap over his face, Freddy sleeps off his drunk in the 
           backseat. He stirs, looks around, feels a throbbing headache. 
           Out of pure habit, he lights up a smoke. He notices Donald. 

                                 FREDDY
                        You ‘member the Verrazano? 

           Donald looks into the rearview mirror. 

                                 DONALD
                        You alright? 

           Freddy looks out the window at the rain. The passing trees. 

                                 FREDDY
                        I don’t know. No. 
                         (back to his story)
                        You remember that day? 

                                 DONALD
                        At the Verrazano Bridge? 

                                 FREDDY
                        Yeah. The grand opening. Dad took 
                        us. You were only about seven. 

           Freddy exhales a fog of smoke as Donald struggles to recall. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        It was raining. Everyone was 
                        soaked. They barely wanted to cut 
                        the ribbon. All these fat-cat 
                        politicians who voted against this 
                        bridge; they’re up on a stage 
                        getting feted. One by one, the shit-
                        heels are being celebrated.  

           Freddy pauses, tearing up a little. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        And all you cared about was Othmar 
                        Ammann. 

           Donald looks back again, unsure-

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        The designer. You couldn’t stop 
                        talking about him. About how this 
                        85-year old guy came all the way 
                        over from Switzerland; he poured 
                        his heart and soul into that bridge 
                        and nobody even mentioned his name 
                        that day. 
           Donald nods, finally recalling the memory. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        They didn’t even thank him. And 
                        you... I’ll never forget what you 
                        told me on the way back home.
                         (beat)
                        You said: if you let people treat 
                        you how they want, they’ll make a 
                        sucker out of you every time. 

           Freddy leans back in the seat, closes his eyes.

           INT. STREET - DAY

           NY Times reporter MICHAEL DEPHILLIPS stands on a street 
           corner. He jams his hands into his pockets to keep warm as a 
           black stretch limousine pulls up. Donald leans out its 
           window.

                                 DONALD
                        Please, step into my office. 

           INT. LIMOUSINE - LATER

           A tape recorder rolls -- Donald and Michael sit across from 
           each other inside the long expanse of limo. 

                                 DONALD
                        So what are people saying about me, 
                        Michael? 

           Writer DePhillips jots notes on a legal pad while also 
           holding up a microphone that’s attached to the tape recorder. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Do they say that I’m loyal? That 
                        I’m a hard worker? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I thought this was my exclusive. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’d like to know. Please. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I just don’t have that much to go 
                        on yet.  
                                 DONALD
                        Really? That’s not what I heard. I 
                        heard you’ve been asking funny 
                        questions about me all over town. 

           Busted. Michael puts his pen down. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ve been checking up on me? 

           Donald’s gaze affirms it.  

                                 DONALD
                        Our first article was brilliant, a 
                        big hit. People loved it. But this 
                        next one will have to be a bit 
                        more...
                         (beat)
                        Specific. So humor me. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        The talk is that they’re not going 
                        to grant you this abatement. 

                                 DONALD
                        Who said that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can’t name my sources. 

                                 DONALD
                        That’s not what they’re saying. 
                        My competitors, maybe. 

           Donald reaches over to the wet bar, grabs a pitcher of water 
           and two glasses. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s stop the tape. Water? 

           Michael stops the tape recorder, takes the water.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You live in Brownsville.  

           The reporter nods.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Brownsville’s where you grew up. 
                        Where you teach. You even do 
                        advocacy work there for the poor. 

           Barrett listens suspiciously. 
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Michael, don’t you see? We both do 
                        the same thing. We’re both 
                        rebuilding neighborhoods. But you 
                        and your family don’t have to live 
                        there. My father and I have 
                        apartments all over The City. 
                        Apartments I can set you up in. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m not sure I follow. 

                                 DONALD
                        Then I’ll say it another way: I 
                        can’t have a word of bad press 
                        right now. It’ll destroy my deal. 

           An awkward silence hangs as the limo slows to a stop. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Do we have an understanding? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, I think we’re good. 

           Donald’s LIMO DRIVER (30’s) walks around to Michael’s door. 

                                 DONALD
                        Good. I think this is your stop. 

           The door opens, Michael steps out and Donald’s charm shifts 
           back on.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Same time next week. 

           INT. NEW YORK CITY - WEST VILLAGE - PIANO BAR - NIGHT 

           It’s very late. Roy sits in a booth with Donald as a DRAG 
           QUEEN (60) plays a cover of Both Sides Now by Judy Collins.  

                                 ROY
                        So you try again. 

                                 DONALD
                        Ravitch won’t come to the table. 
                        None of them will. 

           Roy sips his scotch, frowns, he’s drunk. 

                                 ROY
                        Don’t give me that bullshit. I 
                        hired the Deputy Mayor for you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROY (CONT'D)
                        When his term’s up, he comes to 
                        work for me so that you can go off 
                        and build your little hotel. 

           Roy SLAMS his glass down to summon a refill!  

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        No one really cares how you get 
                        those votes. Only that you get ‘em.  

           That Drag Queen, wearing a glam-mask of make-up, finishes-

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        This country’s built on winning. 
                        S’only thing that matters. The only 
                        thing anyone remembers. 
                         (beat)
                        Why dontcha call old Johnny Boy? 

                                 DONALD
                        Who? 

                                 ROY
                        Johnny Gotti. He’s out on parole. 
                        He’ll have a word with Dickie 
                        Ravitch for you. 

                                 DONALD
                        Roy, we need to focus. 

                                 ROY
                        No, what we need is a song. 

           Roy waves his new drink over at the Drag Queen, spills a bit. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        You! You know anything worth 
                        hearing? 

           Roy shuffles over to the piano, pulls out a $100 bill and 
           stuffs it into the tip jar. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        How about God Bless America!?  

           Some in the bar WHOOP it up for Roy; others HECKLE LOUDLY!  
           Roy HECKLES right back, then plops himself down at the piano. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                         (blustery singing)
                        GOD BLESS AMERICA! 

           The Drag Queen BELLOWS this patriotic anthem, pounding out a 
           sudsy, melodramatic rendition-
                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        LAND THAT I LOVE! STAND BESIDE 
                        HER...!

           Unable to resist Roy’s reckless charisma, Donald finally, 
           reluctantly, starts mouthing the words.  

           INT. NEW YORK CITY - H.R.H. CONSTRUCTION - DAY

           Donald wipes SWEAT off his brow inside a white-walled lobby. 

           A nearby plaque reads: H.R.H. CONSTRUCTION. This is the 
           corporate stronghold of Richard Ravitch.   

           But all around, Donald notices signs of weakness: many 
           EMPLOYEES exit carrying boxes. Some pictures on the wall, of 
           Ravitch and his fellow EXECUTIVES, are being taken down. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        John Barron? 

                                 DONALD
                        In the flesh. 

           Donald turns to see GEORGE PEACOCK (23) Account Executive. 
           Glasses. Nice Suit. They shake, then Donald cleans his hands. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Hot enough out there for you? 

                                 DONALD
                        Hottest July on record.

                                 GEORGE
                        So I heard. This way. 

           George beckons Donald towards a bank of elevators. 

                                 DONALD
                         (gestures to the pictures)
                        I was just admiring the talent. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Sure, we have some great folks 
                        here. 

                                 DONALD
                        Is Richard in? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Our absentee C.E.O? These days he 
                        mostly works out of City Hall. 
                                 DONALD
                        Good for him. 

           George and Donald arrive at the elevators as a Team Of Movers 
           brushes past them carrying big loads of furniture. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Throwing a yard sale? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Ha. Just a little... restructuring. 

           Donald stops George before going into the elevator. 

                                 DONALD
                        George, I can’t bid H.R.H. on 
                        anything unless I know it’s 
                        solvent. 

           George pauses. 

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s complicated. But if you come 
                        upstairs, I can explain everything. 

           DING! The doors open. 

           INT. NEW YORK CITY - OLYMPIA TOWERS – PENTHOUSE – NIGHT

           A few cardboard boxes suggest someone’s just moved in. 

           This is Donald’s new apartment; it looks like a brothel 
           decorated by Sadam Hussein: pink marble, garish colors, 
           glittering brass and gilded everything. 

                                 DONALD
                         (into phone)
                        I’ve got him, Roy. 

           Manhattan stretches out from the tall windows, in all 
           directions, like a giant neon map. 

                                 ROY (O.S.)
                        How?

                                 DONALD
                        Ravitch. H.R.H. He needs a bailout. 
                        The City’s debt crisis is 
                        strangling every project he’s got.  

           In the foreground, a shapely BLONDE moves freely about the 
           space like a dancer, or an athlete. 
                                 ROY (O.S.)
                        A little birdy tell you that? 

                                 DONALD
                        Co-Op City. The fucking convention 
                        center. Manhattan Plaza alone is 
                        underwater to the tune of about $75 
                        million. 

                                 ROY (O.S.)
                        So we leak it.  

           That SHAPE is NAKED! She slinks overs. Kisses him. A hug. 
           This is Trump’s Bond girl: IVANA

                                 DONALD
                        No, not yet.

                                 IVANA
                         (Czech whisper)
                        Let’s run away and get married. 

                                 DONALD
                         (to Ivana)
                        Sweetheart, please. I’m working.  

           Donald points to the moving boxes, covering the phone. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        And could you please start putting 
                        some of this shit away? 

           Intimidated by his command, Ivana obeys. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                         (to Roy)
                        I’ve got something better in mind. 

                                 ROY (O.S.)
                        Like what?

                                 DONALD
                        We’re going to hire him. 

           Click, click - the phone imperceptibly goes dead. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        If I save his dying company, he has 
                        to vote for us. Roy... Roy?! 

           Donald jabs a thumb into the phone: no Roy, no dial tone.

           And then, the shining lights of The City swoon off...
           ALL OF NEW YORK FLICKERS OUT IN A TOTAL BLACK OUT!

           Donald looks at the wall clock. It’s stopped at 8:45 PM. 

           (Yep, this really happened, July 13th, 1977)  

           BEGIN AN EPIC NYC BLACK OUT MONTAGE:

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE – ELAINE’S – NIGHT

           Car headlights illuminate this iconic watering hole as Janice 
           Brightly entertains a table of U.D.C board members (Manes & 
           Jackson), throwing an impromptu Black Out party. 

           On a chalkboard: no lights, no food but lots of liquor. 

           INT. TRUMP VILLAGE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Carrying an oversized FLASHLIGHT, Fred Sr. hustles from 
           apartment-to-apartment making sure his TENANTS are safe 
           during this city-wide calamity. 

                                 FRED SR.
                        Stay calm! We’ll have the power 
                        back on as soon as possible! 

           EXT. SOHO – PUB – NIGHT 

           Bleary-eyed and reeling, Freddy drunkenly staggers out of a 
           downtown bar only to see a horde of LOOTERS!

                                 FREDDY
                        Holy s-shit! 

           Various miscreants sweep him up in a wave of dense, panicked 
           humanity barreling down Crosby Street. 

           A scene from The Warriors come to life. He’s terrified.  

           A ravaged OLDSMOBILE PLOWS - SLAMMMM!! - SMACK through the 
           iron storefront grate of a PAWN SHOP!

           CRASH! GLASS EXPLODES! Screaming!!

           Looters pirate their way in, taking VALUABLES left and right. 
           The confused onslaught thrashes Freddy on the ground! 

           EXT. BROWNSVILLE, NY – NIGHT

           An eerie light plays over the blackened face of MICHAEL 
           DEPHILLIPS. He lives at Ground Zero, the Brownsville section 
           of Brooklyn. SIRENS SCREAM through the dark!
           Michael stares at a burning tenement next to St. Barbara’s 
           Cathedral as a pair of hands pass him a bucket of water. 

           Michael passes the bucket to the next person beside him in 
           the FIRE-LINE as he and a group of community VOLUNTEERS 
           attempt to extinguish the blaze. It’s hellish. Terrifying. 

           Michael processes all of this mayhem, a bitter hateful 
           despair spreading across his face.  

           EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, MANHATTAN - AVENUE A - DAY

           Donald, bloodshot eyes, walks through a decimated 
           neighborhood, assessing the disaster. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
                        And in the aftermath of the city-
                        wide black out... 

           Dispersed packs of LOOTERS still flit through the streets 
           hauling couches over their heads -- electronics -- food.  

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        President Ford has finally 
                        dispatched aide from the National 
                        Guard...

           EXT. BROOKLYN - FLATBUSH AVE - DAY

           Inside his limo, Donald holds hands with Ivana. They look out 
           the windows to see whole buildings razed and shops busted 
           wide open on this central thoroughfare. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        The costs of the catastrophe piling 
                        untold millions onto the city’s on-
                        going financial crisis... 

           EXT. QUEENS - ROOSEVELT AVE - DAY

           Donald steps out of his limo onto a ravaged street.

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        And with New York falling further 
                        and further into chaos... 

           He walks up to a stoop and nods to a shirtless BLACK MAN as 
           they both turn to watch this NEWSCASTER on a stolen TV set. 
                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Many officials now doubt any 
                        economic recovery is possible in 
                        the wake of such a disaster. 

           INT. QUEENS, NY - JAMAICA ESTATES - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Fred Sr’s massive frame reigns over a silent, uneasy dinner. 
           A disheveled Donald enters, stalking past everyone as Mary 
           and Robert mutely shift food across vintage China.

                                 FRED SR.
                        Dinner’s over. 

                                 DONALD
                        I already ate. 

           INT. QUEENS, NY - JAMAICA ESTATES - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Donald dials a number on a rotary phone as Fred Sr’s shadow 
           passes over him. 

                                 DONALD
                        Dad, please. 

           Fred Sr. reaches his arm back around the wall, disconnecting 
           Donald’s call.

                                 FRED SR
                        We’re officially in default! 

           Fred Sr. yanks the phone away from Donald’s slumping form.  

                                 FRED SR.
                        Millions of dollars in the hole and 
                        not a single brick laid! 

           Mary pokes her head into the hallway.

                                 MARY
                        What’s going on? 

                                 FRED SR. 
                        This one... 

           Fred Sr. JABS Donald hard with a FINGER! 

                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                        Makes dumb bets he can’t cover and 
                        then shows the world what a spoiled 
                        fucking brat he is...
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRED SR. (CONT’D)
                         (outraged)
                        BY HAVING ME PICK UP THE TAB!  

                                 MARY
                        Fred, let him be.

                                 FRED SR. 
                         (to Mary)
                        Stay out of this!

                                 DONALD
                        You’re so full of shit! 

           Donald stands, fires a fist at Fred Sr’s FACE! 

           Fred Sr. ducks, swings back at Donald who blocks the blow and 
           counters with a heavy RIGHT UPPERCUT -- his knuckles catch a 
           piece of Fred Sr’s forehead. 

                                 FRED SR. 
                        Rggh! 

           They GRAPPLE as Mary bats away at their backs and Robert 
           storms into the breech. 

                                 MARY
                        JUST STOP IT! 

                                 ROBERT
                        Cut the shit! 

           Fred Sr. grabs a phone book, BASHING Donald on the head!  

                                 DONALD
                        Aaghn! 

           But Donald HAMMERS back with an elbow into Fred Sr’s GUT as 
           Robert fails to drag his brother away!  

                                 FRED SR. 
                        Ommff! 

                                 DONALD
                        What’d you always tell us, dad, 
                        hunh?! WHAT’D YOU FUCKING TELL US!

           Donald LANDS a HOOK, then another, beating Fred Sr. down. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                         (mimicking Fred)
                        YOU’RE A TRUMP!! 

           Mary stares in horror at this violent spectacle. 
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        AND ALL TRUMPS ARE KILLERS! 

           Fred Sr. crawls through puddling blood. Mary attends to him 
           but he pushes her off. Donald wants more but Robert finally 
           hauls him outside. 

           EXT. QUEENS, NY - JAMAICA ESTATES - FRONT PORCH - LATER

           Several wide Georgian columns enclose Robert and Donald 
           inside a spacious front porch. 

           Robert stares at his sibling as Donald presses a slab of meat 
           into his reddening cheek, a prolonged silence.

                                 ROBERT
                        The old man’s lost it over Freddy. 
                        We all have.  

                                 DONALD
                        And you think I don’t know that?

                                 ROBERT
                        Do you ever let up? I mean 
                        seriously.   

                                 DONALD
                        No, actually I don’t. And why 
                        should I? 

           Donald tosses the meat aside and stalks off the porch. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - BENCH - DAY

           Donald wears sunglasses to hide his black eye. He sits with 
           Michael DePhillips on a park bench, gazing at the wide 
           expanse of the Sheep’s Meadow in Central Park.

                                 DONALD
                        You have to have a rough draft. I 
                        have to see it. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Donald, if I don’t let my editors 
                        at The Times look at my rough 
                        drafts, why would I let you? 

           Michael scalds Donald with an fiery glare.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And you still haven’t answered all 
                        my questions. 
                                 DONALD
                        There was no investigation! It’s 
                        all lies. From my competition. 
                        They’re jealous of me, of my 
                        success, don’t you see that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s not what the record says. 

           Michael flips through the pages of his note pad, reading: 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Your father... Twice blacklisted. 
                        He’s built nothing for over a 
                        decade. Accused of misappropriation 
                        of FHA funds. The racial 
                        discrimination case in 1971... 

                                 DONALD
                        Michael, you’ve got me all wrong. 
                        I’m helping this city. People are 
                        excited about me, excited about The 
                        Commodore. That’s what you’re going 
                        to write. That’s the story that’s 
                        going to make your career! 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not until I get some answers.

                                 DONALD
                        Then I’ll sue you for libel. The 
                        New York Times is not a big paper 
                        to me. It isn’t. You don’t want 
                        this kind of attention!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Just try me. 

           Infuriated, Donald stops pacing. 

                                 DONALD 
                        I’m asking you as a friend, please. 
                        Let’s just smooth this all over?

                                 MICHAEL
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 DONALD
                        I think you know. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        A bribe!? Is that what you’re 
                        talking about?
                                 DONALD
                        If that’s what it takes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Get over yourself.  

           Michael stands, shoves his questions into Donald’s pocket. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Answer every single one. Or my next 
                        article, at that little paper, is 
                        going to end you. 

           He hustles off leaving Donald boiling over with anger. 

           INT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, NY - APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A man in pajamas, Janice Brightly’s husband, FRANK, opens the 
           door for Donald.

           In his 30’s, he’s half-asleep but wakes up a little upon 
           seeing Donald wearing sunglasses and looking beat-down-   

                                 FRANK
                        You alright, Donald? 

           Donald nods solemnly. 

                                 DONALD
                        Is she in? 

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. She’s around here somewhere.  

           Donald staggers into an enormous apartment, with gorgeous 
           views of downtown Manhattan. He promptly slumps onto a couch.

                                 DONALD
                        That’s quite a view. 

           Janice enters, hearing him.

                                 JANICE
                        You know what they say about 
                        location. 

           She grimaces at Donald’s black eye. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 

           She rushes over for a closer look. 
                                 DONALD
                        It’s nothing. Please, I’m fine. 

                                 JANICE
                        Does it hurt? Let me get you some 
                        ice. 

                                 DONALD
                        No, it’s okay, please. 

                                 JANICE
                         (sniffs)
                        And when’s the last time you had a 
                        shower? 

           Donald shakes his head -- can’t think about that now. 

                                 DONALD
                        I gave you all this... 
                         (gestures to the space)
                        This apartment. The real estate 
                        job. And I will take it away. 

           Janice sips some tea, ponders Donald’s threat. 

                                 JANICE
                        You know the first thing I told 
                        Frank after we met? 

           Janice nods towards her bedroom where Frank now sleeps.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        That you were the most incredible 
                        man I’d ever laid eyes on. That you 
                        were this wild breath of fresh air, 
                        the opposite of every droning 
                        politician I’d been force-fed over 
                        the years. You’re special and you 
                        remind me of my father... Well, you 
                        can imagine how all this went over 
                        with him. 

           Donald remains unmoved. She steps closer to make her point. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        And if that’s the kind of emotion 
                        you can inspire, in not just me, 
                        but everyone, we’ll get the votes. 
                         (thinks)
                        Hell, we’ll get the entire world’s 
                        vote. 
                                 DONALD
                        And the financing? How do I put 
                        that back together. 

                                 JANICE
                        We’ll get it all. But you have to 
                        evolve. Be more respectful. More  
                        diplomatic. You understand?  

           Donald nods. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call The Governor again in the 
                        morning. See what he has to say.  

           She takes him by the shoulder, hugs him tightly. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        But in the meantime, you have to 
                        promise me you’ll go home, sleep, 
                        think about what I’ve said, and not 
                        do anything stupid.

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Donald stands at an airline ticket counter. 

                                 DONALD
                        The red-eye to Chicago, please. 

           INT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - SKYLINE - NIGHT

           We see an aerial view sweeping down on the Chicago skyline. 
           The Sears Tower. The Tribune Building. Then, one particularly 
           tall skyscraper comes into focus:

           It’s made of black glass; has a big sign: HYATT REGENCY EAST  

                                 JAY (PRE-LAP)
                        That’s the East Tower...

           INT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO, IL - OFFICE - DAY

           Donald sits with Jay Pritzker, looking out at this building 
           from a palatial corner office. 

                                 JAY
                        Regency West will be completed next 
                        year.

           Donald absorbs its stark, modern grandeur. 
                                 DONALD
                        It’s magnificent.

                                 JAY
                        Let’s take a look at that eye. 

           Donald turns his head to Jay, showing off a big purple welt. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Your old man? 

           Donald nods and Jay smiles, brushes his scalp back to reveal 
           the faded lines of a long, thin scar. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        A wine bottle. When I was 13. For 
                        trying to take a sip. 
                         (then)
                        But you didn’t come all this way 
                        for sympathy. 

                                 DONALD
                        I need $13 million for an interest 
                        payment due in four weeks time. 

           Off Jay’s astounded look, Donald stands, in pitch-mode again.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        But in return, you won’t just be 
                        the hotel operator on this deal. 
                        We’ll be full partners. I’m 
                        offering you a 50% ownership stake, 
                        worth untold millions. 

           Donald closes with the big kicker.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Plus, as many hotels in the New 
                        York City area as Hyatt can 
                        possibly open. I’ll build all of 
                        them for you, at cost. 

           Jay walks to the window, looks out at his Hyatt Regency East. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        My reputation. My credibility. My 
                        entire career is on the line here, 
                        Jay. I need your help. 

                                 JAY
                        You think that building performs 
                        differently... Feels different if 
                        it says Pritzker instead of Hyatt?  
           Donald is silent, thinking. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I always thought so. I always liked 
                        the way Hyatt rolled off the 
                        tongue. And I was right. 

           Jay ambles back to the corner of his desk and sits. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I told my dad about our little 
                        deal. Know what he said?  

           Donald has no idea. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Drumpf. 

           Off Donald’s confused look. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        My father knew your grandad, 
                        Fredreich Drumpf. Met him out in 
                        the Klondike during the Gold Rush 
                        of 1897.
                         (then)
                        Before Fredreich landed here from 
                        Germany, he changed his name. 

           Donald swivels his head back to the Hyatt Regency. It’s as if 
           he’s seeing his own name for the first time. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Trump: to outshine, to eclipse, to 
                        outdo.

           Donald locks in on the graphic HYATT letters emblazoned 
           across its side. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Smart man your grandad. He knew 
                        what a name could stand for and how 
                        far he could ride it. 

           Jay shakes his head.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate you coming all this 
                        way out here, but our deal stands.  

           Jay rises, escorting Donald to the door. 
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You get that tax break first. Then, 
                        and only then... 

           Jay turns the knob and opens the door.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Do you get Hyatt. And all the money 
                        you’ll ever need.   

           EXT. MANHATTAN, NY - HELL’S KITCHEN - STREET - DAY

           Richard Ravitch and his fellow U.D.C. Board Members tour the 
           MANHATTAN PLAZA construction site wearing hard hats and 
           business suits. It’s dead here, no workers, no energy. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        The day the Urban Development 
                        Corporation was born, its creator, 
                        Governor Nelson Rockefeller was 
                        marching in Alabama with Dr. King.  

           Ravtich points up to Manhattan Plaza.   

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        He endowed it the broadest possible 
                        powers so that it could do the most 
                        possible good. 

           He solemnly takes his hard hat off, wipes his brow. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        Our goal is urban renewal. We build 
                        for people, not profits. 
                         (pauses)
                        Yet still, there are those among us 
                        who would use it to reward greed 
                        with even greater wealth. 

           Ravitch meets the eyes of all his U.D.C. Board Members. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        Some of you question my integrity 
                        as a developer. And that’s why I 
                        asked you here today. 

           He opens his arms out wide, taking in the vast property. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        By getting Manhattan Plaza back on 
                        track, we house more low-income 
                        outpatients than any hospital in 
                        the Five Boroughs.

                        But even without us, the Commodore 
                        Hotel can maintain a 60% occupancy 
                        rate on 2000 rooms at $478 a 
                        night... Do the math and I trust 
                        you’ll vote accordingly. 

                                 MALE SECRETARY (PRE-LAP)
                        You’ve reached the office of Roy 
                        Cohn, please leave a message... 

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - TERMINAL - DAY

           BEEP! DONALD sits in a phone booth listening to Roy’s machine 
           He sports a rumpled suit and those same sunglasses. 

                                 DONALD
                        We lost ‘em. Our two measly little 
                        votes. They were in the bag and 
                        Ravitch somehow pulled ‘em out! 

           Donald slumps down. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how he did it. But I 
                        plan to fix this once and for all.
                        Today’s the day. Mano-a-mano. Right 
                        here. Right now. Wish me luck. 

           Donald SLAMS the phone down onto the receiver! He then pumps 
           in more change and dials. RINGING.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Janice, meet me downtown in one 
                        hour. 

           INT. MANHATTAN, NY - U.D.C - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           A proud LOGO etched upon a wall: THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT 
           CORPORATION OF NEW YORK CITY

           Janice and Donald sit on a couch beneath it. She nervously 
           touches Donald’s eye up with foundation. 

                                 JANICE
                        We’re rescheduling.

           Donald ignores her; he’s busy fixing his tie. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        You look awful. 
                                 DONALD
                         (emotion rising)
                        This is it. This is where we 
                        finally get him. Will you trust me? 

                                 JANICE
                        I don’t know. How? 

                                 DONALD
                        We teach him. He needs to learn. 

                                 JANICE
                        Learn!? Donald, honestly, what 
                        could you possibly teach him?!

                                 DONALD
                        That my future is better than his. 

           Ravitch’s secretary, MEGAN (30’s) pretty, approaches. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Excuse me. Mr. Ravitch will see you 
                        now. 

           Donald stands, dons his shades.  

                                 DONALD
                        Wait for my signal. 

           Janice stares as Donald strides off with Megan. 

           INT. CORNER OFFICE - DAY

           Gorgeous space, tasteful appointments, unbeatable view. 
           Ravitch sits behind a stately mahogany desk as Donald stalks 
           into his space.  

                                 RAVITCH
                        The heck happened to you?

           Ravitch holds up his hand for a shake; Donald frowns at it.  

                                 DONALD
                        You and your pals are voting ‘Yes’ 
                        on The Commodore, Richard. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        Are we now? 

           Ravitch withdraws his snubbed hand. 
                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        Even if I think the whole deal is a 
                        huge mistake? 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s jobs. Growth. Mid-town. It’s 
                        going to rescue this Ci...

                                 RAVITCH
                         (interrupting)
                        You could care less about this 
                        City. 

                                 DONALD
                        Bullshit! I’m the only one trying 
                        to save it!  

                                 RAVITCH
                        No, Donald, you’re just a bigger 
                        chip off an old block.    

                                 DONALD
                        I figured you’d react this way.  
                        S’why I brought a special friend.

           With a flourish, Donald beckons Janice into the room.

                                 JANICE
                        This wasn’t my idea. 

                                 RAVITCH
                         (dismayed)
                        You shouldn’t be here.  

                                 JANICE
                        I just thought I could help. 

           Ravitch steps towards Donald, angry.  

                                 RAVITCH
                        She still work for The Governor, 
                        you asshole!  

                                 DONALD
                         (nodding & smiling)
                        She is The Governor! 

                                 RAVITCH
                        Have you lost your fucking mind?! 
                        MEGAN! 

           Ravitch looks out the door for his secretary. 
                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        Call security! Get these two outta 
                        here!

                                 JANICE
                        We’re leaving. 

           Janice reaches for Donald’s arm. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        Please do, sweetheart. You know 
                        better. 

                       DONALD
                                                 JANICE
                                        Donald stop! Please. 
           You can’t talk to her like 
           that!  

           Donald heads over to Ravitch’s phone to call Hugh Carey.

                                 DONALD
                        Carey’s going to have your ass!

                                 RAVITCH
                        When we speak this morning I’ll 
                        ask, but in the meantime...! 

           Ravitch storms over to his desk and chases him away. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        GET THE FUCK OUT!!

           He picks up a paper weight and hurls it at Donald’s head! 

                                 JANICE
                        Ahh!!

           Donald ducks as the glass object smashes - CHISS! - into a 
           million pieces! Janice flees the room hysterical!

                                 RAVITCH
                        You’re finished, Trump!

           Donald stays low, crab-walking out as a letter opener now 
           STABS - FUT! - into the wall above his head!  

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Janice just stares into space as Donald reaches for her arm. 

                                 JANICE
                         (jerking away)
                        Don’t touch me. You really are out 
                        of your mind!

                        The man practically runs this City! 
                        He’s in there right now, destroying 
                        both of us. 

           She looks away from Donald, rubs her brow. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        That night we met... at the party. 
                        You were so smooth. So charming.  

           Off Donald’s guilty look.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        Who needs The Governor, right? When 
                        you can get The Governor’s girl. 

                                 DONALD
                        You can work for me now. Only me.  

                                 JANICE
                        No, I won’t. Not even close. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’ll fix everything. 

                                 JANICE
                        No. 

                                 DONALD
                        Yes. Look at me. 

                                 JANICE
                        NO! Goodbye Donald. 

           Janice walks away, leaving him in the dust. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                         (over her shoulder)
                        Go home. It’s over. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           A SET OF WORKMAN’S TOOLS

           INT. QUEENS, NY - BASEMENT - DAY

           Donald lies defeated on a bench in his father’s workshop. 

           Fluorescent lights shine on these tools of the builder’s 
           trade; the space itself is utterly spotless.  
           He sees many different jars of crooked nails on a shelf with 
           hand-scribbled labels; one reads: TRUMP VILLAGE - USED NAILS. 

           This is who Fred Trump Sr. is: the master D.I.Y. builder. 
           Donald covers his face with his arms. 

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Upstairs, Donald passes the rooms of his siblings, before he 
           finally arrives at one particular door. 

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Donald sits at Freddy’s desk. He’s surrounded by memories: 
           records, a model airplane, pictures of himself with Freddy.  

           On a closet door, Donald sees the penciled notches on the 
           jamb where his siblings measured each other’s heights.

           And as Donald opens this door wider, something shiny catches 
           his eye: a bottle of vodka. Looking closer, Donald sees 
           several more empty bottles tucked away, discretely hidden. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           IVANA putters around in the kitchen, plopping a sandwich down 
           in front of Donald as he nods off at the table. 

           Mary enters, carrying a bag of groceries, and greets Ivana 
           with a warm KISS on both cheeks.   

                                 MARY
                         (to Donald)
                        Did you get your father’s message? 

           Donald looks up to see her rummaging around a messy counter. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s here somewhere. About The 
                        Commodore.  

                                 DONALD
                        That’s over, ma. 

           Mary hands Donald the note. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        The money fell apart. I couldn’t 
                        get the votes. Just wasn’t meant to 
                        be... so I quit. 
           For confirmation, Mary looks over at Ivana, who nods. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh.  

           Mary eyes him, surprised. She starts unpacking her groceries. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You okay? 

                                 DONALD
                        I’ll come around. But right now I 
                        gotta talk to Freddy.

                                 MARY
                        He’s gone. Took off for Florida 
                        yesterday. With that... 
                         (a bad taste here)
                        Stewardess. 

                                 DONALD
                        Did he say when he’s coming back?  

                                 MARY
                        He’s not coming back. Says he’s 
                        going to flight school down there 
                        but I’ll believe that when I see 
                        it. He also said they’re getting 
                        married, but who knows.  

                                 DONALD
                        He never told me.

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, well, you’ve been busy. 

           Donald’s eyes widen as he processes this news while looking 
           at Ivana. 

                                 DONALD
                        What’s he thinking? Married!? Guy 
                        can’t even hold down a job. 

                                 MARY
                        Psshh! I hope he does. I love a 
                        good wedding. You outta think about 
                        settling down yourself.

           Ivana perks up. Mary grins. They all share a look, a smile. 
           The gloom is lifting as Donald’s wheels start turning.

                                 DONALD
                        You know, that’s not a bad idea. 
                         (thinks)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        They get to know me. Get to know 
                        what I’m capable of. And who says 
                        ‘no’ to a guy on his wedding day?

                                 MARY
                        Hunh? 

           Donald kisses Mary and bee-lines out the door with Ivana. 

                                 DONALD
                        I gotta go! Tell Dad I’ll call him! 

           INT. WAR ROOM - DAY

           Janice gathers personal items from this tiny space they built 
           together, stuffing her things into a box as fast as she can.  

                                 DONALD
                        It’s all happening very quickly. 

                                 JANICE
                        I’ll bet. Does she even have a 
                        name? 

                                 DONALD
                        Of course she has a name, but more 
                        importantly, can you make it? Can 
                        The Governor make it? 

           Janice rolls her eyes, digging through a filing cabinet. 

                                 JANICE
                        I can’t deal with you right now. 

                                 DONALD
                        I screwed up, Janice. I know that. 
                        But I can put it all back together. 
                         (then)
                        I promise. I’ll do anything. 

                                 JANICE
                        That’s what I’m afraid of! 

           Donald turns on the charm with a signature Trump smile. 

                                 DONALD
                        I love her. She’s totally for real 
                        and everything’s on the up-and-up. 
                        Please. This is it. 

           Janice stops packing for a brief moment.
                                 JANICE
                        You got a picture?  

           Donald produces a picture of Ivana for Janice to analyze. 

                                 DONALD
                        She’s Czech. She’s on their Olympic 
                        ski team. And you’re going to love 
                        her as much as I do. 

                                 JANICE
                        Why haven’t you told me about her?

                                 DONALD 
                        I don’t know. She was with someone 
                        else when I met her. Some guy up in 
                        Montreal but that’s over now. 

                                 JANICE
                         (softening)
                        She’s beautiful. 

           She hands the picture back to Donald, still unsure. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        I guess I’m happy for you. 

                                 DONALD
                        So you’ll be there? With Carey? 

           Janice eyes him, still a tad suspicious.

                                 JANICE
                        Only if you tell me her name. 

                                 REVEREND PEALE (PRE-LAP)
                        Ivana... 

           INT. NEW YORK CITY - MARBLE COLLEGIATE CHURCH - DAY

           At a packed Manhattan wedding inside this historic landmark, 
           a REVEREND presides; he is NORMAN VINCENT PEALE.

                                 REVEREND PEALE
                        I urge you and Donald, as a married 
                        couple, to pray big prayers 
                        together...

           In his 50’s, wearing vestments and glasses; this renowned 
           author of The Power of Positive Thinking is the world’s 
           foremost God salesman, conducting the wedding of:

           DONALD TRUMP & IVANA MARIE ZELNICKOVA 
                                 REVEREND PEALE (CONT’D)
                        For God will rate you according to 
                        the size of our prayers.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           At his reception, tuxedo-clad Donald directs several big-
           busted serving BABES to wait on Table #15: The U.D.C. TABLE. 
           Donald has pulled out all the stops! 

                                 DONALD
                        Gentlemen, welcome!

           The U.D.C. Board Members - except Richard Ravitch - wine and 
           dine in the land of Sodom & Gomorrah!  

           There are loose Women... Booze & Drugs... And loads of Big 
           Cash flying around as Donald back slaps and glad-hands out 
           thick envelope after thick envelope. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                         (joking with the girls)
                        Now if any of these men give you 
                        ladies a hard time, you call me.

           From across the room, two tux-clad GENTS approach: NEW YORK 
           GOVERNOR HUGH CAREY - NEW YORK CITY MAYOR ABE BEAME. The 
           U.D.C. Board Members stand to greet the political elite! 

           Board Member Malcolm Jackson hugs Donald as he heads up a 
           flight of hotel stairs hand-in-hand with a super-hot BABE. 

                                 MALCOLM JACKSON
                        Congrats, Donald. You got my vote. 

           Donald hugs John Manes, and hands him a thick envelope. 

                                 JOHN MANES
                        This guy! Giving gifts at his own 
                        wedding.  
                         (sotto voce)
                        We’re gonna make it happen for you 
                        with Richard. I promise. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m going to hold you to that. 

           NEW ANGLE

           Across the room, a shocked Janice stares in horror at this 
           crazed debauchery; she watches Donald work the room over. 
           EXT. URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION - CORNER OFFICE - DAY

           A telephone console lights up, every line blinking, all of 
           them relentlessly RINGING off the hook. A deafening racket.  

                                 MEGAN (O.S.)
                        Mayor Beame on one! Manes on two. 

           Richard Ravitch sits across his desk from George Peacock.  

                                 RAVITCH
                        I’ll call them back! 

                                 MEGAN (O.S.)
                        And Hugh Carey on three! Again. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        Get rid of ‘em all! 

           Ravitch jumps to his door, KICKS it shut! Finally it’s quiet.  

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        So... our friend John Barron.

           George nods. They don’t even have to speak the name: TRUMP.

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        What are our options? 

           Ravtich chews his pen. 

                                 GEORGE
                        We can refuse to bid The Commodore 
                        and close our doors in about 18 
                        months. Or we can take it... 

           Ravitch now loudly taps the pen. On edge. He can’t sit still. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        And you’ll then be obligated to 
                        vote ‘yes’ on his tax abatement. 
                         (then)
                        You’re the only one he still needs. 
                        Those are our only two choices.  

                                 RAVITCH
                        No. 

           Ravitch blanches, sweating, but unwilling to give in. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        No way. So long as that hotel stays 
                        open, we could refuse to bid and 
                        hope that it recovers. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        And if The City starts to rebound 
                        too - and we really tightened our 
                        belts - we could weather this 
                        storm, George. 

           George frowns, it’s insane. But Ravitch YANKS up his phone! 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        Get on it! That genie’s not coming 
                        out of the bottle on my watch.  

           Ravitch STABS his intercom BUTTON hard! 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        Megan, I need the mayor back now! 

           INT. THE NEW YORK TIMES - OFFICE - DAY

           Typing at his typewriter, Michael DePhillips listens to a 
           tape recorder replaying his TRUMP TAPES- 

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        A bribe!? Is that what you’re 
                        talking about?

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        If that’s what it takes.

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Get over yourself.  

           MICHAEL secretly recorded his last conversation with TRUMP!  

           SUDDENLY HIS DOOR OPENS...

           And in walks his editor, JIM KELLEHER (late-40’s) Patrician- 
           look. Following behind Jim... ROY COHN 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Jim. What’s going on? 

                                 JIM
                        We’re here to talk to you about the 
                        Trump piece. 

           Jim pauses, unsure what to say, knows he’s on shaky ground. 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        We’re killing it. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What? 
                                 JIM
                        At first, we thought you were the 
                        perfect fit for this assignment, 
                        but we’re changing directions.

                        go work for The Voice.

           Michael, flushed, jumps up, surprising both Roy and Jim. 

                                 MICHAEL
                         (to Jim)
                        You’re a fucking newsman, Jim! Does 
                        the name Joe McCarthy ring a bell?! 

           Michael KICKS his chair across the room! 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You of all people should know what 
                        men like this are capable of! 
                         (sneers at Roy)
                        They’re out to destroy this city! 
                        This entire fucking country. 

           Michael collars Jim against the wall as Roy cowers in fear. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I watched my entire community burn 
                        to the ground! Everything I’ve 
                        worked to rebuild! BURNED! So guys 
                        like Roy and Donald can sweep in 
                        and make a fast buck off of it! 

                                 JIM
                         (resigned)
                        They make a killing whether our 
                        stories on them are good or bad.

                                 MICHAEL
                        BULLSHIT! 

                                 JIM
                        Mike, you keep this up, you’re in 
                        big trouble... 

                                 MICHAEL
                        NO! That’s where you’re wrong Jim. 
                        ‘Cause I haven’t even started! 
           Michael grabs his Trump Tapes and stomps out of the door! 

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - STREET - DAWN

           A light snow falls. Ravitch steps out of a town car to see a 
           horde of Reporters and Photographers lying in wait for him.  

                                 RAVITCH
                         (totally flustered)
                        What is this? 

           CAMERAS BULBS explode, strobe-lighting his face!    

           FLASH, POP!      FLASH, POP!       FLASH, POP! 

                     REPORTER #1
           What’s going on at Manhattan 
           Plaza, Richard?! 
                                           REPORTER #2 (CONT’D)
                                        Don’t New Yorker deserve 
                                        better?! 

           Ravitch shields his eyes - FLASH, POP! - at this onslaught. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Which way will you be voting on The 
                        Commodore?! 

           Ravitch covers his head and dashes through this press mob 
           like a suspected child molester. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        No comment. Please, excuse me! 

           He finally makes it to his doorstep, regains his composure. 

                                 RAVITCH (CONT’D)
                        As far as The Commodore is 
                        concerned, we’re struggling, but  
                        hopefully a compromise solution can 
                        be negotiated... 

                                 REPORTER #1 
                        Richard! 

                                 RAVITCH
                        However, it’s more than likely the 
                        tax abatement will not be approved. 

           More Reporters converge on Ravitch from every direction.

           NEW ANGLE

           Across the street - Donald’s limo idles at the corner. A FAKE 
           REPORTER #1 (20’s) leans against the car looking to Trump. 
                                 DONALD
                        Does he honestly think you’re all 
                        real reporters!? 

           This Fake Reporter nods as Donald observes the interrogation.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        He couldn’t attract this much press 
                        if he killed his whole family!

           This entire press ambush of Ravitch is a ruse by Donald! 

           Several more Men and Women carrying cameras and note-pads 
           shuffle over for their marching orders. 

                                 FAKE REPORTER #1
                        He’s still a ‘no’ on The Commodore. 

           Donald responds by furiously shucking out a few hundred 
           dollars. 

                                 DONALD
                        Then get back over there. Go! Keep 
                        that motherfucker out in the cold. 

           Donald’s window rolls up. 

           INT. LIMO - MOMENTS LATER

           From the other side of the limo, Roy climbs in, carrying a 
           newspaper and a fresh cup of coffee. 

                                 ROY
                        How we doing out there? 

                                 DONALD
                        Horrendous. 

           Roy sighs heavily as he hands his newspaper to Donald.  

                                 ROY
                        Well, speaking of reporters. 

           It’s the latest edition of The Village Voice and in bold, 
           black lettering, its front page trumpets: 

           TRUMP POISED TO STEAL HUGE TAX ABATEMENT FROM CITY!

           The by-line - Written By Michael DePhillips. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        But don’t worry about it. Nobody 
                        reads The Voice. 
           In response, DONALD STOMPS his wet bar! 

                                 DONALD
                        MOTHER... FUCKER...!

                                 ROY
                        Donald! 

           GLASS TUMBLERS EXPLODE! Shifting onto his back, Donald SLAMS 
           his HEEL into the window of his limo! BAM!!! BAM!!! BAM!!! 

                                 DONALD
                        I’ll kill him. Fucking kill him!!

           Roy covers his head as shards of glass whizz through the air! 
           Donald monsters a toe into his TV set -- sparks fly -- BOOM! 
           Roy finally pokes his head out of a turtled position. 

                                 ROY
                        Are you done? Please. Come on. 

           Donald hyperventilates with anger.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Can we finally win this thing? 
                        Hunh? Bring in a little muscle? 

                                 DONALD
                         (a bit manic here)
                        Muscle?! Trump was born with all 
                        the muscle he needs! That I can 
                        promise you! That I can really, 
                        really promise you!

           Donald’s bat-shit crazy at this point. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You think I need you and your 
                        guinea pals!? 

           Roy trembles, freaks; he’s terrified! 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        It’s time I finally get rid of this 
                        Ravitch piece of shit myself, no 
                        thanks to you. AND I’LL DO IT MY 
                        WAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

           Donald dials a large, heavy, 1970’s limo phone. RINGING. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Victor Palmieri, please. It’s 
                        Donald. 
                         (waits, then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Victor, clear out the clubhouse. 
                         (pause)
                        RIGHT NOW! 
                         (demonic beat)
                        I don’t care if it costs the U.S. 
                        Mint! You hear me?! At midnight on 
                        the 4th, commence with Operation 
                        Ironsides! 

           Donald CRUSHES the phone down, breathing heavily! 

           EXT. COMMODORE HOTEL - 42ND STREET - NIGHT

           Midnight. April 4th. A massive U-Haul truck and three 
           chartered buses pull up in front of The Commodore Hotel. No 
           lights are on -- no STAFF walks in or out. It’s dead. 

           Donald steps out of the truck with VICTOR PALMIERI who 
           carries several lengths of iron chain.  

                                 DONALD
                         (to Victor)
                        Lock it the fuck up. 

           Victor uses the chain to secure the doors of the hotel. Then, 
           DER SCUTT steps off one of the buses behind Donald. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                         (to Scutt, pointing)
                        Start with those storefront 
                        businesses, Der. 

           Behind Scutt, three bus loads of New York City’s worst 
           VAGRANTS, PIMPS, JUNKIES and TRANSVESTITES pour out.

           Donald takes out a MEGA-PHONE - climbs the lift-gate of the U-
           Haul: he’s bigger, more menacing and warped than ever. 

           The Prom King of the Apocalypse. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Okay people! Spread yourselves out! 

           Scutt unloads a box of spray paint and sheets of plywood. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You two! Move over there!
                        No, closer to the corner! 

           As Donald positions his bussed-in, homeless BOTTOM-DWELLERS, 
           Scutt derelicts The Commodore with spray paint. 
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Move it! 

           Two Hispanic Cleaning People arrive for their graveyard 
           shift; they stop at the Commodore’s locked-up front door. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Coming to work? Esta tratando do 
                        entrar...? No hables Englaze? 

           The Cleaning People nod. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        The hotel’s closed. You’re out of a 
                        job. Are you here legally?  

           Behind Donald, Scutt directs a team of Production Designers 
           to board up the windows and slather graffiti everywhere. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN, NY - 42ND STREET & LEXINGTON AVE - MORNING 

           A full-blown, Donald-orchestrated MAELSTROM engulfs The 
           Commodore Hotel! 

           Striking HOTEL WORKERS picket, carrying signs and chanting 
           for better wages -- PIMPS and PROSTITUTES loiter the streets. 

           Some Homeless have set up a big camp as a HEAD STRIKER (60) 
           grey-hair, bot-belly, megaphones the HYSTERIA to a climax. 

                                 HEAD STRIKER 
                        WHAT DO WE WANT! 

                                 ALL STRIKERS
                        MORE PAY! LESS HOURS!

           The Commodore storefront businesses are covered up by 
           plywood, spray paint and black scorch marks. 

                                 HEAD STRIKER
                        WHEN DO WE WANT IT! 

           Reporters and Cameramen scramble around, covering the scoop. 

                                 ALL STRIKERS
                        RIGHT NOW!

           To top it off, a cavalcade of YUPPIE PROFESSIONALS hustle out 
           of Grand Central; their influx CRUSHES into this CIRCUS! The 
           fighting, SHOUTING and RANCOR escalates OUT OF CONTROL! 

           NEW ANGLE
           Across the street from the mayhem, a BLACK TOWN car pulls up. 
           Its window rolls down and there he is: RICHARD RAVITCH. 

           He opens his door and steps out. His face is pale with 
           terror, realizing that he’s hopelessly overmatched. 

           Beside Ravitch, two BEAT COPS sip coffee and laugh at this 
           giant cluster-fuck instead of trying to police it.  

                                 RAVITCH
                        Are you two going to do anything 
                        about this? 

                                 BEAT COP #2
                        Who the fuck are you? 

           Routed, Ravitch pauses, and then slumps back into his car.

                                                       CUT TO:

           A soaring aerial image of MANHATTAN’s imperial skyline: a 
           jagged fortress of concrete, glass and steel as WE HEAR: 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        And what say you? 

                                 MALE VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        Aye! 

           Dissolve from the monoliths of Manhattan to DONALD’S EYES. 
           Intense. Squinting. Transfixed on the words being spoken...

           INT. MANHATTAN, NY - CITY HALL - HEARING ROOM - DAY

           Donald sits in the front row of a suffocatingly official 
           hearing room watching Ravitch squirm.  

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Let the record show that U.D.C. 
                        Board Member John Manes has voted 
                        ‘Aye’ for The Commodore Tax 
                        Abatement. And now, Chairman 
                        Richard Ravitch, what say you?

           After an eternity of sweating, Ravitch leans forward to a 
           microphone but he can’t speak, he’s so distraught. 

           It’s a tense, tense moment as Ravitch looks out uncomfortably 
           at the assembled Bureaucrats, Press and other notables:

           ROY COHN... JANICE BRIGHTLY... DER SCUTT... FRED TRUMP SR...
           Everyone in the room holds their collective breath as Ravitch 
           finally leans forward again, towards his microphone. 

                                 RAVITCH
                        Aye.

                                 DONALD
                        Yes!

           A ROAR goes up amongst the gallery as Donald hugs his father 
           up off the ground!

           SOUND F/X: A GAVEL POUNDS DOWN

                                                       CUT TO:

           A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS! THE WHITE LIQUID BUBBLES FORTH! 

           INT. LE BERNARDIN - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           JAY PRITZKER, stogie in mouth, pours out two glasses. He 
           offers one to Donald as they gaze at this restaurant’s 
           stunning views of Central Park, and raises his.   

                                 JAY
                        To fathers. May we always walk 
                        through the doors they open. 
                         (beat)
                        And to The New Grand Hyatt Hotel

           Donald smiles, nods and raises his glass, CHIK! But he 
           declines to actually drink. Jay looks at him surprised. 

                                 DONALD
                        I don’t drink. 

                                 JAY
                        Ever? 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s not my thing.  

                                 JAY
                        Well, congratulations are still in 
                        order. 
           Donald nods.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Quite a view, hunh? 

           Donald doesn’t answer, allowing an awkwardness to build. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I still don’t know how you pulled 
                        it off.

                                 DONALD
                        With the hotel shut down, the press 
                        crucified everyone and they all 
                        caved. Carey finally agreed to bail-
                        out Manhattan Plaza. Combine that 
                        with H.R.H. winning The Commodore 
                        construction package and Richard 
                        had no choice. I forced his hand.   

           Jay WHISTLES at Donald’s brilliant endgame. He sips, savors 
           the taste but a real tension continues to build. Donald turns 
           towards Jay. Pauses. Clears his throat.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        We may be going with Westin. 

           This news is a gut punch to Jay, but he doesn’t let it show. 

                                 JAY
                        I suppose I should have suspected 
                        it.  

                                 DONALD
                        They’ve made us a late offer that’s 
                        just too sweet to pass up. 

                                 JAY
                        After all that. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m a business man, Jay. I go with 
                        my gut. 

                                 JAY
                        And you know this isn’t how I do 
                        business. 

                                 DONALD
                        This time I’m afraid it is. 

                                 JAY
                        You got a lotta stones, kid. 
                         (sighs)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        So what’s it gonna take to keep our 
                        deal alive? 

           Donald hands Jay a three-page contract from his pocket. 

                                 DONALD
                        Just your signature. It’s a simple 
                        covenant ensuring that Hyatt never 
                        opens another hotel in the entire 
                        New York area. 

           Jay scans the paperwork, disgusted. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t think I’d come all this 
                        way to compete with my own partner, 
                        my own brand. And with this piece 
                        of paper, I won’t. 

           Jay signs the document and then hands it back to Donald.

                                 JAY
                         (through gritted teeth)
                        Not a problem. Unlike you, $50 
                        million isn’t a lot of money to me. 
                        So I’m signing it. Know why?

           Jay doesn’t wait for a reply; he just downs his champagne. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause this deal gives me that one 
                        thing that’ll keep you up at night.

           Off Donald’s look. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        My name on your building. 

           Jay stalks off as Donald dumps his glass into an ice bucket. 

           INT. CORPORATE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           250 pounds of closing PAPERWORK SLAM onto a table! 

           Inside this massive, antiseptic space - in operatic slow 
           motion - a battalion of...

           LAWYERS, MORTGAGE BROKERS, CITY OFFICIALS, HYATT HOTEL 
           EXECUTIVES, CONSULTANTS, BANKERS, BOARD MEMBERS of the 
           U.D.C., PARALEGALS, ASSISTANTS, INTERNS and one DEPUTY MAYOR, 
           all male (20’s to 60’s) argue, cajole, schmooze and wrangle 
           over this paperwork.  
           A big, municipal real estate closing that feels like D-Day: a 
           marathon of contracts, gesticulating limbs and stale coffee: 
           Janice hustles to push it all over the finish-line.  

                                 JANICE
                        Let’s move it people! 

           Overseeing this mayhem with Janice is JERRY SCHRAGER (late 
           20’s) a rising lawyer in New York’s real estate firmament.   

           And just as this craziness peaks, in strolls Cohn.  

           Roy stares hard at the other Lawyers in the room. Janice sees 
           him, sees the pained look on his face, and then quickly 
           rushes after him as he stalks out of the room. 

           INT. BREAK ROOM - LATER

           Under the incessant hum of several vending machines, Roy 
           enters and turns to Janice as she follows him in.

                                 ROY
                        Where the fuck is he? 

           INT. LINCOLN CENTER - OPERA HOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

           It’s intermission. A dashing, tuxedo-clad Donald schmoozes 
           with some of the other young Masters Of The Universe: 

           RONALD PERELMAN...  CARL ICAHN...  HENRY KRAVIS... 

           He’s at the center of this vortex, marking his arrival. This 
           is his apotheosis. 

           In the midst of this apex of wealth and power, Donald’s Limo 
           Driver enters and whispers in his ear. 

           Donald smiles; he loves being called back to his beloved 
           deals while these other men return to the opera. 

                                 DONALD
                        Will you gentlemen please excuse 
                        me? 

           INT. CORPORATE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s late. Still tux-clad, Donald and Roy look tiny seated in 
           the big, cleared out space. The tall, thick stacks of closing 
           contracts are neatly organized, with pens; ready for signing. 

           What was once chaotic is now calm and quiet. 
                                 ROY
                        Jerry Schrager?

                                 DONALD
                        I needed a closer on this one. 

           Donald looks away, out the window as Roy sinks lower. 

                                 ROY
                        So I’m out. Just like that. 

           Silence. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t do this!

                                 DONALD
                        If you need money, it’s a different 
                        conversation. 

                                 ROY
                        I need the money because it’s what 
                        we agreed to. Because I earned it! 

                                 DONALD
                        We had nothing in writing. 

                                 ROY
                        You’re a dirty motherfucker. A 
                        dirty, dirty motherfucker. 

           Roy rubs his hands in his face. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        What about all your other precious 
                        deals, hunh?! All your future 
                        buildings? I made this happen for 
                        you. Me! Without me... 

                                 DONALD
                        Without you, those buildings are 
                        happening even faster. Trump Tower, 
                        Trump-Parc, Trump Plaza in Atlantic 
                        City. They’re all about to break 
                        ground as we speak. 

           Roy looks lost, pale, utterly annihilated. 

                                 ROY
                        I can’t believe this. I took you 
                        under my wing. Treated you like a 
                        son. Donald, please... 

           Donald gives him nothing. Flummoxed, Roy tries another tack.
                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Just a loan. A percentage of the 
                        closing costs. Anything.
                         (then)
                        We shook hands on this thing. And 
                        we just bilked the government for 
                        millions! I’m in trouble here!  

           Roy breaks down, looking up at Donald’s towering 6’2” frame. 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        I’m begging you. 

           Roy slowly bends a knee towards the floor. 

                                 DONALD
                        Stop, Roy. Stand up, for God’s 
                        sake.   

           But Roy is bewildered with pain and fear. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Get up! Get off that floor right 
                        now you cock-sucking piece of shit! 

           Roy can’t move, his knees seemingly locked to the carpet. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You’re a fucking liability!

           At the door, Janice pokes her head in, observes the skirmish. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I needed lawyer! A real animal. And 
                        I got stuck with an aging faggot.   

                                 JANICE
                        What the hell is going on! 

           Donald sees Janice, halts his rancor, shifts modes.

                                 DONALD
                        It’s nothing. We’re fine. 

           Janice rushes over to Roy. 

                                 JANICE
                        You are not fine! 

           She runs to the door and summons two INTERNS to help Roy to 
           his feet as Donald points to his watch.

                                 DONALD
                        I need this room working, Jan...
           Janice SHOVES Donald towards a small room in back! 

                                 JANICE
                        MOVE IT!

           Janice herds Donald to a back room as Roy is escorted out. 

           INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Donald paces as Janice blocks the only door leading out to 
           the conference room. 

                                 JANICE
                        How do we put an end to this shit?  

                                 DONALD
                        I don’t have time, Janice. 

           Donald gets eye-to-eye with her; ready to push her aside. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        If the deal’s not signed tonight, 
                        it doesn’t happen. It has to close 
                        now! When Koch rolls into off...

                                 JANICE
                         (interrupting)
                        None of that matters if you can’t 
                        tell me why? 

                                 DONALD
                        Why what? Where are you going here? 
                        Back to Albany? Out of real estate? 
                        Is that what you really want?  

                                 JANICE
                        I told you what I want: that guy 
                        who’s planning to save this city 
                        with only one thing... Emotion.    

           Donald points his finger out to the world at large. 

                                 DONALD
                        I beat them all, Janice. That was 
                        the whole point! To stuff all 
                        that... failure in their faces!  

                                 JANICE
                        Was it? ‘Cause we all believed we 
                        were building something. Something 
                        big. Something important.  
           She quickly slips through the door behind her -- returns with 
           a stack of closing contracts, gesturing to them.  

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        We earned this. All of us working 
                        together. It means everything to 
                        me, Roy, you... your family.  This 
                        deal represents millions of 
                        dollars, a new start... a new team. 

           Janice’s eyes begin to shine with emotion. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        But if you can’t do things the 
                        right way. The way we started. It’s 
                        meaningless. It’s nothing but hot 
                        air and greed and hurting people. 

           Donald gestures to the contracts. 

                                 DONALD
                        ‘Cause that’s what it takes! You 
                        saw what it takes to win. 

                                 JANICE
                        Winning has nothing to do with it. 
                        It was about rebuilding a City. 

                                 DONALD
                        We’re close, Janice. 
                         (finger and thumb)
                        We’re this close. 

                                 JANICE
                        To doing it the wrong way for all 
                        the wrong reasons.

           Donald shakes his head, and then carefully takes the 
           paperwork from her hands- 

                                 DONALD
                        You know nothing about winning... 

           As Donald carries those contracts back to the conference 
           room, she chases after him.  

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Donald gingerly arranges the closing paperwork back on the 
           table as neatly as possible as Janice hovers in behind him.  
                                 JANICE
                        ...because that’s not how I choose 
                        to divvy up the world.   

                                 DONALD 
                        Well, there is no other way. ‘Cause 
                        it keeps everything else in life so 
                        beautifully fucking simple! 

           Donald turns to her. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You want me to be just like them?
                         (sneering)
                        Hugh Carey...? Richard Ravitch...? 
                        And build anything real!? Bullshit! 
                        You know that’s not how it works.   

           He’s almost pleading now. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        So long as their eyes are always on 
                        Trump - and not my deals - I can 
                        close anything I want! Anything!  

                                 JANICE
                        But that’s not building. My father 
                        was a builder. You? You’re too busy 
                        creating some kind of fucked up... 
                        persona! 

                                 DONALD 
                        And it’s working! 

                                 JANICE
                        It’s hollow, Donald! It’s a name. 
                        People will see right through it 
                        and then where are you? You’re 
                        done. 

           Donald clenches the papers in his hands. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        We believe in you...  In your 
                        vision. Your energy. We love you! 
                        But the reality is, you’re turning 
                        into this fraud! This act! And the 
                        only thing you’re really looking to 
                        build right now is yourself. 

           She rests her case, and looks to him expectantly, as a stack 
           of CONTRACTS SLAMS into the wall beside her! BOOOM!
                                 DONALD
                        THEN GO BACK YOU FUCKING CUNT!

           She covers her head as an explosion of white erupts beside 
           her! 

                                 JANICE
                        Stop! STOP! DONALD!! 

           Donald picks up another stack and HURLS it at the wall! 

                                 DONALD
                        GO BACK TO ALL THOSE FUCKING 
                        LOSERS! 

           IN SLOW MOTION

           She stares transfixed at these papers angrily dancing in the 
           air. All the effort... Time... And money to prepare... 

           She’s thunderstruck, lost, as he continues to RAGE!!!! 

           BACK TO REAL TIME-

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        DEPHILLPS... CAREY... RAVITCH... 

           Donald turns from her and fires two more stacks of contracts 
           at the conference room windows! Boom! Boom!  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I CRUSHED THEM ALL...! 

           With all the contracts obliterated, Donald sets about 
           absolutely TRASHING this room as Janice ducks out the door.  

           EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Janice steps out, closing the door behind her. She’s floored, 
           near tears as the CRASHING continues back in the conference 
           room. She closes her eyes and exhales, walking away.  

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        DO YOU HEAR ME!?

           With a final look back, she turns and heads into the 
           elevator; its DING! sounds her last goodbye to Trump. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
           Donald continues his rampage scattering pens, kicking the 
           chairs and overturning the gargantuan table, in a final act 
           of FURY!  

                                 DONALD
                        AND I’LL FUCKING DO IT AGAIN!!

           Sucking oxygen, red-faced, alone, Donald rips the black bow-
           tie of his tuxedo off his neck. Total destruction everywhere. 

           He sees his reflection in the window of the conference room, 
           and staggers towards it, puts his hand up against the glass; 
           his FACE super-imposed against the lights of New York city.  

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:

           DONALD’S FACE

           INT. LIMO - DAY

           He’s still looking troubled, only now he sits inside his limo 
           next to Ivana, both of them are dressed in beach clothing.

           Outside the window, we see an exit sign for CONEY ISLAND, as  
           the limo turns off towards it. 

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND N.Y. - STEEPLECHASE PIER - DAY

           Donald is stoic, gazing out over the ocean as Ivana eats an 
           ice cream cone, sitting by herself on a bench behind him. 

           He’s a million miles away, still brooding over the 
           confrontation with Janice when he should be celebrating. 

           EXT. SHORE HAVEN - BALCONY - DAY

           From high up, overlooking Coney Island, Donald seems better 
           now, standing over Ivana’s shoulder. 

           He’s back in his old stomping ground, pointing out the many 
           towers of the Brooklyn skyline that his father erected. 

           Ivana studies these austere monuments like a star pupil.   

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Donald and Ivana meander through this functional, slightly 
           impoverished space with its plaque, and those two tiny words 
           written ever so small:  
           TRUMP VILLAGE

           Donald stares at this plaque: his namesake, as Ivana adjusts 
           one of her very fancy sandals.

                                 IVANA
                        Oof. I can’t take another step. 

           Donald’s eyes refuse to budge from this plaque. 

                                 DONALD
                        Why don’t you head out to the car? 
                        I want to look around a little 
                        more. I’ll be right out. 

                                 IVANA
                        Of course, darling. 

           Ivana walks outside.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Donald ambles towards several apartment units being 
           refurbished and combined. Parked outside of them, he sees 
           wheeled hampers filled with construction debris- 

           Peeking in one doorway, he analyzes the ravaged space and, 
           seeing it mostly empty, steps inside. 

           INT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Donald walks into this gutted space, past the dangling wires, 
           stacks of drywall, ripped out asbestos and rusted pipes. 
           Mariachi MUSIC plays from a RADIO. 

           A LABORER, wearing a safety mask and hat, busily scrubs out 
           the filthy bathroom on his knees. 

           Donald looks around. He bends down to pick up a crooked nail; 
           it’s like the ones his father saved from his job sites. 
           Donald smiles at Fred Sr’s endless frugality and renovating.

           Then... that LABORER tosses a CIGARETTE BUTT over his 
           shoulder, onto the floor.  

           Donald observes this disgusting, still-smouldering fire 
           hazard with repugnance. 

                                 DONALD
                        Hey... Asshole.

           His inner clean freak coming alive. 
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Show a little respect.

           Donald stomps over to the poor Guy.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Do I come to your house and take a 
                        shit in your living room! My dad 
                        owns this fucking place. 

           And that’s when the Guy turns, lowers his mask, and Donald 
           sees him...

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Freddy? 

           A shadow of his former self, 40-pounds lighter; but in spite 
           of his ravaged body, Freddy still flashes the great smile. 

                                 FREDDY
                        Guess we got the same old man. 

           He’s as physically close to death as a living person can be. 

                                 DONALD
                        I... I didn’t...

           Freddy grins broadly at Donald’s beach clothes. His sun hat. 

                                 FREDDY
                        S’okay, I didn’t recognize you 
                        either. 

           As Freddy lights up another smoke, he unleashes an 
           oppressive, wracking cough. Donald is speechless.

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I haven’t called. I just got 
                        back a few days ago. Dad was nice 
                        enough to put me on clean-up.  

                                 DONALD
                        You should have talked to me. I 
                        could have gotten you anything.  

                                 FREDDY
                        Yeah, I didn’t want to bug you. 

           The emotion coursing through both of them is overwhelming. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Besides, I needed some quick cash. 
                        I really didn’t want to bug you.  
                                 DONALD
                        We’ll get you doing something else. 
                        Immediately. Anything you want. 
                        I’ll see to it personally. 

                                 FREDDY
                        Nah, it’s fine. We’re behind on 
                        this job as it is. Pop’s been 
                        keeping us all pretty busy. 

           They both look around at the ruins as a PORTUGUESE FOREMAN 
           WHISTLES from the hallway! 

                                 PORTUGUESE FOREMAN
                        Yo! Vamos move-le! 

                                 FREDDY
                         (to the Foreman)
                        Segundo. Segundo.
                         (then, to Donald)
                        So, it’s official. You got your big 
                        tax exemption. Breaking-ground in 
                        six months... I’m proud of you. 

                                 DONALD 
                         (ignoring)
                        Thanks, but... Come on. You’re not 
                        doing this anymore. No way.  

           Donald gently takes Freddy’s arm.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        We’ll go talk to dad together. I’ll 
                        speak to him about this myself.   

           But Freddy pulls away.

                                 FREDDY
                        S’okay. You’ve done enough. Really. 
                        And this is only temporary, Donny. 
                        I’m heading back down to Florida 
                        next month. Thinking about going 
                        into the commercial fishing 
                        business. 
                         (beat)
                        I’ll call before I take off. I 
                        promise. 

           A moment passes between them as Freddy pats Donald’s arm. 

                                 FREDDY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I gotta go, but you hit the 
                        big time, Donny. Now go get ‘em.  
           Freddy turns to go, and with one last smile and wave, his 
           wraith-like form disappears through the door. 

           INT. LIMO - DAY

           Donald climbs into the long expanse of his limo to see Ivana 
           watching its repaired TV. Donald is pale, in shock. His Limo 
           Driver looks back through the partition. 

                                 LIMO DRIVER
                        You okay, Mr. Trump? 

           Donald looks up but doesn’t see much of anything. 

                                 DONALD
                        Yeah. I-I’m fine.  

                                 LIMO DRIVER 
                        So where to next? 

           Donald contemplates his next move. Finally, he comes to a 
           decision and is about to announce it as we... 

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

           END CRAWL:

           The Grand Hyatt Hotel renovation was completed in 1980.
