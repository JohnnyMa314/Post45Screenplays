                     Camp David. December 1988. (One Year On The Run)

           INT. LAUREL LODGE - CAMP DAVID - DAY

           A giant Balsam Fir is being decorated under the supervision 
           of NANCY, no description necessary, except that she’s looking 
           furious behind a mask of serenity, as usual.

                                 NANCY 
                        I said angels. Where are the 
                        angels? 

                                 HOWARD (O.S.)
                        They have his location.

           The MAIDS dig frantically through boxes of ornaments.

                                 NANCY 
                        Ronnie is expecting the angels. 

           Micro-manager par excellence, Nancy digs through a box 
           herself as HOWARD BAKER, Reagan’s Chief of Staff, stands 
           opposite, awkwardly watching, unsure whether to continue.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m listening, Howie. Where?

                                 HOWARD
                        Switzerland. Zurich.

                                 NANCY 
                        Take him.

                                 HOWARD
                        There may be a show of it if we 
                        take him now. They think if we wait 
                        for him to move again-

                                 NANCY 
                        Make a show.

                                 HOWARD
                        We’re not technically in our 
                        jurisdiction. The DEA-

           Nancy turns her gaze on Dutch’s Chief of Staff, freezing him. 

                                 NANCY 
                        You know how we’re bringing down 
                        the Soviets?

                                 HOWARD
                        Ma’am?
           Nancy looks back into the box, continuing to unpack.

                                 NANCY
                        Oscar De La Renta. Raisa gets on 
                        that plane back to godforsaken 
                        Siberia, and she complains to 
                        Mikhail, we just can’t get coats 
                        like that in Russia. Mikhail is 
                        tired, he’s been up all night 
                        talking nuclear limits with Ronnie, 
                        but Raisa needs his ear, because 
                        she’s been embarrassed. Embarrassed 
                        by the show we put on. A show they 
                        couldn’t put on if their Red Lives 
                        depended on it. Van playing Moscow 
                        Nights! And oh their china! She had 
                        the People’s Tailors work weeks for 
                        an unbeatable coat in Fox, and it’s 
                        put to shame by Oscar’s Mink. 

           Nancy finally finds the SOLID GOLDEN ANGELS, unwrapping them.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Here. I told you this box. 

           The maids look down, frightened. Nancy hands them over for 
           hanging.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Show is everything. It’s how we’re 
                        winning Ronnie’s Cold War. And it’s 
                        how we’re going to win my War.

                                 HOWARD
                        Alright, Mrs. Reagan.

           Howard nods, turns to go. 

                                 NANCY
                        I want his head, Howie. 

           Howard pauses at the door.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        He’s been at large for a year. He 
                        calls himself a Legend in His Own 
                        Time for god’s sake. 

           Nancy eyes the angels on the tree, smiling down at her.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I want his head on a fucking plate.
           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - SUITE - DAY

           A gorgeous suite. Marble, antiques, and a carpet of cash. 
           Literally. Ben Franklin has taken a shit on this floor.

           DARNELL GARCIA, 38, tan, handsomely mustached, half-Jew half-
           Spaniard half-Puerto Rican, and maybe six or seven other 
           halves...is packing in a hurry.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Let me say, for the record, I never 
                        said I was a Legend in My Own Time.

           He’s not even bothering with the million on the floor, his 
           dextrous hands stuff GOLD BARS into a little duffel.

           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           A DEA SWAT TEAM moves down the opulent hallway.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Ed Parker said that about me. In 
                        Kung Fu magazine. 

           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Darnell adds a STACK OF PASSPORTS to the bag of gold. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I was absolutely honored that he 
                        would say that. Ed was the guy who 
                        introduced me to Elvis Presley. 

           Darnell freezes, he looks back at the door.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But Legend in My Own Time. I never 
                        said that.

           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The DEA take positions outside Suite 7F. The team smashes 
           down the door, are hit with a backdraft of fluttering cash.

           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           DEA Agents search frantically, cash everywhere, no Darnell. 
                                 TEAM LEADER
                             (radios)
                        He’s not here.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        What I said was that I was the 
                        smartest, most dangerous guy to 
                        ever work for the DEA.

           A BRICK OF CASH teeters and falls from the rim of the soaking 
           tub. An Agent turns to it, approaching. 

           And Darnell explodes up from the cash, disarming the Agent, 
           he hugs him tight, gun on his neck, awkwardly face to face.

                                 DEA AGENTS
                        Put it down! Down! We will shoot.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        They didn’t like that.

           An Agent runs in behind, Darnell sees it on his hostage’s 
           face, drops the agent with a HIGH KICK behind him.

                                 DARNELL
                             (winks to his hostage)
                        Prefer you as my rearview.

           Darnell backs to the door, starts backing down the hallway. 

           SHOCKED GUESTS look out from their rooms as they pass. 
           Darnell gets to the elevator, DEA following.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Lobby, please.

           His hostage realizes, reaches for the elevator call button. 
           It opens. Darnell backs in, takes his hostage with him. 

           The doors close, leaving SWAT staring at their reflections.

           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell turns his hostage away from him (to normal hostage 
           position), keeps him tight as his radio crackles.

                                 HOSTAGE’S RADIO (CRACKLING)
                        Lobby?/Elevator 2./He’s got Sully, 
                        on his way down.

           Darnell looks up, as the elevator goes down 3, 2...Darnell 
           drops “Sully” with a CHOP to the neck, hits EMERGENCY STOP.
           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Two more DEA AGENTS wait for the elevator, guns ready.

                                 DEA AGENT 1
                        It stopped. 
                             (radioing)
                        Second floor! Second floor!

                                 RADIO (CRACKLING BACK)
                        Seal the first and second 
                        floors./Stairwells./Get me-

           The elevator starts again.

                                 DEA AGENT 1
                             (radios)
                        Moving again. On its way down.

           The Lobby Agents get ready, weapons up. 1st floor, 
           Ground...DING. Doors open, revealing -- 

           An unconscious body in SWAT armor on the floor of the 
           elevator. The Agents storm in, spinning to the 
           corners...where a man lies slouched in his underwear. 

                                 DEA AGENT 1 (CONT’D)
                        ...Sully? 

           The unconscious body does a WINDMILL-LEG-SWEEP from the 
           floor, dropping them both in a blink, knocks them out.

           In full armor, Darnell springs up, and runs out through the 
           lobby with his duffle of gold as HOTEL STAFF watch, stunned.

           EXT. ZURICH HOTEL - STREET - CONTINUOUS

           SIRENS scream. Darnell spots a TOURIST starting a VESPA. 

           He grabs the guy as he gasses it, pulling himself on as he 
           throws the tourist off in one fluid do-si-do. 

           Darnell speeds away, turns a corner just as the DEA hit the 
           street. INTERPOL CARS rush past, on Darnell’s heels. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Running makes you look guilty, I 
                        know. Of course I know that. 

           Darnell speeds up, looks back, and we PUSH in on the 
           harbingers of his end...the golden headlights in his eyes...

                                                              MATCH TO:
           A GOLDEN HEAD, atop a GOLDEN TINY MAN doing a high kick - A 
           KARATE TROPHY.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But I was a world karate champion. 

           A FOOT KICKS THE SCREEN IN TWO, rotating image panels like 
           revolving doors, revealing Darnell doing sport karate SCREEN 
           RIGHT on a blue mat. Movie karate on the street SCREEN LEFT. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        A movie star. 

           Darnell pulls a GUN in movie karate, and SHOOTS HIS IMAGE 
           PANEL, which SPLITS AGAIN. Movie karate Darnell fights on, as 
           another new Darnell boards a jet BOTTOM RIGHT.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Self-made millionaire in the 
                        precious metal import game.

           The JET TAKES OFF, SPLITS PANEL LEFT. FOUR QUADRANTS NOW. A 
           MEDAL OF FREEDOM being hung over Darnell’s neck BOTTOM LEFT.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        A DEA golden boy. 

           Nancy Reagan steps back, shakes his hand warmly. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        The dream life gets people dreaming 
                        up ways you’re not legit. It’s too 
                        much. You can’t do all that. Not on 
                        the level. In my case, they’d 
                        decided I was guilty before the 
                        crime even happened. Am I guilty?
                             (beat)
                        I’ve always been guilty. 

                                                                 BLACK.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Of being me.

                          THE KING OF LA

           Grandmaster Flash’s WHITE LINES takes us a year back to...
                        Rio. December 1987. (Seven Days On The Run)

           EXT. HIGH FAVELAS - ALLEYWAYS - RIO - DAY

           Darnell, in stone washed jeans and boxy blazer, moves up the 
           zig-zag alleyways under a Brazilian sun.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But Switzerland was the end, let me 
                        start at the beginning. I left LA 
                        at the end of ‘87. 180 million 
                        dollars in coke had gone missing in 
                        what they called “The Big Rip,” and 
                        I was the guy they put behind it. 

           Darnell spots a GUARD - tank top, jerry curl, and AK.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Yes. I ran. I had no choice. They 
                        wanted me dead. 

           He doubles back, starts climbing a crumbling plaster facade.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        So I headed to Brazil. For some 
                        cash stored with old colleagues.

           EXT. FAVELA ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Darnell pulls himself up onto a roof where TWO CHILDREN are 
           playing, they pause to look at him, he smiles.

                                 DARNELL
                        Bem. Bem. Tudo bem. 

           The kids play on as Darnell creeps to the edge, and looks 
           down at the Guard, he spots another GUARD on the other side.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           EXT. BETWEEN BUILDINGS - FAVELA - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell stems between the cinder-block walls, making his way 
           down to a rumbling window fan.

           INT. DEA SAFE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           An empty room - crumbling walls, a desk, and SAFE. 
           The WINDOW FAN falls into the room, and is caught by the cord 
           before it drops and can make a sound.

           Darnell gingerly lowers the spinning unit by its tail, then 
           drops silently beside it. 

           He looks around, hears VOICES in other rooms. 

           He goes to the desk, and finds THREE PASSPORTS in the drawer, 
           he puts them in his jacket. Then moves to the safe, puts in 
           the combination, and opens the door.

           Darnell grabs a gym bag, checks it -- FULL OF CASH.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Darnell.

           Darnell freezes, and turns to face JOÃO SOSA, a captain of 
           Rio’s Vermelho Cartel, a burning cigar in his teeth, flanked 
           by the two guards with AK’s.  

                                 DARNELL
                        João.

                                 JOÃO SOSA
                        How you doing, bacalhau?

                                 DARNELL
                        I gotta go away for awhile.

                                 JOÃO SOSA
                        I hear forever.

                                 DARNELL
                        Maybe.

                                 JOÃO SOSA
                        Not with my fucking dinheiro.

                                 DARNELL
                        Your?

                                 JOÃO SOSA
                        Til you move the rest of what you 
                        promised. Now that’s no-no, so-

           The Guards start to move in cautiously to take him. 

                                 GUARD 1
                        Mãos ao alto.

           Darnell raises his hands, João exhales a billow of cigar 
           spoke passing across the frame. The entire image FREEZES. 
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        A lot of folks wanted to do me harm 
                        at this time. Once the DEA burns 
                        you, the guys you’ve been working 
                        with undercover, you’re burnt with 
                        them too. I didn’t just have the 
                        government trying to kill me. I had 
                        a whole career of guys after me. 

           REVEAL: Darnell’s eyes aren’t frozen, sizing up the situation-

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But the money, the violence, all 
                        the things I’ve been associated 
                        with, it’s hard to understand 
                        looking back. Even for me. 

           REVERSE MOTION: The cigar smoke disappears back into João’s 
           mouth. Darnell lowers his hands back to his sides.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        A story looks different backwards 
                        than forwards. 

           João and the Guards walk backwards out of the room. Darnell’s 
           stoic frown melts back to a KNOWING SMILE as he turns back 
           from being caught, putting the cash back where it belongs.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        You gotta see it forwards.

           “WON’T GET FOOLED AGAIN” by The Who takes us back...

                                Los Angeles.  October 1971.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It starts with karate. Karate 
                        really got everything going for me. 

           INT. MCDONNELL DOUGLAS - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

           In a warehouse of shining half-built airplanes we find 
           Darnell, younger, before the mustache, in a mechanic’s onesy, 
           sanding a length of steel, a stream of sparks flying.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Martial arts were huge back then. 
                        Elvis, Steve McQueen...

           RANDOM CLIPS OF: Elvis in a red belt and sunglasses, kicking 
           a heavy bag. Steve McQueen doing punches in the mirror.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        ...everyone was doing them. 

           Darnell looks up to the BOSS in a karate stance opposite a 
           YOUNG MECHANIC, all their CO-WORKERS watching.

                                 THE BOSS
                        Hit me. Come on.

           The Mechanic hesitates, nervous.

                                 THE BOSS (CONT’D)
                        You want me to hit you?

                                 DARNELL (O.S.)
                        He doesn’t want to hit you, man.

           The Boss turns to Darnell approaching from behind.

                                 THE BOSS
                        You want to hit me? 

                                 DARNELL
                        I don’t want to hit you.

                                 THE BOSS
                        I’m the boss, I’m telling you.

           The co-workers grin. Darnell shakes his head, punches slow.

                                 THE BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Faster.

           Darnell punches a bit faster. His Boss spins out of the way, 
           grabs the arm, slams him to the ground, co-workers LAUGH. 
           Humiliated, Darnell climbs to his feet, face smudged in oil. 

                                 THE BOSS (CONT’D)
                        No hard feelings, huh.

           The Boss extends a demeaning handshake. Darnell forced to 
           take it, not meeting his eyes.

           INT. USA KARATE CENTER - TORRANCE CALIFORNIA - DAY

           Darnell sits alone in the bleachers above center mat.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        The Karate championships we’re 
                        being held nearby. I decided to go.

           Darnell is deadly serious, watching.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Mannn, Chuck. First time I saw him.

           A HELMET OF RED HAIR (CHUCK NORRIS) spins, a foot flies up 
           beside it, almost like a bird. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I was mesmerized by his style, 
                        fearless, reckless...

           Chuck spins and kicks, spins, kicks... 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        The kicks. The beautiful kicks. His 
                        take your head off kicks.

           Spin-kick-connection! Chuck drops his OPPONENT. Darnell in 
           awe as the crowd around him erupts. 

           EXT. CENTER MAT - USA KARATE CENTER - LATER

           Darnell shoulders his way through the mob around Chuck with a 
           HEAD-SHOT of his new hero. Chuck, obscured by bodies in front 
           of Darnell, grabs the photo, signs it, hands it back.

           Darnell stares at Chuck Norris’s autograph.

           INT. DARNELL’S APARTMENT - SOUTH CENTRAL - NIGHT

           A grim studio, bars on the windows, hot plate on the dresser, 
           bed on the floor. Nothing on the walls. Piles of BOOKS.

           Darnell stands in the open doorway, taping up the picture of 
           Chuck, placing it over a left over CRUCIFIX above the door. 

           He steps inside, closes the door, and is greeted by his image 
           in the mirror attached to its back. He looks up at Chuck, 
           down at himself. Darnell takes a fighting stance.

           INT. CHUCK NORRIS STUDIOS TORRANCE - DAY

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I called in sick the next day, went 
                        to Chuck’s dojo. Just showed up. 

           Darnell spots that helmet of red hair, face hidden (always) 
           below a STUDENT as he demonstrates a grappling technique.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        You could do that then. This was 
                        way before Chuck was a star.
           INSERT IMAGE: Chuck in full denim, sleeveless denim shirt 
           unbuttoned but tucked in to his jeans, uzi in each hand.

           INT. CHUCK NORRIS STUDIOS TORRANCE - LATER

           Darnell punches in the mirror. The helmet of red hair comes 
           up behind him, and adjusts his fist, raising it.

                                 CHUCK
                        Feel that?

           Darnell breathes, focuses, punches again in the mirror.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Excellent.

           The helmet of red hair pats Darnell on the back, moves on.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It may sound silly to you, but here 
                        was this champion, telling me I was 
                        great.

           INT. DARNELL’S APARTMENT - SOUTH CENTRAL - LATER

           Darnell, shirtless, a GUNSHOT SCAR on his back. He strikes a 
           cinder block with his hand. His hand bleeding, the block not 
           breaking. He winces, striking harder, his hand bleeding more.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        For the first time I believed in 
                        myself. 

           He strikes again, blood splattering the unbroken concrete. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Karate taught me how to seek the 
                        quintessence in my person as Bruce 
                        would’ve put it. 

           FOOTAGE INSERT: Bruce Lee, face carved in ENTER THE DRAGON.

           INT. CHUCK NORRIS STUDIOS TORRANCE - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Darnell, nervous, wearing a brown belt, steps into the small 
           locker room, the sound of a SHOWER RUNNING.

                                 DARNELL
                        Sensei? You got a second?
                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        Uh. Yeah. What’s up?

           Darnell steps into the far side of the shower, Chuck facing 
           the water, just his soapy red hair and back to Darnell.

                                 DARNELL
                        Got the black belt exam coming up.

           Chuck lowers his head, letting the water flush the shampoo.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Bob tells me I’d be the fastest 
                        black belt ever here.

                                 CHUCK 
                        Maybe. I don’t know.

           Chuck rinsing his armpits. 

                                 DARNELL
                        I guess, I was just looking for- 

                                 CHUCK
                        Just do what you learned. 

                                 DARNELL
                        Course. But is there anything else?

           Chuck lets the shower enter his mouth, gargles, spits.

                                 CHUCK
                        Not really, kid. Pay your fees on 
                        time, you’ll be fine.

           Darnell stares at Chuck’s naked back, wishing for more.

           EXT. CHUCK NORRIS STUDIOS TORRANCE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Chuck and his guys get into their hot rods, and pull off.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Next thing I know, I’m in the inner 
                        circle. A Chuck Norris Black Belt.

           Darnell waits for the bus alone, wearing his new BLACK BELT.

           INT. LA CITY BUS - MOVING - WATTS

           Darnell rides home, still in his black belt.
           INT. DARNELL’S APARTMENT - SOUTH CENTRAL - NIGHT

           Darnell lies on his bed, still in his black belt, eyes 
           welling with pain as Chuck’s picture gazes down at him.

           INT. CHUCK NORRIS STUDIOS TORRANCE - DAY

           Darnell breaks four blocks. Doubles down, breaks 8 blocks.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        A black belt, like all 
                        achievements, is really only 
                        another beginning.

           Darnell sparring with a TRAINING PARTNER, puts him down. 
           Darnell doubles down - TWO TRAINING PARTNERS, drops them. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I rededicated myself.

           Darnell takes on FOUR GUYS. The Red Mop of Hair watching in 
           the bg. Darnell turns to him, and Chuck walks off.

           EXT. USA KARATE CENTER - TORRANCE CALIFORNIA - DAY

           Darnell, full mustache now, gets off a TEAM BUS at the back 
           of Chuck’s posse, all the FIGHTERS in their ‘70s finest.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Fast forward a year. I’m on Chuck’s 
                        team at the World Championships.

           INT. BEHIND THE BLEACHERS - USA KARATE CENTER - LATER

           Bob Wall throws up in a trash can, Chuck patting his back. 
           Darnell watches. Chuck continues to pat Wall on the back.

                                 CHUCK
                        Wall’s hungover.

           POV BOTTOM OF TRASH CAN: Wall’s eyes watering, sputtering.

                                 BOB WALL
                        It’s food poisoning.

                                 CHUCK
                        Shut up, Bob. You’re gonna have to 
                        fight for him, Darn.

                                 DARNELL
                        Who I fighting?
           INT. CENTER MAT - USA KARATE CENTER - LATER

           Darnell stares across the circle at his OPPONENT...

                                 ANNOUNCER (PA)
                        With a record of 48-0...the 
                        greatest karate fighter in the

           ...6 feet 2 inches of muscles and karate royalty...

                                 ANNOUNCER (PA) (CONT’D)
                        Joe Lewis!

           Darnell looks back at Chuck and his crew, back to Lewis. 

           Darnell takes his fighting stance. They put toes to the 
           lines. The ref signal go. A flurry of feints, kicks, spins.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I was fighting the greatest fighter 
                        in karate history.

           Darnell takes a strike to the face, a follow up kick to the 
           neck. He staggers back. He’s gonna lose this fight, badly.

           He looks around at the crowd, and notices a BAG OF POPCORN 
           falling in SLOW MOTION from a hand. He frowns, confused at 
           the slow motion fall. 

           He looks around, discovering everything in SLOW MOTION for 
           him, while he remains at NORMAL SPEED.

           Joe Lewis charges. Darnells steps easily aside from the slow-
           speed punch. Lewis follows up with a slow-motion kick, and 
           Darnell just steps back in normal speed. Lewis crosses with a 
           roundhouse slow-motion chop, Darnell walks around behind him, 
           and places one well-aimed KICK at Joe’s head. 

           Joe falls in slow-motion, landing, out cold.

           Darnell looks down at his hands, realizing his MIND POWER. 

           Then looks up at the CROWD as it slowly rises.

           CUT back to normal speed as the crowd ROARS.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        And I kicked his ass. 

           The ref realizes he’s just standing there, snaps to, raises 
           Darnell’s arm, the audience applauding this wild underdog. 
           The Norris team storms the mat, lifting Garcia. 
                                 BOB WALL
                        You just slayed the dragon, man! 

                                 KACHI KIMBALL
                        What the fuck, Garcia? You’re the 
                        fucking world champion! 

           Garcia pale as he’s handed his trophy. 

           He looks for Chuck, sees the red hair leaving. Darnell very 
           hurt to see Chuck just walk out. 

           The crowd begins to CHEER his name, and Darnell smiles again.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        When you zoom out, I mean, a year 
                        before I had been working in an 
                        airplane factory, no idea what I 
                        was going to do with my life. 

           INT. CHUCK NORRIS STUDIOS - TORRANCE - DAY

           Darnell, in instructor gi, wearing a GOLD BELT, his name in 
           custom cursive embroidery, paces before a very full CLASS, 
           sweating at the end of their workout, kneeling studiously.

                                 DARNELL
                        Now I’m a world champion. Karate 
                        did all that. Showed me the path. 
                        And it can do it for you too. It’s 
                        about Mind Power.

                                 STUDENT
                        Mind Power?

                                 DARNELL
                        The way in which we both 
                        internalize and externalize the 
                        art. Bend.

           Darnell holds up an open hand, and closes it slowly.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Reality to our will. All fights, 
                        all action take place in time. When 
                        we can speed up our perception of 
                        time, we can slow time. Relative to 
                        others. Thereby control it. 

           BRIDGET, a tall, confident blonde walks in the front door, 
           bell chiming. Darnell loses his train of thought. 
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        As you can see, time slowed down 
                        for me there as this young lady 
                        walked into the room. 

           The class CHUCKLES. The woman crosses her arms, watching.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Time is relative. Albert Einstein 
                        taught us that. Everything is in 
                        time, ergo everything is relative. 
                        Mind Power through karaté is our 
                        conscious ability to interact with 
                        reality as a relative phenomenon. 

           Bridget impressed, as Darnell intended.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        That’s enough for today.

           Darnell bows seriously to the class. They stand, bow back.

                                 CLASS
                        Osu.

           Darnell turns, and bows to a PICTURE OF CHUCK NORRIS.

                                 DARNELL
                        Osu. 

           The class starts to file out. Bridget approaches Darnell.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Excuse me, are you Sensei Garcia?

           Darnell gives it a dramatic beat, then turns to her.

                                 DARNELL
                        The legend in his own time.

                                 BRIDGET
                             (amused)
                        I’m Bridget.

                                 DARNELL
                        How can I help you, Bridget?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Kung Fu magazine sent me. To take 
                        your picture for the June issue.

                                 DARNELL
                        You work with Ed Parker over there?
           Bridget looking around for a place to do the shot.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I don’t know Ed. It’s freelance. 
                        It’s pretty dark here.
                             (pulls some blinds)
                        We’ll get you against the window. 
                        I’ve been real into windows.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Darnell posing, stiff. Bridget looking into the camera. She 
           walks over, readjusts him. He notes her touch, her closeness.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        Just talk to me. Be natural. 

                                 DARNELL
                        Talk to you about what?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Compliment me.

                                 DARNELL
                        What?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Tell me something nice.

                                 DARNELL
                        Um. I don’t know.

                                 BRIDGET
                        That hard to think of something?

                                 DARNELL
                        No. You’re...very beautiful.

           Darnell smiles, and she SNAPS.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Great. We got it.

                                 DARNELL
                        You got it? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Yep.

                                 DARNELL
                        That’s it?

           Bridget putting the camera away.
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Well...what are you doing tonight? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Tonight? Bold, sensei. Very bold.

                                 DARNELL
                        Mind Power.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Yours or mine?

           Bridget points to her temple, eyes intense. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT

           A CONDUCTOR in white jacket leads the LA PHIL through 
           TCHAIKOVSKY’S 1812 OVERTURE on stage below under pink glow.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Take a lot of girls to the Bowl?

           Darnell looks to her, not sure what to say...

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        Had a feeling when you called him 
                        Ta-chaikovsky.
                             (off his confusion)
                        Chai-kovsy. 

           Bridget grabs a bottle of RED from their basket.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        What’s this a 70 dollar bottle?

                                 DARNELL
                        90 actually.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You were really hoping to get laid?

           Darnell blushes, looks down, getting very upset.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, really. It’s sweet. But 
                        for future reference, a Bud Light 
                        would do the trick.

           The orchestra climaxing on stage. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get out of here.
           EXT. INGLEWOOD DRIVE-IN - LATER

           Darnell and Bridget at a picnic table, slamming burgers.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Well if I’m gonna be your sensei, I 
                        think I better know a little bit 
                        more about you.

           Darnell frowns. She winks, steals a handful of his fries.

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m a world champion. You’re gonna 
                        be my sensei?

                                 BRIDGET
                             (mouthful)
                        I think you got a lot to learn.

                                 DARNELL
                        What do you want to know?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Well...like where you from?

                                 DARNELL
                        Bronx. Grew up here.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Family?

           Darnell shakes his head.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        Only child? That explains it.

                                 DARNELL
                        My sister passed actually. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh. I’m sorry.

                                 DARNELL
                        My mom had passed. Dad wasn’t in 
                        the picture. At least...they didn’t 
                        have to see it. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        That’s terrible.
           EXT./INT. INGLEWOOD DRIVE-IN / DARNELL’S CAR - LATER

           The Drive-in’s lights turning off. Darnell’s car the only one 
           left. Darnell and Bridget in it, still talking...

                                 DARNELL
                        Chuck and I are planning on a chain 
                        of dojos. It’s sorta becoming a 
                        partnership since the win so-

           A TAP on the window startles them, they look up to A SECURITY 
           GUARD’s FLASHLIGHT.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Folks, we’re closed, uh--hoah-
                             (beat, recognizing him)
                        You’re the guy that beat Lewis?

           The Security Guard looks around the parking lot.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. You take your time. 

           The Security Guard puts a fist in his hand, and bows, walks 
           off. Darnell nods back. The Guard moves on. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Look at you, getting the royal 
                        treatment. 

           A quiet beat. Bridget leans in, kisses him. He pulls off.

                                 DARNELL
                        You know, I like you. I don’t wanna-

                                 BRIDGET
                        I like you too. This isn’t 1950. 

           Bridget kisses him again, climbing onto him.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Karate made me feel like a king.

           The couple start going at it.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        For a while.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STATE DINING ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY 

           A rack of Chanel pantsuits is hanging below Lincoln’s Thinker 
           Portrait above the fireplace. A STAFFER pulls a green blazer.

                        You want me to look like a

           Howard is there, hair darker, a year younger, and a year less 
           stressed than when we met him at Camp David.

                        Garcia was spotted in Brazil this 
                        morning.

                                 NANCY REAGAN
                        By who?

                        His suppliers?

                                 HOWARD
                        Hit them for cash. They tipped our 
                        badges on the ground.

                                 NANCY REAGAN
                        And Pasadena?

                                 HOWARD

                        possible. The Times knows a stash

                        I don’t swear, Howard. It’s not 
                        becoming of a lady. But this is a 
                        situation in which if I weren’t a 
                        lady, the first lady, the things I 
                        would be saying to you would make a

                        We have to control the story.

           INT. DEA SAFE HOUSE - 1987

           We find Darnell FROZEN again opposite João and his Guards, 
           with his hands up, eyes searching the scene.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But they did control it. 

           Darnell notices Guard 1 reaching for him, taking his hand off 
           his AK IN SLOW-MOTION...SOUND disappears into a vacuum. Mind 
           Power is kicking in.

           A foot seems to jump from nowhere, Darnell hip kicks the 
           rifle aside, it fires into the floor, knocks aside Guard 2 in 
           SLOW-MO.

           João raises his gun slowly, but Darnell has already sent the 
           window fan whirling like a mace on the end of its cord. 

           Haymakering João in the temple at full speed, João shoots 
           Guard 1 in the back as he reels sideways. 

           Guard 2 turns his AK on Darnell, but Garcia is ahead of him, 
           leaping out the window with the bag of cash.

           EXT. FAVELA ROOFS - CONTINUOUS

           Darnell smashes through the glass, rolling on the roof below 
           as we CUT back to normal speed.

           A beat. A breath. The city of Rio, ocean, and escape lies 
           down before him. Way down. He’s near the top of the favela.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I wouldn’t get my chance to tell it 
                        until now...

           He glances back above him, as GUARDS FIRE AK’S, MUZZLES 
           FLASHING above him. He runs. He leaps from the edge of the 
           roof, to another below, bullets smashing around him.
           WIDE SHOT: As Darnell leaps from building to building, like a 
           giant’s staircase, down away from the gunfire.

           He SMASHES onto the ROOF OF A TAXI on the city’s floor. 

           INT. SMASHED RIO TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           The DRIVER staring up at his crushed roof.

                                 DRIVER
                        Que porra?!

                                 DARNELL
                             (getting in)
                        Airport please.

                                 DRIVER
                        Que?

           Darnell shoves a BRICK OF HUNDREDS at him.

                                 DARNELL
                        DRIVE!

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT - LATER

           Darnell gets out of the smashed roof taxi. 

           INT. RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT - CONCOURSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy’s boys, DEA AGENTS, scour the concourse look for Garcia- 

           Darnell glances back at them from the Air France COUNTER. He 
           flashes his badge to a TICKET AGENT. 

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m gonna need runway access to the 
                        plane. We believe a suspect is 
                        trying to board the flight.

           The Air France Ticket Agent confused, then sees the DEA 
           jackets in the background, looks back at Darnell’s DEA BADGE.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Immediately.

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT - TARMAC - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell in a TARMAC CAR being taken to the plane. 
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Back then, I had no chance of 
                        telling the story. After a lifetime 
                        of being a very visible guy...

           INT. RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT - CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS

           Agents confused, radio’ing one another.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        All I could do was disappear.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PARIS CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - IMMIGRATION - DAY

           An IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL hands Darnell his FRENCH PASSPORT.

                                 DARNELL
                        Merci beaucoup.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHUCK NORRIS STUDIOS - OFFICE - DAY - 1972

           Darnell, in his gold belt and gi, storms into Chuck’s office. 
           The Ginger halo bent over paperwork at his desk.

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m not on the Santa Cruz roster?!

                                 CHUCK
                             (not looking up)
                        Didn’t think you fit the tourney.

                                 DARNELL
                        But I’m the champion. The champion.

                                 CHUCK
                        It’s just a title. I’m looking at a 
                        whole team here. Dynamics.

           Chuck still not looking up. Garcia’s eyes burn, he starts out-

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Hey- 
           Darnell looks back, hopeful.

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        We’re almost out of bog paper, you 
                        mind picking up a baker’s dozen?

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I realized Chuck wasn’t gonna let 
                        me rise in the karate world.

           INT. THE GARCIA’S TORRANCE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           WE FIND DARNELL UPSIDE DOWN, THE ENTIRE IMAGE UPSIDE DOWN: As 
           he practices a line in a mirror, his fists up (down). 

                                 DARNELL
                        It’s the dough, Roper. Or we gotta 
                        break something.

           REVEAL: Bridget behind, looking into the VIEWFINDER of a  
           REFLEX CAMERA at her waist, she SNAPS as the image rights.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You’re doing good with the martial 
                        arts thing. 
                             (hugging up to him)
                        And the marital arts thing. Why do 
                        you need this movie stuff?

                                 DARNELL
                        You know how many people went to 
                        Chuck’s last movie? Do you know how 
                        many fans he has now?

                                 BRIDGET
                        You’ve got the only two fans you 
                        need right here. 

           Darnell turns to her, puts a hand on her belly.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        Why is it so important to you-

           VOICE OVER cuts over her line as she continues to speak.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Anybody who asks that question has 
                        never been on the bottom. The very 
                        bottom. And known it.

                                 BRIDGET
                        -we’re doing good.
           He turns back to the mirror, raises his fists.

                                 DARNELL
                        We need to do better.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Maybe try it with your fists down? 

           Darnell drops his arms, tense, staring in the mirror...

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        When I took Chuck’s part in Enter 
                        The Dragon, we pretty much stopped 
                        speaking.

           Heavy DRUMS, CHIMES and guttural fighting CRY takes us to-

           EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - ENTER THE DRAGON SET - DAY

           Bob Wall, scar makeup over his eye, chats with Darnell, PAT 
           E. JOHNSON, MIKE BISSEL, and JOHN SAXSON for rehearsal as the 
           director, ROBERT CLOUSE, sets up the shot in the bg.

                                 ROBERT CLOUSE (PRE-LAP)
                        And action!

           EXT. BUSHES - GRIFFITH PARK - LATER

           John Saxson, in red turtleneck and slacks, looks for his golf 
           ball in the woods. Saxon looks up at Pat, Mike, Darnell.

                                 DARNELL
                        It’s the dough Roper, or we gotta 
                        break something. I suggest you find 
                        the dough.

                                 ROBERT CLOUSE
                        Cut. Sorry, is that the line?

                                 SCRIPTY (O.S.)
                        Just “we gotta break something.”

                                 DARNELL
                        I thought it could be stronger, you 
                        know, doubling down on the threat. 

           Clouse looks to Saxson, the other actors, they nod. 
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        So basically, when John hesitates, 
                        I come in with a kick, pop, up at 
                        his face, which he blocks, and 
                        then, Pat moves in at him.

           Darnell starts to demonstrate, miming the kick. 

                                 ROBERT CLOUSE
                        Sorry, who is this guy?

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m the world karate champion, Mr. 
                        Clouse. Darnell Garcia.

           Clouse looks to Wall. Wall shrugs.

           INT. ROOM OF MIRRORS - DAY

           Darnell does a slow, toe-leading creep in a multi-mirrored 
           room, checking out his own multi-reflection as he moves.

           REVEAL: A pair of EYES watching him.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Getting to choreograph a Bruce Lee 
                        film, be a part of his last film.

           INT. MANN’S CHINESE THEATER - ETD PREMIER - NIGHT

           Darnell walks the red carpet with Bridget, now very pregnant.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I felt like I was part of something 
                        that would be remembered. 

           INT. MANN’S CHINESE THEATER - - LATER

           Darnell and Bridget sit in the back, ENTER THE DRAGON plays, 
           ON SCREEN: BRUCE and his SHAOLIN ABBOT walk in the woods.

                                 BRUCE
                        A martial artist has to take 
                        responsibility for himself, and to 
                        accept the consequences.

           The images flashing on Darnell and Bridget’s faces. 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           John Saxon, in a turtleneck, opposite Darnell, Pat and Mike.
           Darnell leans over to Bridget’s PREGNANT BELLY, whispers-

                                 DARNELL
                        This is daddy’s line.

           Bridget GIGGLES, takes Darnell’s hand. And then:

                                 PAT E. JOHNSON
                        It’s the dough Roper, or we gotta 
                        break something. 

           FREEZE ON: Darnell. His line has been cut, replaced with a 
           close of Pat E. Johnson saying the line. 

           The scene continues. ON SCREEN: Darnell attacks first. John 
           Saxson throws him down easily. Darnell tries to get up, 
           Saxson kicks him in the face, laying him out. That’s it.

           Darnell looks to Bridget, who smiles, a little uncomfortable.

                                 BRIDGET
                        That was great, honey.

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - MANN’S CHINESE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell stares at himself in the mirror.

           INT. MANN’S CHINESE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           ON SCREEN: Bruce Lee toe-creeps through a room of mirrors.

                                 SHAOLIN ABBOT (V.O.)
                        The enemy has only images and 
                        illusions behind which he hides...

           Bruce begins to destroy the mirrors with kicks and fists.

           INT. MANN’S CHINESE THEATER - ETD PREMIER - CONTINUOUS

           Darnell HIGH-KICKS a TOWEL DISPENSER. It flies from the wall 
           into the mirror, SHATTERING IT. He STOMPS the counter, it 
           breaks from the wall, WATER SPRAYS. A light begins to spark.

                                 DARNELL
                        FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

           He stands there, heaving, as a STALL DOOR opens, a COUPLE 
           comes out, coke all over their noses, terrified. They exit. 
           Darnell left looking at his shattered reflection.
           EXT. FILM SETS - VARIOUS

           Darnell firing a MACHINE GUN at BAD GUYS who dance opposite 
           as their chests EXPLODE in gratuitous pops of gore.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I went on to bigger, better roles. 
                        Bamboo Trap. Outside Man. 

           Darnell aims at an OIL DRUM, then looks to the DIRECTOR 
           filming him on set as the CAMERA MOVES to the oil drum...

                                 DIRECTOR 
                        And 3, 2, 1. CLEAR!

           BOOM! The oil drum explodes straight up. STUNT MEN run up 
           with fire extinguishers as the barrel falls. Others CLAPPING.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Blind Rage, you may have seen.

           Darnell does karate in BLIND SUNGLASSES, he gets KICKED by a 
           BAD GUY...and LEAPS BACKWARDS through a window wall.

           EXT. SET OF BLIND RAGE - DAY

           THREE NAKED WOMEN with LIVE SNAKES crawl all over Darnell 
           seated in a stately chair. He looks very awkward. 

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Cut. Get the wrangler in here, 
                        those snakes look fucking dead. 

           The Women get up, leaving Darnell alone in the throne. TRACK 
           INTO: Darnell’s face, feeling like an outsider.

           INT. THE GARCIA HOME - NIGHT

           Bridget, dressed up, hands their toddler, DANIEL, to a BABY-
           SITTER. Darnell HONKS from the car.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Started doing the Hollywood thing.

           EXT. STEVE MCQUEEN’S HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - VARIOUS

           sipping cocktails in other conversations.
           INT. MASTER SUITE - STEVE MCQUEEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Darnell looking at STEVE MCQUEEN’S LE MANS PORTRAIT on the 
           mantle, next to a picture of STEVE WITH HIS DAD.

           MCQUEEN’S MANAGER, dripping in gold, a WOMAN on each arm, 
           BANGS on the bathroom door. Darnell looks over to the guy.

                                 DARNELL
                        Everything okay?

                                 MCQUEEN’S MANAGER
                        Who the fuck’s in there?

                                 DARNELL
                        My wife. There was a line-

           Bridget steps out.

                                 MCQUEEN’S MANAGER
                        What the fuck?! You know how pissed 
                        Stevie’s gonna be when he hears 
                        people were using his master? 

           Bridget puts a hand on her husband, calming him down.

                                 MCQUEEN’S MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        What are you looking at tough guy? 
                        Get the fuck outta here. Max, get 
                        these fucking people out of here!

           EXT. STEVE MCQUEEN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           A BIG GUY shows them out, Darnell and Bridget humiliated. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But the truth is, after a while, as 
                        seductive as that whole world is.

           They start to go, and are passed by LAPD on their way in. 
           McQueen’s Manager comes out, reaches for the cop’s shoulder.

                                 MCQUEEN’S MANAGER
                        Hey, this is a private party.

                                 COP 1
                        You just touch a police officer?

           COP 2 grabs the Manager’s arm, smashes him into the door. 
           Bridget smiles, looks to share the schadenfreude with her 
           husband, but Darnell is serious, in awe of the power.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It wasn’t for me. 

           EXT. REDONDO BEACH - 1980

           Darnell jogs in short blue shorts with other CADETS.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        To quote Horace Mann, the great 
                        educator--you should be ashamed to 
                        die if you don’t do something in 
                        this life to help mankind. 

           INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - HQ - DAY

           Darnell being sworn in with his Academy Class before the flag 
           and a PORTRAIT of the NEW PRESIDENT...RONALD REAGAN. 

                                 ACADEMY CLASS 
                        ...I will always strive to do what 
                        I know is right, even when it is 
                        difficult. I will act with honesty, 
                        courtesy and regard...

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        For the welfare of others. That’s 
                        what led me to law enforcement. 

           INT. LAPD CRUISER - MOVING - DAY

           Darnell riding along with his SENIOR PARTNER.

                                 DARNELL
                        An honest desire to give back.

                                 SENIOR PARTNER
                        Give back? Look, if it don’t shine 
                        brass ass, it ain’t worth doing. 

           The Senior Partner grabs a pistachio nut from a bag between 
           his thighs, pops it, shucks it in his mouth, spits the shell.

                                 SENIOR PARTNER (CONT’D)
                        You keep your head down, follow 
                        orders, do your paperwork. Period. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        The LAPD wasn’t the place. I needed 
                        something bigger, larger than life. 
           INSERT SHOT: A LIGHTNING BOLT striking a downtown LA tower as 
           Duran Duran’s WILD BOYS beats us into-

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (PRE-LAP)
                        THE DEA!

           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Darnell sits with other NEW HIRES, staring out at the LA 
           skyline and snow covered mountains as FRANKLIN MESSNER, 
           station chief, 40’s, amazing hair, fake tan, does his spiel.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        D. Drug. E. Enforcement. A. 
                        Assholes. That’s what you are, 
                        you’re a bunch of FUCKING ASSHOLES.

           Darnell looks to the black guy, JOHN JACKSON, beside him.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look at him. He’s just 
                        another asshole, he’s got nothing 
                        but shit for you. This is not cops 
                        and robbers. No, you bastards. This 
                        is a fucking war!

           Franklin kicks the GLASS WINDOW. Everyone flinches.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Relax. It’s bullet proof. Why? Up 
                        here, on the 30th floor? 
                             (a dramatic beat)
                        Because the mother fuckers we’re 
                        after have choppers, and are crazy 
                        enough to fly up here and shoot us. 
                        You. 

           Messner points to AL DIVETCO, another new hire. 

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, Divetco. Pick that chair 
                        up from under your fat ass!

           Divetco stands, picks up the chair, confused.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Break the glass with it.

           Divetco grabs the chair, hits the window with it.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Put your fucking back into it!
           Divetco hits the window so hard the chair bounces off back at 
           him, almost knocking him down. 

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        I said it was bullet proof, dummy. 
                        You stronger than a fucking bullet? 
                        You gotta use your head in war. Sit 
                        down, you fucking asslicker.

           Divetco sits. Jackson LAUGHING.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        You think something’s funny, 
                        Jackson? You want to call up the 
                        President and tell him the joke? 
                        Because I can get him on speaker 
                        now. Right fucking now. 
                             (screams)
                        Linda, get me the White House!

           The phone on the conference table begins to RING. All the new 
           guys swallowing...

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        That is a direct line to 1600 
                        Pennsylvania. 

           The line picks up.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        This is the White House, how may I 
                        direct your call?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                             (politely)
                        Oh hi, this is Franklin Messner. 
                        Could you please fuck yourself.

           Franklin hangs up the phone. He grins.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        With great responsibility...comes 
                        great power. That’s right, you cock 
                        cowboys. Prove yourself here, you 
                        can do what you want, when you 
                        want, to who you want, whatever the 
                        fuck. This is DEA. Nancy’s Boys. I 
                        have been to Mother Nancy’s house 
                        in Los Angeles for dinner on two 
                        memorable occasions. Duck l’orange 
                        and Beef Wellington. Succeed here, 
                        you too, may find the most powerful 
                        woman in the world smiling upon you-
           Another agent, WAYNE COUNTRYMAN, mumbles quietly to himself-

                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                        World smiling upon you.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Did you just repeat what I said you 
                        fucking weirdo?

           Countryman’s face twitches. Jackson looks to Darnell--wtf?

                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                        Sorry, sir.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Don’t apologize! Never apologize in 
                        war. That is rule number one here. 
                        None of you will have anything to 
                        apologize for ever again.

           Darnell stares at Messner, inspired.

           INT. DEA - VARIOUS 

           PAN THROUGH - Darnell and other Agents on a whirlwind tour:

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        This was the 1980s. The height of 
                        the War on Drugs. JUST SAY NO, no 
                        questions asked. Everything was 
                        unlimited. We had unlimited ammo.

           PAN TO - A firing range, Darnell and Jackson firing pistols, 
           Countryman is at the end unloading a deafening M60.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Unlimited drugs. 

           PAN TO - An AGENT tosses a brick of coke to another like a 
           football across a sea of desks. It hits a ceiling fan and 
           EXPLODES.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Unlimited funds. 

           PAN TO - A WOMAN placing a stack of bills in a counter. 
           Countryman dumps a bag of crumpled drug money on her desk. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It was crazy. Outta control. Agents 
                        fighting over what seized car they 
                        got to take home for the weekend. 
           PAN TO - AGENTS arguing over a set of keys in a GARAGE full 
           of million dollar sports cars. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I literally saw Agents get in a 
                        fist fight over a Lamborghini. 

           One PUNCHES the other, gets tackled.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        There was one guy who kept a Civil 
                        War cannon in his office. 

           PAN TO - Al Divetco oiling a giant CANNON in his office.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        He said it was a symbol. A symbol 
                        of the struggle. A symbol to 
                        preserve us through the long night 
                        ahead. It was nuts.

           INT. FRANKLIN MESSNER’S CORNER OFFICE - LATER

           Franklin puts a BRIEFCASE on the table, opens it...FULL OF 
           CASH. Countryman swallows. Jackson rises. Darnell stares.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Buy, bust, turn. That’s how it all 
                        worked.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           QUIET RIOT’S Metal Health (Bang Your Head) rises...

           John Jackson and Wayne Countryman, in leather, chat with a

           John Jackson puts a STACK OF BENJAMINS on the table, the 
           Korean Dealer hands him a BRICK OF COCAINE, singing along-

           slips CASH to the BOOKIE, takes a BRICK OF COKE in exchange.

                        Got-no-brains. I’m-in-sane.

           The KARAOKE BALL hits between the cars, and tires SMOKE. 

           INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT

           Wayne Countryman grimacing as a TATTOO ARTIST puts his needle

           Darnell looks from the KARAOKE BALL on the lyrics, idling, to 
           Jackson LAUGHING with the Korean Dealer. Jackson pulls his 
           BADGE. The Korean Dealer stops laughing. The BALL hits text-

                                 DARNELL (AND KARAOKE TEXT)
                        ...BANG-YOUR-HEAD!

           Countryman grabs the Dealer’s head, SMASHES it into the table- 

           The KOREAN KARAOKE DJ pulls a gun, about to shoot, but 
           Darnell strangles him with the karaoke microphone wire.
           EXT. LA RIVER - DRAG RACE - NIGHT

           Angry Bettors draw weapons at Darnell’s BADGE. Countryman 
           pulls a HARD 180 in the drag race, flooring back at the 
           bettors. Their eyes wide, they dive away. 

                                 KARAOKE TEXT (DARNELL SINGING)
                        I’m-remon-strated. Out-dated.

           Jackson pulls his BADGE. The Artist goes for a gun. 
           Countryman grabs the needle-gun, JAMS it into the Tattoo

           Kicks the KARAOKE BALL from the song text into...

           INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Darnell flashes his BADGE. Weapons pop up around the shop. 
           Jackson leaps up from the barber’s chair, pulling PISTOLS 
           from under his gown as his hair droppings fly.

                                 KARAOKE TEXT (DARNELL SINGING)

           Darnell pulling him off. The song and montage FADE OUT as...

           Franklin Messner APPLAUDING Darnell and the team.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Well done, mother fuckers!
           Al Divetco swings a Civil War Cavalry Sword at a champagne 
           bottle, it just EXPLODES. Everyone looks at him, WTF? 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Agents dancing with STRIPPERS. It’s a party.

           Countryman watches the party, awkwardly, in the corner. He 
           looks around, and takes a BAG OF COCAINE, and pockets it.

           Darnell, across the room, see Countryman do this. 

           Countryman sees Darnell see him. Messner pats Darnell on the 
           back, interrupting the moment. He has a STRIPPER on his arm.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Garcia! You’re standing there like 
                        a fucking noodle? Meet Teresa.

                                 STRIPPER
                        I’m Brandy.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Tomato tomato. Teresa, I want you 
                        to take care of this guy. This 
                        guy’s going places. Big places.

           Franklin SLAPS her on the ass, and moves on. Brandy moves up 
           to Darnell, pressing her breasts to his. 

           Darnell doesn’t pay her much attention, he’s focused on 
           Countryman across the room, who looks around, and leaves.

           OFF Darnell’s look.

                                 BRIDGET (PRE-LAP)

           INT. THE GARCIA HOME - PANTRY - MORNING

           Bridget is in a makeshift darkroom in the pantry, hanging 
           prints from a line.

                                 DARNELL (O.S.)
                        I told you, I was with the guys 
                        celebrating the bust.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Until five in the morning with 
                        cocaine in your hair?
           INTERCUT WITH: INT. THE GARCIA HOME - KITCHEN - SAME

           Darnell, still in his dealer-look, making pancakes for his 
           son DANIEL, 6, at the table-

                                 DARNELL
                        We got some big players.

           Bridget steps into the kitchen.

                                 BRIDGET
                        It’s not the movies, Nell, it’s 
                        real.

                                 DARNELL 
                        I know it’s real. I’m making a 
                        difference. I’m good at this. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Good at what? Partying with drug 
                        dealers all night? Do you really 
                        prefer that?

                                 DARNELL
                        No.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Then why are you choosing it?

                                 DARNELL
                        I didn’t choose. You think I wanted 
                        to give up the movies? 

           She walks off. Darnell leaves a cooking pancake to follow her-

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        You know how hard that was for me? 
                        To fail. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        You didn’t fail. 

                                 DARNELL
                        I did. You married a winner.

                                 BRIDGET
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DARNELL
                        You think you would have fallen in 
                        love with some no name working in 
                        an airplane factory?
                                 BRIDGET
                        I think I’d have fallen in love 
                        with Darnell Garcia working in an 
                        airplane factory.

                                 DARNELL
                        You wouldn’t have. I wouldn’t love 
                        that guy either. 

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        Dad.

           Darnell smells a smoking pancake, goes back to the kitchen to 
           find a blackening pancake.

                                 DARNELL
                        Shit. I’ll start a new one, buddy.

           Bridget watching as Darnell pours more batter.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I gotta be a man he can look up to.

           Bridget sits by Daniel, who’s literally looking up at his dad-

                                 BRIDGET
                        All you gotta be is here.

                       Paris. February 1988. (Two Months On The Run)

           INT. MOTEL - PARIS - NIGHT 

           Darnell, exhausted, counts out his remaining cash on the bed.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t know then the DEA would 
                        lead me to the place I am today. 
                        Same organization I had embraced, 
                        that I had risked my life for, 
                        would turn everyone against me. 

           Darnell looks at a list of phone numbers, all crossed out. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Froze my accounts. Said it was drug 
                        money. Had my banks seal it up. 
                        Convinced everyone to hang me out. 

           He picks up the phone, dials, RINGING...
                                 BRIDGET (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Hello?

           A long beat.

                                 BRIDGET (O.S.) (FITLTERED) (CONT’D)
                        Darnell?

           Darnell doesn’t say anything...he swallows, hangs up.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t talk to my wife. My 
                        family. Not until I had the funds 
                        to move them. For all I knew, the 
                        DEA had convinced them I was guilty-

           Darnell wipes his face. He gets up and goes to the bathroom, 
           looks at himself in the mirror.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I hate the DEA. 

           Darnell runs the sink, splashes water on his face, watching 
           it drip slowly off his skin.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But they say to hate something, you 
                        gotta love it first. And for a 
                        while, I’ll admit, I loved it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - DEA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Agents stand around sipping cappuccinos with a million dollar 
           view. RIVERS, a young new agent, enters with coffees. 

                                 RIVERS
                        Coffee, Mr. Jackson?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        No thanks. Turns you black.

           Other Agents LAUGH. Rivers unsure...

                                 JOHN JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Hang on, there, Rivers. I’ll take 
                        one of those. Stand still now.

           Rivers confused. Jackson takes the coffee, and puts it on 
           Rivers’ head. He stands, confused, nervous. 
                                 JOHN JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move. It’s hot. Come on, D. 

           Darnell eyes Rivers, Rivers standing there, hands at his 
           side, coffee cup balanced on his head. Suddenly - A TASSLED 
           LOAFER kicks it off, right into the trash can.

                                 JOHN JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        HOAH! Fuck that’s dope.

           Rivers smiles. Wayne Countryman stares at Rivers, intense.

                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                        What are you smiling at?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Show some fucking respect.

           Darnell pats Rivers on the back, leading him out.

                                 DARNELL
                        They’re just messing with you, kid. 

           INT. DRUG VAULT - DEA HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Garcia and his guys logging product as they stash it in a 
           safe. Countryman takes a BAG OF COCAINE, and pockets it. 
           Darnell looks up from the log, seeing Countryman do this.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I saw things...we all saw things, 
                        we didn’t necessarily say things. 

           Countryman sees Darnell see him, pretends nothing happened, 
           putting other bags of cocaine into the safe.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Reporting on your partners, I 
                        realize it doesn’t make me look 
                        good to say this, but I’m not 
                        trying to look good, I’m trying to 
                        be honest. Reporting on your 
                        partners...it’s not a way to rise-

           Garcia opposite Franklin, heavily orange, rubbing cream onto 
           his eyelids (his eyes are closed for the entire scene).

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        And I wanted to rise.
                                 DARNELL
                        Is there anything else I could be 
                        doing?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Keep kicking ass. Your time’ll come-

                                 DARNELL
                        I will. If you have any advice-

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Wash your hands after you shit. If 
                        it’s wet and it’s not yours, don’t 
                        touch it.

           Franklin LAUGHS, still rubbing his eyes. Darnell looks down.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Listen, son, if you want advice, go 
                        see a shrink. Better yet a whore. I 
                        know a girl. 20 bucks’ll get you a 
                        shoulder to cry on and a bj you’ll

           Bridget and Darnell get out of their minivan with groceries.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It was a dangerous job, sure.

           INT. GARCIA HOME - NIGHT

           Garcia walks in, and BANG! He grabs his chest, shot! He 
           collapses back into the door, sliding down it. 

           Bridget LAUGHS. Daniel in GI JOE pajamas, holds his cap gun 
           smoking, as he fires two more rounds--BANG, BANG.

                                 DARNELL
                        Oh. Oh!

           Daniel runs up to his father, who lies against the door, with 
           his eyes closed...he opens them playfully.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                             (patting his chest)
                        But I was wearing...
                                 DANIEL
                        A bullet proof vest! 

                                 DARNELL
                        You better run!

           Darnell leaps up, and chases Daniel to his room, closes the 
           door. Darnell stands at the door...

           EXT. RUNDOWN HOME - SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Darnell, in a DEA windbreaker, holding a SHIELD, stands at 
           the door. He gives Countryman, Jackson, and Rivers the GO 
           signal. Jackson kisses his GOLD CROSS, tucks it in his bullet 
           proof vest. They nod. Darnell wheels and KICKS open the door.

           INT. GARCIA HOME - NIGHT

           Darnell bursts into Daniel’s room, miming a machine gun...

                                 DARNELL
                             (doing bullet sounds)
                        P-tttt-ttt. P-tttt-ttt.

           INT. RUNDOWN HOME - SOUTH CENTRAL - NIGHT

           Darnell, Countryman, Jackson, and Rivers charge in, FIRING 
           ROUNDS off into the ceiling, terrifying a living room full of 
           BUTT NAKED COCAINE PROCESSORS raising their hands in terror. 

           INT. GARCIA HOME - NIGHT

           Darnell looks around Daniel’s room.

                                 DARNELL
                        There’s no one here.

           Daniel pops out of a pile of stuffed animals, firing.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Back up! I need back up!

                                 DANIEL
                        Back up?

                                 BRIDGET (O.S.)
                        I’m coming, partner!

           Bridget wheels in, miming a shot gun on her hip...
                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        BOOM! BOOM! KA-BOOM!

           Daniel giggles, runs into his closet.

                                 DARNELL
                        Come out, with your hands up.

           INT. RUNDOWN HOME - SOUTH CENTRAL - NIGHT

           Darnell and his guys holding GUNS on the Naked Cocaine 
           Workers, he and Countryman nod to a closet, move to it.

                                 DARNELL
                        Come out, with your hands up.

           INT. GARCIA HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Garcia and Bridget whip open the closet door, and Daniel pops 
           out, they grab him, and he SQUEALS in delight.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But it was a great time.

           INT. RUNDOWN HOME - SOUTH CENTRAL - CONTINUOUS

           Jackson whips open the closet, and TOOTIE REESE, a major LA 
           distributor fires a sawed-off, DEA guys diving away. 

           POV: Darnell’s BULLET-PROOF RAID SHIELD VIEWING SQUARE. It 
           takes the second blast right at it.

           Darnell NAILS Tootie with the shield, tackles the dealer, 
           disarming him as Tootie CURSES in fury. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        A very great time. Pretty soon I 
                        was building the big cases.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DEA HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Jackson, Countryman and Rivers are being walked through a 
           DRUG ORGANIZATION tree by Darnell...

                                 DARNELL
                        This is the guy we’re after. 
                        Nicolas Hunter Ray. 

           At the TOP OF THE PYRAMID is a headshot of: FABIO.
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        This guy is Escobar big. Problem 
                        is, we don’t know where he is, or 
                        what he even looks like. 

                                 AL DIVETCO
                        Who’s that in the photo then?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Fabio, idiot.  

                                 DARNELL
                        Then there’s Patty. Hunter Ray’s 
                        number two.

           Below Hunter Ray, a headshot of PATTY.

                                 AL DIVETCO
                        Is that what Patty looks like or is 
                        that a celebrity too?

                                 DARNELL
                        That’s Patty. He’s the guy we’re 
                        gonna turn. When he does, we let 
                        ‘em know who we are, make him queen 
                        for a day.

           Franklin walks in, his NOSE COVERED IN BANDAGES.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        What the hell you wearing? 

                                 DARNELL
                        Suits?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Nu-un. Have Linda sign you guys out 
                        some petty cash, get some goddamn 
                        nice suits. You’re big dealers now, 
                        you don’t shop at fucking Macy’s. 

           INT. LINDA’S OFFICE - DEA HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Linda counts out Ben Franklins on her desk for the guys. 

           Billy Idol’s REBEL YELL flies us to...

           EXT. GARMENT DISTRICT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           A line of BIG HAIR, GLITTERED CLOTHING and NIGHTTIME SHADES 
           outside a warehouse lit up in pastel colored gels.
           Darnell and Jackson pull up in a LOTUS, get out in SHARK SKIN 
           SUITS and AVIATORS, HEAVY GOLD CHAINS. Darnell carries a 
           briefcase. They look to Rivers and Countryman, waiting-

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Wayne, look at you. Shit.

           Darnell and Rivers admiring him in his ill-fitting sharkskin.

                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                             (shrugs)
                        Ta-da.

           INT. WAREHOUSE PARTY - GARMENT DISTRICT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Darnell and his team blend into the party, the dance floor 
           packed with MOONWALKERS, MARTINIS, NEONS.

           Jackson starts dancing with a WOMAN, topless beneath her big-
           shouldered blazer. 

                                 WOMAN
                        You’re a good dancer.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Nothing girl. Nothing at all.

           Jackson drops, does the worm. Rivers dancing in a circle of 
           WOMEN clapping.

           Wayne Countryman standing with his fingers in his ears. A 
           WAITER bumps him, spills a Martini on his sharkskin sleeve. 

                                 WAITER
                        Sorry.

           Countryman looks at his sleeve, and SHOVES the waiter, who 
           flies into a mess of bodies, tray crashing. Jackson sees from 
           worm position, gets up, grabs Countryman leading him off.

           Darnell following, searches the crowd for faces. He spots-

                                 DARNELL
                        Patty.

           PATTY, the deal front-man for the Hunter-Ray supply chain, in 
           leopard skin vest and ahead-of-their-time parachute pants, 
           points at Darnell. Then points dramatically to the back. 
           INT. WAREHOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The sound of the party muted in the background. Darnell, 
           flanked by his team, stands opposite Patty and his boys.

                                 PATTY
                        You boys look good. You having a 
                        good time tonight?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Real good, real good, Patty.

                                 PATTY
                        Nice suits. What is that, metallic?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Sharkskin.

           Patty puts a hand to his head like a FIN, mimes swimming.

                                 PATTY
                        Dope. Gotta get one of those.

                                 DARNELL
                        You’ll be able to get a few.

           Patty nods to one of his guys. The guy comes forward, puts a 
           briefcase on the floor, opens it, reveals BAGS OF COCAINE.

                                 PATTY
                        Okay?

           Darnell looks to Jackson, Countryman, Rivers. They all nod 
           they’re ready. Darnell steps forward, opens his own 
           briefcase, inside is...HIS DEA BADGE.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        What is that? What is that?

           Jackson, Countryman and Rivers eyeing Patty and his crew.

                                 DARNELL
                        You know what it is. The building’s 
                        surrounded. We just want Nick.

           Patty’s face drops like he’s shit himself. His eyes water.

                                 PATTY
                        You. Fucking. Cocksucker.

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m just doing my job, like you’re 
                        doing yours. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARNELL (CONT'D)
                        We’re all doing our jobs here. I 
                        did mine better today, but you 
                        still got options. Be smart-

           Patty eyes his crew, looks to Darnell. A long tense beat.

                                 PATTY 
                        Man man man. Man shit man.  

           Patty turns around, offering up his hands. Some of his gang 
           follows. Jackson and Rivers move in to cuff wrists-

                                 DARNELL
                        Smart choice. You keep making smart 
                        choices, this is gonna be very easy-

           Rivers is SHOT IN THE HEAD. Darnell sees the blood and brain 
           matter move at him in SLOW-MOTION. SOUND going.

           Mind Power kicking in.

           Darnell tackles Jackson out of the way at full speed, as 
           BULLETS spray. A slow-motion bullet rips through the flesh of 
           his shoulder midair. 

           Countryman pulls an UZI in slow-mo, drops the SHOOTER. 
           Patty’s other guys’ hands up. 

           Al Divetco charges in with the BACK UP as we CUT back to 
           normal speed.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        You saved my life, mother fucker.

           Darnell horrified as he stares at Rivers, in a growing pool 
           of blood, dead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Nancy sits in a deep leather arm chair, eyeing Howard,

                        I want to understand what kind of 
                        man I’m dealing with. Who is he?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Well Garcia’s a 38-year-old male. 
                        Catholic Jew. Latino, white, black 
                        too. Real melting pot, you know. 
                        Stick a fondue fork in him.

           Messner grins, flashing his veneers. The Suits LAUGH. Nancy 
           silences them with a glance. Messner clears his throat.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)

                        I understand he thinks he was some 
                        kind of star? That he’s special?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        He was in movies. Enter the Dragon.

                        You decorated him, mom.

           OFF her look.

           Darnell, shoulder bandaged, stands on stage in front of a 
           “JUST SAY NO” banner. Nancy Reagan hangs a MEDAL on his neck. 

           Bridget in the audience, next to Rivers’ WIDOW, in black, who 
           holds an AMERICAN FLAG and MEDAL. 

           Darnell is approached by a MAN in a black suit as he exits 
           the stage.

                                 MAN
                        Congratulations, Mr. Garcia. You’re 
                        the man of the hour.
                             (offers him a CARD)
                        If you ever want to be man of the 
                        year.
           Darnell looks at the card, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
           embossed on it. He looks back up, the Man nods, walks off.

           INT. THE FIRST LADY’S OFFICE - THE WHITE HOUSE - 1988

           Nancy gets up, moves to DARNELL’S PICTURE, studying his face.

                                 NANCY 
                        So at what point did he turn?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER 
                        We’re getting there. Our analysts 
                        are trying to determine that now. 

           INT. BALLROOM - HILTON - NIGHT - 1984

           Darnell with Bridget opposite Nancy in the crowd.

                                 DARNELL
                        Mrs. Reagan, I wanted to introduce 
                        you to my wife.

                                 NANCY
                        You should be very proud of him.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I am.

                                 NANCY
                        We’re grateful to him, and to your 
                        family. The whole country is.

                                 BRIDGET
                        That’s kind. But what about the 
                        Rivers’ family? She’s a widow now. 
                        Three children. Your husband just 
                        cut the funding to the programs 
                        women like her depend on. 

           Nancy stares, stunned.

           INT. THE FIRST LADY’S OFFICE - THE WHITE HOUSE - 1988

           Nancy turns from Darnell’s picture to the men.

                                 NANCY
                        I remember his wife. 

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        We’ve interrogated her.
                                 NANCY
                        I want to talk to her.

                                 HOWARD
                        You don’t have to be this involved-

                                 NANCY
                        Howard. The last time I decided not 
                        to be this involved was 1967. And 
                        that homo ring almost cost my 
                        husband the governorship. 

           EXT. THE GARCIA HOME - NIGHT - 1984

           A Honda pulls into the driveway, the Garcias get out.

                                 BRIDGET
                        She’s a horrible person. 

                                 DARNELL
                        You still don’t insult a woman like 
                        that to her face. 

           Bridget starts inside.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        You don’t like me in the movies. 
                        You don’t like me in the LAPD. You 
                        don’t like me in the DEA. Maybe you 
                        just don’t like me?

                                 BRIDGET
                        I sat next to a woman whose husband 
                        was killed. That could have been 
                        you. For what? So Nancy Reagan can 
                        hang a medal on your neck? 

                                 DARNELL
                        We’re fighting a war for the soul 
                        of this country. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        No, Nell. I saw you up there. 
                        You’re fighting for you. 

           Bridget goes inside, Darnell staring after her.

           INT. DEA OFFICE - LOS ANGELES - 1984

           Franklin, with a NEW AND MORE SHAPELY NOSE, dims the lights 
           in a room full of AGENTS. An over-head projector casts an 
           image of a NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY on the wall.
                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Nicholas Hunter Ray. Thanks to some 
                        outstanding work by Garcia and his 
                        team, we know what this scumbag 
                        looks like. And look at him. Look 
                        at that jaw line! That million 
                        dollar smile.
                             (shaking his head in 
                              admiration)
                        This guy could be in Men’s Fucking 
                        Vogue.

           The room silent.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, we got a tip that he’s got 
                        a plane coming in to Santa Monica 
                        next week. I expect you to be out 
                        there with boners for this guy. 
                        Darnell, run us through it-  

           Darnell gets up, taking front and center.

           INT. FRANKLIN MESSNER’S OFFICE - LATER

           Darnell knocks on the door, steps in.

                                 DARNELL
                        You wanted to see me, sir?

           Messner wears a COOL-PACK EYE MASK with holes, waving him in.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Come in, come in. Have a seat.

                                 DARNELL
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        You don’t even know what you’re 
                        thanking me for. 

           Darnell sitting, unsure.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        A DC gig’s opening up. Rocket ship 
                        to the lights. You hearing me? 
                        Fuck. I woulda nominated myself, 
                        but it’s been intimated they want 
                        someone with a “diverse” 
                        background. You got fucking 
                        minority blood or whatever, right-
                                 DARNELL
                        My father was Latino, mom was 
                        Jewish, I have African American in 
                        the third-

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        I don’t give a shit. They do. Look, 
                        it’s all but a done deal. So you 
                        keep kicking ass around here, 
                        you’re gonna wanna start shopping 
                        for some Virginia real estate. 
                        Don’t you fucking forget who sent 
                        you up the flag pole, alright.

           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell looks in the mirror, breathing hard, trying to stay 
           under control. He does a celebratory HIGH KICK, PUNCH-PUNCH, 
           another KICK, KICKING invisible assailants.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        So many times, I’d felt the world 
                        was stopping me from being me. And 
                        now the DEA was saying, you’re the 
                        best, go be the best. 

           INT. GARCIA HOME - NIGHT

           Darnell plays the original SUPER MARIO with Daniel, 10.  

                                 DARNELL
                        How’s things in school?

                                 DANIEL
                        Okay.

                                 DARNELL
                        You have any more of that 
                        nervousness?

                                 DANIEL
                        The counselor said it’s called 
                        anxiety.

                                 DARNELL
                        You have any more of it?

                                 DANIEL
                        Sometimes.
                                 DARNELL
                        Karate could help you with that, to 
                        control those feelings.

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know.

                                 DARNELL
                        Well think about it, okay? I think 
                        it could be really good. 

           Daniel shrugs.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        It’s done some great things for 
                        your dad. You remember Mind Power?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah.

                                 DARNELL
                        What is it?

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s like, the ability to change 
                        things. It’s like magic. But it’s 
                        not magic. It’s real.

                                 DARNELL
                        That it?

                                 DANIEL
                             (trying to recollect)
                        We only use 10% of our brains? 

                                 DARNELL
                        Right! But what about the other 
                        90%? There’s a power there, Daniel, 
                        a will you can use to shape your 
                        reality, your anxiety, whatever. 

           Daniel remains focused on Mario Brothers.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been using it at work, and now 
                        I’m up for a big promotion.

           Daniel keeps playing.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        What would you say if I told you 
                        we’re maybe gonna try somewhere 
                        else for a while? A new school?
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        DC. It’s a very big deal. You think 
                        you’d be okay with that?

                                 DANIEL
                        I like it here. 

                                 DARNELL
                        I know. But sometimes, taking on 
                        hard things, things you don’t like 
                        at first, it makes you stronger. 
                        It’s how you learn to use that Mind 
                        Power. Growing up, when things were 
                        hard for me, that’s when I really 
                        learned to use my mind to overcome.

                                 DANIEL
                        Can we get a dog if we move?

                                 DARNELL
                        I’ll talk to mommy about it.

           Daniel lights up. Darnell kisses his son on the forehead.

           Unmarked cars around the runway, indiscrete.

           Darnell sits up front, with a radio. Jackson eats a breakfast 
           burrito. Countryman looks through binoculars.

           Countryman looks through binoculars, finds the LITTLE JET.

                                 DARNELL
                        No one move til he’s off the plane.

           EXT. HUNTER RAY’S JET - LANDING - MOMENTS LATER

           The Jet touches down, slowing as it moves down the runway. It 
           turns, and pulls up to the hanger.

           The jet door opens, staircase presenting itself. Hunter Ray’s 
           crew starts down it towards a WAITING LIMO.
                                 DARNELL (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Not until shoes touch jetway.

           Hunter Ray looks out the doorway of the plane, starts down. 
           Al Divetco signals Go. 

                                 AL DIVETCO
                        GO GO GO!

           LIGHTS, SIRENS, WINDBREAKERS. Cars swarm, a BLACK SUV 
           screeches up in front of the plane, blocking its path.

                                                         DARNELL

                                              Not yet, fuck-

           Hunter Ray’s Guards firing, DEA dive for cover. Other DEA 
           returning fire, they shoot the Guards dead. But Hunter Ray 
           escapes up the staircase back into the plane in the exchange.

                                 DARNELL
                        Who said move, goddamnit?

           The Jet starts up its engines, staircase still down.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        He’s running for it.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        The plane’s blocked.

           Suddenly, Hunter Ray’s waiting LIMO drives for the DEA SUV 
           blocking the plane’s exit, and SMASHES into it. 

           DEA opens fire on the limo, but it backs up, SMASHES the SUV 
           again, bulldozing it out of the way, and the plane begins to 
           accelerate into open runway.

                                 JOHN JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Darnell jumps back in the car, and FLOORS it after the plane.

           INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           Darnell accelerates up alongside the plane as it turns to try 
           to get to the long stretch of runway for takeoff.

           Jackson and Countryman watch with everyone else, now out of 
           their cars, standing, stunned, confused...

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        What the fuck’s he doing?
           The plane makes the turn, and Darnell rolls down his window, 
           reaching out with an UZI...

                                 JOHN JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        He gonna kill the pilot?

                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                        Can’t make that shot.

           Darnell aims at the JET’S FRONT TIRE...Fires-fires. He 
           SWERVES to avoid a RUNWAY SIGN, accelerates up alongside 
           again, the plane beginning to pull away...

           A GUARD steps out onto the door-steps, FIRING an AK at 
           Darnell...one hits his car, shatters the windshield--this was 
           not how this was supposed to go down. 

           And on cue: the shells begin to DROP in SLOW MOTION. 

           Mind Power kicking in.

           Perry Como’s IT’S IMPOSSIBLE rises to the MIND POWERED action 
           moving to its rolling lilt...

           *Darnell accelerates the car towards the jet. Moving faster 
           than everything else in the slow frame.
           *He aims the Uzi again, looking through its tiny NOSE-SCOPE.
           *TIGHT ON: His MAGNIFIED EYE, looking through that scope.
           *The muzzle below the eye flashes, flashes, flashes.

           A a round hits the front wheel of the jet with a loud POP.

           The Jet takes a dip off balance, tire whipping, shredding, 
           landing gear begins to spark, plane swerving, it tips, going 
           NOSE down into the concrete as it skids to a smoking halt.

           Hunter Ray and the pilot jump out, rolling away just before 
           the jet EXPLODES in a FIREBALL.

           CUT back to normal speed as Darnell watches the DEA corral 
           Hunter Ray, cufffing him. APPLAUSE builds O.S.

           INT. DEA OFFICE - LOS ANGELES - LATER

           Darnell enters with his prize to the whole office clapping.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        That’s right! That’s fucking right!

                                 DARNELL (PRE-LAP)
                        This is wrong! This is insane!
           INT. DEA INTERROGATION OBSERVATION ROOM - LATER

           Franklin with JOYCE KARLIN, LA prosecutor, and Darnell, 
           looking at Hunter Ray on the other side of a two-way mirror.

                                 DARNELL
                        He walks on bond, he’s gonna 
                        disappear. He’s got the funds to 
                        never come up again.

                                 JOYCE KARLIN
                        He’s also got the funds for lawyers 
                        like Shapiro. Nothing we can do. 
                        Had the plane not exploded, we 
                        might have had the product to deny 
                        bail, but as it is...

                                 DARNELL
                        I lost men taking this guy down and 
                        he’s just gonna walk?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        We all mourn Rivers, but men die in 
                        war. War continues.

                                 JOYCE KARLIN
                        See you at the Lakers game?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Floor, baby. Count on it.

           Joyce mimes a pistol, walks out. Darnell watches her go, 
           disgusted.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Also, look, Darnell. 

                                 DARNELL
                        What?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        The Washington gig....I’m 
                        recommending Divetco for it.

                                 DARNELL
                        Al Divetco? That fuck-up?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        With this Hunter Ray set-back, it’s 
                        not your fault, but there’s not 
                        really the paper trail to push you 
                        forward for it. 
                                 DARNELL
                        Al Divetco?! Cannon boy?

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        He’s had success in the grass game.

                                 DARNELL
                        The grass game is pussy shit.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Grass is important to DC.

                                 DARNELL
                        I put my life on the line. I 
                        stopped a plane with a fucking uzi. 
                        I brought in Nicholas Hunter Ray. 
                        This is bullshit.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Look, why don’t you go to Hawaii 
                        for a while? We think there’s a 
                        cartel operating there.

                                 DARNELL
                        In Hawaii? 

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Run by one...FNU LNU.

                                 DARNELL
                        Finu Lanu? 

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        First Name Unknown, Last Name 
                        Unknown. Operates out of all the 
                        best hotels, finest spas, Michelin 
                        restaurants. We need guys on their 
                        tail. Why don’t you take a look 
                        around for a month? Courtesy of the 
                        taxpayers. Enjoy yourself. 

           Messner winks. Darnell processing that. Messner starts out, 
           stops, peers in at Hunter Ray in the interrogation room.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                             (walking out)
                        Goddamnit he is a handsome mother 
                        fucker.
           INT. DEA INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Nicholas Hunter Ray sitting at a steel table opposite a BIG 
           MIRROR, Darnell walks in, puts a plastic bag of Hunter Ray’s 
           personals on the table. 

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY
                        So you’re the big swinging dick who 
                        brought me in? How’s that working 
                        out for you? 

           Hunter Ray gets up, offers his cuffs. Darnell unlocks them, 
           takes them. Hunter Ray massages his wrists.

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY (CONT’D)
                        Better if I wasn’t leaving, huh?

                                 DARNELL
                        Just get the fuck out.

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY
                        I know who you are, you know.

           Hunter Ray opens his bag of personals. 

                                 DARNELL
                        I don’t give a fuck you know my 
                        name-

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY
                        I didn’t say I know your name. 

           Hunter Ray takes out a cigarette, a GOLD lighter, lights up. 

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY (CONT’D)
                        I said I know who you are. You’re a 
                        parasite. You exist because of men 
                        like me. Men who take what they 
                        want. While men like you make up 
                        rules to profit from fighting us. 

           A long beat. The silence palpable.

                                 DARNELL
                        ...you’re a dealer piece of shit.

           Hunter Ray takes out his other things, his jacket, a money 
           clip, and a shining GOLD ROLEX PRESIDENT.

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY
                        It’s all relative, baby. 

           Hunter Ray pulls on his jacket.
                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY (CONT’D)
                        Once upon a time, armies of men 
                        like you we’re going after a bunch 
                        of bootleggers and their squirrel 
                        dew. My father was one of ‘em.

           Hunter Ray pockets his lighter, takes another drag on his 
           cigarette, smoke filling the small room.

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY (CONT’D)
                        Think anyone remembers his name? 
                        Every time I legally pay for a 
                        drink, I see his face pissing it 
                        out. Life’s work down the toilet. 

           He slides on his Rolex, adjusts the time. Darnell swallows. 

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY (CONT’D)
                        I have an eye for people. I see 
                        something in you.

                                 DARNELL
                        What the fuck you think you see?

           Hunter Ray approaches, gets very close.

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY
                        A man who yearns for the crown.

           Darnell taken aback. 

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY (CONT’D)
                        But men on your side, Mr. Garcia, 
                        they never wear it. So ask 
                        yourself...what’s really standing 
                        between you and greatness?

           Hunter Ray puts a hand on Darnell’s shoulder, almost fatherly-

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY (CONT’D)
                        You give that some thought, son.

           INT. GARCIA HOME - NIGHT

           Darnell walks in, Daniel waits with a DOG BREED BOOK. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Dad-

           Darnell walks right past his son, and goes into his bedroom. 
           INT. GARCIA HOME - MORNING

           Darnell picks at his eggs, Bridget smiles, takes a wrapped 
           package from a drawer, and walks over to her husband. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Happy birthday.

           Darnell opens the gift. It’s a watch--A CASIO.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        It’s got a calculator.

                                 DARNELL
                        Thank you, baby.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You want to try it on?

                                 DARNELL
                        Later.

           EXT. GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY - LATE AFTERNOON

           Darnell winds his way up the trails above the observatory, 
           past DOG WALKERS, HIKERS and SIGHT-SEERS.

           EXT. TOP OF TRAILS - MAGIC HOUR

           Darnell stands in slacks and dusty loafers where day meets 
           night, looking out at Los Angeles, the snow covered 
           mountains, the ocean, the golden city twinkling.

           He stand above it all...celluoid heroes, titans of business, 
           legal and otherwise, all power, all authority, the shapers of 
           the world...and yet completely anonymous. 

           He looks over at a DOG peeing in the dust. 

           He reaches in his pocket and takes out the CIA CARD he was 
           handed at his medal ceremony. He studies it, thinking.

           INT. GARCIA HOME - SAME

           Bridget heading out with her purse, grabs her keys, she 
           notices the CASIO WATCH sitting on the counter. 

                                 JOHN JACKSON (PRE-LAP)
                        What we doing here, D?
           INT. DARNELL’S CAR - PARKED - PORT OF LA - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jackson eating another breakfast burrito, Countryman with his 
           signature binoculars. Garcia at the wheel.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Thais are small time. It’s like a 
                        hydra, the heads don’t talk to each 
                        other. You can’t build a case.

           Darnell ignores them, starts the car, following a BIG RIG. 

           EXT. GRAVEL YARD - FULLERTON - LATER

           TWO THAI DRIVERS kneel in the dirt with their hands on their 
           heads. Countryman holds a gun on them. 

           INT. TRUCK TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           Jackson and Darnell ripping through box after box, up to 
           their knees in bean sprouts.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Want to tell me what’s going on?

           Darnell rips open another box, more sprouts, tosses it aside. 
           Darnell rips open another box...bingo. He leans the box to 
           Jackson...inside are 10 BAGS OF HEROIN. 

           EXT. TRUCK TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell throws the bags of heroin at the Thai driver’s feet.

           INT. DEA INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Darnell sits opposite the Thai Driver, a RECORDER before him.

                                 THAI DRIVER
                        We don’t get names.

                                 DARNELL
                        I don’t want names.

           INTERCUT WITH: INT. DEA INTERROGATION OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

           Countryman and Jackson share a look, standing at the glass.

                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                        What’s he doing?
           Darnell starts the recorder.

                                 DARNELL
                        Where were you planning to unload?

           The Thai folds his arms, ash drooping on his cigarette.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Look, if it were 10 ki’s, it’d be 
                        worth you calling your lawyer. But 
                        we both know my boss isn’t gonna 
                        give a shit about 3 ki’s off the 
                        street. Just feed me something.

           The Thai Driver studies Darnell.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m trying to be agent of the 
                        month. You get a little party, a 
                        cake, it’s nice.

                                 THAI DRIVER
                        You fucking with me?

           Darnell just stares at him. A long, long beat.

                                 THAI DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        You took us for 10 ki’s! What the 
                        fuck you fucking talking about? 

           Darnell stops the recorder, gets up, turns to the 
           mirror...looking at himself...and directly at Jackson and 
           Countryman who are standing there, processing all this.

                                 DARNELL
                        All I’m asking is where you were 
                        unloading the 3 ki’s. We can plea 
                        you right out of this. No jail.

           The Thai Driver realizing. Darnell stares in the mirror, at 
           his colleagues. Then turns back, and starts the recorder.

                                 THAI DRIVER
                        The three ki’s were gonna be 
                        dropped off at 4th street bridge. 

                                 DARNELL
                        When?

                                 THAI DRIVER
                        I don’t know when. A guy calls. 

           Darnell stops the recorder, rewinds, starts it again.
                                 DARNELL
                        When?

                                 THAI DRIVER
                        11pm?

           Darnell stops the recorder, takes it, walks out.

                                 DARNELL
                        Keep your mouth shut.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        I’m just saying. Linda leaves her

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Well it ain’t petty no more.

           Jackson jots it down. Darnell staring out...thinking.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Was I upset they set me aside?

           TOOTIE REESE, the major LA distributor we saw Darnell bust 
           earlier, counts out bricks of cash. A KNOCK on the door.

                        I handled a lot of drugs and money.

           Jackson and Countryman carry a CRATE from Tootie Reese’s to 
           the car, Darnell at the wheel.

                                 DARNELL
                        Was the temptation there? Yes.

           Darnell drives, Jackson and Countryman riding with the crate.

           Garcia ranting into the phone-

                                 DARNELL
                        That doesn’t mean I did! The worst 
                        thing you can do about someone is 
                        assume the worst. A man with a 
                        record like mine? I believe I was 
                        entitled to the benefit of the 
                        doubt, Chuck. I saw you fucking 
                        quoted in the Times article on me. 
                        I embarrassed you? You don’t know 
                        what you’re talking about, you hard 
                        of hearing motherfucker! This isn’t 
                        the movies, this isn’t playacting, 
                        this isn’t fucking Delta Force. 
                        This is DEA. International drug 
                        conspiracy can’t even tell you

                        did everything for you. I never 
                        said one word, one word against

           He smashes the phone down, smashes it again and again.

           He looks out the glass booth, and sees a MAN eyeing him. He 
           looks across the street, ANOTHER SET OF EYES. Behind him, 
           ANOTHER SET OF EYES on him. 

           Darnell picks up his TWO BRIEFCASES, steps out of the booth.

           EXT. PARIS STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell turns a corner, more EYES on him. He scans a crowd of 
           FLÂNEURS. ZOOM HARD: On various eyes. He speeds up.

           EXT. PASSERELLE DEBILLY - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell crosses onto the foot bridge, sees EYES coming at 
           him, EYES behind him. A beat. He presses on.

           And tosses one of his briefcases into the air, it opens...

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But you can’t feel sorry for 
                        yourself. I learned that. 

           CASH goes flying and swirling in the wind. PEDESTRIANS go 
           mad, start grabbing at the cash. TIGHT ON: WILD EYES as they 
           go for it. Darnell’s eyes, as the whirling cash SLOWS DOWN.

           Mind Power kicking in. 

           Darnell exits the slow-motion chaos and jumps off the bridge!

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Just gotta stay one step ahead.

           WIDE SHOT: As he SWAN DIVES into the Seine. He surfaces, 
           looking up, no EYES after him as he floats past the EIFFEL. 

           INT. NANCY REAGAN’S BEL AIR HOME - DAY

           Bridget eyeing a PICTURE of the EIFFEL TOWER, Nancy and 
           Ronnie posing with MITTERAND in front of it. Opposite, the 
           live Nancy pours two cups of tea. It’s quiet. Tense.

                        Have you been to Paris? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Once.

                                 NANCY
                        The city is so photogenic don’t you 
                        think? 
                             (off Bridget’s look)
                        I’ve been reading up on you. You’re 
                        an up and coming photographer? I’d 
                        love to see your work.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I don’t know what you think I know, 
                        but you’re wasting your time. I 
                        don’t know where my husband is. 

                                 NANCY
                        Direct. You remind me of myself.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I’d prefer to think I’m nothing 
                        like you.

                        You can certainly be as rude as I 
                        can.

           Bridget surprised at this self-deprecating candor. Nancy 
           looks to the wall, and Bridget’s eyes follow to the Reagan’s 
           ARISTOCRATIC CREST...

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        It’s been in the Reagan family for 
                        400 years, that crest of arms.

           On it a bear, California Flag, horse, acting mask, the words-

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        “Acta Non Verba.” Deeds Not Words. 
                        My husband and I believe in that 
                        very dearly. That words really 
                        can’t be counted upon at all. 

           Nancy eyes Bridget, then Bridget’s Gold Rolex President.

                        For instance, the time piece on 
                        your wrist. It tells more than 
                        time. You claiming that you know 
                        nothing...the words ring hollow.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Now I’m not asking for information 
                        on your husband’s crimes. Those 
                        words don’t mean much to me. I’m 
                        just asking for one simple deed. 
                        Help us. Give us a chance to bring 
                        him in. Alive.

           Nancy watching the threat land. Bridget clears her throat.

                        Jelly bean?

           Nancy offers Bridget the bowl. Bridget doesn’t move.

                        I don’t like them either. Ronnie 
                        adores them. I put up with them 
                        because I’ve always found them 
                        festive. So colorful. Ronnie and I, 
                        we always found our ways to the 
                        same things for different reasons.
                             (beat)
                        You see, you can have your own 
                        reasons for helping us. Your family-

                                 BRIDGET
                        Until you called me...I didn’t even 
                        know he was still alive.

                                 NANCY
                        What about your son? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Leave my son out of this. 

           Nancy looks to her AIDE.

                                 NANCY
                        Can you excuse us, please?

           The Aide nods, stepping out, closing the door behind him. 

           Nancy gets up, moves across to Bridget, sitting on the edge 
           of the sofa looking down at her. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Do you not want Daniel to see his 
                        father again?

                                 BRIDGET
                        I don’t respond well to threats.
                                 NANCY
                        You clearly prefer to be bought. 
                        But the United States doesn’t 
                        negotiate with amateur 
                        photographers.

           Bridget gets up, shaking her head at the insult. She takes 
           her tea cup and sets it beside another picture of Ronald.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You know I’ve done some reading on 
                        you. I didn’t realize you were 
                        adopted. Your father, Mr. Robbins, 
                        abandoned the family.

           Nancy eyes her.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        And you want to make an orphan of 
                        my child? You want to know where my 
                        husband is, call your astrologer, 
                        because I am not afraid of you.

                                 NANCY
                        Me? You don’t need to be afraid of 
                        me. Be afraid of the men kicking 
                        down your door in the middle of the 
                        night. To take you and your son, 
                        after they’ve found you’ve both 
                        been helping your husband. 

           Nancy sips her tea.

                        They’ll lock up your brother, your

                        fucking dog will be implicated. 

           OFF Bridget’s look.

                        Submarines? What we doing about it?

                                 AL DIVETCO
                        It’s in strategy right now.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        Wire room got a lead on some 
                        Medellin product coming in via 
                        Monterrey. We’ll get it over to 
                        you. Garcia. Anything on Vermelho?

                                 DARNELL
                        Brazil’s been quiet.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        See your team hit the Thais?

           Darnell shares a look with Jackson and Countryman.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER (CONT’D)
                        Three ki’s and a no-show dropoff? 
                        What the hell you doing?

                                 DARNELL
                        Well, sir. I-

           Darnell struggling...and on cue: he eyes Messner as he bites 
           into a sandwich in SLOW MOTION...

           Mind Power kicking in.

           Darnell gets up, walks out, closes the door. 

           CUT back to normal speed as Franklin tears off the bite, 
           chewing, he looks around, confused.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                             (mouthful)
                        Where the fuck did Garcia go?

           INT. DEA OFFICE - LATER

           Darnell approaches Jackson and Countryman exiting the 
           meeting, Al Divetco passing, mimes jacking off.

                                 AL DIVETCO
                        Three ki’s. Nice job.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        When you fucking leave anyway?
                                 AL DIVETCO
                        Suck my DC-bound dick, Jackson.

           Divetco walking off. Darnell annoyed.

                                 DARNELL
                        We gotta talk. Somewhere quiet.

           EXT. ROOF TOP - DEA HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           The top of LA’s skyline, the snow covered mountains, ocean. 
           It’s spectacular, and LOUD AS SHIT. WIND, CHOPPERS, Darnell 
           is shouting, but it’s too garbled to understand.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        What?! I can’t hear up here!

           Darnell shakes his head, looking out over the city.

           INT. CLIFTON’S CAFETERIA - DOWNTOWN LA - LATER

           Darnell and his guys sit in a quiet booth in the iconic and 
           bizarre forest-themed cafeteria. Countryman picks at a pie.

                                 DARNELL
                        Angela.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Chick I’m fucking in the wire room?

           Darnell nods. Jackson starting to put it together.

                                 DARNELL
                        She compiles all the leads...all 
                        the tips, pushes them to Messner.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        So we hit before there’s any record 
                        of us knowing about it?

           Jackson smiles, getting it.

                                 JOHN JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take a little look-see.

                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                             (mumbling)
                        Take a little look-see.

           Pre-lap SOUNDS OF SEX...
           INT. WIRE OFFICE - DEA HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           John Jackson gives it to ANGELA, the wire officer, doggy-
           style, her hair hanging down like a curtain, obscuring her 
           view of the room, as she braces herself against her desk.

           Jackson thrusts as he reaches for a FILE marked INCOMING 
           LEADS. He flips it open, reading it above her naked back.

                                 ANGELA
                        Oh god, baby. Yes. Yes.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                             (rote fucking as he reads)
                        Oh yeah. Damn baby. 

           Angela unaware, Jackson SPANKS her with one hand, holding the 
           file in the other, reading on.

           Huey Lewis’s I WANT A NEW DRUG carries us into the new game-

           EXT. CALIFORNIA CACTUS CENTER - DAY

           CACTUS FARMERS stand with their hands up. 

           Darnell and Jackson cut open a bag of soil, COCAINE pours.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        We were operating as drug dealers. 
                        That doesn’t mean we were dealers.

           SCREEN SPLITS INTO THREE PANELS: Darnell and Jackson question 
           the farmers while Countryman puts a BAG OF SOIL in his trunk.

           EXT. RUNDOWN HOME - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Tootie Reese again answers the door for Garcia and his crew.

           INT. KARATE DOJO - DAY

           Bridget watches Daniel do a YELLOW BELT EXAM with other BOYS, 
           looks around, surrounded by all DADS. Checks her CASIO WATCH.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman wait as TRAVELERS retrieve 
           their bags from under the bus. 

           They stop a GUY IN A SUIT, out of place in the Greyhound 
           world, help him with his bags -- FOUR HAND ROLLERS.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Few know this, but 50% of all 
                        busts, involve selling drugs.

           SCREEN SPLITS INTO THREE PANELS: Three rollers are loaded 
           into a car with the Suit. Jackson walks off with the fourth.

           INT. RUNDOWN HOME - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Tootie Reese packs another trunk full of cash as Darnell, 
           Jackson and Countryman look on.

           INT. KARATE DOJO - DAY

           Bridget watches Daniel do a GREEN BELT EXAM, alone.

           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS - DRUG LOCKER - DAY

           Darnell and Jackson look-out as Countryman uses a coat hanger 
           to fish BAGS OF COKE out of the DEA’s own drug deposit vault.

           INT. GARCIA HOME - DAY

           Bridget framing and organizing some prints of her photography-

           EXT. GARCIA HOME - NIGHT

           Darnell parks in a brand new Ferarri beside Bridget’s mini-
           van. He gets out, looks at the mini-van.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It gets confusing...

           EXT. GARCIA HOME - DAY

           Bridget walks outside to a Lotus, wrapped up in a bow. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HOME - NIGHT

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman cut open a leather couch, as 
           the OWNER freaks out. Jackson tosses out bags of cocaine. 

                                 DARNELL
                        ...what’s real and what’s not...

           SCREEN SPLITS INTO THREE PANELS: Darnell looks to the Owner, 
           then notes his ELECTRIC GUITAR.
           INT. BENIHANA - NIGHT

           Daniel blows out his birthday candles in front of boys in 
           karate gis and RED BELTS. CHEFS toss rice cups in the bg with 
           derring do. Bridget looks at her watch.

           INT. BENIHANA - LATER

           Darnell walks in with the dealer’s Electric Guitar in a bow. 
           The restaurant is EMPTY. He looks around, the chefs all 
           looking at him, trying not to be embarrassed for him. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        ...what was true and what wasn’t.

           EXT. BENIHANA - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell starts SMASHING the electric guitar on the pavement. 

           SCREEN SPLITS AND SHATTERS AWAY as the GUITAR SOLO of I WANT 
           A NEW DRUG goes haywire, cutting out.

           EXT. ART GALLERY - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           A Ferarri screeches up to the valet, Darnell gets out.

           INT. ART GALLERY - LOS ANGELES - CONTINUOUS

           A CROWD of elegantly dressed viewers peruse Bridget’s prints 
           and photographs hung throughout the space.

           Darnell spots his wife, in a gown, chatting with PROSPECTIVE 
           BUYERS. She catches his eye, looks at her watch, looks away.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Darnell looking at her pictures, studying several marked with 
           RED DOTS. He looks to his wife in another crowd. 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Darnell looking at a picture of himself, no red dot. Bridget 
           comes up to him. He continues to stare at his own image.

                                 DARNELL
                        How much is this one?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Nice to see you too.
                                 DARNELL
                        I didn’t want to interrupt.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You’re two hours late. I had to get 
                        an extra hand just to set up.

                                 DARNELL
                        I shoulda called. I’m sorry.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You want to tell me what the hell’s  
                        going on?

                                 DARNELL
                        You know what I do for a living. 
                        It’s not 9 to 5. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Yeah, it’s 24 hours a day. And what 
                        are you doing? You know what you’re 
                        doing?

                                 DARNELL
                        I know what I’m doing.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You sure about that? 

                                 DARNELL
                        What do you mean?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Where’s all the money coming from?

           Darnell walks her into the corner away from the crowd. He 
           looks around, leans in close to his wife, sotto.

                                 DARNELL
                        Gold.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Gold?!

                                 DARNELL
                        Jesus, keep your voice down. I’ve 
                        been moving it. On the side. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Legally?

                                 DARNELL
                        The tariff’s are the real crime. 
                                 BRIDGET
                        Is it legal?

                                 DARNELL
                        Not in a legal sense, no.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Jesus, Nell.

           A CATERER approaches with a tray of flutes-

                                 CATERER
                        Champagne?

                                 DARNELL
                        Fuck off.

           The Caterer leaves in a hurry.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Nice. 

                                 DARNELL
                        Can we not talk about this here?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh what am I embarrassing you? At 
                        my opening?! You’re embarrassing me 
                        showing up looking like a drug 
                        dealer.

           A GROUP OF TUXEDOES look over.

                                 DARNELL
                        Keep your voice down. You really 
                        want to make a scene? Over what 
                        paid for your new car? For Daniel’s 
                        school? That watch? You want to 
                        give it back? 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Sure, give it back, I never asked 
                        for any of that.

                                 DARNELL
                        Well you seem to have been enjoying 
                        it. You just grew a conscience 
                        overnight?

           Bridget gives him a severe look.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean that. I’m sorry. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Bridge, it’s all relative. You 
                        think the people in here didn’t cut 
                        a few corners? Trickle-down my ass. 
                        You gotta take it if you want it. 

           A beat.

                                 BRIDGET
                        You have to promise me you’ll never 
                        put this family in jeopardy.

                                 DARNELL
                        There’s guys out there selling bear 
                        paws, bladders to Asian guys who 
                        can’t get it up. That’s evil, 
                        that’s wrong, what I’m doing, it’s 
                        harmless, alright. I promise.

           Darnell takes her hand, Bridget brushes it off.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Let’s just get back to the party.

           The Kinks’ LIVING ON A THIN LINE traces us down...

           INT. AIRPLANE - FIRST CLASS - DAY - 1985

           ...A WHITE LINE OF COCAINE...disappearing up John Jackson’s 
           nose from his airplane tray. An OLD TRAVELER staring.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I never put Bridget and Daniel in 
                        harm’s way. 

           EXT. MIAMI - NIGHT - 1985

           A party on South Beach. Darnell showing MIAMI DEALERS seized 
           LA PRODUCT as Jackson pounds a bottle of tequila.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Ever. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - FIRST CLASS - DAY - 1985

           John Jackson looks sick as he puts an ALKA-SELTZER into his 
           water. It fizzes, bubbles. He sips it, and then pours the 
           rest over his head. A STEWARDESS watching, baffled.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Everything I did was for them.

                                                                CUT TO:

                    Washington DC. July 1988. (Seven Months On The Run)

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NANCY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1988

           Nancy sits opposite her infamous ASTROLOGER, JOAN QUIGLEY, a 
           chart of the stars between them, and Darnell’s PHOTO.

                                 NANCY
                        Where is he, Joan? 

           Quigley starts to move a CRYSTAL across the constellations.

           EXT. LONG ISLAND CITY - NIGHT - 1985

           Darnell and his guys hand over more LA PRODUCT, taking 
           PAYLOADS OF CASH as silhouettes against the New York Skyline.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NANCY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1988

           TIGHT ON: The Astrologer’s crystal, guided by long, painted 
           fingernails, traverses the STARS.

                                 JOAN QUIGLEY 
                        His energy. It’s very strong.

           EXT. AIRPLANE - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT - 1985

           Darnell looks to the STARS out his window.

           EXT. DETROIT - DAY - 1985

           Darnell and his guys flash DEA badges as they enter a DETROIT 
           DEA DRUG VAULT. And exit with duffles. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NANCY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1988

           Nancy’s EYES, staring at the stars laid out before her.  

                                 JOAN QUIGLEY
                        Yes. I can feel him.

           PUSH IN: On those stars, and...
           PULL OUT: Into the REAL UNIVERSE. Passing PLANETS. 

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                             (whispers)
                        Where?

           GAS NEBULAS. GALAXIES SPINNING. NURSERIES OF STELLAR DUST.

           AND IN: On one of those bright, TWINKLING NEW BORN STARS...

                                                              MATCH TO:

           Darnell’s TWINKLING EYE as he steps outside into sunshine...

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT - DAY

           Darnell and his guys stepping off a plane in Brazil.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I turned a major Vermelho captain.

           EXT. BLACK CAR - MOVING - RIO - LATER

           The car climbs its way up the favelas.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Major cartel player, a top dog, 
                        brought him to the DEA side as an 
                        informant. That’s how good my 
                        undercover work was.

           EXT. HIGH FAVELAS - RIO - LATER

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman get out of the car, and eye a 
           couple of ARMED GUARDS outside a rundown building. Head in.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        And they want to say I was working 
                        with him. I was doing my job!

           INT. JOÃO SOSA’S OFFICE - LATER

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman sit opposite João Sosa, the 
           Vermelho Drug Captain (we met earlier), smoking a cigar.

                                 JOÃO SOSA
                        I’m taking a lot of risk here.

           Darnell holds João’s eyes.
                                 DARNELL
                        We’re protecting you. 

           Darnell looks to Jackson.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        You’re gonna have to give us some 
                        info on the Vermelhos. That’s gonna 
                        be necessary. Make this look right.

                                 JOÃO SOSA
                        It’s gonna be a thirty percent cut.

           Darnell stiffens.

                                 JOÃO SOSA (CONT’D)
                        Your problem isn’t going to be the 
                        30 percent. It’s gonna be what to 
                        do with all the fucking dinheiro. 

           João offers his hand. A beat. Darnell takes it.

                                 JOÃO SOSA (CONT’D)
                        Alright then, bacalhau.

           INT. FEDERAL RESERVE BASEMENT - COUNTING ROOM - LATER

           A GIANT MONEY COUNTING MACHINE, size of a mini-van, sorting 
           cash, as Jackson dumps duffles of bills into the feed.

                                 FEDERAL RESERVE GUARD
                        You seize all that today? Wow. 

           Darnell nods, looks to the unwitting Guard.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Would I have brought my own drug 
                        money into the Federal Reserve?

           INT. CLIFTON’S CAFETERIA - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

           Darnell sits across a booth from the Man in the Black Suit 
           who gave him the CIA Card. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        They would tell you so. But there 
                        was so much I was doing. I can’t 
                        even tell you about all of it. 

           Darnell slides the guy a folder.
           EXT. NEW CONSTRUCTION MANSION - PALOS VERDES - DAY

           MOVERS take things into the home, Darnell watching with his 
           family. He looks to Bridget, proud. She eyes him, concerned.

                                 DARNELL
                        Chuck lives in Palos Verdes.

           Bridget looks to Darnell, puts a hand on Daniel’s head.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Come on, let’s choose you a room.

           INT. THE GARCIA MANSION - DINING ROOM - LATER

           The table set with food. Darnell picks up the potatoes, 
           serving himself. Bridget opposite. Daniel comes to the 
           table...he has a BLACK EYE.

                                 DARNELL
                        What happened to your face?

           Daniel doesn’t say anything.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I asked you a question.

                                 BRIDGET
                        He got in a fight.

                                 DARNELL
                        What? Is that true?

           Daniel shrugs.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        That’s how you’re using the karate 
                        lessons I’m paying for? What would 
                        your sensei say?

                                 DANIEL
                        Maybe if you meet him, you could 
                        ask.

                                 DARNELL
                        What did you say?

                                 DANIEL
                        Can I be excused?

                                 DARNELL
                        We’re having a family dinner here. 
                                 DANIEL
                        So what?

                                 BRIDGET
                        We haven’t had a family dinner in 
                        two months.

                                 DARNELL
                        I know. Can we have one now?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Honey, why don’t you just have 
                        something to eat?

                                 DANIEL
                        Not hungry.

                                 DARNELL
                        Don’t talk to your mother that way.

                                 DANIEL
                        Don’t tell me how to talk to mom.

           Darnell puts a cut of lamb on his own plate, tense. 

                                 DARNELL
                        You know, I’m sorry I’ve had to be 
                        away, but I’m working hard for this 
                        family. And I may not be home for 
                        dinner every night, but I’ll tell 
                        you what-

           Darnell cuts into the meat hard, too hard, almost violently, 
           his silverware scratching on the plate.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I can never remember a single 
                        family dinner with my dad. Not one. 
                        And you think we lived in a house 
                        like this? That I went to a school 
                        like yours?

                                 BRIDGET
                        D-

                                 DARNELL
                        No. You know where I lived, me and 
                        my sister? We didn’t sleep against 
                        the window, cause it wasn’t safe. 
                        That’s where we lived.

                                 BRIDGET
                        That’s enough.
                                 DARNELL
                        He’s old enough to hear this. I was 
                        shot, Daniel. 

           Darnell stands, lifts up his shirt, turning, showing the 
           AWFUL GUNSHOT SCAR we glimpsed earlier on his back.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I got shot, about your age, just 
                        lying in my bed dreaming of a life 
                        like yours, some gang-bangers drove 
                        by, I got fucking shot! They cut me 
                        open. Took half my liver out. I was 
                        in the hospital a month.

           Daniel tears up.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I said that’s enough.

           Daniel gets up, and leaves. Bridget looks to Darnell, he 
           can’t hold her gaze. She gets up, goes to comfort her son. 
           Darnell left with the bounty of his empty table.

           INT. PARIS CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - IMMIGRATION - DAY

           Darnell and Jackson walking through, Countryman following, 
           looking bulky.

           INT. PARIS HOTEL SUITE - LATER

           Jackson rips TAPED CASH off Countryman’s body.

           INT. BANK SCWEIZ - MILAN, ITALY - LATER

           Darnell, in a suit, Jackson and Countryman in track suits, 
           opposite a SWISS-ITALIAN BANKER, the name “FULVIO PELLI” on a 
           gold plate on his desk, exchanging CASH for SOLID GOLD.

           INT. PARIS BANK - LATER

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman sit opposite a FRENCH BANKER, 
           briefcases of GOLD on the table. The Banker shaking his head.

                                 DARNELL
                        We’re just asking you to take the 
                        deposit.
                                 FRENCH BANKER
                        No offense, but I don’t think you 
                        gentlemen have the pedigree to meet 
                        our bank’s standards.  

           Countryman grabs one of the bankers GOLD PENS from his pen-
           set, and JABS it through the Banker’s hand. He SCREAMS.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        None taken.

           INT. TRAIN - MOVING - ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - LATER

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman in a private coach. Darnell 
           eyeing Countryman-

                                 DARNELL
                        This is Europe. You don’t just jam 
                        a pen into a guy’s hand like a 
                        fucking animal. You understand me?

           Wayne looks out the window, ignoring him.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Guy took the gold, give him a break-

                                 DARNELL
                        That’s not the point. Look how 
                        you’re dressed. We don’t wear 
                        tracksuits. We’re legitimate 
                        businessmen.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Sorry I missed the memo.

           Darnell annoyed, he gets up, leaves the train car.

           INT. MILAN AIRPORT - LATER

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman waiting for their flight back 
           to LA. Jackson eyeing a PENTHOUSE, Countryman looking at an 
           ARCHIE COMIC BOOK. Darnell has the FINANCIAL TIMES open, he 
           lowers the paper, and spots...

           NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY at an espresso bar. 

                                 DARNELL
                        Give me a minute.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:
           Darnell puts his GOLD ROLEX PRESIDENT next to an espresso. 
           Hunter Ray looks up to Darnell, sips his espresso. A beat of 
           pregnant silence.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I thought a lot about what you 
                        said. You were right. It is all 
                        relative. 
                             (smiles confidently)
                        And the men who understand that 
                        wear the gold. I’m building a name 
                        for myself. You’re probably aware 
                        of my numbers. 

           Hunter Ray looks to Darnell.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        If you want in, say the word. 
                        Consider it a token of gratitude.

                                 NICHOLAS HUNTER RAY
                             (genuinely confused)
                        I honestly have no idea who you 
                        are, or what you think you owe me, 
                        but nice watch.  

           Hunter Ray stands, finishes his espresso, and walks off. 
           Darnell’s face falls, he swallows, looks down. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DARNELL’S SUBURBAN - MOVING - DAY

           Darnell stares blankly at the wheel, lost in his head. 
           Bridget beside him. Daniel in the back. It’s silent.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Daniel’s got his first black belt 
                        competition next week. 

           Darnell blinks, sun glaring off the cars. Darnell looks to 
           Daniel in the rearview, who’s checked out.

                                 DARNELL
                        When did you make your black belt?

           Daniel doesn’t respond. He keeps driving, fuming.

           Darnell pulls up to a RED LIGHT, knuckles white on the wheel. 
           He takes a breath, looks over, and in the CAR BESIDE them...a 
           FATHER is being pestered by his SMALL CHILD.

           The Father snaps, and SLAPS his child. 
           EXT. DARNELL’S SUBURBAN - STOP LIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Darnell is out of the car, his door hanging open. 

           The Father opens his window, and Darnell reaches in, and 
           SMASHES the guy in the face.

           He grabs him, and PUNCHES HIM OVER AND OVER. Cars HONKING. 
           Darnell hears nothing, hits the guy again, bloodying his face-

                                 DARNELL
                        You want to beat on someone?!

           Darnell winds up for another shot...

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        DAD!

           Darnell stops, looks at his bloody hands. HORNS blasting. 
           Bridget SCREAMING. 

           He looks up at his son...Daniel staring from the back seat of 
           their suburban at his father, terrified.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Milan. August 1988. (8 Months On The Run)

           EXT. BANK SCHWEIZ - MILAN, ITALY - LATER

           Fulvio Pelli, the elder Swiss-Italian Banker, exits the bank. 
           Darnell gets up, following him through Milan’s streets.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Nothing’s what it seems alright!? 
                        These accusations are just a ruse.

           INT. PELLI’S MILAN TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Darnell pacing opposite Fulvio, in his opulent home office.

                                 DARNELL 
                        I had to be burnt with the DEA. 
                        This is deep cover. Deepest. I’m 
                        trying to fight the corruption 
                        within. Vermelho’s were onto me. 

                                 FULVIO PELLI
                        I don’t understand.
                                 DARNELL
                        I wasn’t gonna get top syndicate 
                        access unless they believed the DEA 
                        wanted me as bad as they wanted 
                        them. I have to be on the run to 
                        look guilty. Cases have to be built 
                        against me. The world has to see me 
                        as a bad guy. I’m a good guy. I’m 
                        one of the good ones. You have to 
                        trust me. I need you to trust me.

                                 FULVIO PELLI
                        I have received phone calls from 
                        the attorney general-

                                 DARNELL
                        Attorney G’s got no idea. Nobody 
                        does. Except the absolute top. This 
                        is need to know. TOP level secrecy. 
                        The CIA runs the DEA. Look it up. 
                        That level. President, Head of the 
                        FBI, CIA Director. I answer to the 
                        CIA now. I’ve been working all 
                        sides. Things I can’t even tell you 
                        about. I shouldn’t even be telling 
                        you this. You could be in danger.

                                 FULVIO PELLI
                        You’re saying you didn’t do it?

                                 DARNELL
                        No, Fulvio! Of course not. It’s all 
                        just a double down. I’m doubling 
                        down here. It’s a double down.

           OFF Pelli’s overwhelmed look.

           INT. DARNELL’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Darnell opens a case, looking at GOLD BARS, as PORTERS from 
           Bank Schweiz wheel in trunks upon trunks of cash and gold.

           EXT. LAX - SUNSET

           An Air France jet landing back in Los Angeles.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        There are no drugs. There were no 
                        drugs. I’ve never been found with 
                        drugs. No powder on the table. It’s 
                        the money. They say the money makes 
                        me guilty. 
           EXT. GARCIA MANSION - 1986

           Darnell pulls up in his Ferarri, gets out.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I can explain where every dime of 
                        it came from. Every asset. 

           Darnell walks up his long front yard, enters his home.

           INT. GARCIA MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell stands in the window looking at the sun setting over 
           the sea.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I have explained. They look at a 
                        guy like me, from the Bronx, hard 
                        part of LA, not lily white, and 
                        they say you’ve got such and such 
                        dollars, in such and such places. 
                        Must have come from drugs. 

           Bridget joins him, looking out at the gorgeous colors.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        There are other ways a resourceful 
                        man can make money. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        How long you gonna lie to me?

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m not lying, Bridge.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I did the math on your “gold.” You 
                        get 5% every troy ounce that goes 
                        through? That’s 22 bucks an ounce. 
                        What’d this house cost? 2,000,000? 
                        That’s 90,000 ounces. You telling 
                        me, you moved almost 6,000 pounds 
                        of gold, by hand, on Continental?

           INT. CONTINENTAL 747 - DAY

           Darnell grabs a DUFFLE from overhead, struggles with it. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I had some help.

           THREE GORGEOUS WOMEN also struggle with BIG CARRY-ONS.
           INT. CUSTOMS - LAX - LATER

           Darnell pushes a luggage cart with the duffle on it. His 
           Gorgeous PORTERS in tow.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It’s 20 trips. 300 pounds each. 

           A wheel on the cart BREAKS under the weight of the duffle. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It’s possible. 

           Darnell drags the broken cart to a side door, his Babe 
           Porters behind him. He flashes his badge at a SECURITY GUARD 
           THERE, who nods, staring at his Porters’ asses. They exit 
           looking back at the CUSTOMS LINE.

           EXT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY 

           Darnell and the Women bring the bags to a waiting LIMO.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I told you, a guy I met, Swiss guy, 
                        in the jewelry district. 

           INT. THE GARCIA MANSION - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bridget walks away from her husband.

                                 DARNELL
                        He didn’t like paying tariffs, 8 
                        points on every troy ounce. Decided 
                        to pay me 5 instead. It adds up.

           Darnell follows.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying I’m a saint, but-

                                 BRIDGET
                        And Jackson? Wayne? The gold 
                        business put them in those homes?

                                 DARNELL
                        I told you about Jackson’s arcades. 
           EXT. JACKSON ARCADES - ALLEY - DAY

           The blue light of PAC-MAN flashes inside, ‘80s video game 
           music drifting out to the back, where Countryman shovels 
           QUARTERS into the back of a pick-up truck.

                                 BRIDGET (V.O.)
                        A million dollars in quarters?

                                 DARNELL
                        You see how Daniel plays his games. 
                        It’s not my business. I don’t know. 

           EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - LATER

           A truck loaded with quarters moves slowly down the street, 
           its bumper DRAGGING and SPARKING under the insane weight.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I know they got so many they almost 
                        broke Wayne’s truck. 

           INT. THE GARCIA MANSION - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bridget turns to face her husband.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I can’t do it anymore. I’m done 
                        pretending.

                                 DARNELL
                        Pretending what?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Stop acting. You’re acting.

           Bridget searches her husband’s face, painfully frustrated.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        What are we to you? Do you just 
                        like the idea of us, the idea of 
                        having a family? Are you just 
                        adding us to your list? Martial 
                        Arts hero. Movie star. Decorated 
                        Agent. Big time gold importer. 
                        Family man. 

                                 DARNELL
                        What are you talking about?
                                 BRIDGET
                        I don’t know who you are anymore. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m not sure I ever did. 

                                 DARNELL
                        You think I need this? You think I 
                        need this right now?!

           Darnell kicks a GOLD FAT BUDDHA off a side-table, it flies, 
           shattering violently.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Putting my life on the line, not 
                        seeing my family, spending all my 
                        time with scumbags. I’m trying to 
                        do better than what I had. My 
                        father left me with nothing. I’m 
                        trying to make something out of my 
                        life. You want to know who I am? 
                        That’s who I am. 

           Bridget grabs his face, holding him. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        Just tell me the truth.

           A long beat.

                                 DARNELL
                        I have an oath to uphold. I can’t 
                        tell you everything. I’m a good 
                        man. You have to trust me. You have 
                        to believe in me. I’m not lying. 

           She lets his face go. A beat.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Get out.

           Darnell walks past her, heads upstairs, calling-

                                 DARNELL
                        Daniel? 
                             (no response)
                        Daniel!

           Darnell goes into Daniel’s room, bed empty.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Where’s my son?!

           Darnell steps out on the upstairs landing, down at Bridget.
                                 BRIDGET
                        He’s not here.

                                 DARNELL
                        Where is he?

                                 BRIDGET
                        I didn’t want him to see this.

           Darnell moves down the stairs, right into Bridget’s face.

                                 DARNELL
                        You try to fucking take my son away 
                        from me?! Where’s Daniel?!

           Bridget just stares back at him, not intimidated. 

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’M NOT A LIAR, GODDAMNIT! 

           Bridget turns from him, goes to the door, opens it. Darnell 
           looks at her a beat, and walks out into the night.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A HELICOPTER lands on the street, blowing a Ferarri door shut 
           at the valet. Jackson and Countryman get out of it.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I’m the first to admit, I lost 
                        track of priorities.  

           They walk past the BOUNCER, into the club. Darnell gets out 
           of the chopper, morose.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Darnell winds the crown on his Rolex, rolling the time and 
           day back. He looks out the window at the dark sky. 

           INT. CLIFTON’S CAFETERIA - DOWNTOWN LA - DAY

           Darnell stares at his coffee, dour. Jackson and Countryman 
           picking at desserts.

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m sick of this.

           A beat. Wayne Countryman staring out...
                                 WAYNE COUNTRYMAN
                        I miss the seasons too. It’s like 
                        time’s not even passing. I 
                        remember, in Connecticut. The fall 
                        was my favorite. Always the Fall. 
                        The leaves were so beautiful. Red, 
                        and orange. The leaves changed. And 
                        it smelled like smoke. It was 
                        always so beautiful before the 
                        winter, and the real bad times. And 
                        in Spring, you knew the bad times 
                        were going to be over. For a while.

           Darnell and Jackson stare at Countryman.

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m not talking about the fucking 
                        seasons! I’m talking about being 
                        small time. Nickle and dime.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        You call 20 mil nickle and dime? 
                        What does your highness require?

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m not talking about the money.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        The fuck are you talking about?

                                 DARNELL
                        The money make you happy?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Makes me pretty fucking happy.

                                 DARNELL
                        I’m talking about...being on top. 
                        Letting the world know who we are. 

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Don’t we want no one to know?

                                 DARNELL
                        Show we own this game. Something 
                        they’ll never forget. That’s what 
                        I’m talking about. That’s what I’ve 
                        always been talking about.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        I’ll talk to Angela.

           Pre-lap SEX NOISES.
           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           A PASSIONATE HAND hits the closed blinds of the wire office.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        As far as I know, Jackson found out 
                        about the stash house from Angela. 

           INT. CLIFTON’S CAFETERIA - DOWNTOWN LA - LATER

           Jackson lays it out for the guys, a drawing on a legal pad of 
           a HOUSE in Pasadena.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        This is how they place me at the so-
                        called “Big Rip.“ The grand charge 
                        they want to hang on me. The coup 
                        de grace.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Columbian Stash House. Miami Office 
                        guesses much as 200 million in coke-

                                 DARNELL
                        What does LA know?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        That’s about it.

                                 DARNELL
                        Plan to hit it?

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Just under surveillance.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        They would have you believe that I 
                        was stupid enough to hit a stash 
                        house the DEA knew about, and had 
                        under surveillance.

                                 DARNELL
                        You got the surveillance schedules?

           Jackson lays out the SCHEDULES. 

           EXT. CRAFTSMAN HOUSE - PASADENA - NIGHT

           Darnell, Jackson and Countryman sit in a dark car, eyeing the 
           craftsman home the Columbians are stashing their drugs in 
           behind bucolic high hedges.
           They watch as ANOTHER DARK CAR across the street starts up, 
           and pulls off.

                                 JOHN JACKSON (O.S.)
                        That’s the 2:30 shift. 

           INT. JACKSON’S DARK CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jackson looks from the surveillance schedule to Darnell. 

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        We got 30 minutes.

           Countryman nods. They get out of the vehicle.

           EXT. CRAFTSMAN HOUSE - PASADENA - NIGHT

           Jackson, Darnell and Countryman cross the dark suburban 
           street, looking around.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Problem with putting me there. At 
                        this “Big Rip.” Is that no one can 
                        agree on the details. Jackson 
                        remembers it as a clear night.

           John Jackson looks up at a BIG FULL MOON.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But the National Meteorologist that 
                        testified remembers the night of 
                        November 7th, 1987 as one of the 
                        rainiest in Los Angeles history. 

           Suddenly, THUNDER, it starts to POUR on the guys.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        It just poured.

           EXT. CRAFTSMAN HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER

           Jackson, Countryman and Darnell open the front gate, SOAKING 
           WET, but it’s no longer raining, everything else dry. 

           They open the gate to the front yard, standing between 10 
           foot high hedges.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Unguarded Countryman said. 

           The front yard is empty. No guards.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Full of guards per Jackson.

           Darnell spots a GUARD emerging, in SLOW MOTION, SOUND GOES 
           OUT as Mind Power kicks in...

           FOUR MORE GUARDS emerge from the covered porch, FIRING slowly-

           Jackson dives slow-motion behind a bird bath, rolling, FIRING 
           up at the guards. Countryman draws his pistol, SHOOTING TWO 
           OF THEM, then dives the other way. 

           Darnell just standing there, a witness to the carnage.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        DEA’d have you believe it was World 
                        War Three that night.

           A COLUMBIAN GUARD lifts an RPG to his shoulder, fires across 
           the lawn, and a CORNER OF HEDGE EXPLODES, lighting up the 
           street. Jackson rises with a MACHINE GUN, FIRING.

           Countryman UNLOADS DOUBLE UZIS in slow-mo, dropping the 
           guards, who fall off the porch, SPLASHING into FOUNTAINS that 
           weren’t there moments before.

           Darnell still just standing, as the ruble and flames and 
           smoke whirl around him.

           CUT back to normal speed as Jackson and Countryman nod to 
           Garcia, start to the house, up the porch, BODIES EVERYWHERE.

           INT. CRAFTSMAN HOUSE - PASADENA - CONTINUOUS

           Jackson and Countryman whirl in, weapons ready, Darnell 
           following, unarmed.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        And the drugs? Some say there were 
                        100 kilos there. 200.

           A STACK OF COKE BRICKS sits in the grand front hall.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)

           The BLOCK OF COKE grows in size, reaching to the ceiling.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        None at all? 

           The DRUGS disappear.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        We were beaten to it. They can’t 
                        even agree on whether the drugs 
                        were there or not that-

           A GROAN interrupts the VO. Jackson, Countryman and Darnell 
           share a look, another GROAN from the living room to the right-

           They move to it slowly, weapons ready, and look down on...

           A WOUNDED GUARD...he’s caught one in the stomach, bleeding. 

                                 WOUNDED GUARD
                        Help...Help me please. I’m 
                        undercover. 

                                 DARNELL
                        What?

                                 WOUNDED GUARD
                        I’m LAPD. 

                                 DARNELL
                        What?

                                 WOUNDED GUARD
                        Under...cover-

           Jackson and Countryman share a look. Darnell goes white.

                                 WOUNDED GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let me die. Please don’t-

           Darnell walks out of the room, back to a ROOM FULL OF DRUGS 
           again. His hand on his head. He vomits. Jackson follows in.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        What the fuck?! 

           Jackson pacing. 

                                 JOHN JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t in the fucking report. 
                        DEA didn’t know about him. 

           Darnell wipes his mouth.

                                 DARNELL
                        We gotta...call an ambulance. 

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        We can’t call no ambulance.
                                 DARNELL
                        We can’t let him die.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Guy’s gonna die anyhow. He’s shot 
                        in the gut.

                                 DARNELL
                        You don’t know that.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        I’m not fucking going down.

                                 DARNELL
                        We’re going fucking down! We don’t 
                        know anything anymore, and we’re 
                        going down!

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        I AM NOT GOING FUCKING DOWN FOR 
                        SOME LAPD SON OF A BITCH WHO’S 
                        ALREADY GUT SHOT.

                                 DARNELL
                        WE’RE GOING FUCKING DOWN!

           BAM! A gun shot behind them rattles them both. 

           They turn, and see Countryman standing over the LAPD guy, his 
           gun smoking, a pool of blood growing on the floor.

           Darnell’s face falls. 

           He charges Countryman, TACKLES HIM, starts beating him.

           Jackson tries to grab Darnell off, and Garcia KICKS him, goes 
           back to strangling Countryman.

           Jackson DECKS Darnell in the eye, and he rolls off Garcia, 
           staring up at the ceiling. 

           Countryman sits up, COUGHING. SIRENS in the distance.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        We gotta get the fuck out of here.

           Countryman gets up, follows Jackson. Darnell lying on the 
           floor, his world spinning.

           EXT. CRAFTSMAN HOUSE - STREET - LATER

           Jackson and Countryman headed to Wayne’s Van. Darnell 
           following behind, moving slow. SIRENS growing.
                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Let’s fucking go, D!

           Darnell eyes them, and starts towards the car. 

           The entire stash house EXPLODES behind him.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        And all this...all this...all while 
                        I was on a plane from Italy? 

           Darnell DISAPPEARS - JUST VANISHES BEFORE OUR EYES - as 
           Jackson and Countryman place the final few bricks in the back 
           of the van FULL OF COKE. 

           They get in, drive off, VAN DISAPPEARING IN A CLOUD OF WHITE.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        My name’s on the flight roster that 
                        night. Air France. Flight 14. 

           INT. AIR FRANCE - MOVING - NIGHT

           Darnell sits on the flight, still damp, with a BLACK EYE, 
           looking like death.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        And they’d have you believe I’m 
                        guilty?

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           It’s POURING outside again. Darnell, Jackson and Countryman 
           stare at their coffees. Countryman’s hand is shaking. Jackson 
           scribbling on a note pad.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Did I associate with guilty men? Do 
                        I have regrets about that? 

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Reckon north of a hundred mil.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Huge. Huge remorse.

                                 DARNELL
                        We’re finished. You understand me. 
                        This is done. This is the end.

           Jackson nods. Darnell eyes Wayne. He gets up, and walks out.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        That doesn’t mean I am those men.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Garcia, Jackson, and Countryman sit with the other agents as 
           Messner excoriates them, a PICTURE of Nancy behind him.

                                 FRANKLIN MESSNER
                        180 million in coke in smoke! It’s 
                        up the fucking flag pole to Mom. 
                        The Times has the beat. It’s a 
                        goddamn scandal waiting to bust. 
                        They’re saying it had to be us, 
                        CAUSE WE’RE THE ONLY ONES THAT 
                        FUCKING KNEW ABOUT IT! This is all 
                        hands. I want fucking bodies, you 
                        cunts, you understand me? 

           Countryman is sweating, Jackson staring at his hands. 

           Garcia staring out the windows...unreadable.

           INT. RUNDOWN HOME - SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

           Tootie opens a bag, takes out a single brick of cocaine, 
           looks to John Jackson. Jackson shrugs.

                                 JOHN JACKSON
                        Just need some wam money ‘til my 
                        share’s been cleaned.

           Tootie nods, hands Jackson a THIN WAD OF CASH.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Middle of the chaos, Jackson tried 
                        to unload a ki.

           EXT. RUNDOWN HOME - - MOMENTS LATER

           John Jackson steps outside. He’s SWARMED with windbreakers.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        They we were watching everyone. It 
                        was...stupid, careless. 
           INT. DEA INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Jackson sits, sweating, being grilled by Messner, Divetco, 
           other AGENTS, and Joyce Karlin, the Los Angeles Prosecutor.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        We used to say, give us three, and 
                        you’ll go free. 
                             (beat)
                        First he gave one. Countryman. But 
                        they didn’t believe the two of them 
                        were up to it all alone. Kept 
                        pushing him. They needed a bigger 
                        fall-guy. Scandal like this, they 
                        needed to make a special offering, 
                        a decorated agent, a star... 

           EXT. THE GARCIA MANSION - PALOS VERDES - DAY

           Darnell’s car idling across the street watching Daniel and 
           Bridget walk into the house. 

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Jackson told them what they wanted 
                        to hear...they always do.

           Bridget senses him. He drives off.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        He put me behind it. 

           EXT. LAX - DEPARTURES

           Darnell walks from SHORT TERM PARKING to the ticket counters, 
           looking over his shoulder.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Everywhere. Everything. 

           EXT. THE GARCIA MANSION - PALOS VERDES - LATER

           DEA and FBI storm the Garcia home, KICK OPEN the door, 
           Bridget and Daniel brought out onto the lawn as DOGS search 
           the home...and find nothing.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t say goodbye, couldn’t 
                        risk that. As I said, I had no 
                        choice.

           Bridget hugs Daniel as DEA continue to ransack their home.
           INT. FAVELAS - BRAZIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell opposite João Sosa, holding that bag of cash.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I was in Brazil.

           EXT. CHARLES DE GAUL AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - LATER

           Darnell entering France.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Paris.

           EXT. BANK SCHWEIZ - MILAN, ITALY - NIGHT

           Darnell leaving his Italian bank.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Milan.

           INT. TRAIN - MOVING - LATER

           Darnell looking out at the Alps, entering Switzerland.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        Zurich. Moving. Trying to keep my 
                        head above water. Get everything 
                        ready, so I could finally disappear-

           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - SUITE - NIGHT

           Darnell sits in the hotel room we met him in in the opening, 
           alone, depressed, his only company a million Ben Franklins. 
           Christmas Lights outside his window.

           Darnell stares at the phone. He dials. It RINGS...RINGS...

                                 BRIDGET (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Hello?

                                 DARNELL
                        Bridget?

           Silence.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I should have called-
                                 BRIDGET (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Should have? Don’t start with what 
                        you should have-

                                 DARNELL
                        Alright. 

                                 BRIDGET (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        I don’t want to talk to you.

           A long beat.

                                 DARNELL
                        Can I talk to my son? 

                                 BRIDGET (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        About what?

                                 DARNELL
                        Please, Bridge.

                                 BRIDGET (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Why you haven’t talked to him in a 
                        year?

                                 DARNELL 
                        I’d just like the chance...

           A beat, BREATHING on the other end of the phone.

           INTERCUT WITH: INT. BRIDGET’S NEW HOME - SAME

           Smaller, decorated modestly. Daniel sits next to the 
           Christmas tree, the TV on in the background.

                                 DARNELL
                        Daniel? 

           The line crackles quietly. Darnell can hear the BREATH.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Merry Christmas. 
                             (beat)
                        Son? Daniel, I’m sorry. I don’t 
                        expect you to understand it all 
                        now. I want you to know, you’ve 
                        maybe heard some things about your 
                        dad. You heard some things? 

           A beat. Nothing.
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        Because the things they’re saying, 
                        they’re not true.

                                 DANIEL
                        Then where are you?

                                 DARNELL
                        Daniel! Daniel, I wasn’t gonna get 
                        a chance to tell the truth. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Why not?

                                 DARNELL
                        That’s not the way the world works. 

           Daniel stares at the TV, AMERICA’S MOST WANTED playing.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna be together again, soon 
                        okay. Just as soon as I can, I’m 
                        gonna bring you and mom here.

                                 DANIEL
                        Where?

                                 DARNELL
                        ...I can’t say now. I can’t put you 
                        in that position. I know this is a 
                        lot to put on someone your age. In 
                        a way, I’m asking you to be a man, 
                        unfairly. I know that. I know that 
                        when I left, I put you-

           Daniel stares at the TV, and JOHN WALSH brings up the photos 
           of the FBI’s most wanted...at NUMBER TWO...is HIS FATHER.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re on TV.

                                 DARNELL
                        What? Listen, Daniel, what I was 
                        saying I want you to hear, because 
                        if my father had told me why, when 
                        he left, if I had understood-

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re only number two. 

                                 DARNELL
                        Number two what?
                                 DANIEL
                        America’s Most Wanted. You’re on 
                        it. You’re only number two.

           Daniel swallows, keeping it together. 

           He looks to his mom, covering her mouth...

           She stands with The FBI and DEA, who fill the living room, 
           their equipment everywhere. 

           They’ve been TRACING the holiday call. They LOCK IN, give a 
           thumps up. 

           And Daniel hangs up on his father.

                                                                CUT TO:

           WHERE WE STARTED...

                     Camp David. December 1988. (One Year On The Run)

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Nancy observes her Christmas Tree, ornamented just right, 
           ready to show. She nods, satisfied. 

                                 NANCY REAGAN
                        Let’s get rid of all this mess.

                                 CAMP DAVID MAID
                        Yes, Mrs. Reagan.

           The maids begin to pack up the ornament boxes and tissue 
           paper quietly.

           INT. ZURICH HOTEL - SUITE - MORNING

           Darnell packing gold in his bags, suddenly becomes alert.

           Mozart’s DON GIOVANNI takes us back to...

           OUR OPENING IN A REVIEW OF CUTS.

           The door is kicked in, a back draft of fluttering cash.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I wasn’t ready to go in.

           Darnell explodes up from the bathtub of cash.
                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        I was prepared to keep running. 

           Darnell leg sweeping the agents in the elevator.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        For my family.

           Darnell stealing a moped, flooring it off.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        For my life.

           The LIGHTS of Interpol in his eyes...harbingers of his end.

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        For my innocence. 

           Darnell drives ahead to Mozart’s arguing Father (La Statua) 
           begging his Son (Don Giovanni) to repent-

                                 LA STATUA (V.O.)
                        Pentiti!

                                 DON GIOVANNI (V.O.)
                        No!

           EXT. ZURICH STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Darnell speeds up, cutting through a BUSY PEDESTRIAN MARKET, 
           turns, and takes the MOPED down a run of steps...

                                 LA STATUA (V.O.)
                        Pentiti!

                                 DON GIOVANNI (V.O.)
                        No!

           Another set of stairs...Darnell dropping towards the docks...

           EXT. ZURICH - LAKE DOCKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell drives onto a slip, and jumps off the moped. 

           The moped continues down the slip, splashing into the water.

           Darnell climbs onto a SPEEDBOAT.

                                 LA STATUA (V.O.)
                        Pentiti!

           He looks up, INTERPOL MOTORCYCLES and CARS descending.
                                 DON GIOVANNI (V.O.)
                        No!

           Darnell starts up the boat, ENGINES ROARING to life.

                                 LA STATUA (V.O.)
                        Pentiti!

                                 DON GIOVANNI (V.O.)
                        No!

           He puts it in reverse, REAR-ENDS another boat.

                                 LA STATUA (V.O.)
                        Si.

                                 DON GIOVANNI (V.O.)
                        No.

           Darnell puts it in forward, WAKE rising.

                                 LA STATUA (V.O.)
                        Si.

           Darnell SPEEDS out of the harbor, onto open water.

                                 DON GIOVANNI (V.O.)
                        No! NO!

           EXT. LAKE - MOMENTS LATER

           Darnell shoots across the blue water, speeding in time to 
           Mozart’s building score. He looks back.

           INTERPOL BOATS in pursuit. 

           A CHOPPER moving in ahead to cut him off. 

           He turns the BOAT hard, and finds another FLEET of BOATS 
           headed his way, turns again...

           Things slow down, Mind Power kicking in.

           TIGHT ON: Darnell’s eyes. He remains faster.

           He turns again. Turns back. 

           Turns again. Turns back. 

           But there’s no play, no move...

           He circles, in semi-slow-motion, nowhere left to go...
           Reality refusing to bend to his will. 

           Darnell slows his circling.

           And comes to rest. The MUSIC cuts out. 

           CUT back to normal speed, The ROAR of the chopper is 
           deafening.

           Darnell raises his hands, putting them behind his head as the 
           CHOPPER descends, boats closing in. 

           Darnell rocking in his own waves and chop...

                                                                 BLACK.

           TIGHT ON: Darnell’s face, as he continues...

                                 DARNELL
                        When you look at my story from the 
                        beginning. 

           REVEAL: INT. LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT - DAY

           Darnell sits in the witness box, his LAWYER stands opposite  
           him. Joyce Karlin, at the Prosecutor’s table...

                                 DARNELL
                        You can see. I can see. I am 
                        guilty. Of some things.

           PAN TO the JUDGE and JURY listening as Darnell continues...

                                 DARNELL (V.O.)
                        But not of what I stand accused of 
                        here today. I sacrificed everything 
                        for this country. And sending me to 
                        jail is wrong. That is the truth. 
                        John 8:32...”know the truth, and 
                        the truth shall set you free.” That 
                        is your job, ladies and gentlemen.

           Darnell looks to the Jury.

                                 DARNELL
                        Know the truth, and set me free.

           The entire courtroom is transfixed.
           INT. LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT - DAY

           Darnell and the courtroom stand as the jury files in. 

                                 JUDGE 
                        Please be seated.

           The courtroom sits.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I understand 
                        you have reached a verdict.

           The HEAD JUROR stands.

                                 HEAD JUROR
                        We have your honor. 

           We LOSE SOUND in the courtroom...tight on Darnell’s eyes, the 
           Judge’s mouth moving in slow motion, the Head Juror’s mouth 
           moving slow...but Mind Power is not kicking in. Sound returns-

                                 HEAD JUROR (CONT’D)
                        ...we find the defendant, guilty.

           TIGHT ON: Darnell’s eyes, helpless to alter this reality. The 
           Judge looks to Darnell. A GAVEL SLAMS, the courtroom begins 
           to empty as Darnell stares ahead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           John Jackson served 4 years in Federal Penitentiary. 

           Wayne Countryman served 2 years in State Prison.

           Darnell Garcia was sentenced to 80 years in jail.

           He served 20 across 10 maximum security prisons, appealing 
           his case throughout. 

           In 2014, Barack Obama commuted his sentence among many others 
           dating from the War On Drugs for non-violent offenders.

                       Darnell Garcia still proclaims his innocence.

           INT. NORM’S DINER - BATHROOM - DAY

           Darnell, older, 60’s, in glasses, still that old mustache, 
           looks at himself a long beat in the mirror. He’s nervous. 

           INT. NORM’S DINER - LATER

           Darnell sits in a booth, reading. The restaurant is empty. 

           He rises as he sees a MAN enter...

           The man shakes his hand, and they sit. 

                                 DARNELL
                        Your mother didn’t want to come?

           Daniel shakes his head.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay. That’s fine. How’s 
                        your son? How’s Justin?

                                 DANIEL
                        He’s good.

                                 DARNELL
                        Thank you for the photos. 

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re welcome.

           A beat, it’s awkward.

                                 DARNELL
                        You want something to eat?

                                 DANIEL
                        I just came to say hi.

                                 DARNELL
                        Alright.

                                 DANIEL
                        So what are you up to?

                                 DARNELL
                        Well, that’s what I wanted to tell 
                        you about. 

           Darnell removes a thick stack of paperwork from his bag.
                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m appealing. They’ve still got 
                        those funds seized up, the gold 
                        money, and I’ve got a tape, of 
                        Jackson, admitting he lied under 
                        oath, about me. All of it. The Big 
                        Rip, all the drugs. My lawyers 
                        think it might be enough to get 
                        them to unlock the money. It’s 
                        enough to really-

                                 DANIEL
                        Stop. 

                                 DARNELL
                        The money’d be for you. For Justin. 

                                 DANIEL
                        We don’t want the money.

                                 DARNELL
                        It’s not drug money.

           Beat.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m gonna go.

           Daniel gets up.

                                 DARNELL
                        I don’t understand.

                                 DANIEL
                        You don’t understand? 
                             (beat)
                        That’s funny. You don’t understand?

           Darnell stares up at his son, confused.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        You think I understand? You think 
                        mom understands? We’ve had 20 years 
                        of not understanding. Was it the 
                        fame? The power? The money? To fill 
                        some hole of being alone in this 
                        world? Cause your dad wasn’t 
                        around? 

           Darnell looks down. 

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Well my dad wasn’t around, and I’m 
                        not a drug dealer.
                                 DARNELL
                        I explained-

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t want to hear it.

                                 DARNELL
                        Then I don’t know what you want me 
                        to say. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I want to hear one true thing.

           Daniel starts to leave. Darnell gets up. 

                                 DARNELL
                        I have regrets. I’m sorry. And I 
                        love you.

           Daniel stops.

                                 DARNELL (CONT’D)
                        That’s three things that are true.

           Daniel takes that in...and turns back to his dad. 

           Father and son considering each other.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
