                        story survives. 

           FADE IN ON 

           A HAGGARD FACE; 

           Piercing eyes, patchy beard over hollow-cheeks. Only twenty-
           seven, but calloused, leathery skin reads a decade older.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The MAN rides horseback through WHIPPING RAINFALL, bundled in 
           a wool blanket, holding onto a RIDER as they GALLOP ahead.

                                 STEEVES (V.O.)
                        If it is so miraculous they don’t 
                        believe, then it is just that much 
                        better of a story. 

           The horse angles toward a REMOTE OUTPOST barely visible 
           through the gusty downpour, mud flinging off its hooves.

                                 STEEVES (V.O.)
                        You’re the only one who deserves to 
                        know the truth.

           INT. CEDAR GROVE RANGER STATION - SIMULTANEOUS

           A Woody Guthrie album wobbles on a depression era phonograph.

           Three Winchester Model 12 Rifles stand at attention in front 
           of contour maps of the Sierra’s most unforgiving terrain.

           Coarse hands grip strong whiskey around a thousand year old 
           sequoia stump doubling as a CARD TABLE.

           The shortest of THREE RANGERS, let’s call him SCRAPPY, takes 
           a long drag of his Marlboro. Stamps his cig out on the stump. 

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Think it was the blast, caused the 
                        slide?
           A SECOND RANGER studies his cards, chewing tobacco. Hair 
           white as winter and face like a catcher’s mitt. This is WISE. 

                                 WISE
                             (sarcastic)
                        Think Uncle Joe was a Red?

           The THIRD RANGER smirks. 

                                 SALTY
                        Knocked a pair of boulders off the 
                        face of Mount Whitney like they was 
                        a couple of marbles. From a hundred 
                        miles away, no less. 

                                 SCRAPPY
                             (grinning wide)
                        Feel good, don’t it? Knowing the 
                        commies so much as lift a finger, 
                        Ike will blast ‘em back Before 
                        Christ.

           Wise eyes Scrappy. Notes his trembling hand. 

                                 WISE
                        That pride moving through your 
                        fingers? 

           Scrappy’s smile dissolves as Wise adds chips to his bet. 

                                 WISE (CONT’D)
                        You got a tell as old as time. 

           A red merle BORDER COLLIE stirs by the fire. Its ears pull 
           back, drawn to the front door. It growls, then BARKS. 

           The Rangers turn in the direction of the door moments before:

           KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK.

                                 SCRAPPY
                             (spooked)
                        ...the hell is that? 

                                 WISE
                        See any hikers out on patrol?

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Didn’t see much of anything.   

                                 WISE
                        Well, go on. 
           Scrappy moves with caution in his step. The Border Collie 
           SNARLS by the fire-- FUR STANDING ON END. 

           Scrappy opens the door and a GUSH of wind blows SIDE-WAYS 
           RAIN into the station past the silhouette of a MAN. 

           The man staggers in. 150 pounds soaking wet. And he is now, 
           literally, soaking wet. 

           He sports a tattered FLIGHT SUIT, like it’s an outer layer of 
           loose skin. AIR FORCE INSIGNIA sewed on the breast pocket. 
           Below, in red monogrammed letters, our hero’s name: 

           LIEUTENANT DAVID STEEVES.

           Steeves looks at the Rangers. Emotionless. Then, curious. As 
           if he’s genuinely unsure if they exist.

           The Rider appears at the doorstep; horse tightly tied to a 
           tree behind her. She helps Steeves into the ranger station. 

                                 RIDER
                        Come on then, give a hand.

           Scrappy rushes to help.

                                 RIDER (CONT’D)
                        Found him off trail up Granite 
                        Pass. Starved halfway to heaven. 
                        He’s on the brink, fellas. 

                                 WISE
                        Christ, he’s an airman? Set him 
                        down by the fire.
                             (to Scrappy)
                        Fetch a blanket. Some water. Quick.  

           The ghostly Steeves spots a ROTARY PHONE and wills himself 
           across the room, bypassing the rangers and the surging fire. 

                                 WISE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, son, where you going?

           Steeves ignores him-- dragging himself towards the phone. He 
           lifts the receiver. Bony fingers dial through throbbing pain.

           RING... RING... RING.

           The park rangers and the rider look on in shock as Steeves 
           presses his ear to the phone. A WOMAN answers.

                                 WOMAN (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?
           Steeves tries to speak but is choked up by the sound of the 
           woman BREATHING and a YOUNG GIRL FUSSING in the background.

           Warm tears run down his cheeks, through his wild beard.

                                 WOMAN (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? 
                             (long pause)
                        I’m going to hang up.

           Steeves musters his last ounce of strength...

                                 STEEVES
                        Do you still love me?

           Silence on the other end. And then, a GASP of recognition. 

                                 WOMAN (ON PHONE)
                        ...David? 

                                 STEEVES (ON PHONE)
                        It’s me, Rita-- 

           He’s cut off by a CLICK. 

           The only sound in the station is the DEAD LINE in his hand.  

           INT. LOBBY - CEDAR GROVE RANGER STATION - LATER

           Steeves sits at the table in front of the fire, draped in a 
           blanket. A bowl of beef stew STEAMING before him. He stares 
           in wonderment at the warm meal. 

           The RANGERS are seated around him, studying his every move. A 
           MAP is spread out on the table on which they’ve plotted his 
           trek through the Sierras. 

                                 WISE
                        How long?

                                 STEEVES
                        What’s the date?

                                 WISE
                        April 1.

           Steeves counts on his fingers. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Fifty-four days then.

           The rangers share looks of awe.
                                 SCRAPPY
                        Well that’s a god damn miracle. 

           Steeves pats the pockets of his flight suit. He finds a 
           smooth wooden tobacco pipe. Grips it in his hand. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Trouble any of you for a smoke? 

           Salty chuckles, smitten. He digs into his jeans. 

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Of all the things to hang onto.

           Salty hands Steeves a pouch of tobacco and a matchbook. He 
           gets to work packing his pipe, wholly focused on the task.  

                                 WISE
                        Rest up, Lieutenant. We’ll phone 
                        the base in Merced. 

           Steeves nods his thanks. The rangers step away. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

                                 SALTY
                             (whisper)
                        Is it even possible?

           Wise glances out the window into the cruel wilderness. Shakes 
           his head in astonishment.

                                 WISE
                        Three decades on the job... never 
                        seen nothing like it. 

                                 SCRAPPY
                        That’s how miracles tend to work.
                             (to Salty)
                        Still got the number of the County 
                        Times?

                                 SALTY
                        Well, sure.

                        Military should know before the

                        C’mon, Gene. Donations been real 
                        light this year.

                        What’s that got to do with--

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Guy like that with a story like 
                        this... slaps a picture of Cedar 
                        Grove on the front cover of every 
                        paper in a hundred miles.

                                 SALTY
                             (buzzing)
                        At the least.

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Could drum up interest in the 
                        Parks. 

           Gene ruminates. Sighs. 

                                 GENE
                        We’ll give him the night. 

           Salty grins, patting Gene on the back en route to the phone. 

                                 SCRAPPY
                        What luck, huh? 

           INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           TIGHT ON Steeves as he pulls in a deep breath of smoke, 
           staring at the beef stew steaming idly on the card table. 
           Darker now that he is alone; a whole world of thought just 
           beyond his wooden gaze. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUPPLY SHED - SIERRAS - DAWN - FLASHBACK

           An empty BEAN CAN hits the wood floor, TUMBLES. 

           Steeves packs his few belongings into a GUNNY SACK. 

           He studies a map of Kings Canyon. The closest Ranger Station 
           is in Cedar Grove, on the back side of a 12 thousand foot 
           peak. A suicide mission by the looks of it.

           His eyes scan the stark shed: empty food containers; ravaged 
           shelves; gaping hole in the roof. 

           A FOREST FIRE rages outside, casting an eerie apocalyptic 
           GLOW through the window.
           Steeves folds the map, slides it into the sack. 

           He takes one last look around and hurries out, passing a 
           crude map carved into the wood wall. The route of his death 
           march traced through the Sierras, ending in “Cedar Grove.” 

           And beneath that: “Sorry about the mess-- Lt. David Steeves.”  

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Steeves sports a BANDANA made from a strip of parachute. 
           Weary eyes visible behind cracked Aviators. 

           He consults the map, navigating his way through the woods.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Steeves stands before a surging river, mountains vaulting 
           beyond. He strips down. Shoves his flight suit into the 
           knapsack and ties his boots around the stalk of his neck. 

           Covered head to toe in bug bites, scratches, and scars, he 
           leaps onto a boulder, staying above the gushing torrent.

           He jumps again. Lands on a mossy surface, and falls sideways 
           into the sweeping current.  

           Steeves surfaces several yards down the river, rushing 
           headlong towards a WATERFALL. 

           He spots the steep drop thirty yards away, and attacks the 
           water, swimming with abandon towards the opposite bank. 

           But the current is too strong. It tosses him over the fall. 

           He disappears into the frothy maelstrom below... SURFACES on 
           the edge of the whirlpool; flailing to stay afloat; pummeled 
           with ice water from above; choking on the thick mist.

           He floats out from under the fall. Grabs on to a fallen tree 
           and drags his shivering body onto dry land. Skin the color of 
           bleach. Ribs so pronounced you could strum a tune on them. 

           He lies face first in the mud, tears threatening. Then SLAPS 
           himself across the face. No time for self-pity. 

           Everything he owns is soaking wet, including his map of the 
           Sierras-- now disintegrating in his hands.
           EXT. PEAK - DUSK

           Steeves scales a sheer CLIFF. He climbs hand over hand, 
           attempting the vertical route-- impossible with his withering 
           strength. A dead end.

           He coughs into a fit, and drops back down. Stuck. 

           Crawling over to the ledge where he came, he stretches out on 
           his stomach and pulls a PHOTOGRAPH from his breast pocket.

           A black and white picture of a BLONDE WOMAN-- a sober, mid-
           western version of Marilyn Monroe-- and a YOUNG GIRL in her 
           arms, staring back with a thin smile. Pure innocence. 

           He stares into their eyes. Then closes his. Suddenly, his 
           muscles ease. At peace with his final decision. 

           He inches forward... One more foot and his center of gravity 
           will send him tumbling to his death. But then--

           A shower of SMALL ROCKS pelt Steeves from above. 

           His eyes shoot open as he turns toward the peak. 

           Over the ledge, the head of a BLACK HORSE peers down at him. 

           Steeves tries to blink away the hallucination as the horse’s 
           RIDER leans over the ledge, spotting him. 

           She shades her eyes to get a better look. 

                                 RIDER
                        Jesus, Mary, Joseph...

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Steeves rides horseback through WHIPPING RAINFALL, bundled in 
           a wool blanket, holding onto the RIDER as they GALLOP ahead.

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. CEDAR GROVE RANGER STATION - MORNING - PRESENT

           Dawn bruises the sky over the rustic ranger station.

           A dated CHRYSLER stutters into the parking lot. A REPORTER 
           hops out, tucking a wrinkled shirt into worn trousers. 

           As he hustles over to the door, two other SEDANS chug up the 
           mountain road behind him.
           INT. CORRIDOR - CEDAR GROVE RANGER STATION 

           Steeves sits rigidly in a chair across from the rotary phone, 
           staring at the receiver. Hands clenched, marble eyes. Unclear 
           if he’s slept, let alone moved, in hours.  

           Scrappy, now in tan slacks and an ironed dress shirt, enters 
           from the other end of the corridor with the REPORTER in tow.

                                 SCRAPPY 
                        There he is... 
                             (shouting)
                        Hey, Dave. I’d like to introduce 
                        you to somebody.  

           Steeves blinks out of his daze. He limps to his feet, and 
           shakes the reporter’s hand, mirroring his eager smile. 

                                 REPORTER
                        It’s a right fine honor to meet 
                        you, Lieutenant. I’m with the 
                        County Times. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Hello.  

                                 REPORTER
                        Heard about all you did out there. 
                        Modern day Odyssey if you ask me. 
                        Braving the elements, fending off 
                        wild beasts-- all in the name of 
                        returning home to your family. 

           Steeves studies the hyperbolic reporter, wary, as the man 
           slides pen and pad out of his back pocket. 

                                 REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Mind if I ask a couple questions? 

           Steeves runs his fingertips through his beard. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           MULTIPLE REPORTERS descend on Steeves. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        What happened in the air? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Engine blew. Knocked me out cold. 
                        Woke up in a cockpit full of smoke. 
                        So I ejected.
                                 REPORTER #2 
                        First 15 days, all without food-- 
                        how’s that humanly possible? 

           A long pause. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Just is. 

                                 REPORTER #3 
                        Any lucky ladies out there waiting 
                        for you?

           The reporters stick recording devices in his face and 
           SCRIBBLE furiously on their pads as they CROWD ever closer.

                                 STEEVES
                        My wife, Rita. We have a little 
                        girl. Leisa’s her name. 
                             (overwhelmed)
                        Excuse me a minute. 

           Nauseous and short of breath, Steeves limps into a bathroom. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Steeves VOMITS into the rusty sink.

           He looks up, catching his reflection in the mirror. It nearly 
           brings him to his knees. A stranger stares back-- jarring 
           enough to make him look down to escape it. 

           Slowly, Steeves looks back up at the reflection. The initial 
           shock subsides, and suddenly, he’s LAUGHING. 

           A LOUD GUTTURAL FIT from a primal place deep within. His eyes 
           water, but the roaring laughter continues. The raw human 
           response of a man who beat death; a survivor celebrating the 
           life he still has left to live.

           EXT. CEDAR GROVE RANGER STATION - LATER

           A DRIVER from the closest Air Force Base arrives and ushers 
           Steeves past the throng of REPORTERS into an idling SEDAN.

           The Park Rangers stand by the entrance of the station. 

           Above the treeline, a SPIRE OF BLACK SMOKE catches Gene’s 
           attention. He squints, considering the strange sight.  
           INT. USAF VEHICLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Steeves stares out at the passing wilderness. He spots the 
           rising smoke, and abruptly turns away. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Are we heading to the airport?

                                 DRIVER
                        Base in Merced, for now. Sure 
                        you’ll be getting home soon enough. 

           Steeves hears his name, but it’s not coming from the driver. 

                                 LOCAL RADIO HOST
                        Lieutenant David Steeves, an Air 
                        Force pilot previously declared 
                        dead from a plane crash, stumbled 
                        into Cedar Grove Ranger Station in 
                        Kings Canyon National Park late 
                        last night...

           The driver turns up the volume. 

                                 LOCAL RADIO HOST (CONT’D)
                        A true miracle given the harsh 
                        conditions in the Sierras remote 
                        wilderness. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Don’t waste any time, do they? 

           Steeves listens intently to the radio as we try to decipher 
           whether he’s captivated or concerned with the publicity.

           INT. CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE - MERCED, CA - MORNING

           PATRICK MCGINNIS, an ambitious young Public Affairs Officer, 
           fields the most important call of his life. 

                                 MCGINNIS (ON PHONE)
                        As many outlets as we can 
                        accommodate, Sir. This is a golden 
                        opportunity to celebrate the world-
                        class training that enabled the 
                        Lieutenant’s survival. 

           A BASE COMMANDER sits nearby, on the edge of his seat. Others 
           sneak glances through the door; word of Steeves has spread. 

                                 MCGINNIS (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Glad to have your support on this, 
                        General. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MCGINNIS (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I’m confident the Lieutenant will 
                        give a good show. 
                             (pause)
                        Roger that. Wheels in motion.

           McGinnis sets the phone down on the receiver with a smile. 

                                 MCGINNIS (CONT’D)
                        Pentagon approved a press 
                        conference for 1100 hours.

                                 CASTLE BASE COMMANDER
                        How in the hell we going to manage 
                        that, McGinnis? 

           Outside the window, the USAF vehicle pushes through a cluster 
           of reporters camped outside the guard station. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Come have a look. He’s already 
                        filled out our bleachers.  

           The Base Commander cranes his neck, tracking the vehicle as 
           it drives by their window-- Steeves gazing out at him. 

                                 CASTLE BASE COMMANDER
                        Sure hope you’re choosing the right 
                        horse; I’ve never heard of the guy.

                                 MCGINNIS
                        It doesn’t much matter who he is, 
                        only what he’s done. All we do now 
                        is repeat the story, over and over, 
                        ‘til a legend is born.

           EXT. CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Steeves exits the sedan in a swirling cloud of dust. He 
           glances up at the looming air traffic control tower. Spots 
           the FACES gawking at him through various windows. 

           He shuts the door, revealing a slab of granite with an 
           engraving: CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE/ GLOBAL POWER THRU AIRPOWER.

                                 DRIVER
                        Right this way, Lieutenant.  

           INT. BARRACKS - CASTLE AIR BASE

           Steeves trails the Driver down a long, bare-walled corridor. 
           Several AIR FORCE PERSONNEL step aside, heads turning as they 
           track Steeves’ ghostly procession-- no one saying a word. 

           INT. CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE - LATER

           A FLIGHT SURGEON helps Steeves out of his soiled uniform.

           He’s covered in pockmarks, bruises; protruding ribs, and 
           caved shoulders. The flight suit was another skin for so 
           long; without it, he’s a living skeleton. 

           Steeves crosses his arms; not proud of his appearance. The 
           surgeon gives him a thorough examination.   

                                 FLIGHT SURGEON
                        That’s it?

                                 STEEVES
                        How do you mean? 

                                 FLIGHT SURGEON
                        I get a call this morning that some 
                        flier ejects over the High Sierras, 
                        hoofing it for months over rock and 
                        ice in 10 below... I brought a bone 
                        cutter, Lieutenant. 

           The surgeon laughs, applying a stethoscope to Steeves chest. 

                                 FLIGHT SURGEON (CONT’D)
                        You’re in remarkably good shape, 
                        all things considered. 

           He withdraws the stethoscope, bewildered. 

                                 FLIGHT SURGEON (CONT’D)
                        Christ, you’re gonna send me back 
                        to church.

           Steeves stares ahead blankly. 

           INT. OFFICE - CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

           Steeves stands with the Base Commander pointing out his trek 
           through the Sierras. Officer McGinnis leans against the wall. 

                                 CASTLE BASE COMMANDER
                        Medic says you’re hanging in there. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Yes, Sir. 
                                 CASTLE BASE COMMANDER
                        Should be proud of all you’ve done. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Will I be getting home soon, Sir? 

           McGinnis steps forward. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Yes, very soon, Lieutenant.   
                             (extends his hand)
                        Office McGinnis, Public Affairs. 
                        We’d like you to participate in a 
                        brief press conference first, if 
                        that’s alright with you. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Who’s going to be there? 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Just a couple folks who want to 
                        hear about your survival.

                                 CASTLE BASE COMMANDER
                        We do need you to be light on the 
                        technical details of the jet. This 
                        will be a national broadcast; can’t 
                        be sure who’s listening in.  

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Walk in the park compared to all 
                        you’ve been through.

           Steeves sniffs. Scratches his beard.

                                 STEEVES
                        So, then I’m reinstated? 

           McGinnis pats him on the back. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Welcome home, Lieutenant. 

           Steeves looks down at his filthy, mud-caked suit. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Should I change first? 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        I’d consider keeping the flight 
                        suit on. And the beard. 

           Off Steeves’ curious look--
                                 MCGINNIS (CONT’D)
                        Picture’s worth a thousand words. 
                             (beat)
                        Besides, ladies really swoon for a 
                        wild man.

           McGinnis winks. Steeves forces a smile. 

           INT. SHOWER - LATER

           Warm water steams off Steeves’ rigid body. He watches layers 
           of filth run down like a muddy stream, clumping in the drain. 

           He takes a razor to his beard, but stops short. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

           Steeves follows McGinnis down the corridor toward the 
           makeshift press room. His flight suit hangs off his skeletal 
           frame. They stop outside the double doors.

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Take your time. Have fun with it.

           Steeves glances between a thin crack in the doors. The room 
           BUZZES with anticipation. He itches his beard. Struck by the 
           pomp and circumstance.  

                                 STEEVES
                        Should I start at Oakland?

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Tell them what you told me, exactly 
                        how you told it. We don’t need Gene 
                        Kelly out there. They came to see 
                        Lieutenant David Steeves. The man 
                        who stared death in the eye, and 
                        didn’t blink.

           McGinnis pats Steeves on the shoulder to loosen him up. 

                                 MCGINNIS (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn that beard’s a wonder. 

           INT. CONFERENCE HALL - CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE - CONTINUOUS

           CAMERA FLASHES berate Steeves as he pushes through the double 
           doors. He squints and shields his eyes-- then remembers to 
           smile as he strides to the podium.
           Dozens of JOURNALISTS, PHOTOGRAPHERS and AIR FORCE PERSONNEL, 
           jostle for position at the front of the stage.   

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Good morning. On April 1st at 
                        eighteen hundred hours, First 
                        Lieutenant David Steeves did the 
                        impossible. After fifty-four days 
                        spent fighting for his life in the 
                        High Sierras, he emerged from the 
                        wild, alive and well. His story is 
                        a testament to the bravery, courage 
                        and ingenuity of American soldiers 
                        in active service today. It is with 
                        great pleasure that I introduce, a 
                        true American hero... Lieutenant 
                        David Steeves. 

           THICK APPLAUSE. Steeves approaches the microphone.

           A CAMERAMAN stands behind a Marconi MK II mounted on a tripod 
           in back. He flicks a switch. It blinks red. 

           Steeves takes a breath, about to speak...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHED - SIMPSON MEADOW CAMPING GROUNDS - MORNING 

           A BATTERED DEER hangs from its hind legs. 

           An emaciated Steeves tugs on a rope, raising the deer higher. 
           He’s rigged a clever pulley hoist from spare parts.  

           He approaches the bloodied carcass with a KNIFE. 

           EXT. SHED - LATER

           A metal TOOLBOX smokes atop the steel grate of the fireplace-- 
           a makeshift oven, slow-cooking the deer meat inside.  

           Resting on his haunches, shoulders caving in, Steeves glances 
           across the camping grounds to the thick grove of trees.

           He spots a LONE COYOTE sitting near the river, watching him. 
           After a moment, as if sensing trouble, it scurries off. 

           INT. SHED - ANOTHER DAY

           Steeves mouth is open wide like the dead, deep in sleep. Rain 
           patters softly against the rooftop. 
           A subtle rumble just before-- the entire shed is grabbed by a 
           SEISMIC QUAKE. 

           Steeves knocks down to his knees.

           He reaches both hands up just in time to stop a STORAGE SHELF 
           from crushing him, everything on the shelves, sliding off, 
           BREAKING over his body and onto the floor. 

           A CACOPHONY OF SOUND that seems to never end...

           Until, abruptly, the quake is over. And silence returns.

           Steeves pushes the empty shelf back upright. Water drips onto 
           his head from a massive FRACTURE in the ceiling.

           Fuck. 

           INT. SHED - ANOTHER DAY

           Rain POUNDS the roof of the shed, streaming inside. 

           Steeves opens his toolbox for a meal only to find a few 
           remaining portions of the deer, wrapped in tin foil.  

           He shuts it, rationing-- but the longer he looks, the more he 
           loses himself to hunger.

           Suddenly, he FLIPS the box over and grabs the largest portion 
           of venison. He hesitates-- then devours the meat. 

           INT. SHED - ANOTHER DAY

           Steeves shakes out the last grains of salt into his palm, 
           tossing the container near the emptied toolbox. 

           The shed has been ravaged. Drawers pulled out, wrappers 
           licked clean, glass containers shattered. Paradise lost.   

           Steeves licks the last of the salt off his palm. His savage 
           beard extends well beyond his chin. 

           Through the window, smeared with oil and breath, the snow is 
           melting-- first signs of spring peeking through.

           EXT. GROVE - DAY

           A SHAKY FLAME lifts to a hollow section of a tree, packed 
           full of mattress padding and tiny sticks.
           Steeves patiently waits for the flame to JUMP from the match 
           to the kindling. The FIRE SPREADS in an instant. Smoke 
           billowing into a clear blue sky.

           EXT. SHED - DUSK

           PLUMES OF BLACK SMOKE rise above the treeline. 

           Steeves sits against the shed, watching the forest burn-- the 
           blaze threatening to jump the river and enter his campground.

           He spits. Scratches his beard. Weighing the odds. 

           INT. SHED - DAWN

           An empty BEAN CAN hits the wood floor, TUMBLES. 

           Steeves packs his few belongings into a GUNNY SACK. A FOREST 
           FIRE rages outside, casting an eerie GLOW through the window.

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - CONDO - WASHINGTON, DC - MORNING - PRESENT

           CLAY BLAIR JR (32) bites down on a piece of butterless toast. 

           Pugnacious and pedantic, Blair has a tough time making 
           friends-- driven to a fault; a reporter intensely committed 
           to the pursuit of absolute truth in uncertain times.

           He wears a starched white collared shirt, black tie. His hawk 
           eyes shift quickly, poring over the Daily News. 

           AGNES (30), his wife, sips coffee, deeply engrossed in an 
           article on nuclear proliferation. She drops the World section 
           like it weighs a metric ton. Rubs her bleary eyes. 

                                 AGNES
                        Dreamt last night the bomb went 
                        off.

                                 BLAIR
                        Huh.

                                 AGNES
                        We tried to hide in a cellar, but 
                        there was a family already inside.  

           Blair stays quiet, keeps reading. 
                                 AGNES (CONT’D)
                        A little boy-- not much older than 
                        Kemp. We forced him and his family 
                        out. He cried the whole time.  

           Blair snorts. He glances up to find his wife glowering. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Sorry, hun. This clown of a 
                        columnist, misspelled ‘erudite.’

           Blair stands, folding his paper. He kisses his wife on the 
           top of the head, altogether missing her sullen expression.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        What were you saying? 

           He tucks an old leather bound notebook into his briefcase, 
           turns to leave. 

                                 AGNES
                        Big day ahead. 

                                 BLAIR
                        If you say so. 

           Blair walks out of the kitchen as Agnes clears the table. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Blair steps over his son, KEMP, 8, who lies on his belly in 
           front of a cabinet television, Davy Crocket cap on his head.

           Blair drops the paper in front of Kemp. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Give your brain a chance. 

           Blair glances at the television as he passes. Double-takes. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        What’s this? 

           Kemp shrugs. Blair turns on the volume. Steeves is on the 
           screen, speaking live at Castle Air Base.  

                                 STEEVES (ON SCREEN)
                        ... climbed to the top of the pass 
                        ‘til I, uh, couldn’t push on any 
                        further. That’s where she found me-- 
                        a rider breaking trail. First time 
                        I’d seen anybody in, well, fifty-
                        four days, I suppose. 
           Blair watches with mounting interest. 

           INT. CONFERENCE HALL - CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Steeves at the podium, sweating under the lights. 

                                 STEEVES
                        She rode me to the station, and the 
                        rangers took over from there. 

           The PRESS look on like cows at pasture. Steeves shoots a 
           quick look to McGinnis behind him-- he’s done.  

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Questions? 

           Hands shoot up; reporters yell over each other.

           Steeves stands an inch taller, the smallest hint of a smile 
           growing on his face. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - TOWN HOME - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Blair stares at the spectacle on screen, already writing the 
           story in his head. 

           INT. OFFICE - SATURDAY EVENING POST - MORNING

           Blair sits at a desk in a compact office, sleeves rolled up. 
           He’s on a call. Scribbling notes as he talks.

                                 BLAIR
                        Where is he heading now? 

           REPORTERS and EDITORS funnel through the hallway, casting 
           sidelong glances at Blair as they pass his office.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate the transparency, 
                        Officer. You’ll hear from me. 

           Blair drops the call, and springs to his feet-- hustling off 
           in the direction of the other journalists. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SATURDAY EVENING POST - MOMENTS LATER

           STAFF crowd around a conference table, an all-hands meeting. 

           Oversized Norman Rockwell magazine covers adorn the walls. 
           Pastoral images of the American Dream. 
           Blair steps into the room, leans against the door frame. 

           The Managing Editor, BEN HIBBS, 50s, owl glasses, boyish 
           features, presides. 

                                 BEN
                        When it’s costing thirty cents to 
                        produce a magazine sold for 
                        fifteen, something must be done. 

           Ben meets eyes with each member of his staff. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        We’re shrinking the size of our 
                        magazine by an inch and a half. 
                        Nothing else changes, understood?  

           DENNIS, late 40s, a grim editor in a bow-tie, interrupts. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Should we be worried, Ben? 

           Ben attempts to reassure the anxious reporters.

                                 BEN
                        I said, nothing else changes.

                                 DENNIS
                        If we’re shrinking that means 
                        advertising revenue’s pinched, so 
                        our readership’s down. And taking 
                        that to its inevitable end-- Curtis 
                        Publishing’s the one moving your 
                        lips. I know what’s going on here; 
                        all of us do. 

                                 BEN
                        Alright, you want it like it is. 
                        The Saturday Evening Post has yet 
                        to find a way to compete with an 
                        electronic box that lights up and 
                        talks to our readers. And yes, 
                        Curtis has started to take notice. 

           The room goes quiet. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Why compete? Television goes one 
                        way, we should head the other. 

           All eyes shift to Blair. 
                                 DENNIS
                        Who’s this guy, Ben? And what does 
                        he mean by ‘we?’

                                 BEN
                        Clay Blair Jr. Former Life and Time 
                        correspondent. We’re lucky to have 
                        him. 

                                 DENNIS
                        The ship’s sinking, so we add more 
                        weight? That fits.  

                                 BEN
                        Blair, continue. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Long-form exclusives with 
                        influential public figures. Our 
                        answer to the celebrity interviews 
                        on every major broadcast network.

           Dennis scoffs. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Long-form? Generally speaking, when 
                        something shrinks, pal-- it gets 
                        smaller. 

                                 BLAIR
                        So, lose the fluff.

                                 BEN
                        Mr. Blair, this is Dennis Haskins. 
                        Humor and Poetry editor. 

           Clearly what Blair meant by ‘fluff.’ Tension in the room 
           pulled taut as the reporters wait to see if he’ll back down.

                                 BLAIR
                        What’s the alternative-- more 
                        gossip columns and Khruschev 
                        cartoons? If the focus is on 
                        entertainment alone, we will 
                        consistently lose out to moving 
                        pictures. 

           The insult lands hard; Dennis stews. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Two minutes in and you already know 
                        more than everybody in the room.  
                                 BLAIR
                        What should that tell you?

                                 DENNIS
                        Tells me you’re a snot nose prick. 

                                 BEN
                        Dial it back, boys. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Ben, you hired me, in your words, 
                        to ‘bring legitimacy back to The 
                        Post.’ 

           Ben leans back in his chair, outed before his colleagues.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Taking the moral high ground and 
                        increasing readership does not have 
                        to be mutually exclusive.

           Silence hovers. Furtive glances. Dennis rises to his feet. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Cute speech. I’m all tingly inside. 

           He crosses the room, staring daggers at Blair on his way out. 

           Ben rolls his pen from one hand to the other, considering. 

                                 BEN
                        Who exactly did you have in mind? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Well, a dead Air Force pilot just 
                        came back to life. 

           EXT. TARMAC - MITCHEL AIR FORCE BASE, LONG ISLAND, NY - DAY

           A SECURITY OFFICER motions for a ‘56 Chevrolet One-Fifty to 
           roll forward a couple feet. Makes a fist, signaling to stop.

           The Chevy brakes, then the doors on the cherry red sedan open 
           wide. HAROLD and ELSIE STEEVES (50s), David’s parents, exit 
           the car dressed in their Sunday best.  

           HAROLD JR “Harry”, 28, Steeves’ brother, and his wife RITA, 
           24, step out of the back seat. Rita holds LEISA, 5, adorable 
           in a pink sundress.

           Rita stands stiff. She clasps the fake pearls on her wrist, 
           staring at the PRESS as they mass around Elsie and Harold. 
                                 LEISA
                        What are all these people doing 
                        here, Momma?

                                 RITA
                        They’re here to see your father, 
                        just like us, sweetheart. 

           Leisa gawks at the crowd as Harry comes to their side. 

                                 HARRY
                        Feels like a dream, doesn’t it? 

                                 RITA
                        I’m not convinced it isn’t. 

           INT. AIR FORCE TRANSPORT JET, CRUISING ALTITUDE - DAY

           Steeves sits next to a sleeping McGinnis. A newspaper in his 
           lap with Steeves’ face on the cover below the headline: 

           “SIERRA SURVIVOR HEADING HOME.” 

           Beneath that, a photo of Rita with the caption “PILOT’S WIFE 
           INCOHERENT WITH JOY.” 

           Steeves carefully extracts the newspaper, considering the 
           caption, when all the sudden--

           TURBULENCE rocks the plane. McGinnis jolts awake and grabs 
           hold of Steeves’ arm. Steeves doesn’t flinch.

           After a moment, the plane levels and calm returns to the 
           cabin. McGinnis draws his hand back. Steeves’ smile gives way 
           to a good natured laugh.

           EXT. TARMAC - MITCHEL AIR FORCE BASE - DAY 

           McGinnis disembarks down a rolling stair ladder, giddy at the 
           sight of REPORTERS held behind a rope.

           Rita holds Leisa near the front of the press. ELSIE squeezes 
           Rita’s shoulder. 

                                 ELSIE
                        He should see you two first. 

           Rita steps out front; nervous to be the center of attention. 

           Steeves emerges from the plane and scans the crowd. He spots 
           his family and hurries down the steps. 
           Rita’s hand instinctively covers her mouth, forgetting about 
           the cameras, wholly moved by the sight of her husband alive. 

           Leisa squirms with excitement in her mother’s arms. Rita lets 
           her down. She races under the rope, toward her father. 

                                 LEISA
                        DADDY!!!

           Steeves lifts her into his arms, holds her tight. 

                                 LEISA (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Mommy said you weren’t coming back.

                                 STEEVES
                             (welling up)
                        I’m here, baby. I’ll never leave 
                        you again.

           Steeves sets Leisa down as Rita approaches. She throws her 
           arms around him, and they hold each other close. 

           Rita tries to catch her breath while Steeves is blinded by 
           the disorienting array of FLASHING cameras. 

           They move apart, staring at each other like puzzle pieces. 

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Let’s see a kiss, huh. 

           Rita shocks back to reality.

                                 RITA
                        I don’t know where to... with this 
                        dreadful beard. 

           The press laugh for a moment, but Rita’s hesitation draws out 
           too long for comfort. 

           Clocking the adverse attention, Rita abruptly grabs hold of 
           Steeves and pulls him in for a kiss. They lock lips while 
           cameras snap away. 

                                 ELSIE (O.S.)
                        My baby. 

           Elsie tugs at Steeves’ arm. He turns and hugs his mother. 

           Rita steps away as David’s father and brother pull him in for 
           a bear hug; laughing and crying all the while.  

           Steeves loses Rita and Leisa to the crowd, as the press mob 
           around him--  bulbs FLASHING; CHEERING him on. 
           McGinnis stands to the side, smile wide as the Pacific.

           EXT. BACKYARD - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - FAIRFIELD, CT - DAY

           A POP of champagne. 

           ALBERT “AL” GILMORE (24), Steeves’ best friend and fellow Air 
           Force pilot, lets the fizz drip on the lawn of the modest one 
           story home, surrounded by a BBQ in full swing. 

                                 AL
                             (loud)
                        Please, everybody, raise a glass.  

           Steeves’ family and friends are happy to oblige. We notice 
           MCGINNIS and BLAIR among them. 

           Al hands the champagne to Steeves.

                                 STEEVES
                        No, thanks. I’m a lightweight now.  

                                 AL
                        What’s this, you came back a prude? 
                             (shouting)
                        To the wild man! 

           They all raise a glass as Steeves raises the bottle, demure.  

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Rita and her mother ESTHER, 50s, Swedish-American, arrange 
           hors d’oeuvre on a platter in the quaint kitchen.

           Rita stares out the window at her husband, champagne in hand.

                                 ESTHER
                        You look ill. 

                                 RITA
                        It’s as if nothing happened before. 

           Rita covers her face with a shaky hand. 

                                 ESTHER
                        No one knows what you do.  

           Esther takes Rita’s hand in hers. They meet eyes.

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        Play along, Rita. This won’t last.
           EXT. BACKYARD - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - FAIRFIELD, CT - DAY

           Glasses clink around him as Steeves looks at the bottle 
           fondly, then sets it down without taking a sip. 

           He scans the yard for Rita as McGinnis approaches. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Lieutenant. I’d like you to meet 
                        somebody. This is Clay Blair Jr of 
                        the Saturday Evening Post. Esteemed 
                        journalist, and a good friend of 
                        the Air Force.

                                 STEEVES
                        Pleasure to meet you.

           The men shake firmly. 

                                 BLAIR
                        You belong to the 3851st, do I have 
                        that right? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Good boys down there.

                                 STEEVES
                        You’re a vet? 

                                 BLAIR
                        These days, who isn’t.

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Clay’s being modest. Fought with 
                        the 8th over Berlin.

                                 STEEVES
                        We should be toasting you, Mr. 
                        Blair. You’re the real hero.

                                 BLAIR
                        To be honest, Lieutenant, I’ve 
                        never been much interested in hero 
                        worship. In my experience, the man 
                        is invariably more interesting than 
                        the hero. 

           Steeves nods, agreeing with Blair’s ideology. 
                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I don’t want to take any 
                        more time away from your family, so 
                        I’ll cut right to it-- the Post 
                        would like to make an offer for the 
                        exclusive rights to your story.

           Steeves turns to McGinnis, unsure of the offer. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I’ve already told my story. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What I’d like to do is get the full 
                        account. Every last detail of your 
                        survival; reintegration into 
                        society; achievements at the Air 
                        Force. All in your own words. 

           Steeves ponders Blair’s pitch. Blair doubles down.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        The American people could use a 
                        role model. A man of integrity. 
                        What you did out there-- it wasn’t 
                        some miracle. It was 
                        resourcefulness. Resilience. 
                        Bravery. Strength. And above all... 
                        character. That’s the kind of man I 
                        want my boy looking up to. 

           Steeves is swept up in Blair’s passion.

                                 MCGINNIS
                        The decision of who tells your 
                        story is entirely yours, 
                        Lieutenant. But I promise you, this 
                        man will tell it right. 

           Blair hands over his card with the Saturday Evening Post logo 
           emblazoned on thick white stock. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Think on it. My number’s on the 
                        card. And if you turn it over, 
                        you’ll see the Post understands the 
                        value of a story like yours. 

           Blair pats him on the back, and walks toward the gate.    

           Steeves turns the card over-- “$8,000” reflecting off his 
           wide eyes. After a beat, he hurries off towards Blair and 
           catches him at the gate.
                                 STEEVES
                        I’m in.

           Blair smiles, curiously. Steeves notices. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        It’s not about the money. It’ll 
                        certainly help get us back on our 
                        feet-- but I trust you. You’re an 
                        airman.

           Blair nods. Gives a slight salute. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I’ll be in touch. Enjoy the 
                        celebration. You earned it.

           Off Steeves, turning the card over in his hand. 

           INT. BASEMENT - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           Rita unpacks a suitcase, laying clothes on the pull-out bed. 
           All the furniture here needs to be refurbished, or tossed. 

                                 RITA
                        Those are for you. They’re your 
                        brother’s but should still fit. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Thank you. 

           Steeves struggles to disrobe through sore muscles. 

                                 RITA
                        Here.

           Rita takes off his coat, then his shirt, seeing his weathered 
           body for the first time-- countless pockmarks and bruises.  

           Rita guides the white undershirt over Steeves’s shoulders. He 
           swims in the fabric.  

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. With the move, it just 
                        didn’t seem right to fold up your 
                        clothes, unpack them someplace 
                        else. 

                                 STEEVES
                        This is fine. 
                                 RITA
                             (avoiding eye contact)
                        We were in Selma for as long as we 
                        could manage, waiting for them to 
                        find you. But I needed to find 
                        work, you see, so I had to leave 
                        the base and move Leisa in with my 
                        mother, start towards a degree-- 

                                 STEEVES
                        Rita.

           Steeves gently takes Rita’s face in his hand.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        This family is what kept me alive. 
                        I don’t need a single thing more 
                        than this. 

           After a beat, she wraps her arms around his emaciated body. 
           They hold each other for a moment before Rita lets go. 

                                 RITA
                             (abruptly)
                        I should go wash up.

           As Rita turns to walk away--

                                 STEEVES
                        It’s over. We ended it in Oakland. 
                        I haven’t spoken to her since. 
                             (beat)
                        Everything about me has changed, 
                        Rita. I promise you. 

           Rita nods before closing herself inside the bathroom.

           Steeves stands there, listening to his wife turn on the 
           faucet to hide the sound of her crying; powerless to help. 

           INT. BEDROOM - CONDO - WASHINGTON, DC - NIGHT

           Blair folds a pair of slacks into a suitcase, cigarette 
           smoking on his lips. A radio reports the nightly news.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        Amateur radio hobbyists are 
                        flocking to their receivers this 
                        evening to hear the first ever 
                        artificial satellite as it hurtles 
                        above the Eastern United States.

                        Will you be gone for long? 

           Agnes stands in the doorway.

                                 BLAIR
                        Can’t imagine so.

                                 AGNES
                        What’s the story? 

                                 BLAIR
                        That airman who survived in the 
                        Sierras.

                                 AGNES
                        Oh. Kemp will be excited to hear. 
                        He’s been on and on about him.

           Agnes lingers. 

                                 AGNES
                        Will you be sure to call tonight? 

           Blair looks up from his suitcase. 

                                 AGNES (CONT’D)
                        They’ve been practicing the ‘Duck

                        He’s been restless at night. 

           Blair returns to packing. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Sure, hun.

                        Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep...

           Agnes starts to leave, then pauses. She listens to Sputnik 
           along with Blair, their backs turned to each other. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SHED - DAWN

           Steeves wakes to the sound of CRUNCHING LEAVES outside.

           FOOTSTEPS, approaching the shed... 

           He blinks rapidly, ears to the door. He briskly rolls out of 
           bed and clambers over to the door, throwing it open to find:

           A DEER licking at a bean can. 

           Steeves freezes in wonderment at the sight. 

           His stomach begs, snapping him back. He dashes for the 
           revolver, tripping over his makeshift bed. 

           When he returns to the open door, the deer is gone. 

           EXT. SIMPSON MEADOW - DAY

           A salt lick lays at the foot of a pine tree, tucked between a 
           narrow opening of branches. 

           Above the salt lick, a COCKED REVOLVER, poised to fire. Clear 
           fishing line tied to its trigger is spread across the opening 
           on a system of weights, acting as a trip wire. 

           Steeves pulls softly on the fishing line. It applies pressure 
           on the trigger, and a shot BLASTS into the earth. 

           Steeves bends down to examine the ground where the bullet 
           entered-- inches above an ‘X’ etched in the dirt. 

           An ingenious trap made to kill a deer. 

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           Steeves tosses and turns in his bed, reeling from a fever-
           induced nightmare. 

           A GUN SHOT echoes off the mountainside. 

           He rises bolt upright. WIDE-EYED. Sweat peppering his 
           forehead. He throws off the canvas and reaches for his boots.

           EXT. SIMPSON MEADOW - MOMENTS LATER

           Arriving breathless, Steeves finds the deer lying face down 
           in the trap. He grabs the revolver and drags the carcass back 
           towards the cabin; blood staining the snow red in it’s wake.  
           Halfway to the shed, Steeves hears a low GROWL. 

           He freezes. Stands guard over the carcass in steely silence, 
           glancing in every direction, ear to the night.  

           A twig SNAPS... A SHAPE slinks out of the woods.

           STRIKING YELLOW EYES burn through the darkness... 

           A THICK COYOTE plants one paw forward, CRUNCHING into the icy 
           earth. Its other front paw rises at a 45 degree tilt. Head 
           cocked, pointed directly at Steeves.  

           Steeves reaches a shaky hand into his pocket, retrieving his 
           revolver. Chamber loose, ALL SIX BULLETS ROLL OUT, scatter. 

           Steeves reaches down; stops short. Eyes connecting with a 
           second COYOTE silhouetted in the moonlight to his right. 

           A SNAP, and he turns his head to find ANOTHER at his left. 

           Steeves bends down. Goes for the deer instead of the ammo, 
           lifting the young buck over his shoulders. 

           He stands tall. BLOOD SLIDING down his flight suit. The thick 
           coyote steps forward initiating a staring contest... 

           Suddenly, Steeves breaks into a SHAMBLING run for the shed--

           One coyote HOWLS. Another CHARGES. 

           Feeling them hot on his tail, Steeves spins-- holds the deer 
           high over his head, and ROARS until his lungs empty.

           The coyotes stop on a dime, eyeing Steeves. Curiosity, fear.

           Ten feet from the door, he takes two slow steps backward, 
           baring his yellow teeth, GROWLING at the hunched animals. 

           He turns, quick, dashes for the shed as the coyotes CHARGE. 
           Steeves reaches the door on a STUMBLE, hurls the deer inside 
           and SLAMS it shut behind. 

           INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Steeves tips a CABINET in front of the door. Slumps against 
           it as the coyotes CLAW, SCRATCH and HOWL at the other side.    

           Steeves runs his hand through his hair, straining to catch 
           his breath. He looks at his palm-- STAINED DARK RED. 

           Blood drips down his face like tears. 
           EXT. SHED - SIMPSON MEADOW CAMPING GROUNDS - MORNING 

           A BATTERED DEER hangs from its hind legs. 

           Steeves tugs on a rope, raising the deer higher.

                        Why do bad things happen to good 
                        people?  

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           INT. UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - TRUMBULL, CT - DAY 

           Steeves and his family sit in the front row of a modest 
           church-- stained glass, salmon colored walls-- attracting 
           whispers and glances from MEMBERS of the congregation.

                                 PASTOR BEN
                        The life of Job, a true believer in 
                        the sovereignty of the Lord, 
                        reminds us that nothing happens by 
                        chance. Even the tragedies of our 
                        lives are in His hands; He is in 
                        absolute control, always and 
                        forever. We can find faith, and 
                        healing, in this fundamental truth. 

           Steeves gaze fixes on the Pastor, hanging on every word.

                        You can do all things, and that no 
                        purpose of Yours can be thwarted.”

           Pastor Ben meets eyes with the Steeves family.

                                 PASTOR BEN (CONT’D)
                        Let us pray.

           Steeves and Pastor Ben exchange a smile before bowing heads. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Steeves stands in front of his own grave. Rita behind him, at 
           a respectful distance. After a long silence;

                                 STEEVES
                        What’s down there, an empty box? 
                                 RITA
                        We buried a shirt of yours, and 
                        your first pair of flight goggles.

                                 STEEVES
                        Honestly?  

           Rita nods, cracking a smile. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I want those back. 

           They laugh at the absurdity of it all. Steeves senses Rita’s 
           guard lowering, seizes the opportunity.   

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I just hope we can bury all that 
                        happened before with that guy down 
                        there. Start fresh. With family and 
                        God at the center. 

           Rita fiddles with her bracelet, mood shifting. 

                                 RITA
                        Just talking to you right now, 
                        David-- it’s strange. I felt in my 
                        heart you were gone. 

                                 STEEVES
                        All I can ask is you’ll try. 

           After some hesitation, Rita nods. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. Let’s leave the man to his 
                        dirt. 

           Steeves leads her away from the grave, toward an idling car 
           with his FAMILY inside. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Which shirt did you bury?

                                 RITA
                        Your favorite.

                                 STEEVES
                        Not the Hawaiian?  

           Rita smirks. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        You just wanted it out of the 
                        house.
                                 RITA
                        It was so loud, I couldn’t hear 
                        myself think. 

           INT. BUNGALOW - CRAIG AIR FORCE BASE - SELMA, AL - DAY

           Blair sits in a bungalow across from COLONEL DUSARD (42), 
           Steeves’ impassioned commanding officer.

                                 BLAIR
                        How many fliers downed this year? 

           Dusard looks uneasy about the question.

                                 DUSARD
                        We like keeping those numbers close 
                        to the vest, you know that. 

           Blair tucks his notebook away.

                                 BLAIR
                        Between us.

           Off the record-- Dusard loosens up.

                                 DUSARD
                        One jet mishap is one too many. But 
                        it happens more often than we’d 
                        like to admit. Hell, a pilot in 
                        Steeves’ squadron-- Lieutenant 
                        Glenn Sutton-- went down in the 
                        Sierras not three months earlier.  

                                 BLAIR
                        Steeves knew him?

                                 DUSARD
                        They were good pals. 

           Blair raises a brow.

                                 BLAIR
                        What do you suppose caused Steeves’ 
                        crash?

                                 DUSARD
                        An explosion that affects the 
                        cockpit is unusual in a T-33; but I 
                        take Steeves’ word for it. 

           Blair spots the BASE COMMANDER peering through the window. 
                                 BLAIR
                        Any trouble keeping him in line?

           Dusard laughs, deflecting.

                                 DUSARD
                        What airman isn’t trouble? Gotta 
                        have a little crazy to sign up to 
                        dive 5 G’s with a T-12 Cloudmaker 
                        in your bay. Nobody knows that 
                        better than you. 

           Blair smiles, humoring his old AF buddy. But he’s a 
           journalist now, he’s gotta ask;

                                 BLAIR 
                        What kind of trouble?

                                 DUSARD
                        Nothing we didn’t get into and out 
                        of ourselves. The kid’s a regular 
                        Chuck Yeager-- logged 900-plus 
                        flying hours before his ordeal. 
                        That’s what’s important.

           Blair eyes him curiously. Then decides to drop it.

                                 BLAIR
                        I appreciate the time. 

                                 DUSARD
                        Anything for a washed up airman.

           The men shake. Blair notices a few GREY UNIFORMED OFFICIALS 
           talking to a short, sandy-haired PILOT outside the bungalow.

                                 BLAIR
                        Am I late to the party?

                                 DUSARD
                        OSI. Just closing out the accident 
                        report. All routine.

                                 BLAIR
                        Who’s that they’re talking to?

                                 DUSARD
                        Some friend of the kid’s.

                                 BLAIR 
                        Any idea what about?

                                 DUSARD
                        I don’t remember you being a gnat.
           Blair puts his hands up in mock-surrender. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m a journo now, Colonel. Have to 
                        ask the obvious. 

                                 DUSARD
                        Take care, Captain. 

           Blair turns, walks out the door. Dusard keeps one eye on him 
           through his window until he disappears into a sedan. 

           INT. FORD - CONTINUOUS

           Blair starts the engine and drives slowly by the OSI 
           interviewing the pilot. He surreptitiously eyes the 
           encounter, zeroing in on the airman’s lapel. 

           He drives off and turns out of the base but as soon as he’s 
           out of sight, he pulls to the side of the road, flips open 
           his notebook, and writes down the name: “Captain Webber.”

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER - ROOFTOP - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Overlooking the glimmering metropolis of NYC, Steeves and 
           family pose like statues along the railing. 

           A PHOTOGRAPHER loads his camera. McGinnis stands beside him 
           with that tireless smile. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Harold, can I have your right hand 
                        on the railing. 

           Harold clutches the railing with his left hand. Elsie smacks 
           it down. 

                                 ELSIE
                        Oh, for crying out loud, Harold.

           She grabs his right and guides it to the railing. 

                                 HAROLD
                        He wasn’t clear.  

                                 ELSIE
                        Have your hearing checked.

                             (to Steeves)
                        Nothing’s changed there, brother. 
           Steeves grins, a pipe in his mouth. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Terrific. Lieutenant, may I ask you 
                        to hold Rita’s waist. She can place 
                        her hand on yours. 

           Steeves waits for Rita to put her hand on his before gently 
           touching her waist. 

           The photographer SNAPS a few shots.

                        Fantastic. And that’s our 1A.  

                                 MCGINNIS
                             (to Harold and Elsie)
                        Did you ever think you’d grace the 
                        cover of The Saturday Evening Post?

                                 HAROLD
                        Not in a million years. 

                                 ELSIE
                        David was the star of all his 
                        school plays. I always knew one day 
                        he’d leave a mark. 

           Harold pats his son on the back.

                                 HAROLD
                        We’re just happy he’s sharing his 
                        miracle with us. 

           Harold chokes up. Steeves grabs his father’s shoulder, 
           basking in his praise. Rita looks on, moved by the encounter. 

                                 ED SULLIVAN (PRE-LAP)
                        I’d like you all to meet someone 
                        rather special. 

           INT. CBS STUDIOS - ED SULLIVAN SHOW 

           ED SULLIVAN stands before us, the TV personality who will go 
           on to introduce Elvis and the Beatles to America. He’s got 
           his hands in his pockets and a sway to his step. 

                                 ED SULLIVAN
                        If you haven’t heard about my 
                        friend already, Lieutenant David 
                        Steeves pulled himself out of the 
                        wild after surviving fifty-four 
                        days in the Sierra mountains.

                        We’re fortunate enough to have him 
                        here in our audience today.

           The camera finds David and his whole family front and center. 

                                 ED SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
                        Lieutenant, and family, welcome. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Hello, Ed.  

                                 SULLIVAN
                        How does it feel to be out of the 
                        woods? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Hard to put into words exactly.

                                 ED SULLIVAN
                        I bet. What would you say makes it 
                        so a guy like you can do something 
                        so sensational? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Dad used to take me hunting. Some 
                        of that certainly came of use.  

                                 HAROLD
                        When Dave was younger, he learned 
                        to trap small animals-- woodchucks, 
                        raccoons. Skinned their hides 
                        cleaner than I ever could. 

                                 ED SULLIVAN
                        You were prepared to face the wild. 

                                 ELSIE 
                        David has a mind of his own;   
                        always full of plans. My mother 
                        thought he’d grow up to be an 
                        inventor. 

           Steeves beams. 

                                 STEEVES
                        If I didn’t have a family to return 
                        to, Ed, I’d still be out there 
                        wandering the Sierras. 

                                 ED SULLIVAN
                        I understand you hunkered down in a 
                        shed for some time? 
                                 STEEVES
                        That’s right. ‘Til an earthquake 
                        hit the basin, tore it apart. Sent 
                        me on my way pretty quick. 

                                 ED SULLIVAN
                        You always hear California’s lovely 
                        this time of year. 

           Canned laughter from the studio audience.

           BACKSTAGE

           GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY towers over McGinnis. His immaculate 
           uniform hugs his thick frame below a heavy, stone-face.

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        That was no earthquake. 

           Off McGinnis’s confused look--

                                 GENERAL LEMAY (CONT’D)
                        That was a fission bomb outta 
                        Frenchman Flat knocked his ass out 
                        of bed.

           McGinnis looks ahead, thrilled to be rubbing shoulders with 
           the Pentagon’s top brass, but unnerved nonetheless. 

           BACK ON STAGE

                                 ED SULLIVAN
                        Rita, this must have been nothing 
                        short of incredible for you. At any 
                        point did you think you might not 
                        see your husband again?

           Rita digs deep for the right answer. 

                                 RITA
                        A wife never loses hope. 

           She exchanges a smile with Steeves. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE - CBS STUDIOS - ED SULLIVAN SHOW - LATER

           After the broadcast, Steeves separates from his family to 
           join McGinnis and Lemay.

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Lieutenant Steeves.
                                 STEEVES
                             (salutes)
                        General Lemay. It’s an honor, sir. 

                                 LEMAY
                        At ease. 

           Lemay sizes Steeves up.

                                 LEMAY (CONT’D)
                        Hell of a thing you did out there, 
                        Lieutenant. Hell of a thing. 

                                 STEEVES
                        People seem to think so.

                                 LEMAY
                        You don’t?

                                 STEEVES
                        Saved my skin, that’s all.

           LeMay motions to the studio lights and cameras. 

                                 LEMAY
                        Not out of the woods yet, huh?

                                 STEEVES
                        Sorry, how do you mean? 

                                 LEMAY
                        You’re representing the United 
                        States Air Force on national 
                        television. No easy task. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Any pointers? 

                                 LEMAY
                        I’ll leave that to the experts. 

           LeMay pats McGinnis on the back. 

                                 LEMAY (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy your leave, Lieutenant. Watch 
                        yourself out there.  

                                 STEEVES
                        Thank you, sir.  

           Steeves and McGinnis salute. Lemay walks off to an exit.  

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Did I say something wrong? 
                                 MCGINNIS
                        There’s a reason even his closest 
                        friends call him ‘Iron Ass.’ You’re 
                        doing just fine, Lieutenant. Arthur 
                        Godfrey’s up next. He has a rather 
                        overt way of warming up to his 
                        guests.

           INT. ELEVATOR - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Rita and Steeves in a swanky elevator, moving up and up, 
           heading to “P.” Steeves looks to the OPERATOR monitoring 
           their ascent.

                                 STEEVES
                        Don’t suppose that stands for--

                                 OPERATOR
                        Penthouse, sir. Only the best for 
                        guests of Mr. Godfrey.

           The doors open to a private suite. Stunning view of the 
           skyline offered through panoramic windows. 

           A bottle of champagne sticking out of a sterling silver ice 
           bucket on the night stand.

           The BELLHOP wheels their luggage into the room. Then leave 
           Rita and Steeves with jaws wide. 

                                 BELLHOP 
                        Enjoy your stay at the Biltmore.

           INT. STUDIO - ANOTHER DAY

           Steeves and Rita sit across from CBS host ARTHUR GODFREY.

                                 ARTHUR GODFREY
                        So the view from your office-- it’s 
                        better than mine. 

                                 STEEVES 
                        35,000 feet is quite a view. Except 
                        when you’re falling through it.   

           LAUGHTER from the audience.

                                 ARTHUR GODFREY
                        Right. So you’re up there, gliding 
                        along at break-neck speed, when--
                                 STEEVES
                        An explosion in the fuselage 
                        knocked me out cold. 

           Arthur Godfrey makes a face to his audience, hamming it up.   

                                 ARTHUR GODFREY
                        Talk about a rough day at the 
                        office.  

           More LAUGHTER. 

           INT. DONOHUE’S STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT

           A bustling Midtown restaurant where the social elite dine on 
           Saturdays and the middle-class save for special occasions.  

           Steeves and Rita sit with Arthur and his wife, MARY. 

                                 ARTHUR GODFREY
                        The spending should be increased 
                        ten-fold. This is the one dramatic 
                        advantage we have over the Reds. 
                        Enhanced strategic air power. 

           A waiter comes by with a bottle of Sherry. 

                                 MARY GODFREY
                        Yes, he’ll have another. Until it 
                        comes out his ears. 

           The waiter fills Arthur’s glass. Moves on to Steeves. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Oh, no thank you.  

                                 ARTHUR GODFREY
                        Nonsense. You both deserve a drink.

                                 MARY GODFREY
                        Arthur loves himself an airman.

                                 RITA
                        I’ll have a glass.

           Steeves glances at Rita, surprised as her glass fills with an 
           honest pour. The waiter turns to Steeves, bottle tilted. 

                                 STEEVES
                        That’s alright. 

           The Waiter moves on; Rita notices. She smiles to herself. 
                                 ARTHUR GODFREY
                        As I was saying, the wars of my 
                        childhood-- Army and Navy beat the 
                        drum. But war like this, the Air 
                        Force is front and center. We won’t 
                        have to drop a single bomb-- just 
                        as long as they know we got the 
                        planes to drop them--

           A homely MAN approaches the table with a look of disbelief. 

                                 MAN
                        Sorry to bother, I never do this, 
                        but could I have your autograph?

           Arthur Godfrey smiles graciously. He offers his hand to get 
           it over with.

           But the man produces a newspaper with a picture of Steeves on 
           the cover. He hands it to a Steeves with a pen.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        The old lady would never believe me 
                        otherwise. 

           Surprised, Steeves takes the pen. Stares at the picture-- 
           surreal to see his face on the cover.

                                 STEEVES
                        Just my name? 

                                 MAN
                        Made out to Margaret. 

           Steeves signs over his face in sweeping cursive. The man 
           walks away, delighted, as Arthur breaks into a hardy laugh.

           He raises a glass. 

                                 ARTHUR GODFREY
                        Welcome to the club, Lieutenant.

           EXT. DONOHUE’S STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Steeves and Rita walk out into the electric night-- flashing 
           marquees, throngs of pedestrians, yellow taxis streaking by.    

                                 RITA
                        The look on your face!

                                 STEEVES
                        Nearly forgot how to sign my own 
                        name. 
           They laugh, fingers interlacing. Steeves looks into his 
           wife’s smiling eyes. This is the high school sweetheart he 
           fell in love with years ago.

           He glances around the crowded city street, orienting himself.  

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got an idea. Maybe my best.  

                                 RITA
                             (teasing)
                        Well that’s a low bar--

           Steeves takes off running with Rita’s hand still locked in 
           his. Together they dodge a blur of pedestrians-- long coats, 
           fancy hats, handbags, heels, canes-- laughing like teenagers. 

           EXT. CAROUSEL - CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

           Steeves and Rita rise and fall, cheering on the animals 
           they’ve chosen to ride on the carousel.  

           Children seated beside them point and giggle at their antics. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER

           Underneath the twirling market lights of the carousel, 
           Steeves and Rita slow dance. He hums to her. “It Had to be 
           You,” their favorite song. 

           Rita holds his gaze without an ounce of hesitation, feeling 
           in this moment that her husband has truly changed. 

           INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Rita touches Steeves’ face, tipsy still, but sincere. 

                                 RITA
                        Did you mean what you said? 

                                 STEEVES
                        What I said? 

                                 RITA
                        That you don’t need anything more 
                        than us. More than our family.

                                 STEEVES
                        With all my heart. 
            																						
                                                                  	
           Rita’s other hand moves up his chest. They kiss passionately 
           as Rita guides Steeves to the plush mattress. 

           LATER

           Rita lies awake in bed next to Steeves who snores lightly. 
           Sober now, processing her decision to sleep with her husband. 

           Conflicting emotions battling it out in her heart and mind.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - SIERRAS - DUSK - FLASHBACK

           ALIVE, Steeves stirs. Blinks. A groggy hand swipes off his 
           SHATTERED AVIATORS; face awash with confusion.  

           He lifts his head off the rock. Rubs his temple. BLACK BLOOD 
           sticking to his fingers like tar. 

           Head throbbing, he labors to a sitting position. His flight 
           suit is starched with ice. Frail body shivering beneath it. 

           Steeves glances up to an empty sky. He feels it now, in his 
           gut, the utter isolation. 

           He shudders. Tears shake loose, stream down his cheeks.  

           WOODS - LATER

           Every other step is a stumble, legs no longer obeying orders. 

           Fifteen days without food, he chews on snow until his tongue 
           bleeds raw. His beard matted and full, cheeks gaunt. A weary 
           eye visible through the crack in his Aviators. 

           All ten of his fingertips are blackened with frost bite, 
           advancing up his fingers like a dark army.

           He slowly rattles off jet models under his breath, trying to 
           keep his mind above water.

                                 STEEVES
                        Convair F-106 Delta Dart... 
                        Douglas... F4D Skyray? 
                             (pause)
                        Grunman F-9 Cougar... no, Panther. 
                        Lockheed... Lockheed, shit. 
                        McDonnel... F3H Demon-

           Then, a faint, familiar HUM...
           Steeves tilts his head, throwing his balance. Listens to the 
           irregular TRILL of an engine. Somewhere above the clouds, the 
           sound of a plane crossing the sky... But is it real? 

           His heart POUNDS. Vision blurs. Shadows distort, trees bend 
           at impossible angles. He stops walking, terrified. 

           The landscape SLANTS at full-tilt, then SPINS into oblivion.

           A PANIC ATTACK grabs Steeves by the throat. He brings a hand 
           to his heart, dropping to his knees. He hacks and hacks, 
           emptying his stomach, phlegm and blood hitting snow.

           When he finally gathers himself and looks up, he sees it. 
           Through a break in the dense forest, a hundred yards away...

           A GOD-SEND.

           SIMPSON MEADOW CAMP GROUNDS

           Steeves rubs the haze from his eyes. The sign’s still there. 
           And just beyond it, a SHED.  

           EXT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           A rusty iron padlock hangs on the front door of a compact 
           wood structure. 

           Steeves spots a baseball-sized rock with a jagged edge. 

           He smashes the padlock. No luck. 

           Again. Nothing. Steeves eyes go bug-eyed with desperation. He 
           summons every last ounce of strength and SMASHES it over and 
           over and over... 

           The lock flies off the handle as he collapses in exhaustion. 
           Steeves pushes the door open with his foot and gazes inside. 

           INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS

           No larger than sixty square feet, the shed is packed with 
           tools and equipment; an outpost for forest rangers. 

           A RODENT scurries off a shelf and out the door as Steeves 
           grabs for a box labelled “FOODSTUFFS.” He rips it open, 
           gaping into the box like it’s filled with pure gold: 

           Can of beans, one of hash, another of tomatoes; two packages 
           of gelatine; a half box of lump sugar; a coffee can one-third 
           full of rice; another half full of pinto beans; 
           two packages of dehydrated soup; a bottle of ketchup and a 
           wide assortment of spices and condiments, mustard, salt, 
           garlic, Tabasco... 

           Steeves drinks ketchup from the bottle, slurping it down so 
           fast he nearly chokes. He gathers himself. Rations the rest. 

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           Steeves drags tent canvas over to a ravaged camping mattress. 

           He sits down, unlaces his boots. Carefully maneuvers them off 
           his feet. He grimaces; the pain excruciating. 

           His legs are in a terrible way: BLUE and ORANGE extending 
           halfway to his knees; feet SWELLING before his eyes. 

           He bundles himself in the tent canvas, SHOUTING the moment 
           the canvas touches his legs.   

           Frost webs across a small window above Steeves as he curls up 
           and falls headlong into a deep, feverish sleep. 

           INT. SHED - DAWN

           Steeves wakes to the sound of CRUNCHING LEAVES outside. 

           FOOTSTEPS, approaching the shed--

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING 

           Blair sits on a bench before rows and rows of ghost white 
           tombstones, jotting down notes in his journal. Just above the 
           treeline behind him, the formidable walls of the Pentagon. 

           A SUITED MAN sits down on the bench beside him, nervous. 
           Blair keeps his eyes on the journal as he speaks.

                                 BLAIR
                        Were you followed, Jim? 

           JIM glances in the direction he came. He’s a thin man in his 
           early 30s, prone to trembling levels of anxiety. 

                                 JIM
                        I don’t think so, no. 
                                 BLAIR
                        Good. Maybe we won’t be hung for 
                        treason after all.  

           Jim picks up on the sarcasm, doesn’t like it. 

                                 JIM
                        This flier’s got a lot of heat on 
                        him, buddy. The last person who 
                        held this folder was the Vice Chief 
                        of Staff.  

                                 BLAIR
                             (intrigued)
                        LeMay? 

           Jim produces a manila folder from his coat. Another glance 
           over his shoulder before he slides the folder to Blair.

                                 JIM
                        If you were anyone else.

                                 BLAIR
                        Thank you, I mean that. 

           Blair shuffles through loose pages, arriving at the end. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the postmortem on the jet? 

           Jim leans in. 

                                 JIM
                             (whisper)
                        It hasn’t been found.

           Blair takes a moment to process this, puzzled. 

                                 BLAIR
                        How long did they search? 

                                 JIM
                        They’re still searching. Combed a 
                        50 mile radius ten times over-- not 
                        a trace where he claimed to have 
                        deployed. 

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s why the OSI’s on the case? 
                                 JIM
                        Doesn’t matter. Guy’s been branded 
                        a hero already-- hell, enlistment’s 
                        spiked twenty percent since the 
                        story broke-- they wouldn’t dare 
                        revoke the title shy of him caught 
                        with a hammer and sickle. 
                             (beat)
                        If I were you, I’d let God be the 
                        judge on this one.  

           Jim collects the folder, slides it in his briefcase.

                                 BLAIR
                        Then why show me the report?

           Jim looks over the cemetery.

                                 JIM
                        My brother died saying your name. 
                        You’re the kind of guy this kid 
                        could never be. That’s all I need 
                        to know. What you do with it-- 
                        well, that’s your decision now. 

           Jim stands and heads off down the path. Blair is left gazing 
           out over the sea of tombstones. Deep in thought.

                                 MCGINNIS (PRE-LAP)
                        Before you get out there, a piece 
                        of advice...

           INT. BACKSTAGE - TV STUDIO

           McGinnis lowers into Steeves’ eyeline, like a boxing coach.

                                 MCGINNIS
                        You’ve lived through something 
                        extraordinary. Don’t hold back. The 
                        whole nation is watching. 

           Steeves nods, realizing what’s being asked of him.  

           INT. STUDIO - WIDE WIDE WORLD

           Host Dave Garroway, and an audience, riveted by--

                                 STEEVES
                        ... tossed the bloody carcass 
                        through the cabin door, and bolted 
                        it up-- just in time to deprive the 
                        pack their dinner. 
           GASPS from the studio audience. 

           Rita in the front row, no longer on stage. Seeing Steeves 
           from the audience POV.   

                                 DAVE GARROWAY
                        If the cold wasn’t enough!

           INT. STUDIO - FLATT AND SCRUGGS SHOW 

           Steeves on stage with the host, FLATT. He jumps out of is 
           seat, acting out the scene in gripping detail, enjoying this. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I’m buck-naked, boots tied around 
                        my neck and everything I own held 
                        high above my head as I wade into 
                        the current--

                                 FLATT
                        -- quite an image for our viewers.

                                 STEEVES
                        I’ll tell you what was quite an 
                        image. The 30-foot waterfall I was 
                        set to barrel over like a piece of 
                        drift wood.

           INT. NEW STUDIO 

           The story has grown BIGGER, not unlike--

                                 STEEVES
                        A massive deer. Biggest I’d ever 
                        seen.

           Steeves reminisces with a million dollar smile. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        After three weeks eating nothing 
                        but ice and grass-- it was the 
                        happiest moment of my life.

           He looks over to Rita in the audience.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Well, second happiest. Marrying 
                        that beautiful woman had it beat.

           The audience eats it up. Rita smiles dimly, put off by all 
           the theatrics. 
           EXT. BUSCH STADIUM - ST. LOUIS - DAY

           A packed stadium on their feet for the Seventh Inning Stretch 
           of the Major League Baseball All-Star game. 

                                 FANS
                             (singing)
                        For it’s one, two, three strikes 
                        you’re out, at the old ball game!

           Rita sits in the stands with Leisa in her lap. Harold and 
           Elsie are there with Harry, his wife Ruth and son BOBBY. 

           The RUMBLE of a jet draws near. They look to the sky. 

                                 STADIUM PA ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and Gentleman... back from 
                        54 days in the wild... America’s 
                        own... Lieutenant David Steeves!

           A SILVER JET streaks through the sky, just above the stadium 
           walls - a thunderous CLAP.  

           On the field, YOGI BERRA and TED WILLIAMS stare up at the 
           jet, clapping their mitts. The country’s biggest stars 
           admiring one of the newest to join their ranks. 

           The stadium erupts in CHEERS. 

           INT. JET

           Steeves at the helm, his eyes smiling behind aviator goggles.

                        So you’ve just come to in a cockpit 
                        full of smoke. 

           INT. RADIO STUDIO - DAY

           Steeves sits with headphones beside a RADIO HOST. McGinnis is 
           seated on the other side of the glass alongside Rita. 

                                 RADIO HOST
                        What’s in your mind at that moment? 
                        Are you terrified?

                                 STEEVES
                        No. My mind went straight to the 
                        training I received from the Air 
                        Force. It’s hard to panic when 
                        you’ve been trained for worse.
           McGinnis’ nods affirmation; Rita flashes concern. 

           INT. TOWN CAR - NYC - DAY

           Rita and Steeves ride in silence down 5th Avenue, beneath the 
           gleaming skyscrapers. 

                                 RITA
                        Why did you change your story? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Which part? 

                                 RITA
                        From what you’ve told me, you were 
                        terribly afraid.

           Their town car slows to a stop at a light.  

                                 STEEVES
                        This is who they want me to be. 

                                 RITA
                        Who, David?

                                 STEEVES
                        The Air Force.
                             (pointing)
                        I represent more than myself now. 

           Rita follows Steeves’ hand, surprised to find a forty foot 
           poster of him outside her window-- a towering recruitment ad 
           for the Air Force fixed to an apartment building. 

           And below the billboard, an elderly WOMAN with sunken cheeks 
           leans out of her window to pour water from a milk bottle into 
           her battered orange flowerpot. 

           Rita fixes on this woman as they motor past, the enchantment 
           of the city fading from her eyes.

                                 AL (PRE-LAP) 
                        Well, I told your Mama that you’d 
                        be in by ten. Well, Susie baby, 
                        looks like we goofed again!

           INT. STATION WAGON - FAIRFIELD, CT - DAY

           Steeves taps his hands on the steering wheel to the beat of 
           “Wake up little Susie” by the Everly Brothers.
           Al sits in the passenger seat, singing poorly, hair blowing 
           in the wind. 

                                 AL
                        Wake up, little Susie, wake up! 

           They pass a Jaguar dealership. 

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, whoa-- slow down. 

                                 STEEVES
                        We gotta get the food back.

                                 AL
                        Let’s just have a quick peak. 

           Steeves glances in his rear-view. Hangs a U-turn. Al grins. 

           INT. JAGUAR DEALERSHIP - LATER

           Steeves admires his reflection in a lacquered mint green ‘56 
           XKSS Roadster Convertible. 

                                 SALESMAN
                        She’s a stunner. Looks even better 
                        topping 75 on the highway. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Been a dream of mine to own one.

                                 SALESMAN
                        And what’s stopping this dream from 
                        coming true today?

                                 AL
                        Great question!

           Al pulls Steeves aside. Sensing an ally, the salesman gives 
           them privacy.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        How much did the Post offer? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Not enough for this. 

                                 AL
                        Then call them and make it enough. 
                        I’m tired of seeing my friend act 
                        like he doesn’t know how to get 
                        what he wants-- 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AL (CONT'D)
                             (pats Steeves’ chest)
                        What he deserves! 

           Steeves is slowly coming around. Al tilts the scales further.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        You’re famous now, Dave. You think 
                        Brando drives around in his mother-
                        in-law’s station wagon?

                                 STEEVES 
                        I shook on it.

                                 AL
                        You didn’t sign on a dotted line. 
                             (beat)
                        Listen, I know you’re a man of your 
                        word, but the Post is taking 
                        advantage of you. Do you know how 
                        many magazines they’re going to 
                        sell when your story hits the 
                        shelves? Only a sucker doesn’t know 
                        his own worth.

           Al pats Steeves on the back and returns to the salesman.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the nearest phone? 

                                 SALESMAN
                        Got to check with the Misses, huh? 

                                 AL
                        Something like that. 

           The salesman shows Steeves and Al to a rotary phone.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Take your time. Remind her how hard 
                        you’ve worked for this. 

           The Salesman winks, then walks off. 

                                 AL
                        Prove to me you’re still the guy 
                        who once convinced a bum to give 
                        you a smoke. 

           Steeves slides Blair’s card out of his wallet. Dials.
           INT. HOTEL BAR - VIRGINIA - DAY

           Blair sits alone at the bar of a hotel, writing in his 
           notebook. A BARTENDER approaches with a telephone in hand. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Mr. Blair?

           Blair looks up from his work. 

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Your office has transferred a call.

           He reaches for the phone. 

           INTERCUT between the Jaguar Dealership and the Hotel Bar. 

                                 BLAIR (ON PHONE)
                        Clay Blair Jr.

                                 STEEVES (ON PHONE)
                        Mr. Blair. David Steeves.

                                 BLAIR
                        Lieutenant. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Listen, about your offer. I got to 
                        be honest; I don’t know much about 
                        how an exclusive works.

                                 BLAIR
                        Well, we’ll go up to Kings Canyon. 
                        Retrace your steps. I’ll take 
                        notes, snap a few photos, ask a few 
                        questions. Simple as that, really.

                                 STEEVES
                        But there’s, uh, a little more to 
                        it than that, right?

                                 BLAIR
                        How do you mean?

                                 STEEVES
                        “Exclusive” means you’re the only 
                        print journalist who can tell my 
                        story, in my own words.  

           Blair senses Steeves’ advance. His face sets like a rock.  

                                 BLAIR
                        As I told you at the barbecue--
                                 STEEVES
                        Not to come off as ignorant or 
                        ungrateful, but I’ve been told 
                        there are other folks like yourself 
                        who’d also like to tell my story. 

                                 BLAIR
                        You’ve been told?

                                 STEEVES
                        I do think you’re a fine 
                        journalist, Mr Blair, but there are 
                        plenty of fine publications-- 

                                 BLAIR
                        What exactly are you asking, 
                        Lieutenant?  

                                 STEEVES
                        Well, you have magazines to sell, 
                        and I have a family I’d like to 
                        start providing for now that I’ve 
                        been graced with a second chance. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Eight grand not enough to feed a 
                        family these days?

           Steeves eyes Al who eggs him on. 

                                 STEEVES
                        To be straight with you, Mr. 
                        Blair... I’m deliberating if you’re 
                        the right man for the job. 
                             (beat)
                        I was hoping you might be able to 
                        alleviate my concerns. 

           Al fist pumps, loving this side of Steeves. There’s a lengthy 
           silence, as Steeves tenses.

                                 BLAIR
                        Ten thousand, not a penny more. 

           Steeves pauses for effect. Then--

                                 STEEVES
                        You’ve got yourself an exclusive. 

           Steeves hangs up and hugs Al in celebration. 

                                 SALESMAN
                        Smile like that, I’d say the Mrs. 
                        just gave you the thumbs up.
                                 STEEVES
                        The sign in the window said you 
                        take credit? 

                                 SALESMAN
                        Matter of fact, buddy. We prefer 
                        it.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Blair sets the phone down. He slides his glasses off and rubs 
           his eyes. Not happy he just got squeezed-- but more than 
           that, he feels personally betrayed. 

           He opens his book. Flips over a few pages, and stops on one 
           with a name: “Captain Webber.” 

           He eyes the luggage at his feet. He could go home as planned, 
           but he picks up the phone instead. Dials a number by heart.

                                 BLAIR
                        Jim. One more favor to ask. 

           INT. RITA’S FAMILY HOME - FAIRFIELD, CT

           Rita stacks textbooks into a cardboard box: “The Psychology 
           of Adjustment,” “The Hidden Persuaders,” etc. 

           Leisa fiddles with a book, titled “Fear and Rage.” 

                                 RITA
                        You’re far too young.

           She reaches for the book. Leisa hesitates. 

                                 LEISA
                        Why are you putting them away, 
                        Momma?

                                 RITA
                        I’ll be working in the dentist’s 
                        office again. Won’t that be fun?   

           Leisa hands over the textbook, confused. 

                                 LEISA
                        You’re never going back to school? 

           Rita packs it in with the others. Staring sadly at her box 
           full of books. Unable to look her daughter in the eye.
                                 RITA
                        We’ll see. 

           HONK-HONK. Rita goes to the window, slides open the blinds.

           Steeves is standing tall in the driveway beside the ‘56 Jag. 
           He motions for her to come outside. 

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        What in the world?

           EXT. RITA’S FAMILY HOME - FAIRFIELD, CT

           Rita steps out into the driveway. Leisa follows close behind.

           Steeves leans against his Jag with a sly grin. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I’d like to take my family out for 
                        a drive.

                                 RITA
                        ...David.

                                 STEEVES
                        C’mon, hop in. I’ll explain it all 
                        at the beach. 

           INT. JAGUAR - COASTAL ROAD, CT - DAY

           Steeves has one hand on the wheel. Rita in the passenger seat 
           with Leisa on her lap. Sea breeze blowing in their faces, 
           sail boats racing on the horizon. Chuck Berry’s “Maybellene” 
           plays loud on the radio.

           Rita abruptly shuts off the music. 

                                 RITA
                        How can we possibly afford this?

                                 STEEVES
                        I had it in my mind that I’d tell 
                        you with our feet in the sand. 

                                 RITA
                        Where did the money come from?

           Steeves is let down by his wife’s tone.
                                 STEEVES
                        The Post. They’re paying me ten 
                        thousand for the exclusive.

           Rita turns her attention to the coastline. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I imagined this going differently.

                                 RITA
                        I don’t know what to say. That’s an 
                        incredible amount of money, David.  

                                 STEEVES
                        Money is necessary. We can’t bring 
                        up Leisa in an orderly way without 
                        money-- we can’t eat, or think in 
                        an orderly way without money.

                                 RITA
                        We don’t need more than we have. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Rita. We’re living in your mother’s 
                        basement.

                                 RITA
                        Until we figure out what’s next.

                                 STEEVES
                        I’ll tell you what’s next. We’re 
                        moving our family to California. 
                        The Air Force will approve the 
                        transfer, they owe me that much. 

                                 RITA
                        California? Why would we leave?

           Steeves touches her leg. 

                                 STEEVES
                        We used to dream about a life like 
                        that, remember? For all we’ve been 
                        through, we deserve this! And a 
                        whole helluva lot more. This 
                        exclusive is our golden ticket out 
                        of this... stagnant life.

           Rita shuts down completely. Steeves powers through a bend in 
           the road, taken aback by Rita’s reaction. 
           He flips on the radio-- Elvis’ “Blue Suede Shoes” drowns out 
           the heavy silence as Steeves focuses on the turns ahead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER BANK - LATER

           Steeves squats by a tree, attempting to shit. It’s a clear 
           day. Blue skies. He fills out his flight suit with the build 
           of Johnny Unitas; beard just beginning to grow in. 

           All the sudden, Steeves starts to sing.

                                 STEEVES
                             (tone deaf, off rhythm)
                        Well you can knock me down, step in 
                        my face, slander my name, all over 
                        the place. Do anything that you 
                        want to do, but uh-uh, honey, lay 
                        off of my blue suede shoes.

           Steeves peers over the rim of his unbroken Aviators at his 
           marred boots, laughing-- finding real solace in this song.   

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        You can do ANYTHING, but stay off 
                        my blue suede shoes...

           Then, just as Steeves is about to have the first bowel 
           movement he’s had in days... 

           A faint, almost imperceptible HUM.

           Steeves peeks up through the tree canopies and there it is, 
           far in the distance--

           A PLANE crisscrossing the sky, headed towards him in a slow, 
           methodical pattern...

           A search pattern. 

           Steeves spots a clearing up ahead, pulls up his flight suit, 
           and charges toward it. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        HERE! 

           His face pales-- frail muscles strain as he breaks into a 
           limping jog, seething with every stride... 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        DOWN HERE! 
           Just as he’s about to reach the clearing, his sprained left 
           leg BENDS AT THE ANKLE, sending all 180 pounds of Steeves 
           plummeting... 

           HEAD HITTING ROCK with a SICK THUD. 

           EXT. WOODS - SIERRAS - DUSK 

           ALIVE, Steeves stirs. Blinks. A groggy hand swipes off his 
           SHATTERED AVIATORS; face awash with confusion.  

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. TRAILER -  SELMA, AL -  NIGHT

           Blair’s Ford is parked down the street from a row of trailers 
           inhabited by airmen, down the road from the Craig Air Base. 

           INT. FORD - CONTINUOUS

           Blair flips through a file with the name “CAPTAIN RONALD 
           WEBBER.” We spot the photo of the man from the Air Force 
           base, who SUDDENLY appears at the window, gripping a crowbar.

                                 WEBBER
                        Why are you after me?! 

           Blair holds his hands up.

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m going to roll my window down. 

           Blair cranks his window a couple inches. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get too many visitors out 
                        this way?

           Webber doesn’t know what to make of him.

                                 WEBBER
                        Who are you?

                                 BLAIR
                        Just a guy interested in what you 
                        might have to say, Captain. 
           INT. TRAILER - LATER

           Blair sits at a breakfast nook in the sparse trailer. Webber 
           leans against the door, maintaining distance. 

                                 BLAIR
                        We’re on a story about an airman 
                        who taught aviation while you were 
                        a cadet. 

                                 WEBBER
                        Lieutenant David Arthur Steeves. 
                        Why talk to me?

           Blair nods.

                                 BLAIR
                        Just running background.

                                 WEBBER
                        You drove all the way out here in 
                        the middle of the night, for what-- 
                        my endorsement of the guy?

                                 BLAIR
                        I know you had a word with the Base 
                        Commander a week before Steeves 
                        fell out of the sky. 

           Webber cocks his head. Not what he was expecting. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        And I saw you last Friday having a 
                        friendly chat with the OSI. 

                                 WEBBER
                        So you want to know why one day the 
                        Lieutenant’s teaching us the ropes 
                        on the T-33 and the next he’s 
                        scrubbing grease off propellers?

                                 BLAIR
                        Why did the base commander strip 
                        his authority, weeks before he 
                        disappeared?

                                 WEBBER 
                        I tell you that, I lose my wings.

           Blair’s interest spikes. Webber smiles. It’s unsettling.  
                                 WEBBER (CONT’D)
                        Everybody wants to believe in 
                        miracles. So bad they’d ignore the 
                        facts staring them dead in the eye. 

           Blair meets Webber’s stare and doesn’t blink.

                                 BLAIR
                        Let’s say I’m someone who doesn’t 
                        believe in anything. What would you 
                        tell me then? 

                                 WEBBER
                        I’d tell you off the record what I 
                        told the OSI on.

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh. And what’s that? 

           Webber looks at Blair’s note pad. Blair slides pen and pad in 
           his back pocket, respecting the ‘off record’ request. Then, 
           with earnest intensity--  

                                 WEBBER
                        The whole nation’s been hoaxed.

           INT. BAR - FAIRFIELD, CT - NIGHT

           Al sets two pints of ale down on a bar table. Steeves sits 
           across the booth, eyeing the pint like it’s an old friend.  

                                 STEEVES
                        I don’t understand it. 

                                 AL
                        I love, Rita. I do. But she’s 
                        always been a bit of puzzle, hasn’t 
                        she?  

                                 STEEVES
                        I should take some blame for this. 

                                 AL
                        Listen to you. Remember when we 
                        started up that detailing shop? 

           Steeves smiles at the memory.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Correct me if my memory is fuzzy 
                        but I recall finishing the last car 
                        of the day, and there you are, 
                        counting bills.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        You tell me, ‘every one of these 
                        puts me one step closer to setting 
                        my family up right’... Your 
                        intentions are more pure than a 
                        monk’s. Now enjoy this drink with 
                        me, godammit.  

           Al holds up his glass. Steeves hesitates... then gives in, 
           raising his pint.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        To the High Sierras. And the low 
                        valleys. And all the land you 
                        roamed and pissed on in between.  

           Steeves cheers his glass on Al’s. 

           Al pounds his drink. When Steeves goes to set his pint down, 
           Al mimes for him to continue. Steeves drains the drink. They 
           slam their glasses down at the same time, laughing. 

           Al spots a couple of attractive WOMEN in a nearby booth. 

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Another round. To clear your head.

           INT. KITCHEN - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Rita scrubs a pot furiously with a dish rag. Esther puts her 
           hand on the short of her back. 

                                 ESTHER
                        I know it’s hard, Rita. I do. But 
                        you must be strong.

                                 RITA
                        I had an entire new life ahead of 
                        me. Carefully constructed. Do you 
                        understand? 

                                 ESTHER
                        What will the paper say if you 
                        don’t stand by his side? They’re 
                        calling him a hero, so what would 
                        that make you? Think of Leisa.

           Rita turns to face her mother. 

                                 RITA
                        I was happy, almost carefree, in 
                        school.

                        When I finally let myself think of 
                        it, for the first time I knew how 
                        shallow our marriage had been-- how 
                        much had been missing from it. He’s 
                        turning back into who he was 
                        before. Reckless, vain... 

           Esther takes a seat at the table. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Your father, before we married, 
                        once told me that he could never be 
                        enough. I took that to heart, and 
                        when he passed, I had plenty other 
                        things to live for. Including you.

           Rita sets the pot on a rack, excuses herself.

                                 RITA
                        Your husband never came back to 
                        life. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Rita... 

           A door shuts. Esther sighs. 

           INT. BEDROOM - BEN HIBB’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Ben stirs awake to the sound of his telephone RINGING. He 
           fumbles in the dark, answers the call. 

                                 BEN
                        Yes? 

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           Blair in a phone booth, off the side of a rural highway.

                                 BLAIR
                        We need to pull the exclusive. 

           INTERCUT

           Ben slides on his glasses as his mind wakes. 

                                 BEN
                        That’s not happening. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I have reason to believe the 
                        Lieutenant is perpetuating a hoax.  
           Ben’s eyes open wide-- now fully awake. 

                                 BEN
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 BLAIR
                        He’s not who he says he is. 

                                 BEN
                        You went to the mat for this guy, 
                        Blair. Curtis is invested big. 
                        Shit, the whole nation is waiting 
                        for this story!
                             (beat)
                        What hoax?! 

           Blair’s face narrows, realizing he doesn’t have all the 
           pieces yet. His silence distresses Ben further.

                                 BLAIR
                        I’ll put it together.  

                                 BEN
                        What the hell is going on? Blair?!

           A BIG RIG kicks up a cloud of dirt as it ROARS by the booth. 

           Blair hangs up, and hurries out.

           INT. BAR - FAIRFIELD, CT. - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Al and Steeves sit with the women Al was eyeing earlier. Al 
           is engaged in boozy banter, but Steeves’ mind is elsewhere. 

                                 AL
                        I’m telling the truth. He’s the 
                        guy. One day, you’re gonna see him 
                        starring in a picture ‘bout his own 
                        life. 

                                 RED LIPS
                        Can’t be him. In the papers he has 
                        that big smile. 

                                 AL
                        Dave.

           Steeves comes to. 

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        I think she’d like to see you 
                        smile. 
                                 STEEVES
                             (unsmiling)
                        ...excuse me.

           Steeves slides out of the booth. Al tries to keep up the 
           tempo as Steeves stumbles away.  

                                 AL
                        How ‘bout the smile of a real flier 
                        -- one who didn’t down his jet?

           HALLWAY

           Steeves balances against the wall near a pay phone. He picks 
           up the receiver, and dials zero. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Laura Miller, Oakland. This is 
                        David Steeves. 

           Steeves holds on the line. Eyes glazed and lonely.

                                 LAURA MILLER (ON PHONE)
                        David? Oh god, is it really you? 

           INT. BASEMENT - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           Footsteps descend the staircase in the dark. Rita is beneath 
           her sheets, pretending to sleep. Steeves takes a seat on the 
           edge of her bed. Rita has her back to him.  

                                 STEEVES
                        You don’t have to say anything. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve messed up, more times than I 
                        can count. 

           Steeves scratches his beard.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        You’ve no reason to trust me. I’m 
                        asking with all my heart you do.

           He sniffs, fighting back emotion.  

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Come with me to Kings Canyon. Let 
                        me prove to you who I am now.  

           Steeves waits for a response. Rita stays silent and still. 

           After a long moment, he rises from the bed, heads back 
           towards the stairs. Movement in the sheets, then--
                                 RITA
                        David. 

           Steeves turns. Rita sits up in the darkness. 

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll go. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Steeves and Rita sit beside each other. Rigid.

           A few rows ahead, a newly wed COUPLE laugh at a private joke. 
           Her head rests on his shoulder. His hand rubs her leg.

           They both study the couple, silently comparing.

           INT. CEDAR GROVE RANGER STATION - DAY

           Steeves’ GEAR is in a corner, staged like a museum display. 

           Blair leans in to get a better look at the parachute. He 
           hasn’t changed his clothes, or slept a wink. 

           Scrappy appears over his shoulder.

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Fabric’s singed from the heat of 
                        the ejection thrusters. 

           Blair rubs the ashen fabric between his fingers. 

                                 SCRAPPY (CONT’D)
                        We don’t usually let folks touch 
                        the artifacts. 

           Blair gives him the side-eye: ‘artifacts?’  

                                 SCRAPPY (CONT’D)
                        Found it bundled up near Dusy 
                        Basin. 

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s where he landed? 

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Slid down into the basin from the 
                        ledge where he landed. Lucky break. 
                        Ain’t too many flat spots 
                        thereabouts. 

           Blair clocks the ‘good fortune’ and digs further.
                                 BLAIR
                        Steeves ever mention why he left 
                        behind a parachute designed to keep 
                        him warm?

           Scrappy never considered this. 

                                 SCRAPPY
                        Must not have been thinking 
                        straight. 

           Blair studies all the life-saving tools Steeves’ left behind. 
           Gene stands nearby, noticing Blair’s skeptical gaze. 

                                 GENE
                        Mr. Blair. May I have a word?

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Gene walks down the hallway with Blair. 

                                 GENE
                        Anybody told you about the fire?

           Blair shakes his head. 

                                 GENE (CONT’D)
                        Blew straight through town-- burned 
                        down my barn-- took ten head of 
                        cattle with it. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Jesus-- where’d it start from? 

                                 GENE
                        Simpson Meadow. Forensics tells us 
                        it sparked before Steeves came 
                        knocking.

                                 BLAIR
                        He would’ve seen the flames?

                                 GENE
                        If he was where he said he was, 
                        he’d not only have seen the fire, 
                        he’d have had to survive it.

                                 BLAIR
                        If I’m understanding correctly-- 
                        you’re saying Steeves lied to you.  
                                 GENE
                        If an omission is the same as a 
                        lie... make of it what you will. 

           A taxi pulls up to the station, Steeves and Rita inside. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Can you take us there today? 

                                 GENE
                        Sure. We’ll see what he says. Must 
                        have just slipped his mind.    

                                 BLAIR
                        You believe that? 

           Roger watches Salty rearrange the ‘artifacts.’ 

                                 GENE
                        Well, not all of us are so 
                        convinced we have the whole 
                        picture.

           EXT. CEDAR GROVE RANGER STATION - LATER

           Steeves and Rita step out of the taxi. A star-struck DRIVER 
           hurries to unload their luggage from the trunk.

           In the light of day, surrounded by fresh greenery and budding 
           flowers, the ranger station has a much warmer hue. 

                                 STEEVES
                        It looks... different.

           Blair pops out of the station, and holds up a hand. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Lieutenant. 

           Steeves greets Blair with a strong handshake.

                                 STEEVES
                        Mr. Blair. This is my wife, Rita. 

                                 BLAIR
                        We met back in Fairfield. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Oh yes, that’s right. 

                                 RITA
                        Hello, again.
           Rita notes the red in Blair’s eyes, his weary gaze. Something 
           curiously morose about him. Steeves misses this entirely.  

                                 STEEVES
                             (enthusiastic)
                        Well, should we hit the trail? 

           EXT. VALLEY - KINGS CANYON NATIONAL PARK - DAY

           Steeves, Rita, Blair and Gene ride donkeys over rocky 
           terrain. Supplies are loaded on a fifth donkey, tied to and 
           trailing Gene’s animal in the rear of the pack.  

           Wild grass and dandelions crunch underfoot, the valley alive 
           with fresh spring growth. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I hardly recognize this... Looks a 
                        whole lot more inviting now. 

                                 BLAIR
                        How would you describe it then?

                                 STEEVES
                        Like stepping into an empty ice 
                        box, and the door locks behind you.

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s right. You said the same on 
                        Godfrey.

           Blair notes Rita’s rigid stature-- trying to decipher if she 
           might be an accomplice in the potential charade.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                             (to Rita)
                        Had you been to the Sierras before 
                        the ordeal? Family trip, perhaps? 

           Steeves interjects.

                                 STEEVES
                        No, Sir.

                                 BLAIR
                        But you’ve flown over?

                                 STEEVES
                        Sure, many times.

                                 BLAIR
                        So you must have been somewhat 
                        familiar with the terrain?
           Steeves laughs.

                                 STEEVES
                        About as familiar as a telescope is 
                        with Mars. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (sneers)
                        You’re nothing if not quotable.

           Steeves is unsure what to make of the remark.

           INT. SHED - SIMPSON MEADOW - LATER

           Steeves leads the crew into the shed. As they inspect the 
           dwelling, he stands in the doorway, flooded with flashbacks. 

           Rita runs a finger over the carving in the wall: Sorry for 
           the mess -- Lt. David Steeves, stung by its deeper meaning. 

           Gene mills about. Presumably looking for matches, a fire 
           starter, or any evidence of arson.

                                 BLAIR
                        Miracle you found this place.

           Blair opens drawers. Everything has been emptied-- eaten or 
           used. He snaps photographs of every nook and cranny. 

                                 GENE
                        Sure is-- only supply shed fifty 
                        miles in any direction. 

           Blair snaps a photo of the map carved into the wood.

                                 BLAIR
                        If only your neighbor had been so 
                        lucky. Lieutenant Glenn Sutton.

           Steeves and Rita both turn, surprised to hear the name.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        He fell off the same flight path, 
                        correct? What was it-- a few months 
                        before you disappeared? 

                                 STEEVES
                        November 24th. That I do remember. 

                                 RITA
                        We were close with the Suttons. 
                                 BLAIR
                        Must have been difficult to watch 
                        the whole thing unfold twice over.

           Rita nods. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        The parallels are extraordinary. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Happens more often than the Air 
                        Force would care to admit.

           Blair notes Steeves’ clenched jaw, his trembling hands.

                                 BLAIR
                        Can you show me the deer trap? I’d 
                        like to see how you fastened it.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The quartet hikes through the brambles, arriving at a patch 
           of woods scorched and battered by the fire.

                                 BLAIR
                        Fire blazed through here, huh? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Guess so. The trap must have burnt 
                        along with the trees.

                                 BLAIR
                        Gene, how many fires pass through 
                        the Sierras early spring, in your 
                        tenure?

                                 GENE
                        Thirty years on the job-- this is a 
                        first. Season don’t start till late 
                        May. Nobody was prepared for it. 
                        Not least, my cattle. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (to Gene)
                        When would you say this started? 

           Gene points to tree stumps unburned up to about three feet.

                                 GENE
                        These stumps were spared, means 
                        they was under snow when the fire 
                        came through. That’s about three 
                        feet-- so, couple weeks ago.
                                 BLAIR
                        That’s about when you were hunkered 
                        down in Simpson Meadow, Lieutenant.

           Steeves stops in his path, clocking the inference. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Never saw smoke from the shed? 

                                 STEEVES
                        No, sir. 

           Blair presses further.

                                 BLAIR
                        Did you ever think to start a fire? 
                        That’s the first thing I’d do.

                                 STEEVES
                        I thought about it, sure. But if 
                        the fire jumped the river, it might 
                        have taken the shed. At the least, 
                        frighten away the game. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Is it possible an ember from one of 
                        your nightly fires caught wind and 
                        crossed the river anyway? 

           Steeves scratches his beard. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Anything’s possible, I suppose.

           Blair bends down with his camera, snaps a shot of the stump.

                                 BLAIR
                        You know Captain Webber said 
                        something strange to me when I 
                        spoke to him the other day.  

           Steeves pales, heart bumping against his chest. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        He said you were relieved as an 
                        instructor and reassigned as 
                        adjutant of a maintenance squad 
                        after certain incendiary remarks 
                        were made about the Air Force. 
                        Weeks before you went off the grid.

           Blair lets this linger a moment as Steeves sweats. 
                                 STEEVES
                        Webber’s not a source you should be 
                        trusting. 

           Blair picks up a burnt stick, then tosses it aside. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Well, not much else out here for us 
                        to find. Unless we happen upon your 
                        jet. Where do you think it’s gone 
                        to anyway?  

           Steeves steps closer to Blair, his knuckles white. 

                                 STEEVES
                             (bristles)
                        Ever since we started out, you’ve 
                        had this tone. Like you’ve got 
                        something to say, but for some 
                        reason, you’re not saying it. 

           Gene braces to rush in. 

                                 RITA
                        David.

           Steeves turns to Rita. Seeing her concern, he calms himself.

                                 STEEVES
                        That T-33 flew over my head at 455 
                        miles an hour, heading southeast 
                        with a busted fuselage. There’s 
                        absolutely no way for me to know 
                        what happened after I deployed from 
                        a malfunctioning jet, Mr Blair.  

           Blair stands his ground, unperturbed. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m sure we’ll have the answer soon 
                        enough. 

           He snaps another photo of the roots as Steeves watches on, 
           considering what else the journalist knows about him.

           EXT. KING’S CANYON NATIONAL PARK - LATER

           The ambient sounds of the forest crescendo as the four ride 
           their donkeys back, lost in thought. 
           EXT. RANGER’S STATION - KINGS CANYON NATIONAL PARK - DUSK

           The group returns to find a RED SEDAN parked in the lot.

           Steeves recognizes the car, but none of the others do. He 
           dismounts his donkey and ties her to a post with urgency.  

           He hurries into the station, ahead of the group, cursing 
           under his breath. Rita notes his odd behavior and follows.

           Blair and Gene hang back, taking their time tying up their 
           donkeys, trading glances.

           INT. RANGER’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Steeves walks a few steps inside. Looks around, frantic. 

                                 SCRAPPY
                        You have a visitor. 

           LAURA MILLER, 23, styled red hair, green eyes, eagerly steps 
           into the room from the hallway. 

                                 LAURA
                        Hi, David. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I told you the hotel lobby. 

           Laura stands in the middle of the room, vulnerable. Steeves 
           doesn’t move to greet her. 

                                 LAURA
                        I couldn’t wait. 

           Rita enters the room behind him. He turns to her, then back 
           to Laura, heavy silence hanging in the air. 

           INT. BREAK ROOM - RANGER’S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Rita, Steeves and Laura are seated around a small table.

                                 STEEVES
                        I asked Laura to come so you could 
                        meet... and know we’re through. 

           Rita tenses. Laura looks surprised. Saddened. Apparently she 
           was unaware of Steeves’ intentions for her trip.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Laura. Please tell her it’s over. 
           Laura clenches her jaw. 

           INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Blair steps inside and approaches Scrappy. 

                                 SCRAPPY 
                        Hate to be in the middle of that.

           Blair adjusts his angle to see Laura. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Who is she?

           Scrappy gives him a look like “put it together yourself.”  

           INT. BREAK ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Rita shields tears with trembling hands. 

                                 RITA
                        ...are you incapable of thinking? 

                                 STEEVES
                        I only ever think of us-- why else 
                        would she be here? 

           Laura laughs in disbelief.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Tell her it’s over. Please.  

                                 LAURA
                        It is over, David. You get what you 
                        want. Again. 
                             (to Rita)
                        I’m sorry, honey. All this time I 
                        convinced myself he was worth the 
                        heartache. He’s not worth a damn.

           Laura storms out. Steeves watches her go; the scope of what 
           he’s done finally sinking in.

                                 STEEVES
                        This is the only way you’d know for 
                        certain.

           Steeves touches his wife’s hand. Then goes after Laura. 
           Trying to fix a situation that simply cannot be fixed. 

           We stay with Rita. Her eyes freezing over. The last hint of 
           love for her husband flickers out before our eyes.  
           EXT. RANGER’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Steeves barrels through the door. He hurries after Laura as 
           she huffs off to her sedan. 

           We stay with Blair who clandestinely steps out to watch the 
           scene unfold. Gene appears by his side holding his own 
           camera. He snaps a photo of Steeves and Laura mid-dispute.  

           INT. BEN HIBBS’ OFFICE - SATURDAY EVENING POST - DAY

           Blair stands before Ben, working himself up.

                                 BLAIR
                        ...the guy’s a phony-- a con-man. 
                        It’s all smoke and mirrors.

           Ben’s eyes flit to the open door. 

                                 BEN
                        Shut the door.

                                 BLAIR
                             (ignoring the request)
                        We’re not paying him a dime, Ben. 

           Ben gets up and shuts the door himself.

                                 BEN
                        A liar and a cheat can still pull 
                        himself out of the wild.

           Blair produces a series of PHOTOS from the Sierras, spreading 
           them out all over Ben’s desk. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s not a question of whether 
                        Steeves was in the Sierras-- how 
                        and why he ended up there is what 
                        we need to be asking. 

           Ben sifts through a few of the photos. 

                                 BEN
                        What reason would the Lieutenant 
                        possibly have for perpetuating a 
                        hoax on a national scale?  

                                 BLAIR
                        He needs some way of explaining why 
                        his jet is gone. Who’s going to 
                        argue with a hero.  
           Ben looks up from a photo, unsettled. 

                                 BEN
                        Let me stop you right there. We’re 
                        not pulling the exclusive. We would 
                        never survive that kind of fallout 
                        with Curtis. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Well then we’re at an impasse, Ben, 
                        cause I’m sure as hell not putting 
                        my byline above the words of a 
                        traitor. 

                                 BEN
                        Traitor? Jesus Christ... 

           Blair lets it sink in. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You think he’s a closet pinko? That 
                        he, what-- sold his jet to the 
                        Soviets then sold us a narrative? 

                                 BLAIR
                        I think we gotta pull the plug.

           Blair straightens his stance. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        There’s no easy way around it. We 
                        can’t be caught paying a guy we 
                        know at the very least is peddling 
                        lies. We need to kill the story, 
                        and make that known to the public.

                                 BEN
                        This isn’t coming out of spite? 

           The question catches Blair off guard. He raises a brow.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You trusted Steeves. And now it 
                        seems you may have been duped. 
                        What’s worse, he nearly conned you 
                        into duping the nation. The very 
                        nation you laid your life on the 
                        line to defend. 
                             (beat)
                        If it’s true-- it’s treason. But it 
                        also may be personal for you-- 
                        humiliation has a funny way of 
                        clouding even the most straight-up 
                        man’s judgment. 
                                 BLAIR 
                        Why’d you bring me on if you think 
                        I’m that much of a hack? 

                                 BEN
                        Act rashly, and you may do 
                        something we can’t come back from. 

           Blair looks him in the eye, surprised. 

                                 BLAIR 
                        So it’s my decision? 

           Ben’s silence confirms it is. 

           INT. BLAIR’S OFFICE - SATURDAY EVENING POST - LATER

           Blair sits at his desk with his back to an open door. Several 
           REPORTERS peer in from the bullpen. 

                                 BLAIR
                        This is a courtesy call, Officer. 
                        Not a consultation. 

           INT. MCGINNIS’ OFFICE - CASTLE AIR BASE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Officer McGinnis paces nervously, on the call. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Do you think we’d ever put a 
                        traitor on the national stage? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Honestly, I’m not sure you bothered 
                        to check.  

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Let us handle this. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m not standing in your way. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                             (panicking)
                        This line between us will be cut-- 
                        forever. Do not do this, Mr. Blair. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s already done. 

           Blair hangs up. McGinnis SLAMS his phone down on the 
           receiver.
           INT. WAREHOUSE - REPUBLIC AVIATION - LONG ISLAND, NY - DAY

           SPARKS shower down from the wing of an F-105 Thunderchief, a 
           sleek, new model fighter jet, about to join the fleet.  

           A WELDER stands at the top of a ladder, modifying an external 
           hard point. Metal SHRIEKS, echoing off the high ceilings.  

           General LeMay stands at a distance, hands behind his back. 
           Officer McGinnis approaches, guided by a SECURITY OFFICER.

           His hand trembles as he fights to stand tall.

                                 MCGINNIS
                        Sir. The Post... they’re pulling 
                        the exclusive.

           Lemay turns red with anger. But not surprise. 

                                 MCGINNIS (CONT’D)
                        You see, there were some 
                        discrepancies in his story--   

                                 LEMAY
                        Put out a statement that the OSI is 
                        investigating his disappearance.

           A long pause as McGinnis’ world flips. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        I had no idea, Sir. 

                                 LEMAY
                        Yeah, no shit. Now you’re going to 
                        undo all you’ve done, before we act 
                        on a mountain of intelligence your 
                        department somehow overlooked. 

           McGinnis pales. 

                                 MCGINNIS
                        It’s true then. He’s a communist.

           LeMay keeps his steely stature. The Security Officer 
           approaches. 

                                 SECURITY OFFICER
                        General. I have President 
                        Eisenhower on the line.

           Fear flashes in Lemay’s eyes as he leaves McGinnis staring at 
           the SPARKS flying off the jet like fireworks.
           INT. KITCHEN - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY

           Rita prepares a sandwich for Steeves who sits at the table, 
           drinking a beer and browsing the classified section. 

           Leisa plays with a doll at his feet, gazing up at her dad, 
           longing for him to join. Steeves fails to notice.

           Rita drops the plate on the table, carrying on into the next 
           room. Steeves looks up momentarily from the paper, shaking 
           his head at his wife’s cold shoulder. 

                                 LEISA
                        Daddy...

           Steeves answers from behind the paper.

                                 STEEVES
                        Yeah, honey?

                                 LEISA
                        How come you lied? 

           Steeves sets the paper down. She has his attention. 

                                 STEEVES
                        What’d you say?   

                                 LEISA
                        Mommy told Grandma you lied. 

                                 STEEVES
                        About what?

           Leisa shrugs. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                             (unnerved)
                        Well, she’s wrong. 

           Leisa returns to her doll. 

                                 LEISA
                             (sotto)
                        Mommy’s never wrong. 

           Steeves prepares a rebuttal, but swallows it. Watching his 
           daughter bounce her doll, he downs the last of his beer. 

           HALLWAY

           Sifting through the mail, Rita comes across a letter from the 
           Saturday Evening Post. It’s an official document typed on the 
           Post’s stationary.
                                 RITA
                             (calling out)
                        David. 

           EXT. THE SATURDAY EVENING POST - DAY

           A small press conference; a DOZEN REPORTERS in formation 
           around Blair. 

                                 BLAIR
                        The Saturday Evening Post has 
                        decided to pull the exclusive with 
                        Lieutenant David Steeves due to 
                        certain discrepancies found in his 
                        account of survival. We are a 
                        publication that values integrity 
                        and we will not compromise our 
                        ethics for any story. That is all 
                        we’ll say on the matter.

           Blair turns his back and walks back into the building as the 
           reporters flood him with unanswered questions. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY

           Steeves paces-- on a call. 

                                 STEEVES 
                        You tell him to return my call as 
                        soon as possible.

           Steeves hangs up, exasperated. A knock at the door draws his 
           attention. 

           Steeves peels back the window blinds to find: Buicks and 
           Chevys parked on the curb. Additional REPORTERS exiting their 
           cars, approaching the house...

                                 RITA 
                        Don’t answer it.

           Steeves ignores Rita. He crosses to the door and opens it. 

           We recognize familiar faces. Reporters that laughed, joked 
           and pat Steeves on the back when he was an undisputed hero-- 

           Now they’ve come with pitchforks. 

                                 REPORTER #1  
                        Lieutenant. Why is the Post pulling 
                        your exclusive?
                                 STEEVES
                        I have no idea. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        What ‘discrepancies’ did they 
                        uncover?

                                 STEEVES
                        I’ve told my story a hundred times 
                        before and it hasn’t changed. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Do you have any idea why Mr. Blair 
                        might think otherwise? 

           As the cluster of reporters grows into a herd, Steeves wakes 
           to the enormity of the situation... 

           VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE NATION RESPONDING:

           -A bundle of newspapers snipped by a blade. Front page of the 
           Bridgeport Press reveals: POST KILLS STORY OF LOST AIRMAN.

           -A newsstand in Times Square. NEW YORKERS flock, stopping to 
           examine Steeves’ face under the headline: HERO OR HOAXER?

           -PARK RANGERS in Cedar Grove DEBATE at the card table, 
           gesticulating wildly over a splayed newspaper. 

           -A reporter asks an Officer McGinnis to comment on Steeves 
           during a press conference. “Our Office of Special 
           Investigations is looking into it.”

           -Newsreel spins black and white footage of Steeves shortly 
           after his return from the wild. Now with ominous music and a 
           suspicious voice over relaying the newest developments. 
           PATRONS in the packed theater watch the scandal unfold. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY

           Steeves’ entire FAMILY gathers in the room, discussing the 
           situation in hushed conversations. The scandal is starting to 
           fracture their family.       

           Steeves speaks privately with his friend, Al. 

                                 AL
                        Have they asked about me? 

           Al’s wipes away a bead of sweat on his forehead. 

                                 STEEVES
                        No. 
                                 AL
                        Nothing about our detailing shop? 

           Steeves has much bigger fish to fry. But eases Al’s mind 
           nonetheless.

                                 STEEVES
                        I haven’t said a word.

                                 AL
                        Oh, thank Christ. 

           Al puts his arm on Steeves’ shoulder. 

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        If you can, buddy. Leave me out of 
                        it, okay? 

           Rita escorts three OFFICERS of the Office of Special 
           Investigation into the living room.  

           Al sees them, and spooks. He wanders off into another room, 
           leaving Steeves there, standing alone, staring at his wife.  

                                 OSI OFFICER
                        Thank you, Ma’am. 

           The thick, linebacker of an Officer brandishes a badge. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        Lieutenant Steeves. We’re with the 
                        Office of Special Investigation. 
                        I’m Officer Brooks. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Okay. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        We’re closing our accident report 
                        and have a couple questions we’d 
                        like to ask. Can we have you come 
                        with us? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Ask me what you want to know; I 
                        have nothing to hide. 

           Steeves’ family members quiet down, stealing glances. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        It’s best if we speak in private.
                                 STEEVES
                        If I get in the car with you, it 
                        will look like I’ve done something 
                        wrong. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        This is all very routine, 
                        Lieutenant. 

           Steeves scoffs. Opens the window blinds.  

                                 STEEVES
                        Why don’t you tell that to them. 

           EXT. RITA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY

           The OSI ushers Steeves through the mob, cutting through a 
           volley of FLASHING BULBS and onslaught of QUESTIONS. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BASIN - SIERRAS - DAWN - FLASHBACK

           Towering SNOW-CLAD MOUNTAINS bathe in the soft light of dawn. 
           Clouds nestled in their crevices. Snow caught in the breeze. 

           A fallen 10 foot dwarf pine is wedged against another. A 
           PARACHUTE splayed at their roots, barely visible under a 
           fresh sheet of snow. 

           Movement from underneath, then suddenly, the chute is tugged 
           from the center; YANKED down into a hole in the earth. 

           Steeves pops his head out of the cave, surprised to be alive. 
           His face is round, healthy; barely any facial hair. 

           He army-crawls out. Staggers to his feet. Squinting, he takes 
           in the wild. The dense crop of trees ahead, the rocky 
           inclines beyond. No path in sight. 

           Steeves takes a step toward his parachute-- SHRIEKS in pain, 
           falling backward on his ass. 

           He grabs at his right ankle. Peeling back his pant leg to 
           find RED SKIN, swollen and tender.  

           He exposes his left ankle. BUSTED just as bad.

                                 STEEVES
                        Christ.
           EXT. BASIN - MORNING

           HUFFING, Steeves crawls on his belly with a rock in hand, 
           elbow over elbow.

           Reaching a rock pile, he adds the stone in his hand, then 
           drags himself over to his dwarf pine shelter. 

           He leans against a tree, taking in the SOS of rocks and 
           sticks he’s built in the clearing. His body’s tracks veer in 
           all directions, been at this for hours.  

           DUSK

           Steeves’ back against the pine, bundled in his parachute.

           He wears his crash helmet and a thousand mile stare. 
           Unconcerned about the snowfall, or unaware of it. 

           SNOWFLAKES breeze over him, sticking to his thin layer of 
           facial hair; clouds low enough to hug the trees. 

           Several feet away, his SOS vanishes beneath the snowfall. 

           INT. SNOW CAVE - NIGHT

           FLAMES barely illuminate the walls of the cave. 

           Steeves trembles, holding the photo of the woman and the girl 
           on his chest that rises and falls with each shivering breath.

           EXT. BASIN - MORNING

           Steeves sets his eyes on a grove of trees fifty yards away.

           His feet are inexplicably BURIED IN SNOW MOUNDS. Boots and 
           wool socks strewn beside them. 

           He eases his feet out of the snow. Grabs his bloated right 
           foot and pivots, testing for pain. Nothing. Completely numb.

           Steeves pulls socks on. Hurriedly loads his feet into boots.

           He grabs hold of a branch he’s cut into a walking stick. 
           Wraps a strip of cut parachute around it, securing his hand 
           to the pine. 

           He DIGS his boots into ice. Prepares for pain. Using the 
           stick and the pine tree behind him, he RISES.

           Face flush from held breath, Steeves plants the stick a foot 
           ahead, then drags his boot behind. Feeling nothing, he takes 
           another step. And now he’s walking.
                                 STEEVES
                        YAW! 

           Steeves continues his paraplegic trek across the basin, 
           leaving his parachute and crash helmet behind. 

           A RED-TAIL HAWK circles high above, silhouetted against the 
           sunrise. From the hawk’s POV: Steeves is a distant star in a 
           teeming galaxy. Barely visible. Terrifyingly insignificant.

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAWN

           Steeves squats by a tree, attempting to shit. It’s a clear 
           day. Blue skies. He starts singing-- 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           INT. OFFICE - AIR FORCE BASE 

           Steeves sits across a table from Officer Brooks. Florescent 
           lights paint the white plaster walls a sickly yellow. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        You radioed in your position over 
                        Fresno at 11:12. That was the last 
                        we heard from you.

                                 STEEVES
                        Right, minutes later my fuselage 
                        exploded. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        You were en route from Oakland 
                        Municipal-- Pacific to your right-- 
                        heading south.

           Steeves rubs his face, tired-- annoyed. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Selma is south of Oakland, correct. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        Is it true you traveled to Mexico 
                        on April 24, 1955?

           This takes Steeves by surprise-- he straightens up. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I took my buddy for his birthday. 
                        We had some menudo at El Compadre. 
                        You want to write that one down?   
           Brooks looks up from his papers. Stern and unsmiling.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Yes, I went to Mexico.

           INT. INFIRMARY - AIR FORCE BASE  

           Steeves is poked and prodded by a FLIGHT SURGEON. Noticeable 
           difference in this medic’s demeanor, compared to the first.

           He runs through the same examination but this time with 
           suspicion, like a detective dusting for prints.

           INT. OFFICE - AIR FORCE BASE 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS 
                        In what city did this jaunt take 
                        place?

                                 STEEVES
                        Nogales.

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        Not much of a vacation destination. 
                        Why not Tijuana, or Rosarito?

                                 STEEVES
                        Closer drive.

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        Are you aware that Nogales is the 
                        sight of a communications tower, 
                        bought and paid for by the Soviets 
                        to pick up signals across the 
                        border? 

                                 STEEVES
                        No.

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        You didn’t happen to make any new 
                        friends in Nogales? 

           Steeves is incredulous. 

                                 STEEVES 
                        What is this-- I mean, what am I 
                        being accused of exactly?

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        I’m simply asking questions.
                                 STEEVES
                        We spent a week’s salary on 
                        tequila, overtipped the mariachi 
                        band, and I reported for duty on 
                        time and ready for PT as soon as my 
                        leave was up.

           Brooks makes note. Moves on.

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - AIR FORCE BASE

           A PSYCHOLOGIST holds up a Rorschach test to Steeves. 

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        What do you see here?

           Steeves studies it. Exasperated with the exercise. 

                                 STEEVES
                        A shrink holding a black smudge.
                        What the hell do you see?

           Off the psychologist’s stoic face, writing on his pad--

           INT. OFFICE - AIR FORCE BASE 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        A fire was reported in Kings 
                        Canyon, fairly close to a site you 
                        claimed to have passed through. 
                        What can you tell me about it?

           Steeves swallows; sweat peppers his brow. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I never saw a fire. 

           Officer Brooks checks a box, and takes a sip of water; 
           suspiciously accepting of Steeves’ answer.  

           INT. BLAIR’S OFFICE - THE SATURDAY EVENING POST - DAY

           Blair’s typewriter has shifted across his desk to make room 
           for his feet. He reclines with today’s Washington Post, 
           headline reading “DISCREPANCY FOUND IN LOST FLYER’S STORY.”  

           A knock on the door. His SECRETARY pops her head in. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        I have a Robert Corrigan from 
                        Northwestern Mutual on the line.
                                 BLAIR
                        Tell him I’m not interested. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        It’s the fifth time he’s called 
                        this week. You were on the road.

           The secretary crosses the room and drops five MESSAGE SLIPS 
           on Blair’s desk with his name, number, and time of call.

                                 BLAIR
                             (under breath)
                        Goddamn insurance salesmen.

                                 SECRETARY
                        He said it’s not a sales call. 
                        Sounds pretty urgent.

           Blair looks up, curious. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Put him through.

           He takes his feet down, and answers the ringing call.

                                 BLAIR (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Clay Blair Jr. Saturday Evening 
                        Post.

                                 ROBERT CORRIGAN (ON PHONE)
                             (over-excited)
                        Mr. Blair. Thank you for taking my 
                        call. Your flier... Lieutenant 
                        Steeves. I’ve been reading about 
                        him in the papers.

                                 BLAIR
                             (impatient)
                        You and the rest of the country.

                                 ROBERT CORRIGAN (ON PHONE)
                        Yes, yes. But did the rest of the 
                        country sell the Lieutenant a life 
                        insurance policy? 

                                 BLAIR
                             (curious)
                        When?

                                 ROBERT CORRIGAN (ON PHONE)
                        Month before he went off the grid.

           Blair’s eyes go wide.
                                 ROBERT CORRIGAN (ON PHONE) (CONT’D) 
                        Up-sold him a hefty package. But 
                        I’ll say-- he wasn’t all that hard 
                        to convince. 
                             (beat)
                        Didn’t think anything of it, until 
                        the rumblings started. Thought you 
                        should know. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Thank you Mr. Corrigan.

                                 ROBERT CORRIGAN (ON PHONE)
                        Can’t hardly sleep at night knowing 
                        I mighta done business with a 
                        commie. Shit, I pat the man on his 
                        back and shook his goddamn hand.

           Blair stares off, no doubt thinking the same.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Rita pushes Leisa in a cart full of groceries. Leisa spreads 
           her arms wide-- pretending that she’s flying. 

                                 LEISA
                        I’m flying, just like Daddy!

           Rita smiles solemnly. She fishes for keys as she nears her 
           car. A SUITED MAN steps out of his sedan, approaches. 

                                 SUITED MAN
                        Need a hand?

           Rita, startled. Smiles politely.  

                                 RITA
                        I can manage.

                                  SUITED MAN
                        Say, I recognize you. 

           Rita’s smile disappears. She ignores him, opens the trunk. 

                                 SUITED MAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re that airman’s wife. 

           Rita places Leisa into the back seat. 
                                 SUITED MAN (CONT’D)
                        He ain’t really a pinko, is he? Me 
                        myself, don’t believe the chatter, 
                        but these days, can’t be too 
                        careful. Here, let me help you--

           He steps forward to help Rita with the groceries and Rita 
           slaps him flat across the face. So sudden she’s even 
           surprised herself. 

                                 SUITED MAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, lady! 

                                 RITA
                        Please. Just let us be. 

           Rita slams the trunk, leaving half her groceries in the cart 
           and hustles into her car. Drives off in a huff.

           INT. OFFICE - AIR BASE - LATER

           Steeves is alone in the room now. No windows. No clock. 

           The walls-- and his demons-- closing in. 

           A transcript of his original statement sits on the desk. A 
           red pen beside it. The implication: amend the accident 
           report. He paces-- angered by the audacity of the exercise.

           He goes for the door. It’s locked. He knocks. No answer. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Hey!  

           He rattles the handle.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I’m done in here. 

           No response. Seething, Steeves kicks the door and then takes 
           a seat to compose himself. For a moment, it seems he has... 

           Until, abruptly, he stands and FLIPS THE TABLE OVER. He 
           charges the door. POUNDS ON IT. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what I did! Someone tell me 
                        what the fuck you think I did!

           EXT. RITA’S FAMILY HOME - FAIRFIELD, CT - DUSK

           Leisa sleeps in Rita’s lap, clinging to her mother. 
                                 RITA 
                        What am I supposed to do? 

           Rita’s mother, Esther, sits close by. We hear VOICES outside 
           the front door. Headlights slant through the blinds. 

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t continue on like this. 

           Esther touches her daughter’s trembling hand. Considering...

                                 ESTHER
                        Maybe it’s time you spoke your 
                        mind. 

                                 RITA 
                        I don’t know when I’ll see him 
                        next. I don’t even know where he 
                        is...

                                 ESTHER
                        Not to David, honey. To the press.

           Rita strokes her daughter’s twitching face, calming Leisa 
           from a bad dream. Her own nerves frayed beyond repair. 

           INT. OFFICE - AIR FORCE BASE - DUSK

           Steeves sits alone in the corner of the room. Disheveled and 
           silent. Hugging his knees. Brooks enters. He glances at the 
           upturned table-- decides to let it be. 

                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        Lieutenant. I’m happy to report 
                        that our investigation has 
                        concluded. You’re free to go. 

           But Brooks looks anything but happy. Steeves shakes his head, 
           and laughs to himself. 

                                 STEEVES
                        You know, you actually had me 
                        wondering for a second-- if I could 
                        possibly have done something wrong.  
                             (beat)
                        I’ve given my life to the Air Force 
                        and how do you repay me? Lock me in 
                        a room for twelve goddamn hours and 
                        make me question my own sanity. 

           Officer Brooks ignores him. 
                                 OFFICER BROOKS
                        We’ve arranged for a car to take 
                        you to the airport. If you’ll 
                        follow me...

           Officer Brooks opens the door wide for Steeves to exit.

           Brooks escorts Steeves down a narrow hallway. 

           Officer McGinnis and other OFFICIALS walk out of a meeting. 
           McGinnis locks eyes with Steeves momentarily before averting 
           his gaze and shifting to get by him. 

           Steeves watches McGinnis over his shoulder, waiting for some 
           acknowledgement that doesn’t come. McGinnis never looks back.  

           INT. TAXI CAB - FAIRFIELD, CT. - NIGHT

           Steeves sits in back of a cab. He catches the DRIVER eyeing 
           him in the rearview. 

           They pull into a cul-de-sac, swarming with REPORTERS. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Shit. Stop... Stop!  

           The car comes to an abrupt HALT. Steeves tosses a few dollars 
           in the front passenger seat and jumps out.

           EXT. RITA’S FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Steeves sneaks around the house. Enters through the backyard.

           INT. KITCHEN - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - SIMULTANEOUS

           Rita is on a call with a Reporter. A tabloid lays open on the 
           kitchen table. On the cover, a picture of Laura Miller and 
           Steeves outside Cedar Grove Ranger Station under the 
           headline: “LIEUTENANT’S MISTRESS SPEAKS OUT.” 

                                 RITA (ON PHONE)
                        When something happens on a 
                        national scale like this people 
                        have to play their roles.  

           Steeves enters quietly through the back door. 
                                 RITA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        No this is not at all connected to 
                        the recent developments. It started 
                        long before all this publicity--

           She turns, startled to see her husband in her house. 

                                 RITA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                             (rushed)
                        I have to go. 

           She hangs up. An awkward beat. 

                                 STEEVES
                        You’re letting them into our lives, 
                        Rita. Too close.  

                                 RITA
                        What choice do I have? I haven’t 
                        slept in a week. I need to separate 
                        from this. 

                                 STEEVES
                        You mean from me. 

                                 RITA
                        A long time ago, we were good-- 
                        really, truly, good together. But I 
                        don’t know who you are anymore. 
                             (beat)
                        And you certainly haven’t bothered 
                        to ask who I am. 
                             (beat)
                        Who are we pretending to be, David? 
                        And for what? 

           This hits Steeves hard. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I swore I’d never lie to you again 
                        and I’ve kept that promise since 
                        the day I walked out of those woods 
                        alive. What more do you want from 
                        me?

           Rita looks into his eyes for a long moment. Courage welling 
           up alongside her tears.

                                 RITA
                        I want a divorce, David.

           Steeves’ blanches, his knees nearly buckling. Devastated.  
           Leisa appears at the top of the stairs with tired eyes. Upon 
           seeing her father, she stirs awake, bounds down the stairs. 

                                 LEISA
                        Daddy!

           She runs to her father as Rita escapes into the backyard. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 

           Rita shuts the door behind her, fighting back tears. She 
           breathes. Gathers herself. Then finally, walks back inside. 

           INT. KITCHEN - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Rita walks through the kitchen to the living room. 

           David and Leisa are gone. 

                                 RITA
                        Leisa?

           She yells upstairs. 

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        Leisa! 

           No response. Deafening silence. Rita runs to the window and 
           throws open the blinds. The driveway is empty. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MATCH STRIKES A FLAME.

           EXT. GOD KNOWS WHERE - DEAD OF NIGHT 

           The flame flickers and settles, barely illuminating a barren, 
           bone-white SNOW CAVE. 

           STEEVES’ terrified face drops into frame. 

           Dizzy with claustrophobia; stiff with shock; freezing his 
           fucking balls off; a look of terror sharply contrasting his 
           clean-shaven, all-American build. First night in the wild. 

           He lowers the match to a pile of wood shavings. 

           BLUE LIPS blow on mars red kindling; quivering and crackling. 
           Tiny flames animate, the wood catching fire. 
           Steeves empties the contents of his BILLFOLD into his lap. He 
           feeds his Air Force ID to the fire; identity reduced to fuel. 

           He fingers a ONE DOLLAR BILL, trembling as he lights the 
           corner-- then watches the flame march across the bill, 
           devouring “IN GOD WE TRUST.”

           One item remains: the picture of Rita and Leisa.

           Steeves holds the photo over the flames, illuminating the 
           portrait. The flames lurch, but Steeves pulls back. 

           He folds the photo in half, then tucks it into his breast 
           pocket above the heart.

           Steeves reaches behind him, producing a CRASH-HELMET. He 
           straps it beneath his chin for added warmth. 

           He curls around the flames like a half-moon, hanging onto 
           life through violent shivers. The world outside WHISTLES and 
           HOWLS, relentless and portentous.  

           For the first time Steeves is forced to look inward. He’s not 
           an introspective man, and the feeling is bitter as the cold. 

           He lowers the sun visor on the helmet and settles in. Tiny 
           flames reflecting off black tempered glass. 

           EXT. BASIN - SIERRAS - DAWN 

           Towering SNOW-CLAD MOUNTAINS bathe in the soft light of dawn. 
           Clouds nestled in their crevices. Snow caught in the breeze. 

           Movement from underneath, then suddenly, the chute is tugged 
           from the center; YANKED down into a hole in the earth-- 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           INT. JAGUAR - CONTINUOUS

           Steeves races down the road with Leisa in the passenger seat. 
           No car seat. No seat belt. He’s taking sharp bends at break-
           neck speed.

           Leisa looks up at him-- innocent confusion melting into fear.  

           INT. KITCHEN - HARRY’S HOME - NIGHT

           Steeves sets Leisa down on the linoleum, tears in her eyes.
           Harry enters with a baseball bat at his side, responding to a 
           noise in the middle of the night. He rubs his eyes.

                                 STEEVES
                        Just for a few days.  

           Steeves trembles with adrenaline. Harry notes the despair in 
           his voice, in his pleading stance. Without question-- 

                                 HARRY
                        As long as you need. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S ROOM - HARRY’S HOME - MORNING

           Steeves sleeps on the floor beside a child’s bed. 

           A knock rattles him awake. He looks up through bleary eyes to 
           find his brother in the doorway, holding a cup of coffee.

                                 HARRY
                        Scrambled or sunny-side-up? 

           Steeves wipes his eyes.

                                 STEEVES
                        Whatever I tell you, the opposite 
                        is true.  

           INT. KITCHEN - HARRY’S HOME - DAY

           Steeves shuffles in. Harry’s wife, RUTH, reads the local 
           edition at the kitchen table. On the cover-- Steeves troubled 
           face. He catches a glimpse of the headline:  

           “AIR FORCE PROBING LIEUTENANT’S STORY.” She sets down the 
           paper, embarrassed to be caught reading about the scandal. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, David. 

           She stands. Hugs him. 

           Steeves takes a seat next to his six-year-old nephew, BOBBY, 
           playing airplanes with Leisa. 

                                 LEISA
                        Look what cousin Bobby has.

                                 RUTH
                        He wants to be a pilot. Just like 
                        his Uncle. 
           Bobby sets the jet down, shy from the attention. Steeves 
           picks it up and examines the components. 

                                 STEEVES
                        This is a dual-engine. Know how 
                        fast she can fly?

           Bobby shakes his head “no.”

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Over four-hundred miles an hour. 
                        Could take you from your house to 
                        school like this--

           Steeves SNAPS his fingers. Bobby’s eyes open wide. Steeves 
           hands back the plane. Bobby inspects the engine, mystified.

                                 RUTH
                        Way the world’s going-- I should’ve 
                        bought him a postal truck. 

           Steeves’ eyes fall on the paper. He can’t help himself.

                                 STEEVES
                             (to Ruth)
                        What’s it say?

                                 RUTH
                        Doesn’t matter. It’s all 
                        speculation. 

                                 STEEVES
                        What are they speculating? 

           Ruth, uncomfortable. But there’s part of her that’s morbidly 
           curious about this.

                                 RUTH
                        ...that you sold your jet.  

                                 HARRY
                        Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s not what I believe, of course. 
                        Who would you even sell it to? 

                                 STEEVES
                        The Soviets. 

           Ruth and Harry stare, stunned by his matter-of-fact tone. 
           Steeves leans back in his chair. He looks around at what his 
           life has become. Run out of his own home. Taken up the life 
           of a refugee.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to have a smoke. 

           He stands and grabs a Budweiser out of the Frigidaire on his 
           way out. Ruth looks at Harry, concerned.

           EXT. PORCH - HARRY’S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Steeves throws back the last of his beer. Tries to light his 
           tobacco pipe, but the Zippo’s out of fluid. So he tosses it.

           His brother joins him on the porch.

                                 HARRY
                        She doesn’t believe it, Dave. None 
                        of us do. 

                                 STEEVES
                        First they implied it was a hoax. 
                        Now they call me a traitor. 

                                 HARRY
                        Nobody’s saying--

                                 STEEVES
                        I’m just supposed to hang out to 
                        dry while strangers make up their 
                        minds about me?

                                 HARRY
                        No. You go back to your job. You 
                        keep your head up and your mouth 
                        shut. You ignore the press and take 
                        care of your family. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Rita will never take me back like 
                        this. And Leisa... What’ll she grow 
                        up thinking? 
                             (beat)
                        I’ll never have this-- what you’ve 
                        got here.

           Harry pauses, knowing that to be true. He searches for the 
           right words but they’re nowhere to be found. 

           A look of determination grows in Steeves’ eye.
                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I’m pushing back, Harry. There’s no 
                        other way.  

           EXT. HARRY’S HOME - EVENING

           Steeves stands on the front lawn; a group of REPORTERS hover. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Mr. Blair and the editors of the 
                        Saturday Evening Post have claimed 
                        that my account of survival has 
                        apparent ‘discrepancies.’ Well, 
                        what are those discrepancies 
                        exactly? I challenge the Post to 
                        come forward with any sort of 
                        evidence suggesting my account of 
                        survival is not the whole truth...

           A flurry of QUESTIONS and FLASHING BULBS. 

           INT. BLAIR’S OFFICE - THE SATURDAY EVENING POST - DAY

           A knock on the door. Blair doesn’t respond, typing away on a 
           new story. DENNIS, appears in the doorway.

                                 DENNIS
                        You should come read this. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (to Dennis)
                        I’m busy.

           Dennis holds up a paper with a shit-eating grin. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Your Lieutenant’s firing back. 

           The headline: “FLIER STICKS TO HIS STORY; ACCUSES THE POST OF 
           MISCONDUCT.” 

           Blair’s face sets like a rock. 

           INT. BEN HIBBS’ OFFICE - SATURDAY EVENING POST - DAY

           Blair enters, closes the door quietly behind him. 

           Ben Hibbs drops his newspaper, and with it, all of his 
           practiced civility.     
                                 BEN
                        This thing isn’t gonna just drift 
                        away and leave you be-- reporters 
                        will come after you, Blair. 
                        Investigate your investigation. Dig 
                        in to find out what you know. 
                        You’re becoming the subject of your 
                        own story; a serious liability to 
                        our publisher. Which makes you a 
                        serious liability to me. 

           Blair doesn’t counter, knowing this to be true. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What do you want me to do? 

                                 BEN
                        If we’re not going to publish the 
                        story, the public’s got to know 
                        why. 

           Blair shifts uncomfortable in his seat.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        All the discrepancies you presented 
                        me-- feed it to other outlets.

           Blair shakes his head. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Unless his jet is found in some 
                        warehouse behind the Iron Curtain 
                        we won’t have the hard evidence to 
                        attack more than his character--

                             (exasperated)
                        Lieutenant David Steeves is either 
                        a hero or a traitor. Make up your 
                        mind, Blair-- WHAT’S THE GODDAMN 
                        HEADLINE?

           INT. KITCHEN - CONDO - WASHINGTON, DC - NIGHT 

           Blair sits in silence at the dinner table with Agnes and 
           Kemp, mulling over his situation. 

                                 AGNES
                        Why don’t you tell your father what  
                        happened today?

           Kemp keeps his eyes on the flicking television; “Invasion of 
           the Bodysnatchers” plays in the living room.  
                                 KEMP
                        I, uh...

                                 AGNES
                        The book report.

                                 KEMP
                        I got an ‘A’ on my report.

                                 AGNES
                        And what book?

                                 KEMP
                        ‘The Boys Book of Jets.’

           A BLINDING WHITE LIGHT FLASHES, then the power dies, plunging 
           the family into darkness. Kemp yelps as chairs screech 
           against the linoleum-- rapid movement throughout the room. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s alright.

           Blair switches on a flashlight, near the window. He pulls 
           back the curtain, and peers outside. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Transformer blew. 

           He swings the flashlight to find his son huddled beneath the 
           table in a ‘duck and cover’ position, trembling. Agnes 
           crouched beside him, touching his back soothingly.  

                                 AGNES
                        We’re okay, baby. 

           Blair keeps the light on his family, absorbing the depth of 
           their fear. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Come on out, Kemp. Just an outage.

           But Kemp doesn’t move. He’s trembling. Blair walks to the 
           table, crouches, then slides under and sits next his wife and 
           son in the dark. He places his hand on Kemp’s head, trying to 
           allay his family’s fears as much as his own. 

           EXT. THE SATURDAY EVENING POST - DAY

           Blair stands before a large crowd of reporters. 
                                 BLAIR
                        It was not in our interest to spell 
                        out the discrepancies found in 
                        Lieutenant Steeves’ account of 
                        survival. We thought it unnecessary-
                        - malicious even. 
                             (long pause)
                        However, recent actions taken by 
                        the Lieutenant have provoked a 
                        response...

           INT. KITCHEN - HARRY’S HOME - DAY

           Ruth peaks through the blinds, eyeing the reporters on their 
           front lawn. 

                                 RUTH
                        They could at least pick the weeds.  

           Ruth turns to Harry and Steeves, each reading different 
           sections of the paper.

                                 HARRY
                        The timing doesn’t look good.

           Steeves hits the paper against the table in frustration.

                                 STEEVES 
                        The Air Force pulled its free life 
                        insurance program. 
                             (beat)
                        Sutton went down, and his family 
                        got nothing. Of course I bought my 
                        own policy. It was the responsible 
                        thing to do.

           Harry shakes his head sympathetically.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Blair has nothing solid beyond the 
                        fire. I’ll admit to starting it, 
                        then it all falls apart for him. 

           Ruth and Harry exchange a nervous look. 

                                 HARRY
                        Did you start it? 

           Steeves keeps his head buried in the paper. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Sure. To attract attention.  
           Harry and Ruth share a troubled look.

                                 HARRY
                        Why haven’t you told anyone?

                                 STEEVES
                        They were calling me a hero. Air 
                        Force wanted me to look the part. 
                        Well, heroes don’t start fires. 

                                 HARRY
                        Dave. How are you going to convince 
                        the press that’s all you haven’t 
                        told them... I mean, is there 
                        anything else we don’t know? 

           Steeves sets the paper down. Eyes Ruth and Harry. 

                                 STEEVES
                        How am I supposed to ‘keep my head 
                        up’ when even my own brother’s 
                        convinced I’m a liar. 

                                 HARRY
                        That’s not fair. 

           Steeves stands, working himself into a frenzy.

                                 STEEVES
                        I need the public support of the 
                        Air Force. Right now, my word 
                        doesn’t seem to mean much to 
                        anybody. 

           Steeves’ eyes are dark and baggy. His hair scraggly. Not 
           since the Sierras has he looked so lost and disturbed. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why don’t you take a breather. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Will you watch Leisa? I’ll be gone 
                        a few days. 

           Harry weighs his options. He has no other choice.

           INT. LOBBY - PENTAGON - DAY 

           Steeves’ wears a pressed military uniform. With a clean 
           shave, he looks younger, vulnerable. Innocent even. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Lieutenant. 
           Steeves snaps to attention.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        General LeMay will see you now.

           INT. GENERAL LEMAY’S OFFICE - PENTAGON

           Steeves walks into the office. He salutes Lemay who continues 
           working at a wide desk with nothing but a blotter and a pen. 

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                             (without glancing up)
                        At ease.

                                 STEEVES
                        I’m here to ask for your help, Sir.

           LeMay sets his pen down. Leans back in his chair.

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        Is that so?

                                 STEEVES
                        I think it’s only right that the 
                        Air Force come to my defense. The 
                        recent developments--

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        Are between you and the Post. 

                                 STEEVES
                        You’re just going to stand by as 
                        they cast doubt on an officer of 
                        the Air Force?  

           LeMay drums his fingers on the desk.

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        Have you heard of the RT-33A? 

           Steeves looks confused.   

                                 GENERAL LEMAY (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        Soviet aircraft. 
                             (beat)
                        I hadn’t either, until a few days 
                        ago when the NSA briefed the 
                        President and myself on the design 
                        for the new jet which they’ve found 
                        in the hands of the Soviets. 

           Steeves stares blankly. 
                                 GENERAL LEMAY (CONT’D)
                        Camera in the nose, additional 
                        recon equipment in the rear. It’s a 
                        spy plane with quite a few 
                        similarities to one of our own 
                        jets. 
                             (beat)
                        Some analysts have gone so far as 
                        to surmise it was modeled after the 
                        T-33. An aircraft you know 
                        intimately.

                                 STEEVES
                             (glaring)
                        I resent the implication.

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        Then answer me this one simple 
                        question, Lieutenant. Where is your 
                        goddamn jet? I’ve been looking, day-
                        in day-out for months, and nothing.

           Steeves takes a deep, fiery breath.

                                 STEEVES
                        I counted every search plane. All 
                        of them came and went in the first 
                        ten days. The sky went quiet after 
                        that. Didn’t seem all that valuable 
                        then. 

           LeMay sneers. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I can’t tell you where the jet’s 
                        gone. Just the same as you can’t 
                        tell me why you’d so readily toss 
                        one of your own to the wolves, with 
                        no hard evidence of wrongdoing.
                             (beat)
                        I’m no hero, General. Never was. 
                        You cooked that one up. But I’m 
                        sure as hell not a traitor either.

           Lemay considers the words carefully.

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        I’m assigning you to teach basic 
                        survival, Lieutenant. 
                             (acerbic)
                        Where your particular set of skills 
                        are better suited.
                                 STEEVES
                        Where I can’t touch another jet. 

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        I believe we’re done here.

                                 STEEVES
                             (cracking, desperate)
                        Don’t take away my wings.

                                 GENERAL LEMAY
                        I strongly suggest you salute me 
                        and walk out of this room before I 
                        throw in a demerit for 
                        insubordination. 

           Against every muscle in his body, as if dignity is paralyzing 
           his arm, he fights to salute the General, turns sharply, and 
           marches out of the room.

           EXT. BACKYARD - RITA’S FAMILY HOME - FAIRFIELD, CT - DAY

           Steeves walks outside, dropping his luggage by the door. 

           Birthday decorations litter the backyard-- half-eaten cake, 
           sinking balloons. The remnants of Leisa’s party that Steeves 
           missed.

           Leisa and Bobby tackle Harry on the lawn. He falls to the 
           ground, theatrically as the children giggle. 

           Steeves’ eyes settle on Rita across the yard, sitting beside 
           Ruth. 

           Ruth spots him standing at a distance. She says something 
           consolatory to Rita, pats her leg, then walks off, leaving an 
           open seat next to her. 

           Steeves approaches, painfully slow. He takes the seat beside 
           Rita, and they sit in silence, watching Leisa play.

                                 RITA
                        David--

                                 STEEVES
                        I’ve already contacted a lawyer. 
                        I’m not giving up until The Post 
                        admits to wrongdoing.

           Rita doesn’t budge, keeping her eyes on her daughter. 
                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Everything I went through, 
                        everything that’s happening to me-- 
                        to us-- it means nothing unless I 
                        can find a way to bring our family 
                        together again.

           Leisa spins in circles until she falls down, dizzy. 

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Rita. 
                             (desperate)
                        All that’s good in my life is 
                        because of you.

           Staring straight ahead, in a tone devoid of all emotion-- 

                                 RITA
                        I’m taking her with me, David. 
                        Don’t try to speak to us again.

           Rita stands, strolls towards Leisa, picks her up from the 
           grass, and tickles her as she laughs in her mother’s arms. 

           Rita holds her over her shoulder and walks towards the house. 
           Steeves meets eyes with his daughter, who gazes at him with 
           confusion and longing as Rita pulls back the screen door and 
           disappears into the house.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - BOLLING AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

           Steeves is led inside by a timid CADET. 

                                 CADET
                        That’s your station. All the basic 
                        survival materials are there for 
                        your review. 

           The Cadet leaves Steeves alone in the empty hangar. Dusty 
           manuals stacked high on the dimly lit, metallic desk.  

           INT. CLASSROOM - BOLLING AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

           Steeves stands in front of a group of CADETS in a sparse, 
           dark classroom. He flips to a new slide that features an 
           edible berry. 

                                 STEEVES
                             (uninspired)
                        This was one of the berries that 
                        saved my life. You’ll find them in 
                        thickets of tall grass.
           Steeves switches to a new slide: him outside of the Cedar 
           Grove Ranger Station in Kings Canyon. Only someone has etched 
           “TRAITOR” over the slide. 

           Steeves glances around him, noting the steely tension in the 
           room. He switches to the next slide without a word about it. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Steeves sits across from a LAWYER and a REPRESENTATIVE from 
           Curtis Publishing. His lawyer, SAMUEL B PICONE, by his side. 

           Ties loose. Water cups empty. They’ve been negotiating a 
           settlement for hours.

                                 SAMUEL B PICONE 
                        To avoid a hearing, Curtis 
                        Publishing Company agrees to award 
                        my client ten thousand dollars for 
                        failing to live up to agreements 
                        made.

           One lawyer whispers to the other. After a beat, he nods. 

                                 LAWYER
                        Curtis Publishing accepts. 

           Sam pats Steeves on the back. 

           EXT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Steeves exits the building, lights his tobacco pipe.   

           He glances around the near-empty parking lot. No one there to 
           document this victory. 

           INT. BLAIR’S OFFICE - SATURDAY EVENING POST - DAY

           Blair’s eyes creep over his typewriter to spy on the SUITED 
           MEN huddled in the conference room, speaking with Ben Hibbs. 

           Ben stands and shakes hands with the men. He holds the door 
           open and they funnel out into the bullpen. A few of them 
           trade glances with Blair as they pass his office.

           Standing up straight by the door of the conference room, Ben 
           signals for Blair.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Blair and Ben, eye to eye. 

                                 BEN
                        Well.

                                 BLAIR
                             (resigned to his fate)
                        Pack it up? 

                                 BEN
                        Congratulations. You’ve been bumped 
                        to Managing Editor. 

           Blair blinks, dumbfounded. Then, worried for Ben--

                                 BLAIR
                        What about you? 

                                 BEN
                        Editor-in-Chief.

           Blair furrows his brow, he can’t believe it.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Readership’s at an all-time high; 
                        they attribute it to your 
                        uncompromising pursuit of the 
                        truth. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I still don’t know the truth.  

                                 BEN
                        That’s alright. Seems like 
                        everybody else does. 

           Blair doesn’t react. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you said it yourself-- was 
                        there any other option?

           Ben pats him on the shoulder and walks out of the room, 
           leaving Blair to ruminate on the question.

           INT. OFFICE - BOLLING AIR BASE - DAY

           Steeves speaks with a BASE COMMANDER, gathering paperwork on 
           his desk.
                                 BOLLING BASE COMMANDER
                        Sign here and you’re a free man-- 
                        officially released from the Air 
                        Force. At your own request, of 
                        course. That will be made known to 
                        the public. 

           Steeves signs the paper without a second thought.

                                 BOLLING BASE COMMANDER (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you something? 
                             (beat)
                        Off the books. 

           Steeves looks up from his signature. 

                                 BOLLING BASE COMMANDER (CONT’D)
                        How much they offer you for your 
                        life rights? 

                                 STEEVES
                        Ten grand. 

                                 BOLLING BASE COMMANDER
                        Christ. I’d fall out of the sky for 
                        that kind of coin.  

                                 STEEVES
                        Give it a shot.  

           Steeves turns to leave but before he can get out the door, 
           the base commander can’t help himself...

                                 BOLLING BASE COMMANDER
                        Was it worth it? 

           Steeves pauses. Doesn’t answer, or turn-- just continues out 
           the door to start a new life as a civilian.

           EXT. AIR FORCE BASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Steeves sheds his Air Force uniform, tosses it in the trunk 
           haphazardly. He puts on jeans, T-shirt, and a baseball cap.

           He climbs in the Jaguar, and drives off. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - LATER

           Steeves drives across the newly constructed interstate 
           highway, passing under a sign reading CALIFORNIA: 2000 MILES.

                                                         TRANSITION TO:
           INT. COCKPIT - AIRCRAFT - DAY

           Steeves steers a light aircraft over familiar terrain, seated 
           beside a kindhearted co-pilot in his fifties, HARRY HERNIER.

           CHYRON: 10 YEARS LATER

                                 STEEVES
                        Running good.

                                 HARRY J HERNIER
                        Hell of a lot smoother. Is there 
                        anything you can’t fix?   

           The question stings a bit, but Steeves shrugs it off.    

                                 STEEVES
                        Mind if we take the scenic route 
                        back? 

           Harry knows why but let’s Steeves off the hook.

                                 HARRY J HERNIER
                        Sure, kid. 

           Steeves hangs a left towards the Sierras, eyes set on the 
           haunting mountain range ahead. 

           INT. HANGAR - FRESNO, CA - DAY 

           The light plane is stationed inside an old wooden hangar. 
           Steeves throws on a leather jacket as Harry logs the flight.

                                 STEEVES
                        Heading out.

                                 HARRY J HERNIER
                        To take the throne?  

                                 STEEVES
                        That’s right.

                                 HARRY J HERNIER
                        Give my best to Cordelia. 

           Steeves waves in response, exiting beneath a flicking bulb. 

           INT. STAGE - FRESNO REGIONAL THEATER - NIGHT

           Steeves is on stage, dressed as King Lear in a cheap local 
           production of the Shakespearian tragedy. 
                                 STEEVES
                        ‘The terrors of the earth!’

           He delivers an impassioned monologue before a crowd of twenty 
           peppered throughout the paint-chipped theater.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        ‘You think I’ll weep. No, I’ll not 
                        weep. I have full cause of weeping, 
                        but this heart shall break into a 
                        hundred thousand flaws or ere I’ll 
                        weep...’

           We notice a YOUNG WOMAN amidst the senior citizens in the 
           back of the audience. The saddest of expressions on her face. 

           INT. LOBBY - THEATER - NIGHT

           Steeves signs a program for an elderly couple. The shoddy 
           powder makeup fails to hide his heavy bags and glass eyes. 
           The years have not been kind. 

           He spots the young woman in the corner of the lobby, near the 
           beverages, patiently waiting her turn. They meet eyes. 

           Emotion floods back in to a life that has become a dry 
           riverbed. He doesn’t move. Neither does she. 

           INT. BAR - FRESNO - LATER

           Steeves sips on a whiskey across from the young woman. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Your mom would kill me if she knew. 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN / LEISA
                        I’m my own person now. 

                                 STEEVES
                        Sixteen. Maybe a little ways to go. 

                                 LEISA
                             (hurt, but hiding it)
                        Fifteen.

           Steeves looks at his watch. 9pm.

                                 STEEVES
                        Only for another three hours.

           Steeves smiles warmly. An awkward silence settles between 
           them; both searching for the right words. 
                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        Everything you’ve heard about me... 
                        I’ve never had the chance to tell 
                        my side of it-- who I really am. 

                                 LEISA
                        I know enough. 

                                 STEEVES
                        No, I don’t think you do.

           Steeves takes a deep breath.

                                 STEEVES (CONT’D)
                        It’s important for you to hear 
                        this, Leisa-- cause at the end of 
                        it all, only your story survives...  

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

           Leisa bumps along the road with a few other PASSENGERS. The 
           bar lights fading behind her. She never looks back. 

                                 STEEVES (V.O.)
                        People can believe or disbelieve 
                        mine as they choose. 

           INT. BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN 

           Steeves, sleepless, turns off his alarm at 5:59A before it 
           chimes. He slips out of the covers. 

                                 STEEVES (V.O.)
                        If it is so miraculous they don’t 
                        believe, then it is just that much 
                        better of a story.

           EXT. HOME - FRESNO - DAWN

           Steeves steps off the porch of his modest home and heads 
           toward his now-rusty Jaguar with a cup of coffee in hand. 

           EXT. TARMAC - MORNING

           A light aircraft starts its propeller. 
           INT. AIRCRAFT - CONTINUOUS

           Steeves adjusts gears, prepping for flight. He looks out at 
           the sun cresting over hilltops. 

           He slides an old photo from his breast pocket and fixes it to 
           the control panel. Rita and Leisa watch over him, as he sets 
           the aircraft into motion. 

                                 STEEVES (V.O.)
                        You’re the only one who deserves to 
                        know the truth...

           INT. BAR - FRESNO - NIGHT

           Steeves sits across from Leisa. Jaw clenched. He’s just 
           finished his story in its entirety. He leans in.

                                 STEEVES
                        All I want is for you not to live 
                        the rest of your life thinking your 
                        father’s some kind of bad guy.
                             (beat)
                        Do you believe me? 

           Leisa’s eyes are wet. She fights to keep her composure. 

                                 LEISA
                        I’m very sorry to tell you this, 
                        but none of that matters to me. 

           Steeves’ face drops, bewildered. 

                                 LEISA (CONT’D)
                        All I ever wanted was for you to be 
                        my dad. 
                             (long pause)
                        Why did you stop being my dad?

           Of all the pain Steeves has endured, this is the pinnacle. It 
           washes over him, filling every cell in his body, as he stares 
           at his daughter with profound love, and deep regret. 

           Leisa checks her watch, then collects her things from the 
           table as tears well up in Steeves eyes. 

                                 LEISA (CONT’D)
                        Good luck with your play. 

           Leisa turns and walks out of the bar. 

           Steeves sits there, alone, bathing in his sorrow, until 
           suddenly, he springs off his seat and exits the bar. 
           EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Steeves spots Leisa walking to a bus stop down the road. He 
           runs after her.

           EXT. BUS STOP - CONTINUOUS

           Steeves reaches Leisa, last in a short line to board the bus.  

           In her eyes he sees immense resentment; but behind all the 
           pain is the innocent eyes of a child longing for a hug from 
           her father. 

           Steeves wraps his arms around her and pulls her close. 

                                 STEEVES
                        I’m sorry... I’m so sorry.

           Leisa gives in. She rests her head on her father’s chest, 
           tears streaming down her cheeks. 

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Moving out. 

           Leisa holds her father a second longer, than breaks away, 
           gives him one last look, and boards the bus. The doors shut. 

           As the BUS ENGINE THROBS we’re immediately pulled back to:

           INT. AIRCRAFT - MORNING - PRESENT

           PROPELLERS WHIR as Steeves welcomes the orange sun cresting 
           the horizon. He kisses his finger, then touches it to the 
           weathered photo of Rita and Leisa, lost in reverie...

           INT. COCKPIT - FLASHBACK 

           Steeves soars over snow-capped MOUNTAINS, guiding his plane 
           up through layers of broken stratus clouds.

           As he settles into a cruising altitude, his eyes set, looking 
           at a PHOTOGRAPH jammed into the lower corner of his 
           windshield: Rita and Leisa, smiling-- pure innocence...

           Ashamed at having just been with another woman, he plucks the 
           photo and seals it in his breast pocket. 

           EXT. TARMAC - MORNING - PRESENT

           Steeves’ light aircraft chugs down the airstrip.
           INT. COCKPIT - FLASHBACK

           Steeves lifts a radio transmitter, flips a switch on the 
           control panel, set to report his coordinates, when...

           BAM! 

           A DEAFENING BLOW knocks Steeves out cold. 

           TARMAC - PRESENT

           Just as the plane is about to lift off, an axel SNAPS, and it 
           nose-dives into the asphalt.

           The aircraft flips, rips apart, careens off the end of the 
           runway, and comes to a fiery halt as it crashes into a shed.

           RUNWAY OPERATORS race to the scene as smoke billows out of 
           the shed.

           COCKPIT - FLASHBACK

           STEEVES COUGHS AWAKE. Eyes open to the SMOKE-FILLED cockpit. 

           Head lolling, half-conscious, Steeves loosens his OXYGEN MASK 
           and breathes in the TOXIC BLACK FUMES. Mistake.

           He straps the mask back on, SUDDENLY ALERT. 

           He spots FLASHING RED LIGHTS on the control panel, seizing to 
           the sound of PIERCING ALARMS. The cockpit slams him around 
           like a boot in a washing machine. 

           Steeves lurches for the control stick but is yanked back by 
           his safety belt. Writhing in the harness, he stretches and 
           finally GRABS HOLD. Eases back on it. 

           No response. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - PRESENT

           BADLY BURNT, Steeves is rushed on a gurney by MEDICAL STAFF 
           down a long hallway, clinging to life...

           COCKPIT - FLASHBACK

           Panic pounding his chest, Steeves shifts his feet from RUDDER 
           PEDALS to SEAT STIRRUPS. Lifts the left-hand ARMREST, and 
           locks the seat harness in place. 
           He eyes a RED PULL-LEVER marked “INITIATOR.” Lunges for it.   

           The CANOPY JETTISONS OFF, sucked into the ether; smoke clears 
           from the cockpit, instantly replaced by EAR-SPLITTING WIND. 

           SHAKING VIOLENTLY, Steeves pulls back the right-hand ARMREST, 
           revealing a hidden TRIGGER. His index finger curls around it. 

           EYES SLAM SHUT as he let’s out a deep, guttural GROWL to coax 
           himself into stoking the TRIGGER.  

           An EXPLOSIVE CHARGE sparks beneath his seat. 

           WHITE INFERNO rockets Steeves out of the cockpit. He WHIPS 
           BACK into thick clouds as the jet blasts ahead at 425 mph.

           ROCKET DEPLETED, Steeves free-falls into the gray abyss. 

           HOSPITAL - PRESENT

           Steeves’ watery eyes flutter as a DOCTOR pumps his heart... 

           SKY - FLASHBACK

           Steeves free-falls through the clouds. 

           Tumbling head over feet, gaining rapid velocity, his arms 
           swim to locate a D-RING on his shoulder strap. 

           POP! The parachute deploys, catching air and RIPPING him back 
           up. His jet seat tumbles on, vanishing in the clouds. 

           Steeves loosens his oxygen mask, and breathes. All goes 
           silent as he drifts peacefully through heavenly white clouds. 

           Suddenly the clouds part, revealing-- menacing, ice-peaked 
           MOUNTAINS rising up beneath his feet.

           Spiraling to earth, the mountains gain razor sharp texture. A 
           FLAT ROCK projects from the side of a steep slope. 

           Steeves aims for the natural platform. But he’s coming in 
           hot. Too swift to land safely. 

           HOSPITAL

           Steeves eyes set, he takes one last breath... 

           SKY

           Steeves tucks his limbs... 20 feet... 10 feet... 5 feet...

           HOSPITAL 
           ... and FLAT-LINES.

           SKY

           ... and SMASHES INTO ICE. 

           SLAM TO BLACK. 

           We hold on the black void as the sound of the flat line 
           slowly fades to silence-- 

           And we hold on that deafening silence just long enough to 
           convince the audience we’ve come to the end-- 

           A few even stand up to leave the theater, just before we...

           FADE BACK IN:

           EXT. KINGS CANYON NATIONAL PARK - DAY

           CHYRON: SPRING, 1977

           A BOY SCOUT TROOP hikes through the forest. 

           A SMALL SCOUT trips on something in the dirt. The others boys 
           pass him, chuckling, teasing. 

           Small Scout lifts a leather-bound BOOK out of the dirt and 
           turns it over in his hands. 

           It’s a bible. Worn and weathered.

           He opens the front covering and finds an engraving: 

           DAVID ARTHUR STEEVES. 

           He starts thumbing through the yellowed pages, when suddenly, 
           a SHOUT draws his attention up ahead...

           He jogs toward the others, gripping the bible tight. 

           Cresting a small hill, he discovers his troop circling...

           A wrecked T-33 AIRCRAFT CANOPY covered in moss and brush.

           INT. KITCHEN - BLAIR’S HOME - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Agnes, now in her 50s, prepare a meal on a marble island in 
           this newly modeled suburban tract home. 
           Blair sits at the table, editing a document. Hair thinned, 
           glasses thicker, 50’s. He’s lived comfortably, but beneath 
           his soft exterior is a man still weathering a storm. 

           Blair’s attention drifts to a flickering television in the 
           other room, stirred by something he sees.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RITA’S HOME - CONTINUOUS 

           LEISA, now in her mid-twenties, has a small TV on in the 
           background while preparing for an exam. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        The wreckage is presumed to belong 
                        to Air Force pilot Lieutenant David 
                        Steeves... 

           Leisa looks up from her textbook in disbelief.

                                 NEWSCATER (ON TV)
                        ... who emerged from the wilds of 
                        Kings Canyon to face controversy in 
                        1957, dying tragically ten years 
                        later in a second plane wreck.  

           LIVING ROOM

           Blair stands alone in the living room, watching the report. 

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        The troop leader who discovered the 
                        canopy contacted the Air Force who 
                        confirmed the identity of the plane 
                        by its serial number...

           Kemp, now in his 20s, appears beside him. 

                                 KEMP
                        I remember him. He had that wicked 
                        beard. 

           Kemp turns to his father, curious about his interest. 

           Blair watches on, his eyes soft and teary. Regret. Relief.   

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RITA’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           TIGHT ON the television set as the broadcast switches to a 
           recording of the bright-eyed Troop Leader: 
                                 TROOP LEADER
                        We do this trip every year. I don’t 
                        know why I chose to change the 
                        route this time, but..

           As another celebrity is born, Leisa turns off the TV. Her 
           reflection lingering inside the black box.  

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Leisa walks in. 

           RITA, mid 40s, sits at the table, grading psychology papers. 
           She smiles dimly at the sight of her daughter. 

           As Leisa debates what to say, if anything at all, we...

           FADE TO BLACK. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: “We present this story, not in defense of David 
           Steeves as an individual, but in the hope that those who read 
           it will be reminded of the infinite complexity of human 
           beings— and of the folly and danger of judging them too 
           quickly and too severely.” -- Redbook Magazine, 1958
