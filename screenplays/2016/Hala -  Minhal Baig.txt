           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           HALA, 17, face blank and expressionless, lies beneath the 
           water in a full bathtub. 

           She blinks. This is the most naked she will ever be.

                                 ERAM (O.S.)
                        Hala. Hala! 

           After moment, Hala climbs out of the tub in SLOW-MO, as if 
           waking from a languid dream.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           A ceiling fan rotates.

           Wrapped in a towel, Hala opens the window, leans out and 
           looks. The sun falls harshly onto her face. 

           She squints, closes her eyes, takes a deep breath.

           EXT. WINDOW / HALA’S POV - DAWN

           Families and young professionals have moved into this 
           gentrifying, quiet corner of Echo Park.

           Hala sees a family at their breakfast table from their 
           kitchen window. They appear happy. She shuts the window.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           INSERT SHOTS:

           1 - LITTLE PORCELAIN & GLASS ANIMALS sit on a DRESSER

           2 - HAIRBRUSH thick with DARK, CURLY HAIR

           3 - A JEWELRY HOLDER

           4 - DOG-EARED COPY of THE BELL JAR by Sylvia Plath

           Hala carefully applies makeup in front of her vanity mirror.

           She flattens out stray hairs. She picks up her hijab from a 
           clothing hook and folds it over her head, tucking in all the 
           corners with practiced ease.

           For a moment, she sits there, clearly transformed.
           A KNOCK at the door.

                                 ERAM (O.S.)
                        Come downstairs for breakfast. 

           One last look at herself in the mirror before she’s gone. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Hala kisses ERAM, 40s, on the forehead; she is the more 
           conservative parent of the two. Hala sits down at the table 
           across from her father, NADIR, 50s, dressed in work attire.

           Nadir reads the newspaper and Eram places breakfast on the 
           table for the three of them.

                                 ERAM
                        You’re going to be late.

                                 HALA
                        I have a few minutes.

           Hala places a piece of toast in her mouth.

                                 NADIR
                        Am I picking you up?

           As she picks up her jacket from the back of her chair, mouth 
           still full:

                                 HALA
                        No, taking the bus. Bye. 

           She heads out. Nadir and Eram exchange an exasperated look.

           INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Hala looks out the bus window with her earbuds in. 

           SLOW-MO: kids on skateboards and bicycles racing down the 
           block. In her POV: she sees JESSE, 17, punk-rock epitome of 
           effortless cool, skateboarding next to the bus. 

           He turns to look at her and --

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           -- THE BELL RINGS.

           She sprints inside, just in time before the doors close shut.
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - LATER

           Bored faces in a literature class: freckled, youthful faces 
           propped up on elbows; chewing gum between teeth; a 

           INSERT SHOT of a page from LOLITA. The following text is 
           being highlighted by a hand (with chipped blue fingernail 
           polish) as it is read:

                                 HALA (V.O.)
                        A polka-dotted black kerchief tied 
                        around her chest hid from my aging 
                        ape eyes, but not from the gaze of 
                        young memory, the juvenile breasts 
                        I had fondled one immortal day. 
                        And, as if I were the fairy-tale 
                        nurse of some little princess 
                        (lost, kidnapped, discovered in 
                        gypsy rags through which her 
                        nakedness smiled at the king and 
                        his hounds), I recognized the tiny 
                        dark-brown mole on her side. With 
                        awe and delight (the king crying 
                        for joy, the trumpets blaring, the 
                        nurse drunk) I saw again her lovely 
                        indrawn abdomen where my southbound 
                        mouth had briefly paused; and those 
                        puerile hips on which I had kissed 
                        the crenulated imprint left by the 
                        band of her shorts -- that last mad 
                        immortal day behind the "Roches 
                        Roses.”

           Hala, the only headscarfed girl in a sea of teenagers, looks 
           up from her book. A few students contain their laughter. 

           MR. LAWRENCE, 34, boyish, clearly an object of affection for 
           some of the girls in class, closes his book. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Okay, that’s enough for today. You 
                        have a writing journal on what we 
                        just read. In your notebooks, 
                        handwritten please. 

           A collective groan. The bell rings once more.

           As students shuffle their books into their backpacks and push 
           in their chairs,

                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to finish up and be 
                        ready to discuss next week!
           Hala shoots a ‘let’s go’ look at a girl in the back of the 
           class - this is MELANIE - who raises her eyebrows 
           suggestively, giving a glance at Mr. Lawrence and then, back 
           at Hala.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Girlish laughter bubbles up from the cafeteria table. Hala 
           steals Melanie’s french fries.

                                 MELANIE
                        He’d look better without the 
                        glasses. 

                                 HALA
                        Who?

           MELANIE (17), contrarian and comfortable in her own skin, 
           retaliates by taking a french fry off Hala’s own plate.

                                 MELANIE
                        Lawrence. Ah-doy. 

                                 HALA
                        I really don’t understand the 
                        fascination. He’s so old.

                                 MELANIE
                        Not that old.

                                 HALA
                        He’s more than twice our age.

                                 MELANIE
                        But he’s so bookish. Like a cute 
                        professor-type. You know. 

                                 HALA
                        You’re such a creep.

                                 MELANIE
                        You’re boring.

           As the other GIRLS chatter at the table, Hala notices JESSE, 
           a mop of messy hair atop his head, sit down at a table across 
           from them with his friends. 

                                 MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        So we good for Saturday? 

           Melanie’s chatter disappears for a moment -- 
                                 HALA
                        What?

                                 MELANIE
                        Are you even listening to a thing 
                        I’m saying?

           Her eyes follow Hala’s. From her POV, Jesse is laughing 
           uncontrollably at a stupid joke his friend’s just told.

                                 HALA
                        What?

                                 MELANIE
                        Oh, man. Are you for real? I’m just 
                        a little surprised that that is 
                        your type. 

           Hala picks up her lunch tray and gets up.

           INT. LOCKER ROOMS - DAY

           Hala waits outside a stall, a T-shirt and sweatpants under 
           her arm as partially-naked girls shamelessly change into 
           their gym clothes. 

           Hala raps on the door of the stall.

                                 GIRL IN STALL (O.S.)
                        Hang on!

           Hala sighs.

           EXT. TRACK FIELD - DAY

           Dressed in thick sweatpants now, Hala lounges on the 
           bleachers with the other girls.

           She watches the boys run track around the field until they 
           complete a lap and the P.E. INSTRUCTOR approaches them.

                                 P.E. INSTRUCTOR
                        All right, ladies. Let’s go. Come 
                        on. Get up.

           Everyone warms up on the tracks and bursts forward as soon as 
           their instructor blows his whistle.

           Hala loses focus for a moment when her eyes connect with 
           Jesse’s as she turns a corner and she turns her head to 
           COLLIDE into another GIRL.
                                 GIRL
                        Jesus Christ! 

           INT. LOCKER ROOMS - DAY

           Hala collects herself in a stall, breathing hard, stripping 
           out of her gym clothes with urgency.

           INT. HALLWAY - HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Hala opens her locker and finds a BLACK CARD with gold 
           lettering on the outside that reads: YOU’RE INVITED.

           She hands it to Melanie, who studies it with curiosity. 

                                 MELANIE
                        You’re coming with me, like it or 
                        not, Hala. 

                                 HALA
                        You know my parents.

                                 MELANIE
                        But guess who’s probably going to 
                        be there. 

           Hala contains her embarrassment.

                                 HALA
                        Shut up. 

           INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Hala sits in the back of the bus with her earphones in.

           She sees SKATEBOARDING TEENAGERS pulling tricks in a PARK 
           from outside the window.

           INT. HOME - DAY

           Hala arrives home. The house is quiet. She heads upstairs.

           INT. HALLWAY - HOME - DAY

           She walks down the hall, peeks into her mom’s room and sees:

           Eram kneeling down in a white hijab for prayer. She rises, 
           puts her hands above her abdomen and continues namaz.
           INT. ROOM - DAY

           In front of the mirror, Hala carefully takes off her hijab. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Eram and Hala set the table. Nadir is busy on his phone.

                                 ERAM
                        I thought you were going to settle.

           He looks up from his phone in irritation.

                                 NADIR
                        Nobody wants to ever go to trial. 
                        There’s too much there for us to 
                        not to. We’ve got a strong chance 
                        of winning if we go forward. We’re 
                        deposing in New York.

                                 ERAM
                        Ramadan is coming up. 

                                 NADIR
                        I don’t have a choice, dear.

           Eram joins him at the table.

                                 ERAM
                        You always have a choice.

                                 NADIR
                        Let’s drop this, please. 

           Hala watches this exchange go down, looks down at her plate. 
           They murmur a prayer before eating.

                                 ERAM
                            (to Hala)
                        How was school?

                                 HALA
                        Good. 

           She pushes around the food on her plate. Eram exchanges an 
           exasperated look with Nadir.

                                 NADIR
                        What are you reading?

                                 HALA
                        The Russians in world lit. Tolstoy, 
                        Dostoyevsky. That stuff. 
           She shrugs. 

                                 NADIR
                        That’s some of the best literature 
                        ever written, you know that?

                                 HALA
                        I know.

           Hala smiles at her father. Eram looks on, envious of their 
           easy relationship.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Hala burns through Lolita in bed. At some point, she puts the 
           book down, turns off the table lamp and lies down. 

           She closes her eyes and lowers her hand beneath the sheets. 

           A sharp intake of breath. Hers. After a moment, she lies back 
           in bed, frustrated. No resolution.

           INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Melanie and Hala sit side-by-side on the bus.

                                 HALA
                        You’re thinking about boys, aren’t 
                        you? I can just tell.

                                 MELANIE
                        What else am I gonna think about? 
                        How much homework we have? I’ve got 
                        you to do that for me.

           Two rows in front of them: Jesse laughs with his friend, 
           WHITNEY (17), a tall, blonde-haired, doe-eyed junior.

           From Hala’s POV: Whitney is the most beautiful person in 
           their class; she and Jesse look like they belong together. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Everyone’s busy with their literature tests. Mr. Lawrence 
           reads at his desk. 

           Hala places her test face-down on his desk. He checks his egg-
           timer - there’s a good twenty minutes left. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        You double-check it? 
           She nods.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        Triple-check?

           She nods, a little annoyed. 

                                 HALA
                        Yeah.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Okay, let me see.

           He checks the class (they’re all still working) and flips her 
           paper over. 

           Mr. Lawrence covers the paper so she can’t see him making 
           marks. He takes a red pen and marks it up.

                                 HALA
                        Wait. 

           He continues making marks. When he’s done, he places it face-
           down. Smiles at her.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        You may take your paper.

           Hala takes the test, folds it, returns to her desk. She 
           unfolds the test underneath her desk. 

           It’s 100%. 

           But he’s made all these tiny scribbles all over her paper. 
           She looks up at him; they share a conspiratorial smile.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY - LATER

           Melanie and Hala people-watch on the bench outside. 

           EXT. STREETS - DAY - LATER

           They walk side-by-side on the streets. Echo Park, the grimier 
           part, the part that is real, diverse and gritty. Melanie’s 
           got a skateboard under her arm. 

           EXT. SKATE PARK - DAY - SAME

           TEENAGERS of all kinds skateboard across the park, pulling 
           tricks on the mini-verts, tubes and railings. 
           Melanie stands on a skateboard and successfully moves forward 
           a bit. Hala watches on. 

                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        So, like, you gotta even out your 
                        weight, simple. 

           Hala balances on a skateboard and nearly falls over. She 
           tries this a couple of times. They laugh.

           Exhausted, they sit back down. 

           Jesse and his crew are at the other end of the park. He’s out-
           of-focus at first, and then finally clear. 

           They make eye-contact, but it’s quickly broken when a friend 
           of his gives Jesse a playful shove. 

           INT. HOME - HALLWAY - EVENING 

           Hala stands outside her parents’ bedroom. 

           Through the sliver in the door: Nadir packs, Eram touches his 
           hand and he tensely moves it away from her.

           Their conversation is too quiet, quick and in Farsi for us to 
           comprehend it.

           INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

           They’ve already finished dinner. Hala picks up her plate and 
           takes it to the sink.

                                 ERAM
                        Hala, can you take care of this? 
                        I’m a little tired.

           Eram puts her plate in the sink and exits the kitchen. As 
           Hala washes the dishes,

                                 NADIR
                        Don’t give your mom a hard time 
                        when I’m gone. 

                                 HALA
                        I won’t. 

                                 NADIR
                        I mean it. She’s already worked to 
                        the bone as it is. She doesn’t need 
                        to worry about you on top of it.
           There’s a buzz from Nadir’s phone on the table. He checks it.

                                 NADIR (CONT’D)
                        I have to pick up some paperwork 
                        from one of the lawyers. You want 
                        to come with me? 

           Hala puts the last dish in the drying rack and dries her 
           hands with a paper towel.

                                 HALA
                        Okay.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nadir turns a corner.

                                 NADIR
                        When I get back, we should make a 
                        list of colleges for you.

                                 HALA
                        That’s four months from now.

                                 NADIR
                        You should already be working on 
                        them, they’ll sneak up on you. And 
                        I don’t want you doing all of that 
                        work last-minute, stressing 
                        yourself out.

                                 HALA
                        You mean you.

                                 NADIR
                        What?

                                 HALA
                        Stressing you out.

                                 NADIR
                        It’s your future.

                                 HALA
                        Where are we?

           They pull up to a nice condominium complex. 

                                 NADIR
                        Stay right here, okay? 

           Nadir leaves the car running. He steps outside.
           From Hala’s POV: Nadir walks up to BRIGITTE, 30s, a dark-
           haired lawyer at the same firm as Nadir. 

           She hands Nadir a file folder. They talk, but Hala’s too far 
           away to make out any of their conversation. Brigitte laughs; 
           stolen moment between the two of them.

           Hala glances up at the complex. 

           A little DARK-HAIRED GIRL presses her face against the glass 
           from a window on the second floor. She and Hala meet eyes. 

           The Dark-Haired Girl gives her a little wave. 

           Nadir sits back in the car. He and Hala exchange a glance, 
           but say nothing.

                                 HALA (O.S.)
                        How did you meet Mom?

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Hala lowers her window and rests her head on her arms as they 
           pass under a tunnel. She closes her eyes. 

                                 NADIR (O.S.)
                        My parents were looking for someone 
                        for me, and her parents were 
                        looking for someone for her, and we 
                        found each other that way. 

                                 HALA (O.S.)
                        That doesn’t sound romantic.

                                 NADIR
                        It doesn’t always work the way it 
                        does in movies, Hala.

           Off-screen, Nadir laughs. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala pulls up the covers over herself when she hears a quick 
           knock on the door. 

                                 HALA
                        Yes?

           Eram enters and sits down at the foot of her bed.
                                 ERAM
                            (quietly)
                        Hala. Where were you after school 
                        today?

                                 HALA
                        We went to the skate park... it’s 
                        not a big deal.

                                 ERAM
                        One of the neighbors saw you with a 
                        group of boys...

                                 HALA
                            (quickly)
                        -- I wasn’t with anyone other than 
                        Melanie, it was just the two of us.

           Eram gives her a concerned look.

                                 ERAM
                        I just want you to be careful. And 
                        stay focused on your school work. 
                        This is an important year for you.

                                 HALA
                        I know.

           Eram kisses her forehead, turns off the light and exits. The 
           room is cast into darkness again.

           After a moment of lying awake in bed, Hala reaches over for 
           her copy of LOLITA.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           All the lights in the household are off except the tiny 
           window on the second floor, still aglow. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           INSERT SHOT of the cover of Lolita. Hala rests her head on 
           top of her book.

                                 JESSE (O.S.)
                        You’re missing lunch.

           Startled, Hala picks up her head.

                                 HALA
                        What do you want?
                                 JESSE
                        Take a walk with me.

                                 HALA
                        Take a walk by yourself.

                                 JESSE
                            (teasing)
                        What’s your problem?

                                 HALA
                        I’m not allowed.

                                 JESSE
                        To walk? That must make life pretty 
                        hard for you.

                                 HALA
                            (matter-of-factly)
                        To walk with a boy alone.

                                 JESSE
                        Your dad’s definitely watching you 
                        right now. 

                                 HALA
                            (gesturing around her)
                        He’s like air, invisible but 
                        everywhere.

           Jesse gets up out of his chair.

                                 JESSE
                        All right, then.

                                 HALA
                            (quickly)
                        If Melanie comes, I’ll go with you.

           EXT. BEHIND THE SCHOOL - DAY 

           The trio walk the path behind the school. Hala in the middle. 
           Clear from body language that Melanie’s smitten with Jesse.

                                 MELANIE
                        Smith, Wesleyan, maybe NYU. Ugh. I 
                        probably won’t get in. 

                                 HALA
                        You’ll get in.

                                 MELANIE
                        The power of positive thinking.
                                 JESSE
                            (to Hala)
                        What do you want to do?

                                 HALA
                        I don’t know. Maybe study law like 
                        my dad.  

                                 MELANIE
                        Law. That sounds right for you. “I 
                        object!” You could be the next Elle 
                        Woods.

           Hala laughs. The bell rings.

                                 JESSE
                        Oh, fuck. 

           Melanie sprints back. 

                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        Race you!

           Hala follows her when -

                                 JESSE
                        Hey, gimme your phone.

                                 HALA
                        I don’t get yours?

                                 JESSE
                        No.

           She hands it to him. He enters his number, hands it back. 
           Hala gives him a curious look.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Mr. Lawrence is going on about Lolita, but it doesn’t matter 
           because Hala’s opened her phone underneath her desk.

           Selects Jesse’s name. Types: “This is Hala.”

           She looks up at him in class. He appears not to notice. She 
           checks to see if the teacher’s looking. He’s not.

           Her phone lights up. A reply: a SQUID EMOJI. What the fuck? 
           would accurately describe her expression.

           She looks over at him. Jesse stifles a laugh. Mr. Lawrence 
           notices the interaction, but lets it pass.
           INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Hala’s in the back row, earphones in, reading the flurry of 
           texts on her phone with newfound interest:

           Jesse: “party this wknd?”
           Hala: “maybe”
           Jesse: “should be fun”

           INT. HOME - NIGHT 

           Hala waits at the front door. A car honks impatiently 
           outside. Nadir comes down the stairs, carry-on bags in both 
           of his hands.

                                 ERAM (O.S.)
                        So you’ll be back in a week.

                                 NADIR (O.S.)
                        Next Friday.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Eram drives. Nadir connects his iPod to the speakers. He 
           scrolls through his music library and finally arrives at one. 

           His face lights up. He presses play.

                                 NADIR
                        Here we go. 

           Eram gives him a curious look. And then the song begins. It’s 
           Soghati by Hayedeh; their past catching up to them.

           Eram laughs, embarrassed.

                                 ERAM
                        Oh my God.

                                 NADIR
                        This is your mother’s song.

                                 ERAM
                        Makes me feel so old.

                                 NADIR
                        We are old. 

                                 ERAM
                        I don’t remember all the words.
                                 NADIR
                        Yeah, right. You know all of them. 
                        You’re just too embarrassed to 
                        admit it. 

           Nadir begins to sing. The car is quiet as he does so - and 
           everyone bursts into laughter. 

           Eram joins in, quieter, embarrassed to be singing. He belts 
           it out; she sings softly. 

           In the backseat, Hala smiles to herself.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Nadir hugs Hala before he leaves.

                                 NADIR
                        No trouble for your mom.

                                 HALA
                        I know. 

                                 NADIR
                        And your college applications.

                                 HALA
                        Have a safe trip. 

           He squeezes her tight. Then lets her go. Eram waits in the 
           car and Hala joins her. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Quiet in the car as they drive home.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala places her earphones in and -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SKATE PARK - DAY

           Hala skateboards across a curve. She steadies herself on the 
           board and moves forward. Takes her a bit of trying.

           She’s getting the hang of it.
           EXT. STREETS - ECHO PARK - DAY

           Hala skateboards down a hill. Eyes closed, her hands in the 
           air, doesn’t care who’s watching.

           INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

           Eram and Hala eat dinner. The empty chair where Nadir usually 
           sits separates the two of them.

                                 ERAM
                        Don’t stay up too late.

                                 HALA
                        I won’t.

                                 ERAM
                        Not even to read.

           As she heads out: 

                                 HALA
                        I won’t.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT

           Hala lies wide awake in bed. Texts light up her phone: 

           Jesse: are you going to make it tonight?
           Hala: can’t leave, mom home
           Jesse: fuck that. come already.

           Hala lies back in bed. After a moment, she sends a quick text 
           to Melanie. She takes a deep breath. Her phone lights up. She 
           reads the text. 

           INT. HALLWAY - HOME - NIGHT

           She peeks into her mother’s room. Eram is fast asleep.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala puts on her makeup, then her hijab. Carefully of course, 
           all the corners tucked in.

           EXT. HOME - NIGHT

           Hala exits the house and sprints toward a waiting car, 
           opening the passenger door and -
           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           -- and closes it shut before sinking down in the seat.

           Melanie gives her a look.

                                 MELANIE
                        You are too much.

                                 HALA
                        Just drive.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

           Melanie parks the car.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

           Inside, TEENAGERS are packed in tight, mixing and mingling 
           with Solo cups in hand. 

           From an OVERHEAD VIEW: Melanie pushes through the crowd with 
           Hala in tow. Hala looks around at everyone in wonder. 
           Teenagers laugh, talk and fool around. 

           As Hala stops to peer at two boys making out, Melanie moves 
           on without her.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Hala searches for Melanie in the crowd. She reaches for her 
           phone: low battery.

           Hala moves through the crowd to the kitchen. She examines a 
           half-empty Solo cup and drinks it as teenagers drunkenly make 
           out around her. 

           She squints. It doesn’t taste good. But she takes a large 
           sip. And then another. And another.

           INT. STAIRS - HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

           Hala drunkenly walks up the stairs. Everything feels too loud 
           and too close. 

           INT. SECOND FLOOR - HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

           Hala spots a dark-haired GIRL and places a hand on her arm. 
                                 HALA
                        Hey.

           The GIRL swivels around, delivering a glare. Not Melanie. 
           From behind Hala, there’s a burst of giggling and snickering.

                                 BOY
                        What do you look like without this? 

           A BOY reaches for her headscarf and tugs.

                                 HALA
                        Stop. 

           She turns around to face him when the Girl behind her does 
           the same thing, nearly pulling her headscarf off.

           Hala hangs onto her headscarf, fearing that it will slip off 
           with their jostling.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        I said stop it.

           The Boy makes another grab for it, and she tries to twist 
           away from the group. 

                                 JESSE
                            (O.S.)
                        Hey. Back off.

           A bunch of ‘ooohing’ commences. 

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. 

           Jesse takes her arm and leads her down the hall, away from 
           the others. Hala appears nauseous.

           INT. BEDROOM - HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

           Jesse pushes the door open. There isn’t anyone inside, so he 
           helps Hala to the bathroom --

           INT. BATHROOM - HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

           -- whereupon she immediately vomits into the toilet bowl. 

                                 HALA
                        I’m going to die.
                                 JESSE
                        No, you’re not. Is this your first 
                        time or--?

           She vomits some more.

           INT. BEDROOOM - HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

           Hala finishes washing her face and leaves the bathroom light 
           on as she sits down next to him on the bed.

           She lies down on the bed and takes a very deep breath.

                                 JESSE
                        You going to make it? 

                                 HALA
                        I think so.

           He touches her hand. She doesn’t stop him.

                                 JESSE
                        Just breathe.

                                 HALA
                        I should find Melanie.

           She sits up and for a moment, their faces are very close 
           together in the darkness, but they say nothing.

           A sharp KNOCK at the door interrupts them. 

           EXT. HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           Hala, wearing her jacket now, steps outside with Jesse on her 
           heels. Melanie glances at him, then at Hala.

                                 MELANIE
                            (to Hala)
                        There the fuck you are. Do you not 
                        pick up your phone? I called you a 
                        million times.

           She waves her phone at Hala.

                                 HALA
                        Oh, god.

           Hala checks her phone. Thankfully no messages from Eram.
                                 MELANIE
                        Now let’s get you home before your 
                        mom finds out.

           Hala glares at Melanie. Jesse appears impressed. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Hala touches her lips as Melanie drives.

           INT. HOME - NIGHT

           Hala opens the door and carefully shuts it close behind her.

           INT. HALLWAY - HOME - NIGHT

           She passes by her mother’s bedroom. Eram’s still asleep.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Before Hala even reaches her bed, she takes off her clothes 
           and lies down, completely exhausted by the night’s events.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Hala takes a hot shower, clearly sexually frustrated.

                                 ERAM (O.S)
                            (muffled)
                        I’m waiting on you.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Eram smiles, unaware as a very bored Hala looks out the 
           passenger window.

                                 ERAM
                        I thought it would be good for us 
                        to get some time in together now 
                        that your father’s gone. 

           EXT. CAFE - DAY

           Eram and Hala eat lunch on a terrace.

           Hala’s texting under the table. A SQUID EMOJI. She replies 
           with a QUESTION MARK.
                                 ERAM
                        Give it a rest, Hala. She can 
                        survive an hour without you.

           Hala puts her phone away.

                                 HALA
                        How did you sleep?

                                 ERAM
                        Not so well.

                                 HALA
                        It’s just a few more days.

                                 ERAM
                        I wanted to talk to you about 
                        something.

           Hala tenses. Does she know?

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        I asked your dad to talk to you 
                        about college applications. I need 
                        you to be serious. They are coming 
                        up... and I haven’t seen you 
                        working on them.

                                 HALA
                        I told him I’d take care of it.

                                 ERAM
                        I’m talking about your future. What 
                        you want to do with your life. You 
                        should be thinking about that. 
                        You’re not going to be this young 
                        forever, not having to decide what 
                        you want to do. 

                                 HALA
                            (annoyed)
                        What about you?

                                 ERAM
                        What about me? I’m raising you. 
                        That is my job. What kind of 
                        question is that?

                                 HALA
                        I didn’t mean it like that.
                                 ERAM
                        Then what did you mean? Maybe you 
                        can make your own breakfast and do 
                        your own laundry then. You’re old 
                        enough, anyway. Nadir tells me I 
                        spoil you, still doing all of that 
                        when you’re old enough to do it on 
                        your own.

           The WAITER comes up to them.

                                 WAITER
                        Excuse me.

           And the conversation’s already over.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Eram drives with her shoulders hunched and tense, as if she’s 
           ready to fight someone. Hala’s in her own little world.

           INT. HOME - DAY - LATER

           They arrive home and Eram immediately heads up the stairs.

                                 HALA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ERAM
                        You don’t appreciate what you have. 
                        You’re used to your father giving 
                        you everything, but someday he 
                        won’t be there, and it will be just 
                        me. Just know that, Hala. That day 
                        will come. It’s not always going to 
                        be all about you. You’ll hurt 
                        people and face the consequences.

                                 HALA
                        I didn’t mean to say what I did.

                                 ERAM (O.S.)
                        Do whatever you want.

           Followed by the sound of a door slamming shut.

           EXT. STREETS - ECHO PARK - EVENING

           Hala heads to the skate park. 
           EXT. SKATE PARK - DAY

           She skates by herself down a dark tunnel. 

           The familiar sounds of skateboards hitting concrete and 
           asphalt flood our senses. 

           EXT. SKATE PARK - EVENING

           She’s about to leave when she hears --

                                 JESSE (O.S.)
                        Oi. Hey. 

           Jesse skates up to her. 

                                 HALA
                        Hey.

                                 JESSE
                        Let’s see what you got.

           EXT. SKATE PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Pretty soon, they pull off tricks, showing off, one-upping 
           the other. They goof off with their skateboards.

           INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Jesse and Hala walk together. They say nothing. He offers her 
           a cigarette between his fingers.

                                 JESSE
                        Smoke?

                                 HALA
                        No, thank you.

           He takes it back, digging his hands into his pockets, afraid 
           to speak and ruin their moment. 

           They avoid each others’ eyes as they pass by a pickup 
           basketball court. 

           EXT. PICKUP BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           A fence separates them from the court, where TEENAGERS play 
           an intense game of pickup basketball.
           She and Jesse press themselves against the chain-link fence 
           and look out at the kids playing ball.

           Without warning, he tosses his skateboard over the fence, 
           climbs it and leaps over to the other side.

                                 JESSE
                        Come on.

           They look at each other through the fence. His fingers brush 
           over hers. She breaks his gaze.

                                 HALA
                        I have to go home.

           She turns away.

           EXT. STREETS - LATER

           Hala’s face catches the orange light of passing street lamps 
           as she skateboards down the block with newfound energy. 

           INT. HALLWAY - HOME - NIGHT

           As Hala settles down at the kitchen table, Eram heads over 
           near the hallway. Over her shoulder,

                                 ERAM
                        We should do something nice for 
                        your dad when he comes back.

                                 HALA
                        Yeah, that’d be nice.

                                 ERAMM
                        Good. 

           Eram dials Nadir’s number on her cellphone. It rings and 
           rings and rings and finally:

                                 NADIR
                        Hello? 

                                 ERAM
                        How are you--?

                                 NADIR
                        I’m at a dinner right now, it’s not 
                        a good time, can I call you in a 
                        few hours?
                                 ERAM
                        I’ll be asleep by then.

           In the B.G. of Nadir’s call, she hears a woman’s voice.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        Who’re you with?

                                 NADIR
                        That’s the waitress. Call you back.

           He hangs up. Eram, confused, puts the phone back. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Eram violently scrapes her utensils against her plate as she 
           eats. Hala watches her as she stabs her food. Her phone 
           lights up under the table.

           Hala reaches for it. 

                                 ERAM
                        Put that away.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Hala washes her face, dries it, looks at herself in the 
           mirror, deep in thought.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala lays in bed. Her eyes grow heavy with sleep. 

           EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT - NIGHT (DREAM)

           SLOWLY PULL OUT as Hala lies on the asphalt of a parking lot. 
           She gets up and looks around. The lot is empty. 

           A dance track like “Say My Name” by Odesza fades in. 

           She dances, completely alone, in this parking lot. Twirling. 
           Jumping. Floating. Free. No fucking boundaries.

           Her movements are unashamed and fluid. As she wheels into a 
           spin, she comes CRASHING DOWN.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           OVER BLACK

                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        Hala.

           INT. MELANIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala opens her eyes, realizes she’s fallen asleep in 
           Melanie’s lap on her bed. 

                                 MELANIE
                        You’re so quiet when you sleep.

           Hala’s phone is vibrating. She picks it up and reads a text 
           from Jesse: BEAR EMOJI.

                                 HALA
                        He’s on his way.

                                 MELANIE
                        How do you know that?

                                 HALA
                        That’s just what it means.

                                 MELANIE
                        What about the squid?

                                 HALA
                        I have no idea.

           They laugh.

           EXT. MELANIE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Hala and Melanie pile into the backseat of Jesse’s car. His 
           friend ANDREW, 17, the “fun one”, is in the passenger seat. 

           EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

           The car speeds down a tunnel as we hear teenagers singing to 
           a tune from inside -- 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           The song is something old school, a 90s beat that everybody 
           loves to late. They are all terrible singers, but it’s fun 
           and nobody gives a fuck. 
           When the song fades away, Hala watches her friends in wonder 
           and doesn’t ever want to lose them.

           This is the youngest and most free she has ever felt.

           EXT. ABANDONED BUILDINGS - NIGHT

           Jesse’s parked his car. He and Andrew head around the car and 
           pop open the trunk. Hala and Melanie exchange confused looks.

           The girls stay in the car. 

           Jesse and Andrew, doing a terrible job of containing their 
           excitement, carry spray cans on the inside of their sleeves 
           over to the exposed brick wall.

                                 MELANIE
                            (under her breath)
                        We’re gonna get caught.

           Hala opens the car door and joins them. 

           Jesse sprays a big ‘J’ and then a ‘K’ next to each other. He 
           stands back to admire his handiwork.

                                 HALA
                        Just kidding.

                                 JESSE
                        Also J - Jesse, K - Kravitz.

                                 HALA
                        Really clever.

           Melanie sneaks up behind them.

                                 MELANIE
                        Boo!

           She picks up a spray can herself.

                                 JESSE
                            (to Hala)
                        You wanna try?

           Hala gives him an uncertain look.

                                 MELANIE
                        Oh COME ON! Be a little bad. For 
                        once in your freaking life. Augh!

           With a sigh, Hala takes the spray can and right as she’s 
           about to aim it at the wall.
                                 ANDREW
                        Fuck - think someone saw us.

           Andrew sprints back to the car.

                                 MELANIE
                            (whispers)
                        Fuck fuck fuck. 

                                 JESSE
                        Let’s go. 

           The kids run back to the car and drive off.

           INT. HOME - NIGHT

           Hala walks back in. The kitchen light is on. Eram is at the 
           table, and as soon as Hala steps into the hallway, she turns 
           to look at her.

           They meet eyes down the hall from each other. Eram looks as 
           if she’s been crying.

                                 ERAM
                        Where have you been?

                                 HALA
                        With my friends.

           Eram nods, as if she’s just too tired to make a point.

                                 ERAM
                        You should get to bed. It’s late.

           Hala lingers for a moment.

                                 HALA
                        You should, too.

                                 ERAM
                        I’ll try.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala sits in front of her computer, surfing the web. Her 
           phone screen lights up. 

           She opens her text. It’s a SKATEBOARD emoji from Jesse. She 
           smiles to herself.
           EXT. SKATE PARK - DAY

           Hala circles the full vert without stopping, each turn slowly 
           building momentum into the next.

           Seemingly forever. Jesse skates past, flips and -- 

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Hala sits down on the whirl-a-gig and Jesse joins her.

                                 HALA
                        Come on, push me.

           He pushes. The whirl-a-gig goes. 

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        Go! Faster!

           He pushes harder.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God. Oh, God. Too fast.

           Jesse laughs, gives her one last push.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        Ahh. I can’t. I can’t. Stop. 

           She steps off the whirl-a-gig and appears a little sick.

                                 JESSE
                        You okay?

                                 HALA
                        I’m fine.

                                 JESSE
                        Are you going to throw up again?

           She glares at him.

                                 HALA
                        No, I just have to breathe. 

           She leans on the fence. He hangs from the monkey bars.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        You look like a monkey.

                                 JESSE
                        Me?
                                 HALA
                        Yeah, you.

           He jumps off the bars.

                                 JESSE
                        Sorry for pushing you so fast.

           Hala leans her head onto his shoulder. He pulls her close 
           into a hug. They’re quiet for a moment.

                                 HALA
                        It’s okay.

           Jesse leans in to kiss her when --

           They hear laughing from behind them. A bunch of TEENAGERS 
           walk by, snickering and laughing.

                                 JESSE
                            (to the Teenagers)
                        Get lost. 

                                 HALA
                        Forget them.

           Jesse takes her hand.

           EXT. PARK - EVENING

           They walk, side-by-side, out of the park, toward the street.

                                 JESSE
                        Coffee?

                                 HALA
                        I should probably go home.

                                 JESSE
                        You’ll need it for all the studying 
                        you’re going to be doing. 

                                 HALA
                        And if my mom calls?

                                 JESSE
                        Then she calls, and you tell her 
                        you’re with me.

           She gives him an uncertain look. He grins. 

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        You need to seriously lighten up.
           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Hala and Jesse sit down at a booth in the back. 

           From her POV, she sees the back of the diner. From Jesse’s 
           POV, he can see everyone as they enter. 

           Their fingers touch across the table. A WAITER comes by, 
           disrupting their moment.

                                 WAITER
                        What can I get you?

                                 JESSE
                        Coffee. Just two.

           When the Waiter returns, he puts the coffee down in a huff. 

           He gives them a dirty look and heads back.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What’s with that guy? Didn’t even 
                        give us napkins.

                                 HALA
                        He’s probably had a shitty day.

           The door opens and a couple walks in. Hala looks back, pays 
           no mind to them, until she double-takes -- 

           It’s NADIR and BRIGITTE; they sit down at a table in the 
           corner of the diner, near the entrance.

                                 JESSE (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           She immediately turns back. Jesse studies her face.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

           He looks in the direction of the couple.

                                 HALA
                        Don’t look at them.

                                 JESSE
                        Why? Who is that?

                                 HALA
                        Just don’t do it. 

                                 JESSE
                        -- You know that guy?
                                 HALA
                        He’s not supposed to be back until 
                        tomorrow. If he sees us...

                                 JESSE
                        Who?

                                 HALA
                        My dad.

           There’s a beat.

                                 JESSE
                        He doesn’t even know who I am.

                                 HALA
                        I think we should go. I don’t want 
                        him to see us.

                                 JESSE
                        That’s the only exit. 

           Jesse looks around, doesn’t see another way out. 

                                 HALA
                        What’s he doing?

                                 JESSE
                        They’re just ordering drinks. 

                                 HALA
                        Let’s go.

                                 JESSE
                        If you get up now, he’s going to 
                        see you. Just wait until he leaves.

           Hala’s phone VIBRATES.

                                 HALA
                        Fuck.

           The phone screen reads: MOM.

                                 JESSE
                        Aren’t you going to pick that up?

                                 HALA
                        Are they looking over here?

                                 JESSE
                        They’re still talking.
                                 HALA
                        Let’s ask the waiter for the check.

           Jesse squints. 

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        Jesse?

           He says nothing.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening?

           He looks back at her.

                                 JESSE
                        He kissed that woman.

           There’s a pregnant pause.

                                 HALA
                        You’re lying. 

                                 JESSE
                        Why would I lie about that?

                                 HALA
                        This isn’t funny.

                                 JESSE
                        Look for yourself.

           She doesn’t want to look. But she quickly turns -

           -- and sees Nadir with his hand on Brigitte’s knee. Their 
           heads are unusually close together.

           Hala sits back in the booth.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m sorry. 

           Her phone VIBRATES again. She turns it off. Stares at it.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Hala?

           She looks like she’s about to cry.

                                 HALA
                        Are they leaving yet?

           Jesse watches them.
                                 JESSE
                        They’re paying now. 

           A moment later:

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        They just left.

           We HEAR the diner’s door close off-screen. Hala is glued to 
           her seat, unable to move.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Hala.

                                 HALA
                        What?

           Jesse pulls a five-dollar bill from his pocket and leaves it 
           on the table. She snaps out of her daze.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t drive me home.

                                 JESSE
                        Then call Melanie. 

           But she’s glued to her chair.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Hala.

                                 HALA
                        What?

                                 JESSE
                            (firmly)
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. DINER - NIGHT

           It’s raining. Hala and Jesse stand outside, without talking 
           to each other. 

           Melanie’s car pulls up. Hala gets in without so much as a 
           look behind her.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Melanie drives. Hala appears pale.

                                 MELANIE
                        You don’t look so good.
                                 HALA
                        Can you just take me home?

                                 MELANIE
                        I am. Geez. Did something happen?

                                 HALA
                        No.

                                 MELANIE
                        Your mom was calling me, I told her 
                        you were in the bathroom. I felt 
                        horrible lying to her. You put me 
                        in a shitty position.

                                 HALA
                        You didn’t have to do that.

                                 MELANIE
                        What else was I gonna say? I’m 
                        sorry, but Hala’s out with some boy 
                        even though I know that’s totally  
                        against your religion.

           Hala buries herself into the corner of the passenger seat.

           EXT. HOME - NIGHT

           Melanie’s car pulls up and Hala opens the passenger door 
           without waiting for the car to come to a full stop.

                                 MELANIE
                            (shouts after her)
                        You’re welcome!

           INT. HOME - NIGHT

           Hala comes in, but as soon as she opens the door, Eram’s 
           already standing there. 

                                 ERAM
                        You should have told me you went to 
                        Melanie’s.

           She’s startled by Eram’s presence.

                                 HALA
                        Is Dad home?

                                 ERAM
                        No, his flight gets back tomorrow. 
                        I thought he told you. 
           Hala blinks, about to cry.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        What’s up with you? You’re all wet!

           Hala suddenly notices her clothes are soaked and a puddle of 
           water has formed around her on the floor.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hala and Eram drink chai together.

                                 ERAM
                        I have a hard time sleeping here 
                        without your dad.

           Hala nods, fucking upset but can’t do anything about it.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        That’s what it’s like, Hala.
                        When you’re in love.

           Hala puts her mug in the sink and leaves.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala lies in bed, puts her head in her hands, tries to 
           breathe through the anxiety.

           She pushes a pillow to her face, sobbing now, not being able 
           to hold it in anymore.

           She breathes. And breathes.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           And then:

                                 ERAM (O.S.)
                            (softly)
                        Hala.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

           The room’s still mostly dark. Eram opens the blinds. It’s 
           still pitch-black outside. Before dawn.

                                 ERAM
                        Did you forget what today is?

           She did. 
                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        It’s the first day of fast. I made 
                        breakfast, come. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAWN

           She and Eram sit together at the table. 

                                 ERAM
                            (in Arabic)
                        I intend to fast.

           Hala stirs her chai with her spoon.

                                 HALA
                            (mumbles, in Arabic)
                        I intend to fast.

           Her eyes are puffed up. Hala and Eram reach for a date at the 
           same time, chewing in silence.

           INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Hala sits next to Melanie on the bus. This sounds faraway 
           even though she’s right next to her:

                                 MELANIE
                        You finish the book?

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The class is deep in conversation about Lolita. 

           Mr. Lawrence guides the discussion, but it all sounds as if 
           it’s happening underwater, like it doesn’t really matter.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Hala.

           She looks up from her book.

                                 HALA
                        Yes?

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        What do you think?

           She seems lost. He sighs.
                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        About the subjective narrative in 
                        the book? Do you think Humbert 
                        Humbert is a reliable narrator? Can 
                        we trust him?

                                 HALA
                        No.

           There’s a beat.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        We can’t trust him.

           Mr. Lawrence nods.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        And why is that?

                                 HALA
                        We never witness the story from 
                        Lolita’s perspective. He’s written 
                        the story, so of course he’s 
                        telling it in such a way that makes 
                        him seem like a hero.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Very good. When Humbert Humbert is 
                        describing Lolita, he describes her 
                        as tempting him, as luring him to 
                        her. What do you guys think about 
                        that?

                                 GIRL
                        -- she’s too young to have done 
                        that. I mean, what is she, like 
                        twelve in the book? 

                                 BOY
                        You don’t know if he’s telling the 
                        truth but we never get to see her 
                        side, so we don’t know for sure --

                                 GIRL
                        But it’s unlikely, that’s all. We 
                        don’t know what she feels like, 
                        only how he does. The story’s all 
                        about him. He’s not a hero. He’s a 
                        douchebag.

           The class laughs.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Settle down, everyone... 
           The conversation submerges once more.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - LATER

           Students file out as class is finally over. Mr. Lawrence taps 
           Hala’s desk with a finger.

           She’s sitting there, staring at her blue eraser with 
           unsettling intensity. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        What’s going on, space-case?

                                 HALA
                        It’s the first day of fast. 
                        Ramadan. You know. I’m just a 
                        little out of it. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Well. You can always hide out here 
                        if you want to avoid the cafeteria.

                                 HALA
                        That’s okay. I’ll be fine.

           But she won’t be.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Everyone eats lunch around her. 

           Hala looks around, lost in a crowd of teenagers who know who 
           they are (or at least do a good job of pretending). 

           Everything in SLOW-MOTION, because nothing is being processed 
           like it usually is.

           Jesse looks back at her from his table, attempting to engage, 
           but she doesn’t return the look. Hala gets up from the table 
           and quickly leaves the cafeteria.

           EXT. SKATE PARK - DAY

           She skateboards down the full vert, this time into the 
           darkness, instead of toward the light. 

           We lose track of her somewhere in the black. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           OVER BLACK

           Flip. Flip. Smack. Flip. Smack. SMACK.

           The skateboard aggressively slaps the asphalt.

           EXT. SKATE PARK - DUSK

           Hala skateboards home as the light outside is fading fast.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Hala sits down at one end of the table, Eram on the other.  
           Nadir sits down next to his wife.

           Hala looks at him.

                                 ALL TOGETHER
                            (quietly, in Arabic)
                        Thirst is gone, the veins are 
                        moistened and the reward is certain 
                        if Allah wills.

           They eat. But she watches him the whole time.

           And this conversation largely takes place off-screen as we 
           PUSH IN on Hala’s face. 

                                 ERAM
                        How was it?

                                 NADIR
                        I slept well on the plane. 

                                 ERAM
                        And the depositions? They were 
                        okay?

                                 NADIR
                        We had a little trouble with one of 
                        them, but it turned around.

                                 ERAM
                        That’s good. 

                                 NADIR
                        It’s good to be here with you.

                                 ERAM
                        Flatterer.

           There’s laughter, but Hala’s face is devoid of emotion.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           INSERT COMPUTER SCREEN

           A search engine. The words being typed: “Herald, Scotsman and 
           Wright.” The page loads. Then, a cursor clicks on that link.

           The pointer clicks on the ‘Lawyers’ page. The page scrolls 
           down a list of lawyers, their names and accompanying photos.

           The scrolling stops at BRIGITTE WHITE. A smiling photo, 
           followed by an accomplished biography. 

           BACK TO ROOM

           The door opens and Hala quickly closes the browser window.

           Eram peeks her head in.

                                 ERAM
                        Goodnight.

                                 HALA
                        Night.

           Eram leaves right as a text pops up on Hala’s phone:

           INSERT PHONE SCREEN

           Jesse: u okay?

           The cursor blinks. The words form: ‘no’ but are quickly 
           erased. The screen goes black.

           BACK TO ROOM

           Hala turns away from her phone and lies down.

           Another text message lights up her screen: 
           “look outside”

           Hala slowly rises from her bed, opens her window and sees 
           Jesse’s car parked in the alley.

           EXT. HOME - NIGHT

           He waves at her. Inside, she can hear her phone vibrate from 
           the receipt of a new text. She picks up her phone. 

           The message reads: “come with me”

           Hala looks out at the waiting car.
           INT. HOME - NIGHT

           Hala quietly makes her way down the stairs and opens the 
           front door. 

           EXT. HOME - NIGHT

           Jesse’s car pulls up to the front of her house and Hala piles 
           into the passenger seat.

           Just as the car drives away, however, we glimpse a light turn 
           on in a window on the second story of the house.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Hala adjusts her giant sweatshirt. 

                                 HALA
                        Where are we going?

                                 JESSE
                        You’ll see.

           EXT. SKATE PARK - NIGHT

           The car pulls up to the skate park.

           Jesse puts on the radio. He and Hala listen to it for a 
           while. He glances at her, she looks away; she glances at him, 
           he looks away; neither saying a word.

           He reaches over to place his hand over hers. She glances over 
           at him, as if to ask is this real?

                                 JESSE
                        Come on.

           He exits the car from his side. After a moment, Hala follows 
           him, too.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           They sit on the hood of the car. The stars are bright. The 
           music rises in volume until it’s no longer diegetic.

           She raises her arms up, real slow, as if to touch the sky - 
           the same way she had when she was skateboarding - and sways. 

           Hala’s lost in her own moment. Forgotten he’s there. There is 
           only this song, this moment, before shes loses it entirely.
           She spins, and then, right as she’s holding herself, as if 
           she might fall apart at the seams --

           -- he reaches over to pull her into a kiss. 

           The kind of kiss that exists only in dreams - explosive, 
           fleeting, a flash of color.

           And then it’s gone. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Jesse places his hand on top of Hala’s in the car.

           INT. HOME - NIGHT 

           Hala opens the door. The inside of the house is pitch-black.

           She heads up the stairs -- 

           INT. STAIRWELL - HOME - NIGHT

           -- but there’s a FIGURE blocking the light at the top of the 
           stairs. A threatening presence.

           She ascends the staircase, stair by stair, fists clenched at 
           her sides. 

           In the darkness, she can’t make out the expression on Nadir’s 
           face. Hala attempts to move past him, but he blocks her path. 

           He twists her arm back. In a harsh but low whisper, so as to 
           not wake Eram:

                                 NADIR
                        Where were you?

           She looks him in the eye.

                                 NADIR (CONT’D)
                        Who was he?

                                 HALA
                        No one.

           Nadir gapes at her. Hala yanks her arm away from him and 
           speeds toward her room.

           Hala’s bedroom door shuts close behind her. She locks it from 
           the inside.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala makes sure the door is locked. When she turns around, 
           her hands are shaking. 

           She can hear a slow shuffle toward the door, and, after a 
           long while, the shadow below the door disappears.

           But the glow underneath her door remains. After a long 
           moment, it disappears.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Hala draws in her notebook while Mr. Lawrence lectures. 

           He notices the look Jesse shoots in Hala’s direction and the 
           small smirk with which she replies.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Hala sits on the bench, alone this time. Mr. Lawrence joins.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        If you ever feel like talking, my 
                        class is never too far away. 

           Hala nods, as if to say, please get lost. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        You have a good one. 

           He gets up and leaves right as Jesse approaches her bench 
           from far away. 

           In the B.G., Nadir’s car pulls right up to the school. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           From his standpoint inside his car, Nadir sees Hala join 
           Jesse and leave the school-grounds with him.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Nadir slowly follows behind Jesse and Hala.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Hala and Jesse walk side-by-side as they head deeper and 
           deeper into the forest.
                                 JESSE
                        She deserves to know, doesn’t she?

                                 HALA
                        It would ruin everything.

                                 JESSE
                        You’d want to know, if it was you, 
                        wouldn’t you? She’s your mom. She 
                        deserves to know. 

           It’s quiet for a while, as they walk further, until Jesse 
           tries to put his arm around her and she cringes at his touch.

           They walk separately; a safe distance between them.

           EXT. WOODS - DUSK

           They arrive at a clearing in a more secluded part of the 
           woods. They have reconciled since we last saw them. 

                                 JESSE
                        I wish I could see what you looked 
                        like without it.

           He’s appears ashamed to have said it.

                                 HALA
                        You want me to take it off?

                                 JESSE
                        No, no. I don’t. Not unless you 
                        want to. 

                                 HALA
                        Okay.

           He sits down. She gets up, and stands right in front of him.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        I want you to see me.

           Hala slowly pulls on a corner of her headscarf until the rest 
           of it slips off her head. Truly naked now.

           For a moment, Jesse says nothing. 

           He gets up, pulls her toward him into a kiss. But this kiss 
           is different than last, less innocent - growing in intensity. 

           He touches her breasts through her sweater. She embraces him.
                                 JESSE
                            (breathless)
                        I want to take your clothes off.

           He’s already easing her onto her back, onto the ground. 

           Light peeks in from the treetops. 

           She hears a belt unbuckle and a zipper unzip. He pulls her 
           jeans and underwear down. She cannot make out the sky from 
           where she is lying down.

           Jesse leans forward. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK

           A sharp intake of breath. Hers.

                                 JESSE (O.S.)
                        Are you okay?

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           It’s still dark. Without missing a beat: 

                                 HALA
                            (strained)
                        Yeah.

           Her face is tight, belying her words. 

           She counts the number of leaves on the branch of a nearby 
           tree. Jesse pushes forward. She loses track and then -

           -- his breathing quickens, faster and faster -- 

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        Pull out.

           He makes a sound.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                            (scared)
                        I said pull out.

                                 JESSE
                        Oh, fuck.

           He does, spills onto the ground. 
           Hala pulls her jeans up. Jesse pulls up his own pants and 
           offers his hand, which she clearly ignores. 

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, happened really fast, 
                        that usually never... 

                                 HALA
                        I’m fine.

           Hala hears strange moans from nearby. She gets up, and peeks 
           over the small hill.

           Below them, a PROSTITUTE performs oral sex on a MAN. The Man 
           makes eye contact with her.

           Jesse pulls her away from the sight.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Hala looks out the passenger window. Outside, the trees are 
           dappled with light. She’s quiet.

                                 JESSE
                        Maybe you can tell me what I can do 
                        better next time -- 

                                 HALA
                            (cutting him off)
                        I’m really tired.

           INT. MELANIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala and Melanie lie sandwiched in her bed together. 

                                 MELANIE
                        The first time is always the worst.

                                 HALA
                        I thought it would be different. 
                        That I would feel something. 

                                 MELANIE
                        That’s only in the stories.

                                 HALA
                        This isn’t a story?

                                 MELANIE
                        No. 

           A beat. 
                                 HALA
                        What is it then?

                                 MELANIE
                        It’s just life.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Eram and Nadir have already broken their fast when the front 
           door opens and Hala enters the hallway.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Eram gets up out of her chair, but doesn’t approach her.

                                 ERAM
                        You missed iftar. You know how 
                        awful that is, Hala. That is not 
                        acceptable in this home.

                                 HALA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ERAM
                        No, you’re not. You’re not sorry 
                        that you missed iftar. You’re sorry 
                        that you got caught. 

                                 HALA
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 ERAM
                        I don’t understand what’s going on 
                        with you. Always going out with 
                        your friends. As if you don’t like 
                        it here. 

           Eram’s out-of-focus for Hala now. Instead, it’s Nadir, who’s 
           glowering from behind her, who’s in-focus. 

           He appears ready to burst.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m heading to bed.

                                 HALA
                        Mom.

           Hala turns to join her when --

                                 NADIR
                        I need to talk to you.
           Hala stays standing.

                                 NADIR (CONT’D)
                        Sit down.

           She does so.

                                 NADIR (CONT’D)
                        I went to pick you up today. I want 
                        to know where you went.

           EXT. PARK - DAY - EARLIER

           Nadir parks outside. From his POV: Jesse and Hala walk 
           further into the forest.

                                 HALA (O.S.)
                        What do you mean?

           EXT. WOODS - DAY - EARLIER

           He follows them into the woods. STAY on his face, tightening 
           with disgust, as we hear the strained sounds of sex. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nadir never breaks eye-contact with Hala.

                                 NADIR
                        I don’t want you to lie to me. I 
                        followed you and that boy to the 
                        park. You went into those woods and 
                        you didn’t come out until an hour 
                        later. I would have followed you 
                        inside but I didn’t, because I 
                        didn’t know what you were doing 
                        with him and I didn’t want to know 
                        what happened.

           Contrary to what he’s just said, Nadir saw everything. But 
           he’s testing his daughter’s honesty.

           She stares at the floor for a moment. One of the kitchen 
           tiles is a peculiar shade of gray.

                                 NADIR (CONT’D)
                        I want you to tell me what you did. 
                        I don’t want you to lie to me. I 
                        will bring out the Koran and make 
                        you swear on it if I have to.
                                 HALA
                        He’s a classmate of mine.

                                 NADIR
                        What is his name?

                                 HALA
                            (quiet)
                        Jesse.

                                 NADIR
                        Speak louder and look at me when 
                        you’re talking to me.

                                 HALA
                        He’s a classmate.

                                 NADIR
                        And what were you doing with him 
                        after school?

                                 HALA
                        We were talking.

                                 NADIR
                        Did he touch you? Hala?

                                 HALA
                        What?

                                 NADIR
                        Did he touch you? Answer me when I 
                        am talking to you.

                                 HALA
                        No.

                                 NADIR
                        Don’t lie to me.

                                 HALA
                        I didn’t do anything wrong.

                                 NADIR
                            (increasing urgency)
                        Are you lying to me right now? 
                        Don’t make me bring out the Koran. 
                        I should tell your mother. During 
                        Ramadan, for God’s sake, Hala, what 
                        were you thinking? What were you 
                        doing? What the fuck were you 
                        thinking? 
                                 HALA
                        I didn’t do anything wrong.

           For a moment, all is quiet. 

           Nadir picks up the glass and tosses it, smashing into pieces 
           against the wall, missing her head by inches. 

           Nadir smacks her across the face. She falls to the floor, 
           protecting her head with her arms.

                                 NADIR
                        Do you want me to bring out the 
                        Koran right now? Will you lie on 
                        the Koran? 

           Hala chokes on her own spit, she’s sobbing now. 

                                 HALA
                        I DID NOTHING WRONG.

           Nadir gets right up into her space and shakes her fiercely. 

                                 NADIR
                        You are not my daughter. My 
                        daughter could not do this. She 
                        would not do this. How could you do 
                        such a thing.

                                 HALA
                            (quietly)
                        What were you doing with Brigitte?

           Nadir is startled. Eram hurtles in through the door. 

                                 ERAM
                        Nadir, what is going on in here?

           She leans down to help Hala and examines her face.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        You hit her? Why in Allah’s name 
                        did you raise your hand?

                                 NADIR
                            (to Hala)
                        Tell your mother where you were 
                        after school today.

                                 ERAM
                            (to Nadir)
                        Lower your voice in this house!
                                 NADIR
                        Ask her where she’s been.

                                 HALA
                            (spits back at him)
                        I’ll tell her what I’ve done when 
                        you tell her what you did. Who you 
                        were with at the diner.

           Eram looks between the two of them.

                                 ERAM
                        What’s going on? What is she 
                        talking about? Nadir? Hala? What do 
                        you mean --

                                 HALA
                        He was at the diner --

           Nadir shoves Eram aside and twists Hala’s arm and yanks her 
           to the floor, raising his hand to smack her --

                                 NADIR
                        You ungrateful little bitch.

           He smacks her HARD. She gives out a yelp. Eram tries to get 
           between them --

                                 ERAM
                        NADIR!

           Eram shoves him off. 

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        What is wrong with you? STOP! In 
                        God’s name. Stop hitting her. 

                                 HALA
                            (crying)
                        Mom. 

           Her cheeks are reddened and eyes puffy.

                                 NADIR
                        Ask her where she’s been!

           Hala’s lip is bleeding. Eram helps her up.

                                 ERAM
                            (to Nadir, venomously)
                        You’re an animal. 
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala’s trying to hold it all together. But it’s no use. She 
           strips off her clothes. Holds her chest, as if she’s about to 
           fall apart at the seams.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           She fills the tub with water. When it’s full, she gets in and 
           submerges herself under the water.

           Holds her breath with her eyes open. 

           And SCREAMS.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           There’s the sound of intense arguing outside, the noise 
           traveling from her parents’ bedroom to her own. 

           After a while, the arguing dies down; the voices get quieter. 
           Hala lies on her side, completely spent.

           Eram peers into Hala’s room, not quite able to comfort her 
           daughter or let her marriage slip away. 

           INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Hala and Melanie sit in the back of the bus together. Their 
           eyes are lidded with sleep.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Hala and Jesse walk to the fences. No conversation, just 
           uncomfortable body language.

                                 JESSE
                        This is about your dad, isn’t it?

                                 HALA
                        No, it’s not.

                                 JESSE
                        Everything was fine until 
                        yesterday. And now you’ve changed 
                        your mind, I don’t know where it’s 
                        coming from.

                                 HALA
                        I can’t be with you.
           He looks away, clearly hurt by this. Hala turns away when he 
           takes her arm.

                                 JESSE
                        Tell me why.

                                 HALA
                        It doesn’t matter why. 

                                 JESSE
                        You don’t get to just walk away 
                        without telling me, because I have 
                        to understand. I want to 
                        understand.

                                 HALA
                        There’s nothing to understand.

           He appears stunned at this.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           As she walks away, Jesse beats the fence with his fists. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Hala draws in her notebook as Mr. Lawrence lectures up front. 
           When she looks up - the class is empty. 

           There’s a Post-it note on her desk. She turns it over. It 
           reads: “Mr. Lawrence” followed by a phone number.

           INT. COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hala sits across the table from her soft-spoken guidance 
           counselor, MRS. YOO, 40s.

                                 MS. YOO
                        You were supposed to have turned in 
                        your college list last week.

                                 HALA
                        I need a little more time.

           Ms. Yoo studies her face. The bruised lip.

                                 MS. YOO
                        That wasn’t at school, was it?

           Hala avoids her gaze, shrugs it off.
                                 HALA
                        I was skateboarding. 

           Ms. Yoo senses that something is off, but unable to say 
           anything about it. 

                                 MS. YOO
                        Come talk to me if you need 
                        anything, okay?

                                 HALA
                        Okay.

           But Hala’s already on her way out. 

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Hala lies alone on the whirl-a-gig, her face appearing and 
           disappearing with each turn; as we PUSH IN on her, she gets 
           up and leaves frame. 

           EXT. CONDOMINIUMS - DAY

           A beautiful condominium complex for young professionals.

           Hala slips inside the gates right after he swipes his card to 
           enter the complex.

           INT. HALL - CONDOMINIUM - DAY

           Hala lingers in the hallway. 

           She approaches an apartment at the end of the hall. She 
           reaches for the doorknob but draws her hand back.

           Hala’s finger lingers on the doorbell. 

           There’s only quiet behind the door. Then shuffling. Sounds 
           like small feet. 

           The door opens. It’s the DARK-HAIRED GIRL, 3, from before.

                                 DARK-HAIRED GIRL
                        Hello. 

           Hala says nothing.

                                 DARK-HAIRED GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?
                                 HALA
                        Who are you?

                                 BRIGITTE (O.S.)
                        Lo, what’re you doing? You’re not 
                        just supposed to open the door 
                        without mommy. 

           Brigitte appears at the door. She appears more ordinary than 
           she did at the diner - no-makeup, just an ordinary mom. 

                                 BRIGITTE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about that - can I help 
                        you?

           Hala looks at Lo.

                                 LOLO  
                        I know!

                                 BRIGITTE
                        Shush, Lo.

                                 LOLO
                        With Dada. 

                                 BRIGITTE
                            (exasperated)
                        Get back to your room, Lo. 

           Lolo turns away, giving Hala a long look before disappearing 
           back inside the apartment.

           When Brigitte looks back up, Hala’s already broken into a 
           full-on sprint down the hall.

                                 BRIGITTE (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        Excuse me! Are you okay? Do you 
                        need any help? Hello?

           Hala’s heart pounds in her ears.

           EXT. STREETS - EVENING

           Hala crosses the street. She only hears the sound of brakes 
           being SLAMMED and the SCREECH of tires. 

           Followed by the HONK HONK HONK of a car behind her. Hala 
           swivels her head - 

           A DRIVER leans out of his car.
                                 DRIVER
                        The fuck are you doing?! Move!

           INT. BUS - MOVING - EVENING

           Hala sits in the back row of the bus, hand shaking as she 
           dials a number on her phone, Post-it-note in her other hand.

           EXT. LAWRENCE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fireflies wind their way in the air on the lit porch. Mr. 
           Lawrence opens the door and sees Hala sitting on the stoop.

           She turns to look at him with tear-stained cheeks.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LAWRENCE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mr. Lawrence hands her a cup of tea and sits across from her. 

                                 HALA
                        Thank you.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Your parents are probably worried 
                        about you. You should call them. 
                        Let them know where you are.

                                 HALA
                        I wanted to talk about the future.
                        I thought I’d study law like my 
                        father. But now I’m not so sure. I 
                        don’t know if I want to be anything 
                        like him. I just never really 
                        thought I had any options. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        I see.

           She drinks her tea. 

                                 HALA
                        The problem is I don’t know what I 
                        care about. I don’t know where I’m 
                        going to be in five years. I don’t 
                        know where I’ll be in a year. Maybe 
                        I’ll be in college. But I don’t 
                        know what kind of person I want to 
                        be. Or who I should be.
                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        You don’t have to figure everything 
                        out in a day.

                                 HALA
                        What if I never figure it out?

           He laughs, nervous at her intensity.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        You’ll be fine. 

                                 HALA
                        Can I stay here?

           Mr. Lawrence is startled by the question.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        With you? For the night? I’d just 
                        prefer not to go home.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        That wouldn’t be appropriate.

                                 HALA
                        I don’t have anywhere to go. I 
                        don’t want to go home. I could call 
                        Melanie, but she’d probably call my 
                        parents, too.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Are you finished?

           He takes her teacup and heads back to the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - MR. LAWRENCE’S HOME - NIGHT

           He puts dishes away. Hala enters, lingers in the hallway.

                                 HALA
                        It’s not safe for me at home.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Have you talked to Ms. Yoo about 
                        this?

                                 HALA
                        She can’t help me. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Hala.
                                 HALA
                        I’m not asking for anything other 
                        than a place to sleep tonight. 
                        Nobody has to know you helped me. I 
                        just can’t go home tonight.

           Their eyes meet meaningfully.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mr. Lawrence sets a comforter on top of the mattress.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        There’s towels in the closet and an 
                        extra toothbrush in the bathroom. 

           He turns the light on and off in the bathroom.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        Light switch. You’re all set.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

           Hala lies awake. She tosses off her covers.

           INT. MR. LAWRENCE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mr. Lawrence is asleep. Hala takes off her clothes and slips 
           under the covers next to him.

           He immediately wakes up and gets out of bed. He turns on the 
           table lamp with a shaking hand. 

           In the dim light, he sees that she’s half-naked.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        What are you doing?

                                 HALA
                        I couldn’t sleep.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        This is wrong.

                                 HALA
                        I don’t want to sleep alone.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        Please go.

           She stands there for a moment and then sits down on the bed.
           Mr. Lawrence turns away from her, paralyzed. Unable to move.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        You should go home.

                                 HALA
                        My father hit me once.

           It’s quiet for a long while.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

           She slips in bed next to him, reaches over, takes his face 
           and turns it to face her. 

           Hala touches his face with her hand, first his forehead, then 
           nose, then mouth, and finally, down to his chin.

           He sees her bruised lip.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        What happened to your mouth?

           Hala kisses him. He goes stiff. She reaches underneath the 
           sheets and, with her free hand, turns off the light.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK

           A sharp intake of breath. His.

           EXT. ECHO PARK - MORNING

           The morning after. Hala skateboards down the block. The sun 
           is coming up behind her, like a halo behind her head.

           INT. HOME - DAY

           She sneaks inside.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           She turns on the shower, to a too-hot setting. Hala reaches 
           between her legs. The water running down her legs turns a 
           slight pink.
           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Hala emerges, fully dressed, and runs right into her mother, 
           who’s been waiting outside the whole time; her face furrowed 
           in concern.

                                 ERAM
                        Where have you been?

                                 HALA
                        I was at Melanie’s.

           She moves past Eram to pick up her backpack.

                                 ERAM
                        I called her and she said you 
                        weren’t with her.

                                 HALA
                        I was with somebody else. Who cares 
                        who I was with.

           Eram stops her and takes her shoulders.

                                 ERAM
                        I don’t know who you’re with, where 
                        you are, I don’t know what’s going 
                        on with you. I know things haven’t 
                        been easy at home -- 

                                 HALA
                            (forcefully)
                        I’m going to be late for school.

                                 ERAM
                        I need you to talk to me, Hala.

           Hala slings her backpack over her shoulders and leaves Eram 
           alone, who sits down on the bed, completely overwhelmed. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Hala sits down at her desk. Melanie leans over. 

                                 MELANIE
                            (whispers)
                        What’s going on?

           Mr. Lawrence comes in, gives Hala a glance.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                            (to Melanie)
                        Please take your seat. 
           Melanie sinks back into her seat, giving a concerned glance 
           in Hala’s direction. He takes roll call.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Hala scribbles in her notebook. It’s a letter to Mr. 
           Lawrence. She tears off the sheet and folds it. 

                                 MELANIE
                        What did you want me to say? She 
                        was grilling me -

                                 HALA
                        You could have said I fell asleep 
                        at your place.

                                 MELANIE
                        I legit didn’t know whether you 
                        were even alive. Sorry for actually 
                        trying to be a good friend and 
                        worrying about you.

                                 HALA
                        You really messed shit up for me.

                                 MELANIE
                        I just tried to do the right thing.

           Melanie gets up and leaves. Hala picks up her bag and heads 
           back toward school when --

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        What’d you do to Jesse?

           She turns to face him.

                                 HALA
                        What do you mean?

           Hala’s eyes follow as Jesse walks past them, without a look 
           in their direction. 

                                 ANDREW
                        He’s upset. 

                                 HALA
                        I didn’t do anything.

           She continues walking.
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Hala sees Mr. Lawrence talking to Ms. Yoo. He catches Hala’s 
           eye but continues talking to her.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The bell rings. STUDENTS head out of class.

           Hala walks over to Mr. Lawrence’ desk and drops the note in 
           his letter tray. Jesse sees this.

           Mr. Lawrence glances up, takes the note and

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Hala follows Mr. Lawrence to his car. 

                                 HALA
                        Hey.

           He turns on her. 

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        This can’t continue. What happened 
                        last night was very irresponsible. 

           He takes the note out of his pocket and returns it to her.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE (CONT’D)
                        And don’t write me anymore letters. 
                        If someone read those...

                                 HALA
                        Do you regret it?

           The question startles him. Mr. Lawrence moves in closer, so 
           as not to be overheard.

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        You are my student and I am your 
                        teacher. What happened should not 
                        have happened. And it would be best 
                        if you didn’t write these, and if 
                        we never discussed this again.

           Hala appears as if she’s been hit by a brick. He storms off. 

           Melanie walks up, taking Hala’s shoulder.

                                 MELANIE 
                        Hala.
           Melanie has a bewildered expression on her face.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        What just happened? Are you okay?

                                 HALA
                        Fuck off, Mel.

           Hala walks off, wobbly, off-kilter. 

                                 MELANIE
                        What’s going on? Where were you 
                        last night? Jesus Christ! If 
                        someone would fucking tell me! 

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Hala walks into her room, collapses onto her bed in tears. 
           She tries to regulate her breathing. In, out, in.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s just Nadir and Eram. Hala’s seat is empty.

                                 NADIR
                        Everyone pulls overtime. It’s all 
                        about who has the most billable 
                        hours, who the clients trust the 
                        most. I have to pull my weight.

                                 ERAM
                        You’re not pulling your weight 
                        here. In this home. In raising our 
                        daughter. In this marriage.

                                 NADIR
                        There is nothing to say to you. 
                        You’re being unreasonable.

                                 ERAM
                        She’s lost and she needs you.

                                 NADIR
                        It doesn’t matter how hard you try, 
                        or what you do to raise them the 
                        right way. They always end up 
                        disappointing you. 

                                 ERAM
                        You can’t give up on being her 
                        father. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERAM (CONT'D)
                        Just because your father gave up on 
                        you doesn’t mean that she doesn’t 
                        deserve hers --

                                 NADIR
                            (snaps)
                        -- this has nothing to do with my 
                        father. You can stop presuming you 
                        know who I am. 

                                 ERAM
                        I am your wife. I know who you are.

                                 NADIR
                        Our parents were friends. I chose 
                        you, not the other way around. 

           Eram appears devastated. 

                                 NADIR (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it that 
                        way. Eram.

                                 ERAM
                        Don’t talk to me.

           She pushes her plate back and leaves the table. 

                                 NADIR
                        Eram, please.

           The door slams shut.

           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Hala, crouched on one of the stairs, has heard their entire 
           conversation. She goes back upstairs.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Hala looks out the window. She looks smaller, hunched over, a 
           blank expression on her face.

           All the students leave the room in SLO-MOTION as Hala stays 
           in her seat, rigid and in place. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Hala’s furiously writing another note. She drops it on Mr. 
           Lawrence’s desk and makes a beeline for the exit.  
           Mr. Lawrence picks up the note, folds it, and places it into 
           his bag. 

           EXT. HALLWAY - HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           From outside the class, Jesse has seen this happen. He 
           watches Hala disappear down the hall.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Jesse waits near his locker until Mr. Lawrence leaves the 
           classroom for a moment. 

           As soon as Mr. Lawrence is out of sight, he heads back inside 
           the classroom.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Jesse opens Mr. Lawrence’s bag, sifts through it, finds the 
           note, unfolds it. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY (LATER)

           Mr. Lawrence packs up his books and computer. He picks up his 
           bag and heads out. 

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hala sits across from an empty chair; the desk bears a 
           PLACARD that reads PRINCIPAL, MS. REBECCA SCHOETTE.

           REBECCA SCHOETTE, 40s, stern and sympathetic at the same 
           time, sits down across from Hala.

                                 REBECCA
                        How are you?

                                 HALA
                        I’m fine.

                                 REBECCA
                        Do you know why you’re here?

           Hala shakes her head.

                                 HALA 
                        No.
                                 REBECCA
                        A classmate of yours has informed 
                        me that he read a note that you had 
                        addressed to Mr. Lawrence, the 
                        contents of which implicate him in 
                        a relationship with you. Did you 
                        write that note?

           Hala doesn’t meet her eyes.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Did Mr. Lawrence pursue a sexual 
                        relationship with you?

           Another beat.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        I will need to contact the 
                        authorities. You do understand 
                        that..?

           She’s quiet.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Hala?

                                 HALA
                        I want my mother.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Lawrence reads out loud from Notes from the Underground. 
           A knock at the door; it’s Rebecca. She opens the door.

                                 REBECCA
                        Can I have a word?

                                 MR. LAWRENCE
                        I’ll be back in a minute.

           As he heads to the door -

                                 REBECCA
                            (in a whisper)
                        Would be best if you brought your 
                        bag with you.

           Students in class whisper, already speculating and gossiping.

           Melanie notices Hala’s empty desk.
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Students press their faces against the glass, watching 
           intently as Rebecca and Mr. Lawrence walk outside; there’s a 
           police car parked in front.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Eram drives and dials her husband. She reaches voicemail.

                                 ERAM
                        I need you to meet me at the police 
                        station. It’s about Hala. Please 
                        call me when you get this.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Hala sits in the lobby. Eram walks in and embraces her. 

                                 ERAM
                        I called your father.

                                 HALA
                        Why would you do that?

                                 ERAM
                            (harshly)
                        Because he needs to know.

           A POLICE OFFICER approaches Eram.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Do you have a lawyer on their way?

                                 ERAM
                        He should be here any moment.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Mr. Lawrence sits across from two POLICE OFFICERS. They wear 
           grave expressions; their expressions are stern.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Eram and Hala wait in the lobby.

                                 ERAM
                        I taught you to stay on the right 
                        path, and you did whatever you 
                        wanted to do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERAM (CONT'D)
                        There will be consequences, Hala. 
                        And I won’t be able to save you. 

           Right then, Brigitte walks in, her eyes searching for them --

           -- she and Hala meet eyes. Brigitte quickly masks her 
           embarrassed recognition.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        You must be Eram.

           Brigitte extends her hand; Eram doesn’t take it.

                                 ERAM
                        Who are you?

                                 BRIGITTE
                        Brigitte White. I’m one of the 
                        junior lawyers at the same firm as 
                        your husband. He sent me to 
                        represent your daughter.

                                 ERAM
                        I need Nadir in here.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        He’s in a deposition right now.

                                 ERAM
                        This is my daughter.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        I’m very sorry. He thought it would 
                        be best if I came in his place.

           Police Officer approaches them.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                            (to Eram, gesturing toward 
                              Brigitte)
                        Is this your lawyer?

           Eram hesitates for a long moment.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Police Officer leads Hala, Brigitte and Eram into the room.

                                 BRIGITTE
                            (to Police Officer)
                        I’d like to speak with my client 
                        alone first.
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        That’s fine.

           He exits. 

                                 BRIGITTE
                            (to Eram)
                        I think it’s best if you let her 
                        speak for herself.

                                 ERAM
                        Nadir should be here, I don’t care 
                        if he’s --

                                 BRIGITTE
                        -- he’s in a deposition.

                                 ERAM
                            (exasperated)
                        Then he should get out of it and be 
                        here for his daughter! What is he 
                        thinking? I don’t know what I’m 
                        supposed to be doing. 

                                 BRIGITTE
                        I’m sorry. I’m just doing the best 
                        that I can.

                                 ERAM
                            (snaps)
                        Your best isn’t good enough.

                                 HALA
                        Mom.

           Eram is startled out of her anger.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                            (to Eram)
                        Please just go. 

           Eram finally storms out, but not without shooting Brigitte a 
           dirty look before she goes. 

           As soon as the door shuts close --

                                 BRIGITTE
                        Why did you visit me?

                                 HALA
                        Are you sleeping with my father?

           There’s a long silence.
                                 BRIGITTE
                        I’m going to do everything in my 
                        power to help you.

                                 HALA
                        I need to know the truth. 

                                 BRIGITTE
                        Whatever your father and I had, it 
                        is over. Our relationship is 
                        strictly professional now. 

                                 HALA
                        Am I supposed to forgive you?

                                 BRIGITTE
                        I need you to trust me if you want 
                        me to represent you in that room 
                        with those officers. They’ll ask 
                        you difficult questions. 
                        Uncomfortable questions. I’m here 
                        to help you. I don’t need you to 
                        like me. I need you to trust me.

           Hala gives her an uncertain look.

                                 HALA
                        Okay.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        From this point forward, you tell 
                        me the truth and nothing else. Did 
                        you have a sexual relationship with 
                        your teacher, Mr. Lawrence?

                                 HALA
                        No. 

                                 BRIGITTE
                        Did you have sex with him?

           Hala hesitates.

                                 HALA
                        No.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        Did he perform any sexual favors?

                                 HALA
                        Yes.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        What did he do? Oral sex?
           Hala nods.

                                 BRIGITTE (CONT’D)
                        Was it consensual? Did you agree 
                        for him to do this?

                                 HALA
                        Yes.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        How many times did it happen?

                                 HALA
                        Once.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        You understand that Mr. Lawrence 
                        may be arrested because he is in a 
                        position of power over you? He is 
                        your teacher and you are his 
                        student. The law sees it as immoral 
                        for him to have asserted his 
                        authority over you in this way.

           There’s a knock at the door. The Officer comes in, digital 
           recorder in hand. He sets it down on the table. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Are you ready?

           Brigitte’s face doesn’t betray any uncertainty.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        Yes.

           Officer presses the record button. 

           Hala opens her mouth to speak.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY - LATER

           Eram sits outside on a bench. Brigitte joins her, taking a 
           long drag on her cigarette.

                                 ERAM
                        Is it over?

           Brigitte nods. She blows out her smoke.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        What are those?
                                 BRIGITTE
                        These? American Spirits.

           Eram absorbs this.

                                 ERAM
                        Nadir smokes those.

                                 BRIGITTE
                        They’re popular at the office. You 
                        want one?

           Brigitte hands her a cigarette. Eram uncharacteristically 
           takes one. After a long moment:

                                 BRIGITTE (CONT’D)
                        He wanted to be here.

                                 ERAM
                        If he wanted to be here, he would 
                        be here. When Nadir wants 
                        something, he gets it.

           Eram gives her a pointed look. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Eram drives. 

                                 HALA
                        It was Brigitte. He was with her at 
                        the diner.

                                 ERAM
                        I know.

                                 HALA
                        I’m sorry.

           Hala looks over to see her reaction, but Eram’s face betrays 
           no emotion.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nadir opens the kitchen window to let the air out. He’s 
           smoking a cigarette at the table. 

           Eram walks in, sets her bag down on a chair and levels with 
           him; her face is tight.

                                 ERAM
                        You didn’t come.
                                 NADIR
                        It worked out, Eram. You don’t have 
                        to be so tense. Everything’s fine.

                                 ERAM
                        Everything is not fine, and it will 
                        never be fine again. 

           They share a look.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                            (whispers)
                        Talaq.

                                 NADIR
                        Eram. You can’t be serious.

                                 ERAM
                        Talaq.

                                 NADIR
                        Dear, if you say it one more time, 
                        you can’t take it back.

                                 ERAM
                            (firmly)
                        Talaq.

                                 NADIR
                        Now you’ve really done it. 

                                 ERAM
                        Yes, I have.

           Eram leaves him smoking at the table. Nadir puts his face in 
           his hands, overwhelmed. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hala sits awake in her darkened room. 

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           Hala skateboards alone. Her face appears anguished.

           INT. METRO STATION - NIGHT

           She pushes past the turnstile. 
           INT. METRO PLATFORM - NIGHT

           The platform’s relatively empty. She walks past the groups of 
           people waiting for the train.

           Hala walks up to the EDGE of the platform, past the yellow 
           bar where it’s “safe” to stand. 

           She CLOSES her eyes. 

           She can feel the air move and hear the distant sound of the 
           train coming in from the other end. 

           Will she jump? 

           A WOMAN SCREAMS.

           Hala opens her eyes and sees --

           -- A MAN JUMP IN FRONT OF THE INCOMING TRAIN.

           The train SLAMS against his body. He’s CRUSHED underneath the 
           speeding train cars.

           A WOMAN shields her CHILD’S eyes but he’s already witnessed 
           the grisly horror.

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           Hala sprints home. Her anguished face emerges and disappears 
           under the passing orange street lights.

           She gains speed, running away from herself, this world, this 
           life, the futility and meaninglessness of existence.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Hala watches the passing scenery. Spring now; the trees are 
           showing new signs of life.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The SCHOOL BELL rings. Students settle in; different haircuts 
           and lighter clothes. A different TEACHER lectures at his 
           desk. Some time has passed.

           Hala looks out the window. 
           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Hala appears healthier than before, but no less sad. Melanie 
           sits down next to her.  

           But they don’t talk. They watch the other STUDENTS laughing 
           and talking in the yard.

           INT. METRO - DAY

           Hala holds onto the pole in a mostly empty subway car.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Hala walks up to the apartment. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           She passes by the LANDLADY. 

                                 LANDLADY
                        Say hello to your mother for me.

                                 HALA
                        I will.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hala and Eram sit on opposite sides of a small dining table 
           in a cramped apartment; their new home. 

           They say nothing as they eat together. No words, just the 
           sound of utensils. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The new Teacher paces at the front of the class as students 
           busily finish their exams. 

           Hala concentrates on her test, fills in answers. The timer 
           reaches zero.

                                 TEACHER
                        Pencils down. Please turn in your 
                        exams. 

           Hala passes up her test. The SCHOOL BELL rings.
           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Melanie drives as Hala sits in the passenger seat. 

                                 MELANIE
                        I’m glad I’m getting to see you 
                        before I leave for the summer.

                                 HALA
                        What?

                                 MELANIE
                        Dad’s getting relocated to London 
                        for work, so we’re packing up.

                                 HALA
                        You didn’t tell me that.

           Melanie shrugs. 

                                 MELANIE
                        You never asked.

           INT. THEATER - DAY

           Hala sits next to Melanie. We don’t know what the film is, 
           but it sounds like a drama.  

           PUSH IN on Hala’s face during the film. 

           Her face cycles through sadness, anger, despair, resignation, 
           and numbness in a SINGLE, CONTINUOUS TAKE.

           The sound of a GUNSHOT pulls us out of it. 

           Hala takes in a breath as if she had been holding her breath 
           underwater for too long.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           It’s just Melanie and Hala now.

                                 HALA
                        I think I’m going to apply for a 
                        driver’s license.

           Melanie looks over in surprise.

                                 MELANIE
                        I could teach you. 

           They smile at each other. 
           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hala sits down next to her mother on the couch. Eram has a 
           community college pamphlet in her hands.

                                 ERAM
                        How was the movie?

                                 HALA
                        It was all right. We should go 
                        together sometime. 

           Eram ‘mhms’. She’s still reading. Hala notices the pamphlet.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 ERAM
                        I thought, why not? Especially if 
                        you’re going away to school, I 
                        thought I’d finally have the time 
                        to myself to go and learn 
                        something, maybe accounting... 

                                 HALA
                        You can definitely do it. 

           Eram taps her on the head with the pamphlet.

                                 ERAM
                            (a little sad)
                        Oh, I thought you believed your mom 
                        was always a little dumb.

                                 HALA
                        I’ve never thought that.

                                 ERAM
                        Is it the truth?

                                 HALA
                        Yes.

           After a beat, Eram begins to cry. Hala embraces her. They sit 
           there on the couch, holding each other for a long time.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A very cramped bedroom. Not as nice as her previous one. Hala 
           lies in a single bed. 
           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           SLOWLY PULL OUT as Hala leans out her window and watches the 
           people on the streets below.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Hala sprints across the street. 

           INT. METRO - DAY

           Her eyes are closed as people chatter all around her.

                                 HALA (O.S.)
                        Will that be all, sir?

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Yes, thank you.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Hala, in a waitress uniform, takes a COUPLE’s order. 

           INT. BACK OF THE RESTAURANT - DAY

           Hala picks up two plates of orders.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           She places the Couple’s orders on the table. 

           When she looks back up again, she sees Jesse and Andrew enter 
           the cafe and sit at a table near the front.

           She hesitates. Another WAITRESS gives her a look. Hala sighs, 
           heads over to them.

                                 HALA
                        What can I get you?

                                 JESSE
                        I didn’t know you worked here.

           Hala’s face tenses. Andrew flips open the menu. 

                                 HALA
                        What would you like?
           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Andrew and Jesse are done eating. Jesse places a large tip on 
           the table when Andrew’s not looking. 

           Andrew exits. Jesse lingers. Hala approaches the table and 
           picks up the plates.

           She sees the large tip. 

                                 HALA
                        You don’t have to give that much.

                                 JESSE
                        I want to. 

                                 HALA
                        Thank you.

                                 JESSE
                            (ashamed)
                        You all right?

           She picks up their plates, turning away from him, signaling 
           the end of their conversation.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight.

                                 HALA
                        You too. 

           She watches him and Andrew cross the street. 

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           Hala stuffs her hands rubbed raw from washing dishes back 
           into her pockets.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Hala waits in line as each of the students goes up, one by 
           one, to be photographed in front of a blue-sky background.

           She watches the other students take their photographs. They 
           all appear annoyed to be doing it, but in front of the 
           camera, they smile on command.

           Hala sits down on the stool in front of the backdrop. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        All right. Smile.
           There’s a FLASH of WHITE LIGHT.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, let’s try that one more time.

           This time, she forces the smile. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Perfect.

           Another FLASH of WHITE LIGHT as we PUSH IN on the faux blue-
           sky background -- 

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           -- and transition into a real sky. 

           This is from Hala’s POV as she lies on the fresh grass. She 
           takes a handful of grass in both of her fists and squeezes 
           them tight. 

           She takes in a deep breath. As if coming to terms with what’s 
           happened, she lets a shaky breath out. 

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           In a dimly-lit room, Hala blows out the candles on a birthday 
           cake surrounded by her mom and her friends.

           The girls at the party sing ‘Happy Birthday’ with gusto. They 
           all clap and laugh. 

           Eram slices the cake, which everyone scarfs down. 

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY 

           Dirty paper plates are stacked on the table. Melanie connects 
           her iPod to the speakers. She picks something dance-y.

           She gets up in front of the others, as if to present a show.

                                 MELANIE
                            (to Eram)
                        You have to dance.

                                 MONICA
                        We know you have some moves!

           Eram laughs.
                                 MELANIE
                        Come on!

                                 ERAM
                        If Hala says so -

                                 HALA
                        - Do it! Go.

           Melanie pulls Eram to her feet. With much embarrassment, Eram 
           starts to dance with the girls. 

           Slowly at first, and then, with greater enthusiasm -

           Hala is both embarrassed and proud.

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God, mom.

                                 MELANIE
                        Ohhh! Yeah! Come on. Everybody!

           They all dance together and Hala looks on - a small smile 
           forming on her face. 

           A small semblance of normalcy returning to her life.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER

           Hala and Eram pick up dirty paper plates and cups and toss 
           them into garbage. The landline RINGS. 

           Eram picks up the phone. 

                                 ERAM
                        Hello?

           Someone on the other end speaks. Eram watches as Hala takes 
           the garbage out with a smile on her face.

                                 ERAM (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           She hangs up. Eram approaches Hala.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Hala exits the complex and sees Nadir beyond the gate, gift 
           box in his hands. 

           She opens up the gate, allowing her some space to stand, but 
           now allowing Nadir in.
                                 NADIR
                        Happy Birthday. I thought I’d just 
                        come by to give you this. A little 
                        congratulations. 

           He hands her the box and she reluctantly takes it.

                                 HALA
                        Thanks.

           She shuts the gate and heads back to the apartment.

                                 NADIR
                            (trying to make 
                              conversation)
                        That’s very impressive, getting 
                        into Harvard. You get the smarts 
                        from your father. Always did.

           Hala stops. Her fingers dig into the box. She turns around.

                                 HALA
                        No, I don’t.

           Nadir watches her enter the building. 

           The door slams shut behind her.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hala tears into the wrapping paper at the kitchen table. Eram 
           washes dishes and watches from out of the corner of her eye.

           Hala pulls out a VINTAGE RECORD - it’s classic Iranian music.  
           From over her shoulder, Eram peers at the gift.

                                 ERAM
                        Looks expensive.

                                 HALA
                            (unimpressed)
                        He’s just showing off. 

           Hala sets the record on the bedside table, no longer 
           interested in it. 

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, all wearing blue gowns, stand in a 
           line, waiting for their names to be called so they can go up 
           and receive their diploma from Rebecca.
           Parents watch expectantly in the crowd. Rebecca finally 
           arrives at Hala’s name. 

           Hala walks up to the podium, shakes the Principal’s hand and 
           receives her diploma in the other. 

           In the crowd, Eram bursts into tears. Elsewhere, Nadir looks 
           on with anguished pride.

           Hala walks off the podium as students continue to be called 
           up to receive their diplomas.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Students toss their graduation caps in celebration. In the 
           midst, Hala’s face has lit up. She can leave this all behind.

           EXT. MELANIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Melanie and Hala embrace as Melanie’s parents load cardboard 
           boxes into the car.

                                 MELANIE
                        You better come visit. Would be fun 
                        to have you around.

                                 HALA
                        Let’s plan on it. 

                                 MELANIE
                            (whispers)
                        I’ll see you soon.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           Hala watches the car become smaller and smaller until she can 
           barely see it in the distance. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hala picks up Nadir’s record. Looks at it. Hesitates to put 
           it in the cardboard box.  

           From the other room:

                                 ERAM (O.S.)
                        You sure you don’t need any help?

                                 HALA
                        No, I’m good. 
           INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Her room’s full of taped cardboard boxes, save for the record 
           that her father bought her for her birthday still sitting on 
           a shelf, collecting dust.

           After a moment, Hala packs it inside one of the larger boxes. 

           INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - NIGHT

           She can’t fall asleep. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Hala drives this time. Eram’s in the passenger seat, 
           connecting Hala’s iPod to the radio. 

           Eram cycles through the music, hesitates over a song, hiding 
           her disappointment.

           Hala looks over.

                                 HALA
                        You should play it.

                                 ERAM
                        It doesn’t feel right.

                                 HALA
                        It’s our song, too. 

           Eram presses play. Soghati by Hayedeh. 

           Hala looks over at Eram, small smile on her face, as she 
           begins to sing. 

           Eram joins her, and in this moment, they are still a family.

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Eram looks ready to cry but doesn’t. She hands Hala the last 
           of her carryons.

                                 HALA
                        I’ll call you when I land.

           They embrace.

                                 ERAM
                        Don’t make me worry about you.
           As Hala parts from the embrace,

                                 HALA
                        I won’t.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOVING - NIGHT

           She looks out the window as the scenery shifts.

           EXT. DORMITORIES - HARVARD UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

           The CAB DRIVER helps her carry her luggage to the door.

           INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Hala walks into an empty room with a bed, a nightstand, a 
           bookcase and a writing desk. 

           She puts her luggage down and collapses onto the bed. Taking 
           a long, good lung-ful of air and lets out a breath.

           There’s a KNOCK at the door. It’s HANNAH (18), her suitemate.

                                 HANNAH
                        Hey. Hala, right? I’m Hannah. 

                                 HALA
                        Yeah. 

           Hala gets up and shakes her hand.

                                 HANNAH
                        Didn’t mean to bug you. I, uh, 
                        don’t know anyone here and a couple 
                        of the freshmen on the first floor 
                        got a few of the older kids to buy 
                        them beer, so if you wanna come 
                        join, it’ll be on the first floor, 
                        can’t miss it.

                                 HALA
                        Thanks so much.

                                 HANNAH
                        Awesome. Well, I’ll leave you to 
                        it. Let me know if you need 
                        anything.  

           Hala gives her a small smile and returns to unpacking boxes.
           EXT. STREETS - HARVARD - NIGHT

           FOLLOW Hala closely from behind as she walks out of her dorm 
           and onto the streets. She digs her hands into her pockets.

           When she hears the sound of people carrying on a conversation 
           behind her, she glances over her shoulder, turns back and 
           continues on.

           INT. CAFE - HARVARD SQUARE - DAY

           Hala sits down at a stool on the counter. The Waitress brings 
           her coffee. 

           A dark-haired BOY, 18, with an intense expression on his 
           face, checks her out. He’s new, too.

                                 BOY
                        Hey. You just moved in?

           Hala stirs the coffee with her little spoon.

                                 HALA
                        What’s your name?

           Hala looks down at her coffee, lost at first; the swirl in 
           her coffee dissipates. 

           She turns to him, after a moment, and speaks, self-assured 
           this time:

                                 HALA (CONT’D)
                        Hala.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                                                   FIN.
