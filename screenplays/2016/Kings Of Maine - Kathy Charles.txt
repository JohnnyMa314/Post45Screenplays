                                                -- STEPHEN KING
           INT. ATTIC - DAY

           Dust. Old furniture. Sunlight from a cobwebbed window 
           penetrates the shadows.

           The creaking of feet on stairs. A boy steps into the 
           darkness, STEPHEN (11). He looks around, apprehensive. An 
           attic is a scary place for a boy.

           He takes the plunge; enters the musty space. Dust mites dance 
           in a single shaft of sunlight.

           Stephen drags over an old chest and opens it. He fishes out a 
           moth-filled BLOUSE; digs deeper. Just his mother’s OLD 
           CLOTHES. Nothing interesting.

           He pushes the chest aside; spies a wooden crate. The side 
           reads: DRINK MOXIE SODA. MAINE IN A BOTTLE. The lettering is 
           red and faded.

           Stephen drags the crate over and peers inside. Bingo.

           The crate is filled with old PAPERBACKS. He scoops one out 
           and holds it up. The cover shows a MONSTER with DEVIL HORNS 
           emerging from between two GRAVESTONES. The title is THE 
           LURKING FEAR AND OTHER STORIES. The author is H.P. LOVECRAFT.

           He puts the book back and pulls out another one. A scantily 
           clad woman is being devoured by rats, her skin scratched and 
           bloody. The cover warns: “AFTER THE H-BOMB, BEWARE OF... THE 
           COMING OF THE RATS.” Jackpot.

           Stephen replaces the books and weaves his hands through the 
           handles of the crate. He’s about to lift it when--

           A voice from behind him; a man in shadows.

           His father, DONALD.

                                 DONALD
                            (stern)
                        Stephen.

           Stephen drops the crate; whips around. No one’s there. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hello?

           Nothing. Must have been his imagination.

           He leans over, drags the crate a few more feet, then...
                                 DONALD
                        What do you think you’re doing, 
                        Stephen? That don’t belong to you.

           Stephen peers nervously into the corner of the attic. A dark 
           figure walks towards him.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Dad? 

                                 DONALD
                        I told you not to touch my things. 
                        Damn kids, taking things that ain’t 
                        yours. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m sorry, Dad.

                                 DONALD
                        You think you’re better than your 
                        old man? Is that it? You think 
                        you’re better than your old man, 
                        Stevie?

           DONALD steps out of the shadows.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You’re not the only one with 
                        dreams.

           DONALD’s eyes turn RED. He bares VAMPIRE FANGS and LAUGHS.

           Stephen SCREAMS. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - NIGHT

           STEPHEN KING (20s) wakes from a nightmare. He’s all grown up; 
           a husky, hulking figure with shaggy hair and a thick mountain 
           man beard. 

           His wife, TABITHA, a cute country girl with a bob of curly 
           hair, sleeps soundly beside him.

           A baby begins to cry. Stephen throws back the covers. Tabitha 
           stirs as he leaves the bed.

                                 TABITHA
                            (sleepy)
                        I’ll get her.
                                 STEPHEN
                        No. I’ll do it.

           Stephen hoists himself up and walks over to a CRIB. He lifts 
           up his crying infant daughter NAOMI, comforting her.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, sweetie.

           INT. KITCHENETTE, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER

           Stephen opens the FRIDGE, baby in arms, and takes out a BEER, 
           cracking it open with his free hand. He slams it back as 
           Naomi’s cries lessen. She eyes her father curiously.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (to Naomi)
                        Daddies need milk too.

           Naomi grins and giggles.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        At least someone’s happy ‘round 
                        here.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - MORNING

           Light streams through thin, ragged curtains. Stephen wakes to 
           the sound of SIZZLING bacon. He groans, rubs his eyes and 
           squints against the sunlight.

           INT. KITCHENETTE 

           Tabitha tosses bacon in a frying pan. She’s wearing a 
           HOUSEDRESS; her cupid face framed by oversized PRESCRIPTION 
           GLASSES. 

           Naomi sits in a highchair; watches curiously as her mother 
           prepares breakfast. Stephen lumbers into the kitchen area. 
           He’s wearing dirty jeans and a tee shirt that says MAINERS DO 
           IT BETTER.

           Stephen steals a piece of bacon from the frying pan.

                                 TABITHA
                        That all you’re havin’?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m runnin’ late. Where’s my 
                        jacket?
                                 TABITHA
                        Check the laundry room.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

           More a closet than a room. Piles of dirty clothes take up 
           every inch of space.

           Stephen rummages around until he finds what he’s looking for: 
           a faded denim jacket. Something in the corner of the tiny 
           space catches his attention: a CARD TABLE with a PLASTIC 
           CHAIR pushed under it. On the table sits an OLIVETTI
           TYPEWRITER. Stephen regards the typewriter with a mixture of 
           love and hate.

           INT. KITCHENETTE

           Tabitha burns the bacon. Smoke rises from the pan.

                                 TABITHA
                        Shit!

           She opens the trash can, is about to scoop the bacon in when 
           something catches her eye.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM 

           Stephen puts on his denim jacket; is about to leave when 
           Tabitha enters.

                                 TABITHA
                        What’s this? 

           He turns around. Tabitha’s holding up an EMPTY BEER CAN.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (sheepish)
                        I needed something to help me 
                        sleep.

                                 TABITHA
                        You ever heard of countin’ sheep?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It was just one beer, Tab.

           Tabitha pulls something out of the other pocket of her 
           housedress. It’s another EMPTY BEER CAN. Stephen sighs. 
           Busted.

           The PHONE rings in the kitchenette.
           INT. KITCHENETTE 

           Stephen scoops up the phone as Tabitha throws the beer cans 
           back in the trash.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hello?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello, Steve?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ayuh?

           INT. DOUBLEDAY, NEW YORK CITY

           A bustling publishing house. BILL THOMPSON sits at his desk. 
           A portly man with a kind demeanor, Bill is the sort of editor 
           every writer dreams of: passionate, smart and invested in his 
           clients.

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        Steve, it’s Bill Thompson at 
                        Doubleday.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE

           Stephen raises a surprised eyebrow at Tabitha.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Bill! Good to hear from ya. How you 
                        been?

           Tabitha’s ears prick up at the mention of Bill’s name.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN STEPHEN AND BILL

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        Disappointed, to tell you the 
                        truth. I may as well say up front 
                        I’m calling with bad news.
                            (beat)
                        The sales board passed on the book.

           Tabitha watches as Stephen deflates. He tries to keep a 
           cheery countenance.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Wow. So they passed, huh?

           Tabitha sighs. Not again.
                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        I’m sorry. Science fiction’s a hard 
                        sell right now. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s okay, Bill. Thanks for 
                        trying.

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        You got anything else?

                                 STEPHEN
                        You mean another book? Not really. 
                        I’ve been focusing on short 
                        stories. They pay faster. 

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        Well when you’ve got another one 
                        you send it to me, okay?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I will. 

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        You’re a talented guy, Steve. We’ll 
                        get something through eventually.

                                 STEPHEN
                        All right. Thanks for the call, 
                        Bill.

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        Don’t mention it.... and Steve? 
                        Watch out for those Maine bears, 
                        okay?

           Stephen laughs.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Will do. 

           Stephen hangs up. Tabitha frowns.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        They passed. Again.

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m sorry, hon. Those sales boards 
                        don’t know anything. That book is 
                        great.
                                 STEPHEN
                            (beat)
                        I really thought this would be the 
                        one.

                                 TABITHA
                        Maybe you can sell it to a 
                        magazine. Get it serialized.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Maybe.

                                 TABITHA
                        Hey.

           Tabitha puts her arms lovingly around her husband.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        It’ll happen. You’ll just have to 
                        write another one.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Forget it. I don’t have time to 
                        work on something that’s never 
                        gonna get published. Not when short 
                        stories are paying the bills. 
                        Anyway, I’m all outta big ideas. If 
                        a “marathon to the death” isn’t 
                        enough to get these New York 
                        bigwigs excited, I don’t know what 
                        is.

           Tabitha gives him a sympathetic smile.

                                 TABITHA
                        You’ll think of somethin’. You 
                        always do.

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER

           Stephen walks out the front door; lights a cigarette. We see 
           the DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER in all its dilapidated glory.

           A RUSTED BUICK sits in the driveway, held together by BALING 
           WIRE and DUCT TAPE. 

           Stephen gets behind the wheel and says a Hail Mary.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Please God.
           He steels himself and turns the KEY in the ignition. 
           Miraculously the car starts. “Layla” by Derek and the Dominos
           blasts from the radio.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                            (looking towards the 
                             heavens)
                        Thanks, big guy.

           INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY, HAMPDEN, MAINE - DAY

           Stephen pushes a GIANT CART down a line of INDUSTRIAL SIZED 
           WASHERS. The sound of the machines is deafening.

           He finds an EMPTY WASHER; opens the enormous door and tips 
           the contents of the cart inside. He closes the door and turns 
           the machine on. The sheets spin round and round, dancing with 
           each other. 

           Stephen stares into the washer as if hypnotized, his mind a 
           million miles away.

           INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - LATER

           A row of HAND PRESSES and SHIRT-FOLDING UNITS. Workers 
           operate the machines with barely concealed boredom. 

           Stephen stands in front of an IRONER AND FOLDER. On the other 
           side of the machine stands TONY, his co-worker. 

           They each take an end of a dirty sheet and feed it into the 
           machine. Tony shouts above the whirr of the engine.

                                 TONY
                            (to Stephen)
                        You ask me, people need to give 
                        Nixon a break. So what if he’s a 
                        crook? They’re all crooks! That 
                        man’s done a lotta good for this 
                        country...

           Stephen spaces out. He stares into the JAWS of the machine, 
           feeds in another sheet. BIG METAL TEETH grab the linens, 
           DEVOURING them. 

           Tony’s voice BUZZES in his ear. Stephen grabs another sheet, 
           pushes it towards the FEEDER, when... 

           Tony’s hand CATCHES in the linen. METAL TEETH come down, 
           WRENCHING THE SHEET towards the mouth of the machine. Tony’s 
           HAND is TORN OFF. Blood POURS from the wound. 
           The LINENS turn SCARLET RED. STEPHEN SCREAMS. Tony looks at 
           Stephen, annoyed, as blood spurts in the air in front of his 
           face.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing, Steve?

           Stephen wakes as if from a dream. He looks at Tony’s hand. 
           There’s no bloody stump; no mangled hand. It was just his 
           imagination.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t doze around these 
                        machines, man. It’s dangerous.

           Stephen nods shakily, rattled by the vision.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sorry.

           INT. BREAK ROOM, INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - LATER

           A bleak wood-paneled room with a few PLASTIC TABLES, some 
           CHAIRS and a COFFEE MACHINE. A poster of a forest trumpets 
           MAINE. THE WAY LIFE SHOULD BE.

           Stephen sits eating a TUNA SANDWICH. He flicks through a dog-
           eared copy of LIFE MAGAZINE someone has left on the table. A 
           story catches his eye:

                              TELEKINESIS: FACT OR FICTION?

           Beneath the headline is a PHOTO: a woman stares at a PLATE as 
           it HOVERS IN THE AIR. Stephen reads, eyes widening with every 
           word.

           Tony strolls in. He opens the fridge, looks inside and 
           scowls.

                                 TONY
                        Goddamn assholes in here drinkin’ 
                        all the Coke.
                            (to Stephen)
                        What the hell’s got your attention 
                        so bad?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Humph? Oh, just this article.

                                 TONY
                        Oh yeah? What’s it about?
                                 STEPHEN
                        Telekinesis.

                                 TONY
                        Tele-what?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s where you can move stuff with 
                        your mind.

                                 TONY
                        You believe in that shit?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I dunno.

                                 TONY
                        Every time I come in here you’re 
                        readin’ something weird. You sure 
                        are an odd guy, Steve.

           Tony exits. Stephen barely notices. The article has him 
           enthralled.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - LATER

           Stephen kicks open the back door and lumbers outside. He 
           lights a cigarette; enjoys a moment of quiet. Suddenly he 
           hears the sound of approaching SINGING. The voice is deep and 
           husky.

                                 VOICE
                            (singing)
                        Baby, can you dig your maaaan? He’s 
                        a righteous man... baby, can you 
                        dig your maaaaan??

           A man walks by wearing COWBOY BOOTS, DARK BLUE JEANS, a DENIM 
           SHIRT and DUSTY DENIM JACKET. In his hand is a FLASK.

           Stephen watches with envy as the man takes a drink. He tips 
           his flask towards Stephen and smiles. Stephen nods shyly in 
           return. The man disappears around the corner, Stephen staring 
           after him.

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - AFTERNOON

           Stephen pulls up in the Buick, gets out and checks the MAIL 
           BOX. There’s mostly bills and some junk mail. There’s also an 
           envelope from CAVALIER MAGAZINE.
           Stephen tears it open. Inside is a CHECK for FIFTY DOLLARS. 
           He smiles. It’s not much, but it’s something.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen strolls proudly inside, holds up the check for his 
           wife to see.

                                 STEPHEN
                        We’re in the money. Fifty bucks!

           Tabitha sounds far from happy. She gestures to the baby in 
           her arms.

                                 TABITHA
                        Steve... something’s wrong. She 
                        won’t stop crying.

           The joy drains from Stephen’s face. He feels his baby’s 
           forehead.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey Naomi... what’s wrong? You not 
                        feeling well?

                                 TABITHA
                        I think it’s her ear. 

           Stephen looks in Naomi’s ear. He touches a large bulge in the 
           EARLOBE. A thick trail of YELLOW PUS oozes out.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Jesus Christ!!

           INT. DOCTORS OFFICE - EVENING

           Naomi sits on a cold steel table, clinging desperately to her 
           Daddy.  The doctor pokes at her ear with a swab. She cries 
           louder.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s an ear infection, all right. 
                        Pretty bad one too. She’ll need 
                        some antibiotics.

           Stephen and Tabitha exchange a concerned look. How much is 
           that gonna cost?
           EXT. SHOP ‘N SAVE PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Stephen walks out of the DRUG STORE holding a BROWN PAPER 
           BAG. He gets in the Buick and takes out a vial of BRIGHT PINK 
           GOO; waves it playfully at his daughter.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (scary voice)
                        Ooooo... look at this, Naomi! “The 
                        Pink Stuff.” Sounds like a nuclear 
                        concoction that turns rats into 
                        monsters. 
                            (jokingly to Tabitha)
                        Sure we should be giving this stuff 
                        to our kid?

                                 TABITHA
                            (tense)
                        We paid enough for it.

           Stephen tries to assuage Tabitha’s fears.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Come on, Tab. We’re okay.

                                 TABITHA
                        We’re okay now. But for how long?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It won’t always be like this. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Sometimes I think it would take a 
                        miracle to change things.

           Stephen sighs as he starts the engine.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m working on it.

           INT. BATHROOM, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - MORNING

           Stephen looks in the mirror; inspects himself with judging 
           eyes.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Fee Fi Fo Fum, I smell the blood of 
                        an Englishman...

           He runs a hand through his thick, grubby beard; picks up a 
           STRAIGHT RAZOR.
                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        So long, old friend.

           INT. HALLWAY, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Stephen walks down an empty high school hallway. He’s CLEAN 
           SHAVEN and wearing a SUIT. The mountain man beard is GONE. 
           He’s a man who means business.

           INT. OFFICE, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen sits in front of MR. ULLMAN, the principal of Hampden 
           Academy.

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        I’m sorry, Mister King. We just 
                        don’t have any teaching positions 
                        available at the moment. Probably 
                        won’t have for quite some time. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        You don’t have anything? Anything 
                        at all?

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        Teaching jobs are few and far 
                        between these days. When they do 
                        become available, they’re snatched 
                        up almost immediately.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Isn’t there some way I can get to 
                        the front of the line? 

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        I can keep your details on file; 
                        give you a call if something comes 
                        up.

                                 STEPHEN
                        And you’re sure you don’t have 
                        anything?

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        The only job we’ve got going at the 
                        moment is for a janitor.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ll take it.

           Mr. Ullman looks at Stephen quizzically. He flicks through 
           his resume. 
                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        Mister King, you have four years of 
                        college-- 

                                 STEPHEN
                        --and I’m working in a laundry. If 
                        I’m here as a janitor, then maybe 
                        when one of those teaching 
                        positions opens up, you’ll think of 
                        me first.

           Ullman looks at Stephen sympathetically. The guy sure seems 
           desperate.

           INT. BAR - AFTERNOON

           Stephen pulls up a stool at an empty bar. The bartender, 
           LARRY, saunters over.

                                 LARRY
                        Evenin’, Steve.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hi Larry. Little slow tonight?

                                 LARRY
                        Ayuh. What can I get ya?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hair of the Dog that bit me.

                                 LARRY
                        Bourbon on the rocks?

                                 STEPHEN
                        You got it.

           Larry brings him a bourbon.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Can I get a beer too? 

           Larry brings over a Bud. Stephen quickly slams back the 
           bourbon in one mouthful; waves the empty glass at Larry.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        One more of these, Larry.

           Larry raises an eyebrow; pours him another.

                                 LARRY
                        Knockin’ ‘em back a little fast, 
                        aren’t ya Steve?
                                 STEPHEN
                        I gotta lot of work to do tonight. 
                        Gotta get my buzz on.

           He slams the drink back as Larry disappears into the back 
           room. A voice pipes up from the other end of the bar.

                                 VOICE
                        What kind of work do you do?

           Stephen looks over. He sees the denim-clad man he saw outside 
           the laundromat days before. This is R.F. He’s drinking a 
           whiskey, a mischievous glint in his eyes. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Technically, as of today, I am a 
                        janitor.

                                 R.F.
                        Makes sense. If I was cleanin’ 
                        toilets I’d wanna get shitfaced 
                        too.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Actually that’s just my side-gig. 
                        I’m really a writer.

                                 R.F.
                        A writer, eh?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well, I’m tryin’ to be.

                                 R.F.
                        What kinda writin’ do you do?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Short stories, mostly. Sci-Fi, some 
                        horror...

                                 R.F.
                        That’s cool.

           R.F. extends his hand.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        The name’s R.F.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Steve King. 
                            (shakes hand)
                        Good to meetcha, man.

           R.F. downs his whiskey; slams the glass on the bar.
                                 R.F.
                        Fancy a game of pool, Steve?

           INT. POOL TABLE, BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Pool break. R.F. sends the balls scattering across the table 
           as Stephen watches. A nearby TELEVISION runs a news report 
           about an embassy bombing. Stephen watches with dismay.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Scary stuff happening in the world.

                                 R.F.
                        Sometimes you have to push back. 
                        Can’t let fuckers walk all over 
                        you.

           R.F. lines up his next shot; sinks a few balls. Stephen eyes 
           him with a hint of trepidation.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        So... a horror writer, eh?

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s right.

                                 R.F.
                        What’s that all about?

                                 STEPHEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 R.F.
                        I mean something pretty fucked up 
                        must have happened to you when you 
                        were a kid to make you write that 
                        shit.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Bambi.

           R.F. looks up from his shot.

                                 R.F.
                        Excuse me?

                                 STEPHEN
                        When I was a kid my Mom took me to 
                        see Bambi. It was the first time I 
                        ever got scared. I mean really
                        scared. It was when the woods 
                        caught on fire and Bambi and his 
                        Mom were trying to get out. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                        Bambi asks his Mom what was in the 
                        woods that caused the fire. Bambi’s
                        mom turns to him and says: “MAN was 
                        in the woods.” Goddamn if that line 
                        didn’t make me shit my pants in 
                        fear. It got me thinkin’... how bad 
                        can man be? Then Bambi’s Mom got 
                        shot, and I found out.

           R.F. gives Stephen an amused look.

                                 R.F.
                        If you say so.

           R.F. shoots and misses. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        So what do you do for a livin’?

                                 R.F.
                        Travellin’ salesman.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No kiddin’?

                                 R.F.
                        That’s right. The open road is my 
                        home.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Huh. My dad was a salesman. 

                                 R.F.
                        No shit? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        He ran out on us when I was just a 
                        kid. Seems he favored the open road 
                        too.

                                 R.F.
                        Well, you can’t really judge him 
                        for that. Man’s gotta do what he’s 
                        gotta do. It’s like a wolf that 
                        bites its own paw off to get out of 
                        a trap.

           Stephen grows wary of the conversation. He looks at his 
           watch.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well, I better be getting back. The 
                        wife’ll be getting suspicious.
           R.F. looks over towards the bar. Larry is nowhere to be seen. 
           He walks over and reaches behind the counter; grabs a bottle 
           of BOURBON from the well. 

           Stephen walks over and whispers...

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           R.F. extends the bottle to Stephen.

                                 R.F.
                        One for the road.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I can’t take that!

                                 R.F.
                        Sure you can.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Listen, you may be new in town, but 
                        I gotta tell ya... Larry’s a friend 
                        of mine. We go way back.

                                 R.F.
                        The amount of money you spend in 
                        this joint? Your buddy Larry owes
                        you. Come on. You took a shit job 
                        today. You deserve it.

           R.F. pushes the bottle into Stephen’s hands. Stephen’s about 
           to hand it back when Larry reemerges from the storeroom. 
           Stephen quickly stuffs the bottle into his jacket.

                                 LARRY
                            (oblivious)
                        Heading off?

                                 STEPHEN
                            (nervous)
                        Yeah Larry. I’ll see you around.

           He quickly exits, face pale, as R.F. smirks behind him.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - EVENING

           Tabitha is putting on her work uniform: a pink DUNKIN’ DONUTS 
           dress. Stephen strolls in; attempts to hide his drunkenness.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey! It’s my girls!
           He ruffles Naomi’s hair before pulling Tabitha in for a kiss. 
           She looks at him suspiciously.

                                 TABITHA
                        How many have you had?

                                 STEPHEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 TABITHA
                        You stink of Altoids.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I wanted my breath to be nice! I’ve 
                        been thinking about kissing you all 
                        day...

           They kiss. It’s long and passionate. When they part Tabitha 
           gives him a disappointed look but decides to let it go. 
           Naomi, as if sensing her mother’s imminent departure, begins 
           to cry. Stephen picks her up and comforts her.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Awww, come on baby. Everything’s 
                        okay. Mommy will be back soon.

           Tabitha picks up her handbag and makes for the door.

                                 TABITHA
                        Love you.

           She pecks Stephen on the cheek. 

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t stay up too late.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I won’t.

           Tabitha exits. Stephen walks into the kitchen and opens the 
           pantry door. He takes the BOTTLE OF BOURBON from his jacket 
           pocket and stuffs it inside, pushing it all the way to the 
           back.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                            (to Naomi)
                        Sssh. No telling.
           INT. HALLWAY, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Stephen pushes a MOP and BUCKET down a long, empty corridor. 
           He’s wearing overalls and sneakers, hunches over the mop like 
           the Hunchback of Notre Dame. On his overalls is a sewn-on 
           name-tag: JANITOR.

           INT. GIRLS LOCKER ROOM

           Stephen SCRUBS the rust-stains off the wall in the girls 
           locker room. He looks around, takes in the SHOWERS with PINK 
           PLASTIC CURTAINS.

           On the wall he spies something that perks his curiosity. He 
           stops scrubbing and walks over to take a closer look. It’s a 
           TAMPON MACHINE.

           INT. HALLWAY, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - LATER

           The SCHOOL BELL sounds, sending students pouring into the 
           hallway. Stephen pushes his mop past the oblivious students. 
           Suddenly a DISHEVELED-LOOKING TEEN rushes past him, almost 
           knocking him over.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey! Slow down!

           The girl whirls around; looks past Stephen with wide, 
           frightened eyes. Her hair is ratty and unbrushed; her dress 
           more like a POTATO SACK. This is SONDRA.

           Stephen turns in the direction of her gaze. Two MEAN GIRLS, 
           all pretty dresses and perfect make-up, are following close 
           behind.

                                 MEAN GIRL #1
                        My God - look at her dress!

                                 MEAN GIRL #2
                        Doesn’t she have any self-respect? 
                        I’d rather kill myself than look 
                        like that.

           Stephen watches as Sondra quickly disappears down the 
           corridor, looking like a frightened animal.

           Stephen stares after her, lost in memory as we--

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:
           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Stephen (12) hurries down the street as he’s chased by two 
           KIDS.

                                 KID #1
                        My Dad says your Dad went for 
                        cigarettes and never came back. He 
                        says you’re nothing but a bastard.

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s not true! My Dad’s in the 
                        Navy!

                                 KID #2
                        You lying bastard!

           The Kid pushes Stephen over. He falls to the ground, grazing 
           both his knees. The Kids laugh as they run off.

           INT. BATHROOM, THE KING HOUSE - FLASHBACK CONTINUES

           Young Stephen sits on the sink while his mother RUTH dabs his 
           cut knees with MERCUROCHROME. Stephen winces.

                                 RUTH
                        Don’t be a big baby. It ain’t 
                        nothin’ but a scratch.

           He tries to be brave.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Mom? Did Dad leave us? Am I a 
                        bastard?

           Ruth hesitates. She keeps dabbing at her son’s grazes.

                                 RUTH
                        Your father’s in the Navy. And 
                        don’t cuss.

                                 STEPHEN
                        When’s he coming home?

           Ruth ignores the question. Instead she examines her 
           handiwork.

                                 RUTH 
                        There. Much better. 
                            (beat)
                        Don’t you listen to those boys no 
                        more, ‘kay? They ain’t nothin’ but 
                        gossips and small minded fools.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Okay, Mom.

           CLOSE on Stephen’s teary eyes.

                                 MEAN GIRL #1 (PRE-LAP)
                        What are you lookin’ at, goober?

           INT. HALLWAY, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - FLASHBACK ENDS

           Stephen shakes himself from the memory. The Mean Girls look 
           at him with disgust.

                                 MEAN GIRL #2 
                        Why don’t you take a picture? It’ll 
                        last longer.

           Stephen quickly hurries away, head bowed, as the girls 
           snigger behind him.

                                 STEPHEN (PRE-LAP)
                        I tell ya, these girls were meaner 
                        than bulls with jack handles up 
                        their asses.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - EVENING

           Tabitha listens as she sits across from Stephen at the 
           kitchen table, CALCULATOR in hand. In front of them is a pile 
           of BILLS. Tabitha calculates as Stephen talks.

                                 STEPHEN
                        This kid looked so frightened. It 
                        reminded me of a girl I went to 
                        school with. She was so weird. She 
                        didn’t even know what a period was. 
                        Got it the first time in the locker 
                        room. All the other kids started 
                        makin’ fun of her. She thought she 
                        was dying.

                                 TABITHA
                        Jesus. That’s awful.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You said it. The next year she 
                        prettied herself up, dropped the 
                        weight and got a makeover. It 
                        didn’t help. In fact, the teasing 
                        got worse.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                        I heard she killed herself a few 
                        years back.

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh God. That poor girl.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (beat)
                        You know, sometimes I wish I’d done 
                        somethin’... said somethin’. But 
                        hey, if they were pickin’ on 
                        someone else, it meant they weren’t 
                        pickin’ on you.

                                 TABITHA
                        High school sure is brutal, even 
                        for good lookin’ folks like us.

           Stephen chuckles. He looks down at the mountain of bills.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Speaking of brutal, how we
                        doin’?

                                 TABITHA
                        We’ll scrape by this month. You’ll 
                        have to cut down on cigarettes.

           Stephen frowns. He turns to Naomi as she plays TOY BLOCKS on 
           the floor.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You got a job yet, Naomi? This 
                        ain’t no free ride.

                                 TABITHA
                        God forbid she wants to be a writer 
                        like her parents.

           Stephen looks down glumly at the pile of bills.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You said that right.

           Tabitha continues her calculations; speaks as she adds.

                                 TABITHA
                        Well, maybe there’s something in
                        this.

                                 STEPHEN
                        In what?
                                 TABITHA
                        Those girls you saw at school.
                        Maybe this is your chance to work 
                        through some unresolved issues.

           Stephen raises an eyebrow. The wheels start turning in his 
           head.

           That’s not such a bad idea.

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - MORNING

           Stephen walks outside in his robe. He opens the MAIL BOX and 
           pulls out a pile of envelopes. He cycles through them. Bills, 
           junk, then finally... an envelope from WEIRD TALES MAGAZINE.

           He tears open the envelope, expecting to find a CHECK. 
           Instead he finds a REJECTION LETTER:

           Dear Mr. King,

           Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your story was 
           not what we’re looking for right now...

           Stephen’s hands tremble. His eyes bulge.

           The letter BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Hey, Steve!

           The MAILMAN waves to Stephen as he rides by on his bicycle.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey, Terry.

           The mailman rides off. Stephen looks at the letter in his 
           hands. There’s no fire, no smoke. Just another weird 
           imagining. He shakes his head ruefully.

           His imagination will be the death of him.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen storms into the laundry, filled with a mixture of 
           anger and determination. He stares down the OLIVETTI
           TYPEWRITER, sizes it up as a gunslinger would his opponent.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Okay, asshole. Let’s do this.

           He slams his ass in the seat and gets writing. 
           MONTAGE/INTERCUT:

           -- LAUNDRY ROOM: Stephen writes; fingers flying over the 
           keys.

           -- HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM: Stephen walks through the rows of  
           lockers, makes his way over to the showers. He explores them. 
           The tiles are covered in BLOOD.

           -- HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR: The MEAN GIRLS move in slow motion, 
           flicking their hair back, laughing cruelly.

           -- HIGH SCHOOL SHOWER: SONDRA, the teen he saw being chased 
           down the corridor, sits in the corner naked, head buried in 
           her chest, as a chorus rings out around her. PLUG IT UP! PLUG 
           IT UP! PLUG IT UP! Then, all of a sudden...

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DOUBLE WIDE

           Stephen STOPS writing. He tears the paper from the Olivetti
           and reads it, frustration setting into his features. He 
           shakes his head.

           It’s wrong. All wrong.

           He looks at the small pile of pages beside the typewriter. 
           It’s no good. Any of it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Goddamnit it, Steve.

           He picks up the pile of papers and walks out of the laundry 
           into the--

           INT. KITCHENETTE

           -- where he throws it all in the trash.

           He turns to the pantry and opens it; pushes aside jars of 
           green beans and condensed milk. Finally he finds it - the 
           BOTTLE OF BOURBON stashed at the very back. He grabs it and 
           heads out.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Stephen hikes along the side of the road, swaying a little. 
           The bottle of bourbon is in his hands, half drunk.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You look like you’re walkin’ to 
                        beat the devil.
           Stephen looks up. R.F. is walking along the road towards him, 
           carrying a SPORTS BAG.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey there. Fancy runnin’ into you 
                        again. 

                                 R.F.
                        I was headed to the woods; do some 
                        shooting. What are you doin’ out 
                        here? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Nothin’. I was just clearing my 
                        head.

           R.F. notes the bottle of bourbon in Stephen’s hand.

                                 R.F.
                        Told ya that would come in handy.
                            (beat)
                        Why don’t you come with me? Have a 
                        few brewskies?

                                 STEPHEN
                            (reluctant)
                        I should really be gettin’ back.

                                 R.F.
                        Come on, man. Live a little.

           Stephen mulls it over. Finally he shrugs. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Screw it.

           R.F. claps him on the shoulder.

                                 R.F.
                        That’s more like it!

           EXT. THE WOODS - LATER

           BANG. The sound of a REVOLVER. Stephen covers his ears. A 
           BEER CAN sits on a ROCK as DUST swirls around it. 

           R.F. cocks his gun and fires again. This time the beer can 
           goes FLYING into the air!

                                 R.F.
                        Woo-hoo! I got you that time, 
                        sucker!
           R.F. tries to hand the gun to Stephen.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Go on, man. Take a shot.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Nah. I don’t like guns.

                                 R.F.
                        Don’t be such a pussy.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No thanks.

                                 R.F.
                        Suit yourself.

           R.F. aims and fires again. The bullet CAREENS off the rock. 

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit.
                            (to Stephen)
                        What’s up your ass, man? You’re 
                        messin’ with my mojo. You and the 
                        wife have a fight or somethin’?

           Stephen opens up.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m just having one of those days 
                        when I feel like the worst writer 
                        on the planet.

                                 R.F.
                        Whoa. Heavy shit.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Maybe I’m not cut out to be a 
                        writer. Maybe it’s all just a pipe 
                        dream. 

                                 R.F.
                        You could be right. I mean, what’s 
                        the chances of becoming a literary 
                        superstar when you’re nothin’ but 
                        poor white trash from Maine? 

                                 STEPHEN
                            (defensive)
                        It’s not all bad. There’s a guy at 
                        Doubleday who wants to see my next 
                        book.
                                 R.F.
                        Did he see your last book?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Um, yeah...

                                 R.F.
                        And? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        They didn’t think it was right for 
                        them.

                                 R.F.
                        How many times has that happened?

                                 STEPHEN
                            (glumly)
                        Three.

                                 R.F.
                        They rejected three fuckin’ books? 
                        Damn.
                            (beat)
                        Oh well. Maybe you’re right. Maybe 
                        the next one will catapult you to 
                        literary stardom.

           Stephen remembers Tabitha’s words.

                                 STEPHEN
                        These things just take time. 

                                 R.F.
                        None of us are gettin’ any younger. 
                        Life is for living! You should be 
                        enjoying yourself, not sittin’ here 
                        moping.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I can’t be a janitor the rest of my 
                        life. 

                                 R.F.
                        Ain’t nothin’ wrong with workin’ 
                        for an honest wage. It’s better 
                        than dreamin’ about shit that ain’t 
                        ever gonna happen.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’ll happen. It has to. Things 
                        wouldn’t be so bad if I wasn’t flat 
                        broke.
           R.F. sits down beside Stephen and cracks open a beer.

                                 R.F.
                        That’s the problem with havin’ a 
                        family to support. All they do is 
                        drag you down. Me? I got something 
                        more important than family.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh yeah? What’s that?

                                 R.F.
                        Freedom.

           Suddenly a RABBIT comes out of the clearing. R.F. cocks his 
           gun. Stephen looks up in alarm; tries to stop the inevitable.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Wait! DON’T!

           R.F. shoots. The rabbit’s stomach EXPLODES. R.F. views his 
           kill with satisfaction.

                                 R.F.
                        Bull’s-eye.

           R.F. notes Stephen’s expression of horror.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Don’t be sad, Steve. It probably 
                        had rabies.

           Stephen stares at the rabbit in horror, its entrails 
           glistening in the sun.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - LATER

           Tabitha comes home with Naomi, a grocery bag in her arms. 
           MUSIC drifts from the bathroom: a radio playing “Rocket Man” 
           by Elton John. The sound of Stephen singing emanates after 
           it. Tabitha puts the groceries on the bench and Naomi in her 
           crib.

                                 TABITHA
                        Steve!

           No response as Stephen continues to sing. Tabitha shakes her 
           head in amusement.

           She starts unpacking the groceries. Her attention is diverted 
           to the TRASH CAN where she notices the discarded pages of 
           Stephen’s story.
           She pulls them out, dusts off coffee grinds and cigarette 
           ash. Stephen continues to sing in the bath tub, oblivious to 
           her discovery. Tabitha sits down at the table and reads.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Tabitha takes the typed pages into the bathroom. Stephen is 
           sitting in the bathtub, smoking a cigarette and drinking a 
           beer. Tabitha waves the pages at him.

                                 TABITHA
                        What’s this?

                                 STEPHEN
                        What?

                                 TABITHA
                        I pulled these out of the trash.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (beat)
                        That’s nothin’. I’m not gonna 
                        finish it.

                                 TABITHA
                        Why not?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Because it’s no good.

                                 TABITHA
                        Well I think it’s good.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (surprised)
                        You read it?

           Tabitha sits down on the toilet seat and flicks through the 
           pages.

                                 TABITHA
                        A lot of people will be able to 
                        relate to this, Steve. I think 
                        you’ve really got something here.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Forget it. I can’t write women.

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes you can. This is proof that you 
                        can.
                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s too long for a short story.

                                 TABITHA
                        Then make it your next novel.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m not wasting time writing 
                        another novel.

           Tabitha gives him an admonishing look. Stephen becomes 
           petulant.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        No one’s gonna want it.

                                 TABITHA
                        Steve, it’s good.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (hopeful beat)
                        Really?

                                 TABITHA
                        I want to know what happens to this 
                        girl. Write it for me. Please.

           Stephen leans out of the tub, runs his hand up Tabitha’s leg.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (playful)
                        And what are you gonna do for me?

                                 TABITHA
                            (nervous beat)
                        I’m gonna give you another mouth to 
                        feed.

           Stephen gives Tabitha a perplexed look.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What are you sayin’?

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m sayin’... that I’m pregnant. 

           Stephen’s eyes grow wide.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Pregnant?

                                 TABITHA
                        Uh huh.
                                 STEPHEN
                            (beat)
                        Again??

                                 TABITHA
                        Yes, again!
                            (beat)
                        I found out last week. I missed my 
                        period. I didn’t know how to tell 
                        you.

           Stephen looks down, pensive. Tabitha searches his face for a 
           response; becomes increasingly nervous.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Well??

           Stephen slowly looks up. There’s a GRIN on his face. Tabitha 
           breathes a huge sigh of relief.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        You son of a bitch!

           Stephen laughs. He grabs her arm and pulls her into the tub 
           for a bear hug.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        No!! Don’t get me wet!!

           Stephen ignores her cries as he pulls her in. She laughs as 
           he wraps his wet arms around her. She doesn’t see that his 
           eyes are wide with trepidation.

           INT. RUTH KING’S HOUSE - DAY

           A modest shingled house. Stephen opens the locked door with a 
           key and heads in. The sound of a TV set blares from the 
           living room.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ma?

                                 RUTH
                        In here.

           INT. LIVING ROOM 

           Stephen enters the living room. His mother RUTH sits in a 
           sofa chair wrapped in a blanket, cigarette in hand.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey, Ma.
                                 RUTH
                        Hello, son.

           Stephen leans over; kisses her cheek. He notes the cigarette.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I thought you were trying to cut 
                        down.

                                 RUTH
                        This is cutting down.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (sheepish)
                        Can I have one?

           Ruth tosses over the pack.

                                 RUTH
                        Help yourself.

           Stephen sits next to her on the sofa; lights a cigarette.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What’re you watching?

                                 RUTH
                        Some old pile of rubbish.

           They watch the TV for a moment in silence.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ve got some news for you.
                            (nervous beat)
                        We’re, uh, having another baby.

           Ruth tenses.

                                 RUTH
                        Well. You and Tabby sure don’t 
                        waste any time, do you?

                                 STEPHEN
                        This wasn’t anything we planned, 
                        believe me. I’m very aware this is 
                        not the right time to be having 
                        another kid. 

                                 RUTH
                        There’s never a right time for 
                        children. You just make it work 
                        with what you have.
                                 STEPHEN
                            (unconvinced)
                        You mean like Dad did?

                                 RUTH
                        Don’t talk nonsense, Stephen. 
                        You’re nothing like him. 

           Stephen remembers a memory and smirks.

                                 STEPHEN
                        The Navy, huh?

           Ruth snorts.

                                 RUTH
                        What was I meant to tell you? Not 
                        the truth, that’s for sure. It 
                        would have broken your heart.

           She pats him on the knee.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Everything will be fine, Stephen. 
                        Children are a blessing.

           Stephen manages a thin smile.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I know, ma. I know.

           INT. CLASS ROOM, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Stephen tentatively approaches the door of an empty 
           classroom. A teacher stands at the chalkboard writing out the 
           next day’s lesson. Stephen knocks quietly. The teacher, KURT 
           BARLOW, looks over.

                                 KURT
                        Good. You’re here. Let me show you 
                        where it is.

           Stephen wheels his MOP and BUCKET inside; follows Kurt to the 
           back of the classroom. There’s a big puddle of VOMIT on the 
           floor amongst the tables.

                                 KURT (CONT’D)
                        It was that damn Vern Tessio. I 
                        watched the kid eat a whole apple 
                        pie at lunch.

           Stephen takes the mop out of the bucket and begins to clean 
           up the vomit.
                                 KURT (CONT’D)
                        You’re Steve, right?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ayuh.

                                 KURT
                            (extends hand)
                        Kurt Barlow.

           They shake.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Good to meet you, Kurt.

                                 KURT
                        I heard on the grapevine that 
                        you’re a writer. I dabble in a 
                        little writing myself.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 KURT
                        Nothing serious. I’ve written a few 
                        articles; some short stories. It’s 
                        just so damn hard to get published 
                        these days. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re telling me.

                                 KURT
                        You had any luck?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Here and there.

                                 KURT
                            (surprised)
                        Really?

                                 STEPHEN
                            (shrugging)
                        Just a few magazines.

                                 KURT
                        That’s great. Where?

                                 STEPHEN
                            (embarrassed)
                        You heard of Cavalier magazine?

           Kurt is slightly taken aback.
                                 KURT
                        You mean the nudie mag?
                            (beat)
                        Well, hey... that’s cool. I mean, 
                        it’s still publication, right?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Right.

           There’s a small uncomfortable lull in the conversation.

                                 KURT
                        Well... keep up the good work.

           Kurt leaves Stephen to clean up the vomit.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah. Thanks.

           INT. HALLWAY, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - LATER

           Stephen struggles as he drags a trash can across the floor. 
           He’s wearing THICK RUBBER GLOVES; screws his nose up at the 
           awful smell.

           WHAM! A group of JOCKS shamble past, KNOCKING the TRASH CAN 
           from his hands. The contents spill out all over the ground.

                                 JOCK
                        Watch where you’re goin’, mop- 
                        jockey!

           Stephen gets down on his hands and knees and starts picking 
           up the trash. Mr. Ullman appears beside him.

                                 MR. ULLMAN 
                        Steve? Got a minute?

                                 STEPHEN
                        One sec, Mr. Ullman. I gotta get 
                        this cleaned up.

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        It’s fine. You can leave it for the 
                        moment.

           Stephen is immediately nervous. Is he about to get fired?

           INT. OFFICE, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen sits across from Mr. Ullman. He’s still wearing the 
           rubber gloves; looks broken and disheveled from his duties.
                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        So Steve... how are you enjoying it 
                        here?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Uh, I like it here just fine, Mr. 
                        Ullman.

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        Good. Because one of our English 
                        teachers just up and quit on us. 
                        You asked me if I’d think of you 
                        first, so here we are.

           Stephen almost looks disappointed.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Teaching? 

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        Uh huh.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Full time?

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        That’s what it says on the packet.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Uh, would there be much extra 
                        curricular work?

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        You’re beginning to make me think 
                        you don’t want this, Steve.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No, I do, it’s just that.. well, 
                        I’m trying to focus on my writing 
                        at the moment. I just started this 
                        new book...

                                 MR. ULLMAN
                        Steve, I know this is none of my 
                        business, but as a man who was once 
                        young and full of big ideas, take 
                        it from me... do it for your 
                        family.
           EXT. SARAH SPRUCE’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Stephen knocks on the door of a small house with a neatly 
           manicured lawn. The door opens. Stephen gives a big, overly 
           enthusiastic smile.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey Sarah.

           SARAH SPRUCE, Stephen’s MOTHER IN LAW, stands with Naomi in 
           her arms, looking unimpressed. Stephen quickly moves his 
           attention to Naomi.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        There’s my little girl!

           Naomi reaches for her father. He takes her.

                                 SARAH
                            (terse)
                        I hear congratulations are in 
                        order.

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s right! Another little one on 
                        the way.

           Sarah’s disapproval is obvious.

                                 SARAH
                        You still workin’ up at that 
                        school?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yup, and I’ve had a few stories 
                        published too. Everything’s going 
                        good.

                                 SARAH
                        I hope so. Two children is a big 
                        responsibility.

           Stephen’s cheery facade falters.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well, thanks for babysitting.

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t mention it.

           Stephen carries Naomi to the car, Sarah’s judgmental eyes 
           following him the entire way.
           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - THAT EVENING

           Tabitha leans behind the counter, writing in a notebook. 
           She’s deep in thought; doesn’t hear the chime as the front 
           door opens.

                                 STEPHEN
                        We heard you got some good eatin’ 
                        here.

           Tabitha looks up; sees her husband and daughter. She beams.

                                 TABITHA
                        Well! What a nice surprise!

           Stephen hands Naomi over the counter into her mother’s arms. 
           He spies the notebook.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You working on a new poem?

                                 TABITHA
                        Ayuh. When I can.
                            (to Naomi)
                        Hey, babe. You want some donuts?

           Naomi nods her head. Of course.

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen and Tabitha sit in a booth eating donuts. Tabitha 
           wearily lifts her arms and stretches. Stephen looks at his 
           wife sadly; notes her growing belly.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You okay?

                                 TABITHA
                        Hm? Yeah, I’m okay. Just tired.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (beat)
                        So... a teaching job came up at the 
                        school.

                                 TABITHA
                            (excited)
                        Really? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Uh huh.
                                 TABITHA
                        Well?? Did they offer it to you?

                                 STEPHEN
                        They did.

                                 TABITHA
                        Are you kidding? That’s fantastic! 

           Stephen tries to act excited.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It doesn’t pay much more, but every 
                        extra bit helps, especially now, 
                        and I can still write at night, I 
                        guess.

           Tabitha recognizes his reluctance. She takes his hand.

                                 TABITHA
                        Sweetheart - thank you. 
                        Everything’s going to work out the 
                        way we want it to. I just know it. 

           Stephen gives an upbeat smile.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yep. Me too.

           He takes a tense bite of his donut.

                                 STEPHEN (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        “I am all in a sea of wonders. I 
                        doubt; I fear; I think strange 
                        things, which I dare not confess to 
                        my own soul.” 

           INT. CLASSROOM, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Stephen stands in front of a bored looking class, reading 
           from a copy of ‘DRACULA’. He’s wearing a tweed jacket and 
           khaki pants; looks uncomfortably “teacherly”. He looks out at 
           the fidgeting class.

                                 STEPHEN
                        “God keep me, if only for the sake 
                        of those dear to me!”
                            (beat)
                        So... what’d you think?

           No response from the class. 
                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Anyone?

                                 STUDENT #1
                        It was boring.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What do you mean ‘boring’!?

                                 STUDENT #3
                        It wasn’t scary.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Are you telling me you wouldn’t be 
                        scared if you came face to face 
                        with Count Dracula? 

                                 STUDENT #3
                        No way!!

                                 STUDENT #2
                        If I saw a vampire, I’d punch him 
                        right in the face.

           Laughter from the rest of the class. Stephen sighs heavily. 
           God help him.

           INT. TEACHERS LOUNGE - LATER

           Teachers sit on cheap sofas, smoking and drinking coffee. 
           Stephen walks over to the coffee machine and pours himself a 
           cup. KURT BARLOW calls over to him from the sofa.

                                 KURT
                        Hey Steve! Didn’t recognize you 
                        without your overalls. 

           Stephen laughs good-naturedly.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Never thought I’d say it feels good 
                        to wear tweed.

           Kurt turns to the other teachers.

                                 KURT
                        Steve’s also a writer.
                            (to Stephen)
                        I was just telling them I’m about 
                        to be published. Can you believe 
                        it? Now Hampden Academy will have 
                        two published writers on staff.
                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s great, Kurt! Congrats, man.

                                 KURT
                        Thanks. It’s not a big deal.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What’s the publication?

                                 KURT
                        Harper’s.

           Stephen falters a little.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Wow! Harper’s? 
                            (beat)
                        That is a big deal.

           Kurt waves away his compliment.

                                 KURT
                        Not really. No one reads that 
                        literary stuff. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well I’ll be sure to buy a copy. 
                        Congrats again.

                                 KURT
                        Thanks. Comin’ from another writer, 
                        that sure means something.

           Stephen walks out of the lounge and quickly realizes he’s 
           left his coffee behind. He’s about to go back in when he 
           catches the tail end of a conversation. 

                                 FEMALE TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Where exactly was he published?

           Stephen stands just outside the door, listening from around 
           the corner.

                                 KURT (O.S.)
                        You heard of ‘Cavalier’?

                                 MALE TEACHER (O.S.)
                        The porn magazine??

                                 FEMALE TEACHER (O.S.)
                        How do you know about that?

           Laughs all round.
                                 MALE TEACHER (O.S.)
                        I may have perused it once or 
                        twice. They publish a lot of trashy 
                        sci-fi and horror stories.

                                 KURT (O.S.)
                        It still counts as being published.

                                 FEMALE TEACHER (O.S.)
                        It’s no Harper’s.

                                 MALE TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Well, he was the janitor. Trash is 
                        obviously his trade.

           A smattering of laughter. Stephen scampers away down the 
           corridor, humiliated.

           INT. SARAH SPRUCE’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Tabitha enters her mother’s house. She’s dressed in her 
           Dunkin’ Donuts uniform; looks drained and tired. She calls 
           out.

                                 TABITHA
                        Mom?

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        In here!

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Tabitha enters the living room; finds her mother on the sofa 
           in front of the TV while Naomi plays on the floor. Tabitha 
           immediately goes to her daughter.

                                 TABITHA
                        Hi sweetie! You have a good day 
                        with Grandma?

                                 SARAH
                        She’s been a doll the entire day.

                                 TABITHA
                        Thanks for looking after her, Mom.

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t mention it.

           Tabitha takes a seat on the sofa next to her mother. She rubs 
           her growing stomach protectively. Her exhaustion is clearly 
           showing.
                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        How was work?

           Tabitha attempts to feign enthusiasm.

                                 TABITHA
                        Okay. It’s pretty slow in there 
                        which is good. I can get some 
                        writing done.

                                 SARAH
                        A woman in your condition shouldn’t 
                        have to work.

                                 TABITHA
                        Mom, it’s fine. Really.

           Sarah removes something from her apron pocket: a wad of cash. 
           She hands it to Tabitha.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                            (off the cash)
                        I don’t need this.

                                 SARAH
                        Just take it.

           Tabitha reluctantly takes the money.

                                 TABITHA
                        Thank you.

                                 SARAH
                            (beat)
                        So how’s that husband of yours?

                                 TABITHA
                        He’s good. He’s working on a new 
                        book. 

           Sarah makes no attempt to hide her disapproval.

                                 SARAH
                        Tabitha, it’s not all about him, 
                        you know. I’d hate for your talent 
                        to go to waste.

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s not like that, Ma. Steve 
                        supports my writing just as much as 
                        I support his. It’s just that 
                        poetry doesn’t pay anything. His 
                        short stories are keeping us 
                        afloat.
                                 SARAH
                        If you say so.

                                 TABITHA
                        Steve and I are in this together. 
                        It’s gonna happen for us. You’ll 
                        see.

           Sarah decides to let the matter drop. She shakes her head 
           ruefully at her daughter.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - EVENING

           Tabitha returns home with Naomi and steps into a trailer 
           filled with darkness. 

           She looks at the BED, expecting to see Stephen curled up 
           under the covers. It’s EMPTY.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

           Tabitha pads in quietly to find Stephen hunched over his 
           typewriter, fast asleep. She lightly shakes his shoulder.

                                 TABITHA
                        Steve? Honey, it’s time for bed. 

           Her foot hits something that clinks noisily. A beer bottle 
           goes rolling across the floor. Stephen isn’t asleep. He’s 
           passed out.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

           Stephen comes to. The room is bathed in sunlight. He shields 
           his eyes; accidentally hits an empty beer bottle on the desk, 
           sending it crashing to the ground. He groans miserably.

           INT. KITCHENETTE 

           Tabitha makes breakfast; her displeasure obvious. Stephen 
           gingerly makes his way towards her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Mornin’.

                                 TABITHA
                        Good morning.
                            (tense beat)
                        Looks like you had quite a party 
                        last night. 
                                 STEPHEN
                        I was having trouble writing.

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m surprised you remember.

           Stephen becomes surly.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Give me a break, Tab. I didn’t 
                        drink that much.

                                 TABITHA
                        You were passed-out. With the rate 
                        you’re drinkin’ you’ll be dead by 
                        the time you’re twenty-five.

           Stephen suddenly explodes in frustration.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What do you care what happens to 
                        me?

                                 TABITHA
                        Excuse me??

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m just a no-good bum who can 
                        barely take care of his family, 
                        right??

                                 TABITHA
                        You sure are good at feelin’ sorry 
                        for yourself this morning.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tab, listen--

           He tries to take her arm but she shrugs him off.

                                 TABITHA
                        You listen. I don’t care if
                        you never publish another story
                        ever again. I don’t care if we have 
                        to live in this trailer for the
                        rest of our goddamn lives, as long 
                        as you’re a good husband and a good 
                        father, and you’re good to 
                        yourself.

           She takes hold of Stephen’s face, forcing him to focus on 
           her. She’s never been more serious.
                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        I will support your writing and
                        your dreams, but I won’t support
                        you being a drunk.

           Stephen grows petulant.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Then maybe you’d be better off 
                        without me!

           He shakes free of her and makes for the door.

                                 TABITHA
                        Stephen! WAIT!

           He grabs his jacket and heads out the door, slamming it 
           behind him.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Well shit.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           The diviest of all dive bars; a place for serious drinkers 
           only. Stephen slams back shots of JACK DANIELS amidst the 
           other rowdy revelers.

                                 R.F.
                        WOO-weeeee! That’s what I’m talkin’
                        about!

           Stephen turns around. R.F.’s standing behind him, a massive 
           grin on his face.

                                 STEPHEN
                        R.F! My man! What’re you doin’
                        here?

                                 R.F.
                        Gettin’ a buzz on, that’s what I’m 
                        doin’. Didn’t know a place like 
                        this would be your scene.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It is tonight.

           R.F. motions to the bartender.

                                 R.F.
                        Rack ‘em up, barkeep! We’re just 
                        gettin’ started!
           INT. DIVE BAR - LATER

           The bar is hoppin’. Lynard Skynard’s “Free Bird” blares from 
           the jukebox. R.F. and Stephen are well and truly soused as 
           Stephen tells R.F. about Kurt Barlow.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Can you believe it? That son of a 
                        bitch, talkin’ about me behind my 
                        back.
                            (beat)
                        Still, the guy’s being published in 
                        Harper’s. No wonder he thinks I’m a 
                        goddamn loser.

                                 R.F.
                        Man, who gives a fuck what that 
                        preppie motherfucker thinks? He can 
                        keep his tweed jacket and his posh 
                        literary bullshit.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You know what? You’re right! Hey 
                        barkeep! 

           Stephen signals the bartender.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Another round!

           A skanky-looking BARFLY gives R.F. the side-eye. R.F. sidles
           up to her.

                                 R.F.
                        Hey, mama. How’s about letting 
                        loose those cow udders? Daddy needs 
                        his milk.

                                 BARFLY
                        Fuck off, asshole.

           She throws a drink in his face. R.F. grabs the woman roughly.

                                 R.F.
                        You don’t wanna be doin’ that to 
                        me, darlin’. I am a very dark man.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (intervening)
                        R.F. Hey. It’s all good, buddy... 

           Stephen tries to pull him away. R.F’s gaze is still fixed on 
           the woman, who stares at him with wide, frightened eyes. He 
           breaks into a grin.
                                 R.F.
                        Hell, baby... I was just kiddin’
                        around! Bartender, another drink 
                        for the lovely lady here.

           R.F. throws a twenty dollar bill on the bar. 

                                 BARTENDER
                            (unimpressed)
                        All right, buddy. You’ve caused 
                        enough trouble. Go on... get outta 
                        here. 

                                 R.F.
                        Gladly. This place is a fucking 
                        dump.

           R.F. downs his shot and winks at the lady.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the free drink, doll.

           EXT. DIVE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen and R.F. roll drunkenly out of the bar and head 
           towards the Buick. Stephen stops suddenly. In front of him is 
           an enormous SAINT BERNARD. It stares at Stephen with mean, 
           glowing eyes.

           The dog begins to growl as Stephen backs away.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Nice doggy...

           The dog LUNGES. FOAM drips from its MOUTH. Stephen shields 
           himself from the impact of the dog’s bite when R.F. steps in 
           between them.

                                 R.F.
                        Get outta here you crazy mutt! Go 
                        on! Get!!

           The dog whimpers and runs away.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                            (casually)
                        Guess I have a way with animals.
                            (beat)
                        Come on. Let’s get the fuck outta 
                        here.
           EXT. DOWNTOWN BANGOR - MOMENTS LATER

           A 31-foot tall statue of PAUL BUNYAN stands proudly by the 
           side of the road, massive AXE slung over his shoulder. 
           Stephen’s Buick comes speeding past. 

           INT. BUICK

           R.F. drives as Stephen sits bleary-eyed in the passenger 
           seat. Ominous black clouds fill the skies. Buddy Holly’s “Not 
           Fade Away” plays on the radio.

           R.F. devours a cheeseburger as he drives. He looks out the 
           window and gestures at the statue.

                                 R.F.
                        Hey, Steve! What did Paul Bunyan
                        say when he crapped his pants?
                            (beat)
                        It was an “axe-I-dent”!

           Hysterical laughter from R.F. He flings the burger from the 
           window. It slaps Paul Bunyan RIGHT IN THE FACE.

           EXT. BUICK - MOMENTS LATER

           The Buick comes to a stop at a red light. A 1958 RED PLYMOUTH 
           FURY pulls up beside them. Behind the wheel is a tough-
           looking GEARHEAD, his equally tough-looking BUDDY seated 
           beside him.

           The gearhead smirks at them. R.F. revs the engine.

           INT. BUICK

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re not seriously thinking of 
                        racing that guy??

                                 R.F.
                        You’re damn right I am.

                                 STEPHEN
                        This car can barely do fifty miles 
                        an hour! You race that guy, it’s 
                        gonna fall apart!

           R.F. locks eyes with the driver. The gearhead’s buddy leans 
           over.
                                 BUDDY
                            (to R.F.)
                        Eat shit, creep!

                                 R.F.
                        I eat shit for breakfast, and I 
                        wash it down with a cold glass of 
                        fuck you.

           The light turns GREEN. They PEEL OUT.

           EXT. STREET 

           The two cars RACE SIDE BY SIDE down a SUBURBAN STREET.

           INT. BUICK 

                                 STEPHEN
                        OH MY GOOOOOD!

                                 R.F.
                        Yee-haw!!!!!

           EXT. STREET 

           The Buick SCREECHES around a corner. They’ve got the drop on 
           the gearhead, but he’s gaining.

           INT. PLYMOUTH

                                 BUDDY
                        He’s gaining on us, man!

           The gearhead casts a concerned look in his REARVIEW MIRROR.

           EXT. STREET 

           The Plymouth SWERVES next to the Buick. They’re NECK AND 
           NECK.

           R.F chooses decisive action and SLAMS the Buick into the side 
           of the Plymouth! The Plymouth wobbles as the driver tries to 
           take back control.

           INT. PLYMOUTH

                                 GEARHEAD
                        WHAT THE FUCK??
           INT. BUICK 

                                 STEPHEN
                        WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?? I 
                        NEED THIS CAR!

                                 R.F.
                        What you need Steve is a PAIR OF 
                        BALLS!!

           EXT. STREET

           The Buick RAMS the PLYMOUTH, sending it CAREENING OFF THE 
           ROAD!

           INT. PLYMOUTH

           SCREAMS from the gearhead and his buddy. The gearhead tries 
           to right the wheel. The Plymouth lands in a DITCH.

           INT. BUICK

           Maniacal laughter from R.F as they drive off. Stephen looks 
           back at the Plymouth; watches as the driver gets out to 
           inspect the damage. 

           The gearhead kicks his tires in a rage. His buddy gives them 
           the finger.

           Stephen shrinks back in his seat, traumatized.

                                 R.F.
                        Man! Wasn’t that something! We sure 
                        showed those shitters what we can 
                        do!

           He takes out his flask and drinks; notes Stephen’s pale, 
           frightened face.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Steve! Where’s your sense 
                        of adventure?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Stop the car. I’m going to be sick.

                                 R.F.
                        Stop your bitchin’. You’ll be fine.

           Stephen rolls down the window and SPEWS out the side. He 
           pulls his head back in. R.F. offers him the flask.
                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Have some of this. As my old man 
                        used to say, the only cure for a 
                        hangover is to keep drinkin’.

           Stephen shakes his head.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ve had enough.

           R.F.’s tone abruptly changes. 

                                 R.F.
                        Are we going to have a problem 
                        here, Stephen?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Are you serious?

                                 R.F.
                        I’m as serious as a heart attack, 
                        my friend.

           He shoves the flask closer to Stephen.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Drink, or I’ll run this shit box 
                        right off the road.

           Stephen reluctantly takes the flask; manages a small sip.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        MORE!

           He takes a larger mouthful and grimaces.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        When are you gonna learn, Steve?

                                 STEPHEN
                        What are you talkin’ about?

                                 R.F.
                        I’m talkin’ about your shitty life, 
                        man! You could do anything you 
                        wanted to if you weren’t tied down. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I have responsibilities. I-I have--

                                 R.F.
                            (mimicking Stephen)
                        “I have responsibilities! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 R.F. (CONT'D)
                        I have a wife and a baby and 
                        another one on the waaaaaaay! 
                        Waaaaaaahhhhh!!!” 

                                 STEPHEN
                        You just don’t get it ‘cause you 
                        don’t have a family!

                                 R.F.
                        Oh, and like you’re the father of 
                        the year? Face it... you’re just 
                        like your old man. Trapped and 
                        lookin’ for a way out.

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s not true!

                                 R.F.
                        Hey Steve... watch this.

           R.F. takes his hands off the steering. As the car veers from 
           the road Stephen frantically makes a grab for the wheel.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Jesus Christ!! ARE YOU TRYIN’ TO 
                        KILL US??

           R.F. takes the wheel again. He calmly surveys the road ahead 
           and starts singing...

                                 R.F.
                        Baby, can you dig your maaaan? He’s 
                        a righteous man... baby, can you 
                        dig your maaaaan??

           He SLAMS DOWN on the ACCELERATOR. The Buick SCREAMS down the 
           HIGHWAY at an INSANE SPEED.

           Something twigs in Stephen. He looks at R.F. Something isn’t 
           right.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Who are you? 

           R.F. cackles.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM 
                        ME???

                                 R.F.
                        I’m your guardian angel, Steve, and 
                        I’m gonna take you away from all 
                        this. 
           R.F. SLAMS DOWN on the accelerator. Stephen SCREAMS.

                                 STEPHEN
                        OH MY GOD!! STOP!!!!

           R.F. laughs crazily. Stephen looks at him in horror. His eyes 
           are as RED as FIRE.

                                 R.F.
                        BUCKLE UP, STEVIE!!!!

           Stephen HOLDS ON FOR DEAR LIFE as the car CAREENS off the 
           road and SMASHES into a TRAFFIC LIGHT as we--

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. BUICK - MOMENTS LATER

           Darkness. Stephen lies slumped over the steering wheel. He 
           comes to with a gasp.

                                 STEPHEN
                        HUH!?!?

           He flinches in pain; touches his forehead. His hand comes 
           away bloody. He looks around. The car is empty. He’s 
           confused. Where the hell is R.F.?

           EXT. BUICK

           Stephen gets out and looks around. A MOTORIST stops his car 
           and gets out.

                                 MOTORIST
                        Hey! You okay?

           Stephen quickly makes up a story.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah, I... I just thought I saw a 
                        cat.

                                 MOTORIST
                        A cat??

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ayuh. On the road.

                                 MOTORIST
                        You want an ambulance?
                                 STEPHEN
                        No. I’m okay.

           The motorist gives Stephen a skeptical look. He’s about to 
           leave when Stephen asks him a question.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, uh... did you happen to see 
                        anyone else around here?

                                 MOTORIST
                        What do you mean?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I mean, was there someone else, 
                        another guy, who was, I don’t 
                        know... running away or something?

                                 MOTORIST
                        You think someone ran in front of 
                        your car?

                                 STEPHEN
                        No, I think someone was in my car.

                                 MOTORIST
                            (concerned)
                        You sure you don’t need a doctor?

                                 STEPHEN
                        No, no.
                            (beat)
                        I’m okay. 

           The motorist gives Stephen a look like he’s crazy. Stephen’s 
           starting to suspect that maybe he is.

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - LATER

           The sound of an approaching engine. The Buick comes into 
           view, headlights sweeping across the front of the trailer. 
           Tabitha watches anxiously from the window as Stephen stumbles 
           from the car.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE

           Stephen quietly enters. Tabitha stands with her back to him; 
           pretends to be fixated on washing dishes.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Tab?
                            (beat)
                        Tab, I’m sorry...

           She whips around.

                                 TABITHA
                        Where the hell have you been?! I’ve 
                        been worried sick, AND I had to 
                        cancel my shift!

                                 STEPHEN
                        I kinda lost track of time...

           Tabitha notices the cut on Stephen’s forehead. Her tone 
           shifts from outrage to concern.

                                 TABITHA
                        What in God’s name happened to you?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I had a little fender bender. The 
                        car’s fine. It’s just a scrape. 

                                 TABITHA
                        And what about you? Are you fine?

           Stephen looks helplessly at his wife. Tabitha searches her 
           husband’s blood-shot eyes.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit, Steve. You look like 
                        you’ve seen the devil.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tabitha dabs at Stephen’s forehead with antiseptic. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Owww!

                                 TABITHA
                        Don’t be such a baby.

           She continues cleaning the wound. Stephen proceeds 
           cautiously.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tab... have you ever, uh, seen 
                        something that wasn’t there?
                                 TABITHA
                        What’re you talkin’ about?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m talking about something, you 
                        know, like a hallucination.

           Tabitha looks at her husband with a mix of concern and 
           amusement.

                                 TABITHA
                        You been seein’ stuff, Steve?

           He looks down, ashamed. Tabitha lifts his chin with her hand.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        You can tell me. You can tell my 
                        anything.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s nothin’. Probably just the 
                        booze.

                                 TABITHA
                        That’s what I thought.

           Tabitha goes back to cleaning the wound.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        I’m worried about you.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ll be fine. I’m just under a lot 
                        of pressure.

                                 TABITHA
                        So am I, Steve. Sometimes I think 
                        you forget there are two writers in 
                        this house, not just one. I’ve got 
                        dreams too, you know.

           Stephen frowns. She’s right.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m sorry.

           Tabitha takes his face in her hands.

                                 TABITHA
                        I have so much faith in you.
                            (beat)
                        Don’t let me down.

           Stephen wraps his arms around her.
                                 STEPHEN
                        You know something? You’re the 
                        toughest broad I know.

           Tabitha finally smiles.

                                 TABITHA
                        My Daddy didn’t name me after a 
                        warship for nothin’.

           EXT. HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Stephen steps out of the front entrance as students stream 
           around him. 

           He stops to light a cigarette. Looking up he sees Sondra 
           waiting by the curb. Stephen watches from a distance; thinks 
           about going over and talking to her. He’s just about to make 
           his move when a STATION WAGON pulls up.

           The door swings open. Inside is a severe-looking woman 
           wearing a CONSERVATIVE BLACK DRESS with UNRULY HAIR. From the 
           dashboard hangs a CRUCIFIX. On the bumper bar is a sticker: 
           HAVE YOU FOUND JESUS?

           The woman calls out impatiently.

                                 SONDRA’S MOTHER
                        Come along, Sondra. I haven’t got 
                        all day.

           Sondra quickly ducks into the car. Her mother gives Stephen a 
           withering glare as they drive off. Stephen watches them go; 
           another idea forming in his head.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - NIGHT

           Stephen sits at the typewriter, thinking. Next to the 
           typewriter is a bottle of bourbon. He looks at it, looks at 
           the page, then--

                                 R.F.
                        Too early for a night cap?

           Stephen lets out a SCREAM of surprise. His chair goes FLYING 
           back and he hits the floor, HARD. R.F. leans over him and 
           laughs.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit! Look at you! You look 
                        like you’re about to crap your 
                        pants!!
           Stephen struggles to catch his breath. 

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Aww, don’t be sore. Just thought 
                        I’d give ya a little scare. I 
                        thought you liked bein’ scared.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Get the fuck outta here.

                                 R.F.
                        That ain’t no way to talk to a 
                        friend.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re not my friend. I don’t even 
                        know if you’re real.

                                 R.F.
                        If I’m not real, then how am I 
                        here?

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re here because I’m going 
                        insane.

                                 R.F.
                        Brother, you’re not going insane... 
                        you’ve been insane.

           INT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT (STEPHEN’S MEMORY)

           Stephen and R.F. play pool together the night they met.

           JUMP CUT - SAME SHOT - (ALTERED FLASHBACK) -- suddenly it’s 
           ONLY STEPHEN at the pool table, playing against himself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           R.F. reaches over the bar and grabs the BOTTLE OF BOURBON 
           from the well.

           JUMP CUT - SAME SHOT - (ALTERED FLASHBACK) -- it’s STEPHEN 
           taking the BOURBON from the well and hiding it in his jacket.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - RESUMING

           Stephen is distressed by this revelation. He VOMITS in the 
           laundry sink. R.F. winces. Gross.

           Stephen wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Other people saw you.

                                 R.F.
                        No... they didn’t.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT (STEPHEN’S MEMORY)

           The BARFLY throws her drink in R.F.’s face.

           JUMP CUT - SAME SHOT - (ALTERED FLASHBACK) -- it’s STEPHEN’s 
           face being dowsed in booze. 

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - RESUMING

                                 STEPHEN
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 R.F.
                        You mean why are you doing this.

                                 STEPHEN
                        So what are you telling me? That 
                        I’ve got a split personality?

                                 R.F.
                        Let’s just say I’m your better 
                        half. The dark half. The part that 
                        knows how to cut loose and have a 
                        good time. The part that doesn’t 
                        mind getting a little blood on his 
                        hands...

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAY (STEPHEN’S MEMORY)

           The RABBIT comes out of the clearing. Stephen watches in 
           horror as R.F. aims and SHOOTS.

           JUMP CUT - SAME SHOT - (ALTERED FLASHBACK) -- it’s STEPHEN’s 
           gun pointed at the RABBIT. He FIRES.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - RESUMING

           Stephen buries his face in his hands at the thought of the 
           dead rabbit.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh God! OH GOD!!
                                 R.F.
                        Don’t be so dramatic, Steve. So you 
                        like a drink every now and then. So 
                        what? There’s no crime in that. 
                        Look around you. This place is a 
                        fucking dump. It’s no wonder you 
                        drink. All this pressure is killing 
                        you. I’m here to save you.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I don’t need saving.

                                 R.F.
                        You’re hurting my feelings.

                                 STEPHEN
                        How do you think I feel? I thought 
                        you were a real person!

                                 R.F.
                        I am real. I’m as real as you. 
                        Whenever you need me, I’m always 
                        there. All you have to do is pick 
                        me up off the shelf.

           R.F. picks up the bottle of bourbon from the desk; waves it 
           in Stephen’s face.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Now... how about we have another 
                        drink?

           Stephen stares at the bottle, a rage of conflict brewing 
           inside him. R.F. raises an eyebrow at him. What’s it gonna 
           be?

           INT. CLASSROOM, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Stephen teaches his class. His suit is slightly askew; he 
           speaks with a tremble in his voice.

                                 STEPHEN
                        The character of Count Dracula is 
                        what we call a “paradox.” A paradox  
                        is something that has contradictory 
                        qualities, that can be two things 
                        at once. Dracula may be a monster, 
                        but he is also a man...

           His lesson is interrupted by an announcement from the OFFICE.
                                 P.A. (O.S.)
                        Attention please... there is a 
                        phone call for Mister King in the 
                        administration office... Mister 
                        King, please make your way to the 
                        office....

           A flicker of concern on Stephen’s face.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (to students)
                        Excuse me.

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen grabs the phone from the waiting RECEPTIONIST.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hello?

           He hears crying from the other end.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Tabby? What is it? What’s wrong? 

                                 TABITHA (O.S.)
                            (beat)
                        Oh... Stephen...

           INT. BUICK - LATER

           Stephen drives, stoney-faced, while Tabitha sits beside him, 
           teary-eyed. Naomi grizzles from the backseat.

           EXT. MAINE GENERAL HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           The Buick pulls up in the parking lot of Maine General 
           Hospital. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Stephen and Tabitha walk in. Stephen’s mother, Ruth, is 
           propped up in bed. She’s awake but looks weak, her face pale 
           and drawn.

           Tabitha approaches first, Naomi in her arms, as Stephen lags 
           behind, looking shell shocked.
                                 TABITHA
                            (consoling)
                        Hey Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        What’s this? You didn’t have to 
                        come all this way.

                                 TABITHA
                            (to Naomi)
                        Say hello to Grandma...

           Naomi reaches for Ruth. She takes her in her arms. As they 
           cuddle Ruth’s eyes lock on Stephen’s. He doesn’t know what to 
           say. He’s overwhelmed with emotion.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Ma...

           Ruth tries to keep the conversation light.

                                 RUTH
                        Stevie, hand me my cigarettes, 
                        would you?

           Stephen and Tabitha exchange a concerned glance.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I don’t think that’s such a good 
                        idea.

                                 RUTH
                            (beat)
                        I don’t think it really matters 
                        anymore, does it?

           Stephen tries to hold it together. His body shakes with the 
           effort.

           INT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL

           Stephen and Tabitha listen to the doctor as he describes 
           Ruth’s condition.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s cancer. Started in the uterus. 
                        It’s very aggressive but we do have 
                        options. We’re going to begin 
                        treatment right away. We’ll make 
                        her as comfortable as possible.

           Stephen can barely take in the words. He stares off blankly 
           into the distance; fighting back a storm of emotions.
                                 TABITHA
                            (to doctor)
                        Thank you.

           The doctor leaves. Tabitha puts a hand on Stephen’s arm.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay, hon?

                                 STEPHEN
                            (beat)
                        Maybe I need a minute.

           Tabitha’s heart breaks for her husband. She tries to stay 
           strong.

                                 TABITHA
                        Okay. I’ll take Naomi downstairs 
                        for a soda. You want anything?

           Stephen manages a smile. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        No thanks.

           Tabitha kisses her husband.

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s going to be okay.

           She takes Naomi down the corridor. Stephen watches her go, 
           grappling with how things can fall apart so easily.

           INT. RESTROOM, HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen storms into the restroom, trying to contain his 
           panic. 

           He turns on the faucet; splashes cold water on his face. He 
           looks back up at the mirror and sees R.F. standing behind 
           him, all faux concern.

                                 R.F.
                        How you doing, buddy?

           Stephen remains stoney-faced. He turns off the faucet.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Tough break. First your Dad leaves 
                        you, now your Mom. I guess some 
                        people just aren’t meant to have a 
                        family.
           Stephen whirls around and pushes R.F against the stall wall. 
           R.F. meets his steely gaze with one of his own.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Easy, big fellah. I’m your friend.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re not my friend. YOU’RE the 
                        goddamn cancer! YOU!!

           Stephen gives him one last shove before letting him go. R.F. 
           straightens up, adjusting his scuffed collar.

                                 R.F.
                        You should be nice to me, Steve. 
                        I’m the only real friend you got. 
                        Mom’s on her way out, and it’s only 
                        a matter of time before Tabby sees 
                        what a loser you really are. When 
                        everyone else is gone, I’ll still 
                        be here.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I don’t need you.

                                 R.F.
                            (beat)
                        Try getting through this without 
                        me.

           Stephen gives R.F. a reproachful look before exiting.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER

           Stephen sits in a chair by his mother’s bedside. He’s reading 
           “The Haunting of Hill House” by Shirley Jackson. Ruth stirs 
           awake and sees her son; notes the book in his hands. 

                                 RUTH
                        You always were a bookworm. Just 
                        like your father. 

           A thin smile from Stephen.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I thought you said we didn’t have 
                        anything in common.

                                 RUTH
                        Well, that wasn’t exactly true. I 
                        didn’t want anything I said to put 
                        you off your writing.
                                 STEPHEN
                        My writing? 

                                 RUTH
                        Suppose there’s no harm in tellin’
                        you now. I ain’t one to be taking 
                        secrets to the grave. Truth is your 
                        father tried to make it as a writer 
                        too. 

           Stephen can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 STEPHEN
                        My father wanted to be a writer?

                                 RUTH
                        Never got any further than a few 
                        short stories. As soon as he got 
                        rejected he lost interest.

           An awkward silence. Stephen can barely comprehend what she’s 
           saying. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Who knows? Maybe that sorry son of 
                        a bitch is where you get all your 
                        talent from.

           CLOSE on Stephen as he grapples with this revelation. 

           INT. HOSPITAL COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen approaches the cashier, looking flustered.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Gimme a pack of Marlboros.

           The cashier puts the cigarettes on the counter. Stephen pulls 
           out his wallet, stares at the cigarettes as we--

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. THE KING HOUSE - DAY

           TODDLER STEPHEN (2) stands hanging on to the edge of his 
           crib. He surveys the living room. A man is sitting in a sofa 
           chair; his father, Donald. He smokes a cigarette and appears 
           deep in thought.

           Stephen’s POV as Donald looks over at his son for a brief 
           moment before stubbing out his cigarette in an ashtray.
                                 DONALD
                            (calling out)
                        Ruth! I’m goin’ to get some more 
                        cigarettes!

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Okay, hon. Can you pick up some 
                        milk?

                                 DONALD
                        Milk? Sure.

           Donald pulls on a jacket and puts on a hat. He looks down 
           pensively at his son.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        See you round, kid.

           He leaves. Stephen starts to cry, his shrieks getting LOUDER 
           and LOUDER as we--

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. HOSPITAL COFFEE SHOP - RESUMING

           Stephen stares dumbly at the cigarettes.

                                 CASHIER
                            (off cigarettes)
                        You still want those?

           Stephen nods glumly. He hands over a twenty.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

           Stephen walks down the corridor towards his mother’s room. 
           There’s a commotion outside. NURSES run back and forth.

           Stephen drops the cigarettes. He breaks into a jog; reaches 
           his mother’s room as a NURSE gives him a sad look and shakes 
           her head.

           He looks in, sees his mother lying peacefully with her eyes 
           closed as the nurses unhook her IV.

           CLOSE on Stephen’s devastated face.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Stephen wearing the same despondent look. It’s his mother’s 
           funeral. Tabitha holds Stephen’s hand as Naomi plays amongst 
           the headstones.

           Stephen listens silently as the priest reads the eulogy. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Yea, though I walk through the 
                        valley of the shadow of death, I 
                        will fear no evil...

           Tabitha gives his hand a supportive squeeze. He tries to 
           smile but can only manage a grimace. His world is shattered.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

           The state fair. The bright colors of the rides compete with 
           the cries of the barkers. Punters try their luck at gaming 
           booths. A FERRIS WHEEL circles endlessly in the distance.

           Stephen walks with Tabitha while she pushes Naomi in a 
           stroller. Tabitha points out the lights of the MIDWAY.

                                 TABITHA
                        Look Naomi! See the pretty colors!

           Stephen glances over at the midway; sees a CLOWN holding a 
           bunch of BRIGHTLY COLORED BALLOONS. The clown leers silently 
           at him. R.F. appears beside Stephen.

                                 R.F.
                        What the fuck is that clown lookin’
                        at?

                                 TABITHA
                        Steve? Are you okay?

           Stephen quickly snaps back.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah. I’m fine.

                                 TABITHA
                            (sympathetic)
                        We can go home if you want to. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        No. It’s fine. Naomi’s having fun.
                                 R.F.
                            (sarcastic)
                        Good for Naomi.

                                 TABITHA
                        I just thought this might help take 
                        your mind off things.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I know. It’s good. I’m enjoying 
                        myself.

                                 R.F.
                        I know what would make this 
                        enjoyable.

           Stephen looks at R.F. with exasperation.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (to Tabitha)
                        Hey listen... I’ll be right back, 
                        okay? 

                                 TABITHA
                        Steve--

                                 STEPHEN
                        One minute. I just need to take a 
                        leak.

           Stephen breaks away from his family and moves towards the BIG 
           TOP. He trots behind the tent; looking cautiously behind him. 
           He removes a FLASK from his jacket and takes a drink.

                                 KURT
                        Steve!

           Kurt Barlow appears from around the corner. 

                                 KURT (CONT’D)
                        I saw you on the midway. How you 
                        doin’?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Uh, okay.

                                 KURT
                        Great Fair this year.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sure.
                                 KURT
                            (off flask)
                        Whatcha got there?

           Stephen looks down at the flask; instinctively pockets it. 

                                 KURT (CONT’D)
                            (condescending)
                        Hey... it’s okay. You don’t have to 
                        worry. I won’t tell anyone. I get 
                        it. We all enjoy a little nip every 
                        now and then. But if anyone else 
                        saw you, well, I don’t know how to 
                        say this... you could get a 
                        reputation.

           Stephen’s eyes burn with fury. He steps up to Kurt.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Is that a threat?

                                 KURT
                            (confused)
                        What? No! I said I wasn’t going to 
                        tell anyone!

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’ve got a lot to say about 
                        everything, don’t ya Kurt? You and 
                        everyone else. You’re nothing but a 
                        bunch of judgmental hypocrites who 
                        can’t mind your own damn business.

                                 KURT
                        Steve, listen -- I’m just trying to 
                        help you out here.

           Stephen gets in Kurt’s face.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You breathe one word of this to 
                        anyone, and I swear to you, I will 
                        come after you with a goddamn 
                        baseball bat. 

                                 KURT
                            (alarmed)
                        Steve--!

                                 STEPHEN
                            (mocking voice)
                        Steeeeeeeve!!
           Kurt regards Stephen with wide, terrified eyes. Stephen’s 
           tone suddenly changes.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, man! I’m just kiddin’!
                        Seriously, thanks for lookin’ out 
                        for me. I appreciate it. This can 
                        be just our little secret, okay?

           Kurt nods quickly.

                                 KURT
                        Yes. Of course.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Good man. 

           Stephen walks off, leaving a clearly traumatized Kurt 
           standing alone. He walks out from behind the big top and sees 
           his wife. She’s CROUCHED OVER on the ground, a small group of 
           people gathered around her excitedly. Stephen rushes over to 
           her.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Tab, what’s wrong? What happened??

           She looks at him with wild, startled eyes.

                                 TABITHA
                        My water just broke.

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM, MAINE GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

           Tabitha lies on a hospital bed, her legs up in stirrups. 
           Doctors and nurses mill around as her face contorts with 
           pain. Stephen holds her hand tightly.

                                 DOCTOR
                        All right now, one last push--

           Tabitha bears down and SCREAMS. A baby CRIES.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Here he is! Mister and Mrs. King, 
                        you’ve got a baby boy!

                                 TABITHA
                        A boy!! Stephen, it’s a boy!!

           Stephen looks at his son in wonder. Tears fill his eyes.

           After the death of his mother, it’s a bittersweet moment.
           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - DAYS LATER

           Stephen sits at his typewriter trying to write. He’s 
           interrupted by the sound of a baby crying. He sighs in 
           frustration as R.F. appears beside him.

                                 R.F.
                        Goddamn. That new baby sure is a 
                        drag.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (to R.F.)
                        Don’t you ever shut up??

           Tabitha appears at the door.

                                 TABITHA
                            (to Stephen)
                        What was that, hon?

           Stephens turns to Tabitha.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hm?

                                 TABITHA
                        You said somethin’.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s nothing. I’m just... talking a 
                        scene out in my head.

                                 TABITHA
                            (skeptical)
                        Oh. Okay.

           Tabitha leaves. R.F. gazes after Tabitha lustfully.

                                 R.F.
                        I’d like to talk her right outta 
                        that dress.

           Stephen keeps trying to type but the baby’s cries get louder 
           and louder. He throws up his hands in frustration.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Goddamn it!

           INT. KITCHENETTE

           Stephen wanders out of the laundry and walks over to the 
           crib. He tries to hide his annoyance.
                                 STEPHEN
                        What’s wrong, baby Joe?

           JOE lets out a wail as Stephen picks him up. Tabitha sits at 
           the kitchen table, trying unsuccessfully to scoop baby food 
           into Naomi’s mouth.

                                 TABITHA
                        He’s just tired.

           Stephen bounces Joe up and down in an attempt to placate him. 
           Baby Joe promptly SPEWS UP all over Stephen’s shirt.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Awww Jesus...

           Tabitha sighs.

                                 TABITHA
                        That’s just great.

           She puts down Naomi’s spoon; heads into the kitchen for a 
           wash cloth.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Here...

           She hands the washcloth to Stephen and takes the baby. 
           Stephen dabs ineffectively at the stain.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were writing.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s kinda hard when the baby’s 
                        cryin’.

           Stephen takes a cigarette out of his pocket and lights it. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Goddamn it, Steve. I thought you 
                        were giving up!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sorry.

                                 TABITHA
                        Not around the baby. Please.

           R.F. appears by the refrigerator.

                                 R.F.
                        Don’t let her talk to you like 
                        that. This is your house.
                                 STEPHEN
                            (to R.F.)
                        Stay outta this, would you?

           Tabitha’s jaw drops.

                                 TABITHA
                        What did you say to me??

                                 STEPHEN
                            (frustrated)
                        I’m not talking to you!

                                 TABITHA
                        No, you’re not. You’re yelling. 

                                 STEPHEN
                            (exploding)
                        God, I can’t stand this anymore! I 
                        NEED TO GET SOME WORK DONE!

                                 TABITHA
                        THEN GO DO IT! This isn’t my fault, 
                        Steve! Babies cry! I’m sorry it’s 
                        such a damn inconvenience to you!!

           R.F. slides up beside Stephen. In his hands is an AXE.

                                 R.F.
                        Stephen, I swear to God. If you 
                        don’t shut this bitch up... I will!

           R.F. RAISES the axe above his head. HE SWINGS!

           Stephen LEAPS for Tabitha!

                                 STEPHEN
                        TABBY!!! LOOK OUT!!!!

           Stephen THROWS her to the ground; shields her body with his 
           own as the AXE comes down.

           Then-- NOTHING. Stephen and Tabitha are lying on the ground. 
           R.F. has disappeared, along with the axe. Tabitha begins to 
           struggle.

                                 TABITHA
                        Let! Me! Go!!

           She breaks free from Stephen and leaps up. She looks at her 
           husband with incomprehension as Naomi cries louder.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU????
           Stephen’s face is red; his eyes wide and startled.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tab! I’m sorry! I thought I saw--

                                 TABITHA
                        Saw what??

           Stephen has no answer. Sweat drips from his forehead. He 
           tries to catch his breath as his wife stares at him with 
           utter bewilderment.

           INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Stephen stands in front of the mirror; looks at his red, 
           startled face. He opens the bathroom cabinet and takes out a 
           bottle of EXCEDRIN; pops a few and chews.

           He closes the cabinet. Written on the mirror in BRIGHT RED 
           CRAYON is the word REDRUM. 

           Stephen stares at the word, eyes wide with confusion and 
           terror. He grabs some TOILET PAPER; quickly wipes the word 
           away with a trembling hand. Red crayon SMEARS all over the 
           mirror, looking for all the world like BLOOD. R.F. appears
           behind him.

                                 R.F.
                        Typical. Never doing what needs to 
                        be done. 

                                 STEPHEN
                            (defiant)
                        I am doing what needs to be done. 
                        I’m writing.

           He throws the paper in the trash and walks out.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Stephen sits down at the typewriter; lights a cigarette. He 
           puts his trembling fingers on the keys; takes a deep breath. 
           He’s about to start writing when--

                                 TABITHA (O.S.)
                        Stephen.

           Stephen’s shoulders slump. He buries his face in his hands; 
           emits a long, drawn out sigh.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What??
           Tabitha stands nervously in the doorway.

                                 TABITHA
                            (beat)
                        We need to talk.

           Stephen lifts his head and stares at her with deranged eyes, 
           a creepy grin on his face.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Do we?

           He slowly gets up. Tabitha takes a defensive step back.

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m just... concerned.

                                 STEPHEN
                            (taunting)
                        You’re concerned?

           Tabitha treads softly.

                                 TABITHA
                        I know you’re upset about your Mom. 
                        So am I. But you’ve been acting 
                        strange for a long time, even 
                        before she got sick.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Is that a fact?

                                 TABITHA
                            (nervous beat)
                        I was thinking, maybe, you should 
                        see a doctor...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Of course you were! There’s always 
                        something wrong with Stephen! It’s 
                        always Stephen’s fault!!! Why can’t 
                        you just be happy, Steve? Why can’t 
                        you just pull yourself together??

                                 TABITHA
                        Stephen, please. Don’t do this. 
                        Just calm down. I’m trying to help 
                        you.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Maybe I’m upset because I’m trying
                        to get some work done, AND NO ONE 
                        WILL LET ME CONCENTRATE!
           Tears fill Tabitha’s eyes.

                                 TABITHA
                        I don’t know how much longer I can 
                        do this.

           Stephen laughs cruelly.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well, isn’t that just a kick in the 
                        nuts? I mean, where would Steve be 
                        without Tab and the kids to weigh 
                        him down??

           He sits down; rolls another piece of paper into the 
           typewriter. He starts typing.

           Tabitha takes a deep breath. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I’m taking the kids.

           Stephen stops typing. Tabitha presses on.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking them to my Mom’s... just 
                        for a night or two. That way you 
                        can have some space, you know... to 
                        think things through.

           R.F. appears next to Stephen. He laughs.

                                 R.F.
                        Checkmate. 

           Stephen slowly stands, his eyes glinting with malice. Tabitha 
           takes a few steps back.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well. That’s just fucking great 
                        isn’t it. After all I’ve done. 
                        After how hard I’ve worked. I’m 
                        trying to give us a better life. 
                        I’m trying to get us out of this 
                        fucking hell hole. And all for 
                        what? FOR NOTHING!!

           Stephen SCATTERS the pages of his unfinished manuscript 
           across the floor. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Stephen! What are you doing??

           R.F. bursts into gales of laughter.
                                 R.F.
                        Whoa! This is gettin’ good!

           Stephen proceeds to TRASH the laundry room.

                                 STEPHEN
                        All our hopes!! All our dreams!!! 
                        FOR NOTHING!!!

           Stephen PICKS UP his TYPEWRITER; hoists it OVER his SHOULDER.

           Tabitha screams.

                                 TABITHA
                        STEPHEN!! DON’T DO IT!!!!!!

           He HURLS IT out the WINDOW. The typewriter SMASHES to the 
           ground outside.

           Tabitha bursts into tears.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        NOW YOU’VE DONE IT!!!!

           She runs from the room. Stephen screams after her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Fine! FUCKING GO!! YOU’RE BETTER 
                        OFF WITHOUT ME ANYWAY!!! YOU ALL 
                        ARE!!!

           In the next room Tabitha quickly packs a bag for the kids, 
           bundles them under her arms and makes for the front door. She 
           takes one last sad look around her home before leaving. The 
           door slams shut. Tabitha is gone.

           Stephen’s shoulders slump. R.F. pats him on the back.

                                 R.F.
                        I think it’s time for a drink.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - NIGHT

           Stephen and R.F. sit drinking in the trailer. Alice Cooper’s 
           “No More Mister Nice Guy” plays on the radio. 

                                 R.F.
                        How does it feel to be a free man?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It feels pretty fuckin’ good.
                                 R.F.
                        Told ya.

           Stephen becomes drunkenly contemplative.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You know... I think my old man had 
                        the right idea. I used to be angry 
                        at him for leavin’ us, but I’m not 
                        anymore. I don’t blame him for not 
                        stickin’ around. Nothing you do is 
                        good enough for anyone. Might as 
                        well be on your own.

                                 R.F.
                        I knew you’d come round.

                                 STEPHEN
                        So what do we do now?

           R.F. holds up his beer bottle.

                                 R.F.
                        We keep drinking.

           The clink beer bottles, chug them back as we SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - MORNING

           Stephen is lying on the floor, asleep. He is surrounded by 
           EMPTY BEER BOTTLES.

           He comes to. Broken light shines through the windows of the 
           trailer. He squints. The trailer is dead quiet. No music. No 
           R.F. No baby crying. No Tabitha.

           He stands up, looks around his broken home. His face fills 
           with regret. What has he done?

           INT. CLASSROOM, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Stephen stands at the front of a packed classroom. His eyes 
           are red; his hair disheveled.

                                 STEPHEN
                        One of the attractions of a horror 
                        story like “Dracula” is that it 
                        allows us to indulge in antisocial 
                        behavior. We get to experience what 
                        it feels like to be a monster 
                        without actually hurting anyone.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                        This is what’s known as 
                        ‘catharsis.’

           Stephen writes the word CATHARSIS on the board.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        For this reason horror stories 
                        actually serve an important role in 
                        society. They provide an outlet for 
                        our darkest emotions, the ones we 
                        would prefer to keep hidden from 
                        the people around us...

           INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

           Stephen exits the classroom with his briefcase. Someone SLAMS 
           in to him: Sondra. She looks up at him, eyes wide and 
           alarmed.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What’s going on?

           Stephen looks past her shoulder, sees the Means Girls 
           loitering innocently by the lockers. Stephen holds Sondra by 
           her shoulders.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        What happened? 

           Sondra hesitates; looks around in a panic. Stephen tries to 
           capture her attention.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey... it’s okay. You can talk to 
                        me.

           Sondra trembles in his hands.

                                 SONDRA
                        I hate them. They’ll never leave me 
                        alone.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m going to talk to them--

                                 SONDRA
                        NO! Please don’t.

                                 STEPHEN
                        We have to do something!

               She leans in; speaks in a whisper.
                                 SONDRA
                        I wish we could blow them all up.

           She breaks free of his grasp and runs down the corridor. He 
           looks after her, helpless. The Mean Girls shrug and walk 
           away. Suddenly, something occurs to Stephen. An idea.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - LATER

           Stephen bursts into the trailer, brimming with ideas. He 
           throws down his briefcase; shuffles through a pile of 
           magazines on the kitchen table. He finds the copy of LIFE 
           MAGAZINE he was reading at the LAUNDROMAT. He opens it and 
           finds the article:

                              TELEKINESIS: FACT OR FICTION?

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen PICKS UP HIS TYPEWRITER off the ground and dusts it 
           off. A few of the keys are broken but it’s nothing he can’t 
           fix.

           He throws it under his arm and goes back inside.

           INT. KITCHEN TABLE, DOUBLE WIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen sits at the table with the typewriter. He takes a 
           TUBE OF SUPERGLUE and a BAG OF BUTTONS from Tabitha’s SEWING 
           KIT. He carefully GLUES a LARGE BUTTON on one of the broken 
           keys; blows on it to make the glue dry quicker. He tries it 
           out. The key WORKS. Stephen smiles triumphantly.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DOUBLE WIDE

           Stephen bursts into the laundry carrying his newly repaired 
           typewriter. He picks the pages off the floor, dusts them off 
           and sits down.

           He starts to write. He types FASTER and FASTER. As he does 
           OBJECTS start to LEVITATE off the table. An ASHTRAY, the 
           LAUNDRY DETERGENT, his PACK OF CIGARETTES. The FASTER he 
           types the HIGHER they go. They HOVER above his head as he 
           TYPES to the end of the page, then--

           RIIIIIP!!

           Stephen TEARS the page triumphantly from the typewriter. The 
           objects FALL BACK into place. He looks at the page, thrilled. 
           There might be some life in this story yet.
           He’s about to get back into it when--

                                 R.F.
                        What the fuck are you doin’?

           Stephen doesn’t respond. He keeps typing.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Asshole. You look at me when 
                        I’m talking to you.

           Stephen still doesn’t respond.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        HEY!!

           Stephen keeps typing.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re not here. You’re not here 
                        because I don’t want you to be.

                                 R.F.
                        It doesn’t work that way. You can’t 
                        just wish me away, motherfucker. 
                        I’m not going anywhere.

           Stephen stops typing. He turns to R.F. with a newfound 
           strength.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’ve ruined me, R.F. You took 
                        everything from me. My family. My 
                        talent. My sanity. Well I’m getting 
                        it all back. This ends now.

           Stephen goes back to writing. R.F. gives him a defiant look.

                                 R.F.
                        We’ll see about that.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen is deep in the writing zone when he smells something. 
           He stops typing; sniffs the air. Then he hears it. The sound 
           of CRACKLING.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER

           Stephen walks out of the laundry. His face is immediately 
           bathed in a RED, FIERY GLOW. The curtains of the trailer are 
           in flames. The trailer is ON FIRE!
           R.F. stands in the middle of the trailer, laughing like a 
           maniac.

                                 STEPHEN
                        WHAT DID YOU DO?????

                                 R.F.
                        I’m settin’ you free, prisoner! 
                        BURN, BABY, BURN!!!

           Stephen rushes to the kitchen and SNATCHES a POT from the 
           stove top. He fills it with water, races back and DOUSES the 
           curtains. They SMOLDER with BLACK SMOKE.

           Stephen races back to the kitchen to refill the pot. He 
           desperately throws the water on the remaining flames.

           The fire is EXTINGUISHED. R.F. cackles amidst the chaos.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Wooo-weeeee! Nearly had you then, 
                        didn’t I? We were this close to 
                        freedom. Oh well. There’s always 
                        next time. Like they say, practice 
                        makes perfect.

           Stephen advances on R.F, teeth gritted in rage.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I want you OUT.OF.MY.HEAD.

                                 TABITHA
                        Stephen?

           He turns around. Tabitha is standing in the doorway, staring 
           in horror at her husband. She looks at the carnage of her 
           home. BEERS CANS are strewn all around the room. ASH TRAYS 
           are overflowing. CURTAINS smoldering.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        I just... came back for some 
                        things.
                            (frightened beat)
                        What’s going on? Who were you 
                        talking to??

                                 STEPHEN
                        Nobody, just... myself...

           Tabitha takes a cautious step back. 

                                 TABITHA
                        What do you mean you were talking 
                        to yourself? 
           R.F. advances on Tabitha. 

                                 R.F.
                        I’ve had just about enough of 
                        you...

           Stephen pushes him back.

                                 STEPHEN
                        LEAVE HER ALONE!

           Tabitha gives Stephen a look of bewilderment. 

                                 TABITHA
                        STEPHEN!! WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO??

           Stephen looks at Tabitha imploringly.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tabby, please, I need help. 

                                 R.F.
                        You sure do.

           Stephen grabs R.F. by the lapels; pushes him up against the 
           wall.

                                 STEPHEN
                        SHUT UP!!!!!

           This is too much for Tabitha. She flees. Stephen drops R.F. 
           and gives chase.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Tabby! Please!!!

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER

           Tabitha gets in the car, slams the door and takes off.

           Stephen drops to his knees.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tabby, please!! DON’T LEAVE ME!!!

           Her tail lights dim in the distance. Stephen hangs his head 
           sadly.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER 

           Stephen walks back inside the trailer, head bowed, a defeated 
           man. R.F. leans casually against the wall.
                                 R.F.
                        That woman just ain’t no good for 
                        us.

           Stephen emits a long, drawn out sigh.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You know what, R.F?
                            (beat)
                        You’re right. 

           R.F. eyes Stephen suspiciously.

                                 R.F.
                        What are you sayin’?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s done. My marriage is over. And 
                        this goddamn book. Who’s going to 
                        give a shit? A girl with 
                        telekinetic powers? It’s a bunch of 
                        crap, just like the rest of my 
                        books.

           Stephen looks R.F. straight in the eye.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sayin’ I give up. 

           R.F. slowly nods. The two men, separate but one, stare at 
           each other with resignation.

                                 R.F.
                        It’s about time. 
                            (beat)
                        Let’s hit the road.

           INT. BUICK - MOMENTS LATER

           The Buick SPEEDS down the highway. 

                                 R.F.
                        FREE AT LAST! FREE AT LAST! THANK 
                        GOD ALMIGHTY, WE ARE FREE AT LAST! 
                        I knew you’d come around. We can go 
                        wherever we want. I say we head on 
                        down to Florida. From now on it’ll 
                        be sand, skirts and scotch for us.

           Stephen signals for a turn-off.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Sounds good my man! But first we’ll 
                        need supplies, am I right?

                                 R.F.
                        Yeah. We’ve got a long drive ahead 
                        of us. Libations are in order.

           EXT. GENERAL STORE - LATER

           Stephen walks out of the store carrying a large DUFFEL BAG. 
           He looks nervously towards the Buick. R.F. eyes him 
           suspiciously; yells out the open window.

                                 R.F.
                        Damn, man. What the hell did you 
                        buy?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s a long way to Florida!

           Stephen puts the duffel bag in the TRUNK of the car and opens 
           it. The bag is FULL of BEER. He takes one out and closes the 
           trunk.

           INT. BUICK

           Stephen gets in and throws a beer over to R.F. 

                                 R.F.
                        Thanks, partner.

           Stephen cracks open a beer himself, sculls it back and starts 
           the engine.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Florida, here we come!

           INT. BUICK - NIGHT

           The Buick cruises along the road. The highway is surrounded 
           by thick, green woods. R.F. belches loudly. Stephen downs the 
           last of his beer and chucks the can out the window.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Man. I gotta take a piss.

           He pulls off to the side of the road; kills the engine.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        This’ll only take a minute.
           He fumbles for the door and drunkenly staggers out.

                                 R.F.
                        Take your time. Think I’ll grab 
                        myself another beer.

           EXT. HIGHWAY

           They both exit the Buick. Stephen, appearing suddenly sober, 
           goes round to the back and opens the trunk. He UNZIPS the 
           duffel bag. His hand plunges DEEP amongst the BEER CANS and 
           grabs hold of something. He carefully pulls it out.

           It’s a SHOVEL.

           He casts a cautious eye in R.F’s direction. R.F. is seemingly 
           oblivious to what he is doing. He stands by the side of the 
           road, singing as he relieves himself.

                                 R.F. (O.S.)
                        Baby, can you dig your maaaan... 
                        he’s a righteous man, tell me, 
                        baby, can you dig your man...

           Stephen slowly approaches R.F. from behind and RAISES the 
           shovel. He gets closer and closer, is about to swing when--

           R.F. whips around, grabbing the shovel effortlessly with one 
           hand!

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        You really thought I wouldn’t see 
                        you coming?
                            (beat)
                        You damn fool. I am you.

           R.F. swiftly brings his elbow up to Stephen’s face, knocking 
           him to the ground. Stephen’s consciousness fades as we--

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Deep amongst the trees. R.F. drags Stephen’s body behind him, 
           shovel slung over his shoulder.

                                 R.J.
                        Blue moooooon... you saw me 
                        standing aloooone...
           Stephen slowly comes to. He looks around wildly; tries to 
           grab onto branches and bushes as they pass but can’t quite 
           manage it. R.F. notices he’s awake.

                                 R.F.
                        Come on, Steve! Sing it with me! 
                        Without a dream in my heaaaaaart, 
                        without a love of my owwwwwwwn...

           R.F. throws the shovel down, dropping Stephen abruptly.

                                 R.J.
                        This looks like a nice spot. Damn, 
                        these woods are creepy. It’s like 
                        something out of a horror story, 
                        huh?

           Stephen moans a response. He frantically tries to crawl away. 

                                 R.F.
                        Where do you think you’re going?

           R.F. drags him back by the scruff of his shirt.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        You’re a real pain in the ass, you 
                        know that? We were home free, and 
                        you had to go and fuck it all up. 
                        Again.

           R.F. kicks Stephen in the stomach. Stephen rolls over, 
           clutching his gut. R.F. picks up the shovel and starts 
           digging.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        We could have lived the good life. 
                        The only thing stopping us was you.

           Stephen attempts to stand but the pain is too great. He falls 
           back down in the dirt as R.F. keeps digging.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        So I’m gonna have to get rid of 
                        you, buddy. Sorry, but you’re 
                        dragging us down.

           R.F. grabs Stephen by the ankles; drags him over to the 
           freshly dug hole as Stephen pleads for his life...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Wait! You’re right! I’m sorry!!! 
                                 R.F.
                            (mocking)
                        I’m sorrrrry, R.F. I’m 
                        SORRRRRRRRRY. Christ, Stephen - man 
                        the fuck up!! If you weren’t such a 
                        pussy we wouldn’t be in this 
                        goddamn situation. 

           R.F. THROWS him in the hole. Stephen lands face down; coughs 
           up a mouthful of dirt. R.F. picks up the shovel and starts 
           filling him in.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        You think you don’t need me? Well, 
                        I don’t need you.

           Stephen tries to sit up. He gets a face full of dirt. 

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        Look at you. You’re pathetic.

           He lays back down. He’s given up hope. R.F. stops scooping 
           dirt. He leans on the shovel; looks at Stephen accusingly.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        No wonder your father left you.

           Something fierce awakens in Stephen. He LEAPS UP like a 
           ZOMBIE out of the grave; WRAPS HIS HANDS around R.F’s THROAT 
           and SQUEEZES. R.F. scrambles for Stephen’s hands; tries to 
           pull them off but they’re too strong.

           He HEAD BUTTS Stephen, sending him STAGGERING BACK. Stephen 
           GRABS the SHOVEL; swings it WILDLY in R.F’s direction. It 
           connects. A thick SPRAY OF BLOOD pours from a wound on R.F’s 
           forehead. He staggers towards Stephen.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna kill you, you son of a 
                        bitch.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Think again.

           Stephen SWINGS the shovel once more, knocking R.F. 
           unconscious as we--

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           EXT. THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           R.F. comes to. He’s lying in the makeshift grave. Stephen 
           frantically shovels dirt over him as R.F. pleads for his 
           life.

                                 R.F.
                        Steve - come on, pal. I was just 
                        kidding around. Let’s forget the 
                        whole thing, okay?? I’ll leave you 
                        alone. You’ll never see me again. I 
                        promise.

           Stephen continues to shovel dirt onto R.F. He grunts with 
           exertion as R.F. becomes frantic.

                                 R.F. (CONT’D)
                        You think you can get rid of me?? 
                        You’ll NEVER be rid of me! I’ll 
                        always be with you! You can bury 
                        me, but you can’t kill me. I’m part 
                        of you, just like I was part of 
                        your old man--

           Stephen lifts the shovel HIGH above his head; brings it down 
           with a resounding THWACK!

           R.F. is finally silenced. Stephen stares at his lifeless 
           body; throws the shovel down triumphantly.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m not my father.

           He turns to walk out of the woods. Suddenly, from behind him, 
           the sound of LAUGHTER. Stephen stares in terror at the mound 
           of dirt. It’s moving. Stephen makes a run for it. He sprints 
           through the trees, his clothes catching on overhanging 
           branches, tearing at his skin.

           R.F.’s laughter becomes god-like; omniscient. His voice 
           echoes through the wilderness.

                                 R.F.
                        I’ll see you round, Steve. Sooner 
                        or later, I’ll see you around...

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - MORNING

           Stephen pulls up in the Buick and gets out. He’s covered in 
           dirt; his clothing ripped and torn. He takes the duffel bag 
           from the back of the Buick and slams the trunk shut. 
           EXT. BEHIND THE TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Stephen opens the beer cans one by one. He pours the contents 
           out into the grass and throws the cans into the trash.

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE

           A car pulls up. It’s Tabitha in her mother’s VW. She gives 
           the trailer a look of resignation before killing the engine. 
           She gets out.

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE

           Tabitha steps inside; looks around apprehensively. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Hello?

           No answer. 

           INT. BATHROOM 

           Tabitha opens the bathroom cabinet; starts putting toiletries 
           into an overnight bag. She glances through the window and 
           sees Stephen outside. She watches as he empties the beer cans 
           into the ground. Her face softens.  

           EXT. BEHIND THE TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Tabitha walks behind the trailer; regards Stephen curiously 
           from a distance. Stephen is so absorbed in the task he 
           doesn’t even notice her.

                                 TABITHA
                        Hey.

           Stephen looks up; sees Tabitha. He looks down again, ashamed.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey.

           He continues with the task at hand. Tabitha watches him for a 
           moment, undecided. Finally she kneels down beside him; starts 
           helping him empty the beer cans.

                                 TABITHA
                        My mother always said I was the 
                        most stubborn girl she ever knew. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TABITHA (CONT'D)
                        “Tabby,” she’d say, “you’re like a 
                        dog with a bone. You never know 
                        when to quit.”

           Stephen looks at his wife with enormous affection.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tab... it’s over. I promise. No 
                        more drinking.

                                 TABITHA
                        It’s not over. It’s something 
                        you’re going to have to work at 
                        every single day of your life.  

           Stephen gives his wife a look of resolve.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I can do it.

           Tears brim in Stephen’s eyes. Tabitha tries to remain stoic. 
           She gestures to the remaining beer cans.

                                 TABITHA
                        Go on. I’ll finish this. 

           Stephen looks at Tabitha quizzically. She smiles.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you have a novel to write?

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

           The Ramones “Blitzkrieg Bop” revs up as Stephen gets back to 
           work.

           MONTAGE:

           -- LAUNDRY ROOM: Stephen pounds the keys like a madman. He’s 
           gonna lick this sucker.

           -- DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER: Stephen and Tabitha lie in bed. 
           Tabitha is reading pages of the manuscript. Stephen watches 
           nervously. She gives him a thumbs up. He smiles with relief.

           -- TEACHERS LOUNGE: Stephen sits reading the LIFE MAGAZINE 
           article about TELEKINESIS. He takes notes. KURT enters and 
           gives him a wary smile. Stephen smiles back happily. He’s in 
           a better place now. 

           -- HAMPDEN ACADEMY: Posters are going up for the PROM. 
           Stephen looks at them, inspired.
           -- LAUNDRY ROOM: The end run. Stephen types and types, 
           until... 

           He pulls the last sheet out of the typewriter and throws it 
           down on the manuscript pile.

           He turns the manuscript over; exposing the title page.

                                        “CARRIE”

                                     By Stephen King

           He looks at the page with satisfaction. “CARRIE” is complete.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Stephen walks down the street in an enormous coat, bundled up 
           against the chill. A thick package is in his hand. He pauses 
           before a MAIL BOX and reads the address.

           ATTENTION: BILL THOMPSON, EDITOR
           DOUBLEDAY
           1745 BROADWAY
           NEW YORK, NEW YORK

           He takes a deep breath, opens the mailbox, and puts the 
           package in the slot.

           EXT. YARD, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - DAY

           Sondra sits by herself on a wooden bench, picking at a 
           sandwich. Stephen walks outside; catches a glimpse of her. He 
           makes a split-second decision then decides to walk over.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey.

           Sondra eyes him cautiously.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        We haven’t been properly 
                        introduced. I’m Steve. Uh, Mister 
                        King. I teach English. You’re not 
                        in any of my classes, are you?

           Sondra shakes her head.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name? 

                                 SONDRA
                        Sondra.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Mind if I sit down?

           Sondra gives a small nod. Stephen takes a seat, looks around 
           at the other students playing in the yard.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        This shit’s hard, isn’t it?

           Sondra is startled by his use of an expletive.

                                 SONDRA
                        What??

                                 STEPHEN
                        You know. This. High school. Life.
                        I wish I could tell you it gets 
                        better, but it doesn’t. Not really. 
                        One thing I know, you’ve gotta 
                        fight life every step of the way. 
                        Don’t let it gang up on you.

           Sondra frowns; doesn’t say anything.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell you what. I’m gonna keep 
                        fightin’ this world if you will 
                        too. If you ever need a friend, 
                        someone to talk to, you come find 
                        me, okay?

           Sondra finally smiles.

                                 SONDRA
                        Okay.

           Stephen nods. He spies a ruffled paperback beside her: 
           “Valley of the Dolls” by Jacqueline Susann.

                                 STEPHEN
                        And one more thing...

           Sondra looks at him expectantly. Stephen motions to the book.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t stop reading.

           INT. BATHROOM, DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - DAY

           GRAPHIC: MONTHS LATER
           Winter. The trailer is effectively snowed in. Tabitha stands 
           in front of the mirror blow drying her wet hair. The HAIR 
           DRYER shorts. She shakes it.

                                 TABITHA
                        Shit.

           Stephen appears at the door.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 TABITHA
                        Damn thing broke.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ll get you a new one on the way 
                        to work.

                                 TABITHA
                        We can’t afford it. 

           Stephen looks out the window at the snow.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Honey, it’s freezing out there. 
                        You’ll catch cold.

                                 TABITHA
                        I’ll be fine. I’m more concerned 
                        with having money to keep the 
                        heating on. They cut back on my 
                        shifts again. We’ll have to keep 
                        the phone disconnected for another 
                        week at least.

           Stephen wraps his arms around her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m sorry, Tab.

                                 TABITHA
                        Don’t worry. I’m sure you’ll hear 
                        back from Bill Thompson soon.

           He snuggles into her shoulder.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You have a lot more faith than I 
                        do.
           INT. HALLWAY, HAMPDEN ACADEMY - LATER

           Stephen is walking down the hallway when an announcement 
           comes over the intercom.

                                 P.A. (O.S.)
                        Phone call for Mister King. Mister 
                        King, you have a phone call at the 
                        office.

           INT. OFFICE, HAMPDEN ACADEMY

           Stephen races into the main office, grabs the phone from the 
           RECEPTIONIST.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tab? Everything okay?

                                 BILL THOMPSON (O.S.)
                        Steve! It’s Bill Thompson.

           Stephen takes a deep breath.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Bill! What a surprise.

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        You’re a hard man to get a hold of. 
                        I’ve been calling for days!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah, we’re having some problems 
                        with the phone at home.
                            (beat)
                        Is everything okay?

                                 BILL THOMPSON
                        Are you sitting down?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Uh... do I need to?

           INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - EVENING

           Stephen sits nervously at the kitchen table. There’s a BOX in 
           front of him. The headlights of the Buick swing into the 
           driveway.

           Stephen straightens in his chair. He’s chomping at the bit. 
           Seconds later, the front door opens. Tabitha hurries in with 
           the kids.
                                 TABITHA
                        Christ on his throne, it’s freezing 
                        out there.

           She hands baby Joe to Stephen, starts taking off Naomi’s 
           winter coat. Stephen picks up the box off the table; hands it 
           to Tabitha. She looks at it quizzically.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 STEPHEN
                        A gift.

                                 TABITHA
                        We can’t afford gifts.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Open it.

           Tabitha opens the gift. It’s a HAIR DRYER.

                                 TABITHA
                        Oh Steve. You really shouldn’t 
                        have. This is too much.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re the best damn mother there 
                        ever was, and the best damn wife.

           Tabitha becomes alarmed at Stephen’s sudden show of emotion.

                                 TABITHA
                        Stephen? What is it? What’s wrong?

           Stephen hesitates before answering; draws out the moment.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I sold “Carrie.”

           A triumphant smile breaks out on Tabby’s face.

                                 TABITHA
                        You did???

           Stephen nods, grinning from ear to ear.

                                 TABITHA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God! That’s wonderful!
                            (off hair dryer)
                        Still, you shouldn’t have spent so 
                        much--
                                 STEPHEN
                        Tab-- it sold for four hundred 
                        thousand dollars.

           Tabby drops the hair dryer. It SMASHES on the ground into 
           tiny pieces.

                                 TABITHA
                        WHAT??

                                 STEPHEN
                        We did it, Tabby. You and me. We 
                        really did it. It’s over.

           Tabitha looks around at the tiny trailer, looks down at her 
           kids, looks at her husband. Stephen takes her in his arms, 
           the two of them crying and laughing.

           They’ve been through so much together: poverty, heartache, 
           and failure.

           And now they’ll be together in success.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW - EVENING

           GRAPHIC: FIVE YEARS LATER

           Stephen sits on the sofa next to Johnny Carson. The crowd 
           APPLAUDS WILDLY for him. Stephen smiles and waves.

                                 JOHNNY CARSON
                        You’re the scariest guy in America, 
                        and they still love you!

           LAUGHTER from the crowd as the applause politely dies down.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What can I say? In all honesty I 
                        actually have the heart of a small 
                        boy. I keep it in a jar on my desk.

           LAUGHS all round.

                                 JOHNNY CARSON
                        So Stephen-- your first book, 
                        ‘Carrie’, made you a household 
                        name. Your latest book, ‘The 
                        Stand’, is about a very bad man 
                        named Randall Flagg who tries to 
                        take over the world after the 
                        apocalypse.
                                 STEPHEN
                        It is, Johnny. It’s about the 
                        struggle between good and evil, 
                        between men and monsters...

                                 JOHNNY CARSON
                        Do you believe in monsters?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I do, but not in the traditional 
                        sense. I don’t think there’s a 
                        Boogeyman hiding in your closet or 
                        under the bed. But monsters are
                        real. They are the dark sides of 
                        who we are. They live inside us, 
                        and sometimes they win.
                            (beat)
                        Sometimes.

                                 JOHNNY CARSON
                        And your wife Tabitha is also a 
                        talented author.

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s right. She has a new book 
                        coming out as well.

                                 JOHNNY CARSON
                        You must be very proud of her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You have no idea. She’s definitely 
                        my better half... in every way.

           INT. GREEN ROOM - LATER 

           Stephen strolls into the green room and is greeted by Tabitha 
           and the family. NAOMI (7) and JOE (5) run towards their 
           father.

                          NAOMI
                                                          JOE
           Dadddyyy!!!
                                             Daaaad!

           They LEAP into his arms. He embraces them affectionately.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey gang!

           Tabitha walks over. In her arms is another baby, OWEN.

                                 TABITHA
                        Hey, tiger.
           Stephen and Tabitha kiss. The kids giggle and make “yucky” 
           sounds.

                                 STEPHEN
                        How’s my baby boy?

                                 TABITHA
                        Doin’ good. Teethin’ a little.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey, Owen -- what do you think 
                        about all this showbiz stuff, 
                        buddy?

                                 TABITHA
                        I think he’s pretty proud of his 
                        Dad.

           Stephen and Tabitha exchange a knowing smile.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Let’s go home. New York ain’t my 
                        scene.

           EXT. THE TONIGHT SHOW STUDIOS - EVENING

           Stephen exits to the CHEERS of his waiting fans. He gets down 
           to the business of signing autographs. 

           He spots a familiar figure amongst the sea of faces. It’s 
           R.F. Stephen nods in his direction, acknowledging his 
           presence. R.F. stares back menacingly. 

           Stephen’s the one in control now. He was right: he doesn’t 
           need R.F. He can do this on his own.

           The crowd cheers LOUDER and LOUDER. They call his name. 
           Stephen smiles as we...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           “He is two men - he has ALWAYS been two men. That’s what any 
           man or woman who makes believe for a living must be. The one 
           who exists in the normal world... and the one who creates 
           worlds. They are two. Always at least two.”
