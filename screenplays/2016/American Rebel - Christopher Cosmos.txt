                       The following is based on a true story. 
           THICK SMOKE.

           Clouds of it, swirling and twisting as it rises, drifting in 
           the wind.  

           And then THUNDER.

           The earth shaking beneath our feet.  Cannon shots.  Staccato 
           GUNFIRE.

           Followed by screams.  Death rattles.  Battle cries.  The 
           sounds of men piercing the sky.

           OPEN ON:

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD -- NORTH CAROLINA -- AFTERNOON

           Red-coated British on one side, blue-coated Continentals 
           across from them, a haze of smoke and fire rising between 
           armies.

           SUPER: Greensboro, North Carolina -- March 15th, 1781.

           The British have the high ground, they outnumber the 
           Continentals two-to-one, and they’re winning.

           They pummel their enemy with heavy artillery.  Followed by 
           musket volleys.  More smoke rising as we go across the field 
           and behind--

           THE CONTINENTAL LINES.

           Where there’s a hastily built and very shallow trench, dead 
           bodies scattered between the feet of troops still alive and 
           fighting. 

           And in the mass of men, we find the scared eyes of a young 
           soldier holding a musket and seeing his first real action of 
           the war, this is:

           WILLIAM JAFFERS (20s): blue eyes hidden behind a layer of 
           dirt, breathing heavily, bare-knuckling his rifle, as he 
           raises it and fires into the distance along with the rest of 
           the men.

           ... BANG!!!

           There’s screams from the British, then he quickly ducks as 
           musket balls whizz, whizz, whizz past his head; soldiers all 
           around him are hit, bullets thumping into flesh, bodies 
           falling to mud.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB (O.S.)
                        SECOND VOLLEY, READY!!
           William glances into the distance at CAPTAIN JAMES WEBB (42); 
           regiment commander, sword held high in the sky, through the 
           billowing smoke. 

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        AIM!!

           Then William drops his musket and grabs a fresh one from the 
           ground, next to a soldier that fell before he got his shot 
           off.

           He tries to aim through the smoke, along with the rest of the 
           Continentals still on their feet, as they wait for the next 
           order, then--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        FIRE!!!

           The Captain brings his sword down as William fires and 
           another CONTINENTAL VOLLEY explodes across the battlefield.

           ... BANG, BANG, BANG!!!

           More screams from the British, then returning MUSKET FIRE 
           whizzing past, and more Continental soldiers falling, dead in 
           the mud.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        RELOAD!!!

           William still hasn’t been hit, and he turns and dives for 
           cover into-- 

           THE SHALLOW TRENCH.

           Where he grabs both muskets, trying to re-load as quickly as 
           possible, working with shaking fingers, then pauses when he 
           hears something in the distance.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Did you hear that?

           He turns to the young men who dove next to him, also re-
           loading their rifles, this is ANDREW THOMAS (17) and JAMES 
           THOMAS (15), brothers. 

           The noise gets louder, closer, the ground under them begins 
           to shake.

           They wait for a moment longer, then with worried and scared 
           eyes, slowly peer over the trench to see: 

           Swirling smoke on the battlefield, and all’s peaceful for 
           another moment, until--
           THROUGH THE SMOKE: 

           A fearsome cavalry charge of screaming HESSIAN MERCENARIES 
           emerges, galloping straight towards them, letting out their 
           fierce and foreign battle cries.

           It’s a terrifying sight, and William’s breath catches in his 
           throat, as he whispers--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hessians...

           The very word inspires fear as all the Continentals raise 
           their muskets and quickly take aim as they wait, the Hessian 
           cavalry not yet in range.

           William sees the look in Andrew and James’ eyes, and their 
           shaking hands holding their muskets -- they’re all just kids, 
           about to go toe-to-toe with professional soldiers, and they 
           need hope.

           He shakes Andrew’s shoulder.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hey, we’re Massachusetts boys, 
                        right?  So let’s show these German 
                        bastards just what that means.

           Andrew and James look back at him, and then all three nod 
           resolutely, as Andrew says:

                                 ANDREW
                        Don’t tread on me.

           William responds:

                                 WILLIAM
                        Don’t tread on me.

           And James, too:

                                 JAMES
                        Don’t tread on me.

           And then all the other soldiers around them hear, and take up 
           the refrain, too -- “Don’t tread on me, don’t tread on me, 
           don’t tread on me.” 

           Then they rise as one, from the trench, defiance still fresh 
           on their lips as they take aim at their charging enemy...

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        GET READY, MEN... FIND YOUR 
                        MARKS...
           Captain Webb waits another moment, as the Hessians keep 
           riding towards them, then once they’re in range turns to his 
           men and yells--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        FIRE AT WILL!!!

           ... BANG, BANG, BANG!

           And as the Continental muskets explode in smoke and a loud 
           volley of bullets--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A LOW HILL.

           Where the Commanders of the Continental Army watch the battle 
           as it unfolds.

           MAJOR GENERAL NATHANAEL GREENE (42) looks through a spyglass, 
           sees the charging Hessians, and the volley fired at them by 
           his army.

           Some of the Hessians fall, shot from their horses, but not 
           enough.

                                 LT. PAINE (O.S.)
                        What are your orders, General 
                        Greene?

           General Greene folds the spyglass back, then turns to 
           LIEUTENANT JOHN PAINE (30s) standing next to him, waiting for 
           his command.

           The General hesitates, hates giving this order, but knows 
           that he has to--

                                 GENERAL GREENE
                        There’s too many of them.  Too many 
                        of these brutal and godless savages 
                        with no nation...
                             (then; the words painful 
                              for him)
                        Give Captain Webb the order for 
                        retreat - save as many of ours as 
                        we can, and we’ll fight them 
                        another day.

                                 LT. PAINE
                        Sir...

           Lieutenant Paine salutes, then climbs onto his horse, kicks 
           to a gallop riding towards--

                                                                CUT TO:
           THE BATTLEFIELD.

           Where we track with Lieutenant Paine as he makes his ride, 
           men fighting all around him -- shooting, bleeding, dying -- 
           mortar shells from the distance EXPLODING large craters in 
           the earth.

           He sees a BRITISH SOLDIER take aim at him, from across the 
           battle -- he quickly raises his own PISTOL, takes a split 
           second to aim, and--

           ... BANG!

           A perfect shot from horseback, and Paine’s bullet explodes 
           directly through the soldier’s skull.

           And he keeps riding, heading towards--

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE CONTINENTAL LINES.

           And the shallow trench where CAPTAIN WEBB’s with his soldiers 
           as they frantically reload their muskets as quickly as 
           possible, jamming powder and bullets down into the long 
           barrels.

           The Hessians are bearing down on their position, fighting 
           their way through the battlefield, and most of the Americans 
           have reloaded, as Webb yells again--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        ... FIRE AT WILL!!!

           Another EXPLOSION of gunfire from William and the soldiers 
           that have reloaded in time, and more Hessians fall, but 
           there’s still so many. 

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        SWORDS!!!  BAYONETS!!!!

           William breathes heavy as he wields a bayonet on the end of 
           his musket; next to him Andrew and James do the same, waiting 
           for their enemy, as:

           The Hessians get closer, closer, closer, almost to them, the 
           Continentals brace themselves, then--

           ... CRACK!!!

           The Hessian charge CRASHES INTO THE CONTINENTALS, bringing 
           blood and death, professional soldiers cutting down the sons 
           of farmers.

           And as chaos, dirt, and blood consumes everything, we follow 
           close with--
           WILLIAM.

           As he thrusts his bayonet up at a HESSIAN on horseback, but 
           the blow’s parried and he’s slammed to the ground by a 
           CHARGING HORSE.

           He stands again, completely covered in mud, a gash above his 
           eye, looks above him, as--

           ... SLASH!!!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ahhhhhh!!!

           A sword slices across his shoulder and he falls to the ground 
           again -- blood spilling from the wound -- tries to struggle 
           to his feet, as--

           ACROSS THE BATTLEFIELD.

           Paine finishes his ride, and gets to the thick of the 
           fighting, uses a sword to cut his way to where Captain Webb 
           fights with his men.

                                 LT. PAINE
                        ... Captain Webb!!

           Webb turns to see him--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Do you have reinforcements?

                                 LT. PAINE
                        Orders from General Greene, 
                        Captain.
                             (a beat; their eyes 
                              meeting)
                        Retreat...

           A heavy moment, as they both process what that means, the 
           disappointment, then--

           ... BANG!!!

           A bullet TEARS through Paine’s chest in an explosion of blood 
           and flesh, and he falls from his horse, dead before he hits 
           the ground.

           Captain Webb runs to him, but sees the wound, and there’s 
           nothing he can do -- Paine’s already gone -- so he turns back 
           to his men, and yells--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        RETREAT!!!
           A TRUMPETEER takes up the cry -- sounding his horn -- as 
           Captain Webb climbs onto Paine’s horse, gets a higher vantage 
           to see--

           In the distance, there’s a river to the north that creates a 
           natural barrier.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        THE RIVER!!  TO THE NORTH!!  ALL 
                        CONTINENTALS NORTH TO THE RIVER!!

           Webb starts to fight his way through the Hessians, and the 
           British Regulars now too, leading his men towards the river 
           in the distance, as we go--

                                                               BACK TO:

           THE MASS OF BODIES.

           Where William’s climbing back to his feet from being face-
           down in the mud, and he hears the cry around him, and in the 
           distance--

           “Retreat, retreat, retreat,” and “North, to the river, 
           Continentals to the river!”

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        ... William!!!

           He looks over to see Andrew and his brother James fight their 
           way to him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We have to get to the river!

           They all nod, and turn north together, about to start their 
           retreat, just as--

           ... BANG!!!

           A bullet EXPLODES Andrew’s head inches from William -- bits 
           of blood and brain splatter across their uniforms as Andrew’s 
           body collapses, broken.

                                 JAMES
                        NO!!!

           James tries to pick his brother up -- but he’s beyond dead -- 
           half his face gone.

           William grabs James, soldiers running all around them now, 
           and more artillery explosions, coming from the distance, 
           getting closer--

                                 WILLIAM
                        C’mon, James - we have to go!
                                 JAMES
                        He’s my brother!

                                 WILLIAM
                        He’d want you to live!  What else 
                        did he die for?  We have to get to 
                        the river!

           An excruciating moment, as James looks down at his brother’s 
           body, then lets him go, tears in their eyes as they turn and 
           start running, when--

           A HESSIAN APPEARS.

           Sitting high on his horse, above them, his sword drawn, 
           polished steel glinting bright against the sun, as he swings 
           down, and--

           ... SLASH!!!

           In a split second, he rips it through James’ chest, opening 
           him completely from shoulder to hip-- 

                                 WILLIAM
                        JAMES!!!

           And as James falls, the Hessian turns to William, raises his 
           sword, and William freezes -- no bullets left, nothing for 
           him to do but watch wide-eyed with terror, and accept that 
           this is his end.

           Then just as the Hessian’s about to strike--

           ... BANG!!!

           A bullet buries into his stomach, and he falls, clutching at 
           it, as William turns to see--

           CAPTAIN WEBB.

           Holding a smoking pistol, on his horse in the distance, then 
           he turns away, back towards the battle, yelling to keep 
           rallying his men--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        TO THE RIVER!!  ALL CONTINENTALS TO 
                        THE RIVER!!!

           William turns to James, bleeding on the ground next to him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        James...

           James opens his mouth to try to speak, but no words come, and 
           he COUGHS blood.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Don’t... don’t say anything...

           Then James weakly reaches inside his uniform, takes out a 
           folded piece of paper that’s smeared with blood, and hands it 
           to William.

           He takes it, looks at it in his hands, then tucks it away in 
           a pocket.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ll bring it to them - I give you 
                        my word.

           And by the time he looks back at his friend, James is already 
           gone, blank eyes staring up at the sky above them.

           William painfully stands, and he looks around -- there’s 
           soldiers running past, towards the river -- then he sees the 
           dead Hessian, and the sword at his side. 

           He picks up the sword, then falls in with the rest of the 
           defeated CONTINENTAL ARMY retreating towards the river.

           And as he runs, he sees another Hessian standing over a 
           fallen Continental, and William stabs -- SHHHFFFT!!! -- and 
           runs the Hessian through from behind.

           The Hessian falls, as William rips the sword back out, stares 
           down at the first man he’s killed in such close quarters, and 
           then the soldier he saved.

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        Thank you.

           William’s grabs the soldier’s hand, pulls him to his feet, 
           tells him--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hurry.  We need to get to the 
                        river.

           And they run together, catching up with the retreat, heading 
           towards--

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE DAN RIVER.

           Where CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS splash to the north bank, and 
           there’s more on that side that fire at the pursuing BRITISH 
           and HESSIANS.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        HOLD THE RIVER!!  GIVE THE REST 
                        TIME TO CROSS!!
           The Continentals have the advantage now, and hold their enemy 
           from crossing as the last of their own make their way safely 
           ashore.

           And then, when all the Continentals have crossed and start to 
           head further north, into Virginia, the British stop and don’t 
           follow them.

           William looks back and sees this, then continues north with 
           the rest of the men, battered and bloody but not yet 
           beaten...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE BATTLEFIELD.

           And the sharp eyes of LORD CHARLES CORNWALLIS (43), the 
           leader of British forces in America, as he surveys the 
           battlefield in front of him.

           Bodies are littered everywhere as far as the eye sees, and 
           while his forces won the day, there are more British bodies 
           on the ground than American.

                                 GENERAL O’HARA (O.S.)
                        A great victory, my lord.

           Cornwallis turns to see GENERAL O’HARA next to him -- then 
           his eyes flick back to the dead.

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        The Continentals fought fiercely - 
                        more bravely than I’d expected, or 
                        given them credit for.
                             (then; softer)
                        I thought they would break 
                        sooner...

                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        They’re farmers, and the sons of 
                        farmers - they had twice our 
                        numbers, and you still won the day.  

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        Look around, General.  They may be 
                        farmers and their sons, but any 
                        more “victories” such as this one 
                        and it’ll be the end of the British 
                        Army in America.
                             (then)
                        The moment in which this war will 
                        be decided is coming - and we need 
                        to be better.

           And as Cornwallis begins to walk away, we stay on the 
           battlefield, with the bodies.
           We drift over them, and see the faces, all of them too young, 
           too innocent, and then a voice softly on the wind, a 
           whispered prayer.

                                 DEBORAH (V.O.)
                        Our father, who art in heaven, 
                        hallowed be thy name...

           And as we PULL BACK, the battlefield in its entirety starts 
           to come into view, and the bodies become smaller and smaller 
           as we rise.

                                 DEBORAH (V.O.)
                        Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, 
                        on Earth as it is in heaven...

           There’s thousands of them, soldiers lost and forgotten, and 
           then, among the bodies, a soiled CONTINENTAL FLAG, trampled 
           in the mud...

                                 DEBORAH (V.O.)
                        And please forgive us our 
                        trespasses, as we forgive those who 
                        trespass against us, and deliver us 
                        from evil...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MIRROR.

           And strong sapphire eyes with a deep fire behind them staring 
           back at us, a YOUNG WOMAN holding a cross in her hand as she 
           finishes the Lord’s Prayer.

                                 DEBORAH
                        ... forever and forever.  Amen.

           And then she kisses the cross, attached to a chain around her 
           neck, and as she tucks it back under her dress, we get our 
           first glimpse of--

           DEBORAH SAMPSON (20s): the woman with the fire in her eyes, 
           high and proud cheek bones, angular jaw and face, and she’s 
           tall, standing 5’7’ during a time in history when the average 
           height for a woman was barely five feet.

           Her dress is plain and simple, made from brown cloth with a 
           white collar.

           She’s a house servant.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DINING ROOM -- THOMAS HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

           BENJAMIN THOMAS (40s) sits at the head of his table, his wife 
           LYDIA to his right, their four sons (ages 11-2) fill the rest 
           of the places.

           Deborah goes to each setting, serving dinner as the family 
           talks.

           SUPER: Middleborough, Massachusetts -- April 4th, 1781.

           One of the boys motions to her that he wants less vegetables, 
           and with a wink she halves his portion, so his parents don’t 
           see, and he smiles.

           Then, a KNOCK.

           The boys’ eyes light up, and so do Deborah’s, knowing what 
           this could mean.

                                 BENJAMIN THOMAS
                        Deborah, would you see who’s at the 
                        door, please?

           Deborah’s finished plating the food, and sets the serving 
           dishes aside with a small smile, as she wipes her hands and 
           goes to--

           THE HALLWAY.

           Where she walks to the door and opens it to find a 
           CONTINENTAL SOLDIER on the threshold; blue waist coat, white 
           vest and polished buttons sewn into red trim, and a Hessian 
           sword hanging at his hip.

           William’s clean-shaven now, his hair freshly combed, the mud 
           washed off his face.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ma’am.  
                             (bows; takes his hat   
                              off)
                        Are you Mrs. Thomas?

                                 DEBORAH
                        No, I’m... I run the household 
                        here.

           Behind them, Benjamin appears in the hallway, holding his 
           napkin.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Who is it?
                                 WILLIAM
                        My name is Private William Jaffers, 
                        sir.  

           When Benjamin sees William, he reaches out to touch the wall, 
           to steady himself, because he knows what an unfamiliar 
           soldier on his doorstep means.

           And it’s more than he can bear.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM -- THOMAS HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Deborah kneels beside her bed, her cross out again as she 
           prays.

           Beneath her, in the kitchen, she can hear the muffled sobs of 
           Lydia Thomas grieving her lost sons, a sound that chills to 
           the bone.

           Deborah finishes, and climbs into bed; waits for another 
           moment, sadness in her eyes, then blows the candle out and 
           the room goes dark.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN -- THOMAS HOUSE -- DAWN

           The sun’s not yet up as Deborah walks into the kitchen, 
           dressed in her servants uniform, and puts a pot of water on 
           to boil.

           She ties an apron around her waist, starts to take 
           ingredients from a cupboard to make oatmeal, her morning 
           chores, when--

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        You don’t need to make breakfast 
                        today - I don’t think anyone’s 
                        going to have much appetite.

           Deborah turns to see Benjamin sitting in shadows, a glass of 
           whiskey in front of him, James’ note with blood still smeared 
           across it next to the glass.

           A moment, then--

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I am, too.
           Deborah doesn’t know what else to say, and there’s silence 
           until she finally manages to get out what she’s dreaded 
           asking.

                                 DEBORAH
                             (softly)
                        Both of them?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        At the same battle.

           Another moment, then Benjamin reaches out, takes another 
           glass and pours a whiskey for Deborah.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        For Andrew and James.  Rebels, and 
                        Massachusetts boys, to the very 
                        end.

           She hesitates.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Go on.  It’s alright.

           She picks up the glass, meets his eyes, then nods.

                                 DEBORAH
                        For Andrew and James.

           And then they both drain the whiskey, and set the glasses 
           down, and he stays staring at them, shaking his head.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It was my fault.  There was too 
                        much talk of patriotism and 
                        revolution in this house, too many 
                        ideals being thrown about between 
                        these walls.  
                             (then; softer)
                        I didn’t fire the bullets, but in 
                        the end it was still their father 
                        that killed them, all the same.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Sir...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        You’re excused from work today.

           He stands and walks to the doorway, then pauses for a moment 
           and turns back -- he’s been drinking, but his thoughts are 
           still lucid.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Life’s precious, Deborah.  And what 
                        we do with our lives matters.
                                 DEBORAH
                        It’s not your fault, Mr. Thomas.  
                        You should be proud of them, and 
                        what they did.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I am.  More proud than you could 
                        possibly imagine.  
                             (beat)
                        And that’s what makes it so 
                        difficult.

           And then, with one more look, he turns and leaves, and 
           Deborah’s alone.

           Everything’s silent for a moment, as she weighs an important 
           decision, something that’s been on her mind for a long time.

           Then she takes off her apron, puts it away, and walks 
           outside.

                                 RECRUITER (PRE-LAP)
                        THE TIME TO ENLIST IS NOW!!!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET -- MIDDLEBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS -- MORNING

           A bustling Colonial town that’s been recently freed from 
           British rule.

           Deborah walks down the street, and she looks quite different; 
           her hair’s pulled tight under a cap, which makes it look 
           short, like a boy’s, and she’s wearing modified breeches.

                                 RECRUITER (O.S.)
                        You may have heard that the battle 
                        at Guilford Court House was a 
                        defeat, and while it’s true we 
                        didn’t win the day, we took 
                        hundreds of the Redcoat bastards 
                        with us, and that’s why we need 
                        your service!!

           Deborah pushes her way through a crowd to see a CONTINENTAL 
           RECRUITER standing on an APPLE CRATE, delivering his speech 
           to the gathered young men.

                                 RECRUITER
                        We’re on the verge of turning the 
                        tide of this war, and we need more 
                        men!!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RECRUITER (CONT'D)
                        Lord Cornwallis himself was even 
                        heard to have said after the battle 
                        that if the British have many more 
                        “victories” such as this one, then 
                        this country will soon be called 
                        America indeed!!!

           The crowd lets up a CHEER, and Deborah glances at the men, 
           nobody’s looking at her twice.

                                 RECRUITER
                        Every man that volunteers will 
                        receive food, board, and a pension 
                        after the war’s over.  And more 
                        importantly... you’ll be able to 
                        live the rest of your lives knowing 
                        that you took up arms in the name 
                        of freedom, and for the defense of 
                        a country that one day we’ll be 
                        able to call our own.  

           He GLARES out at them.

                                 RECRUITER
                        SO ARE YOU WITH ME???  ARE THERE 
                        ANY PATRIOTS IN THE GREAT STATE OF 
                        MASSACHUSETTS???

           There’s thunderous APPLAUSE as the Recruiter steps down, and 
           the young men rush forward to the table he has set up, eager 
           to do their part.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           THE RECRUITMENT TABLE.

           Deborah waits in the line of young men until very soon it’s 
           her turn, and she walks forward, stands in front of the 
           Recruiter.

                                 RECRUITER
                        Name and age?

                                 DEBORAH
                        John.  21.

                                 RECRUITER
                        Surname?

           She hesitates a moment, then--

                                 DEBORAH
                        ... Smith.

           The Recruiter pauses at that, looks up, raising an eyebrow.
                                 RECRUITER
                        And what’s next... you’re gonna 
                        tell me I’m Pocahontas?

           Deborah swallows, she panicked and said the most common name 
           she could think of, and didn’t sell it well.

           Then the Recruiter squints at her, looking closer, a strand 
           of hair peeking from under her cap.

                                 RECRUITER
                        What’s this?

           He reaches to touch the strand, but she shoves his hand away.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Is it a crime to have long hair 
                        now?

                                 RECRUITER
                        We don’t care the length of your 
                        hair as long as you can fire a 
                        musket.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Then it sounds like I’ve come to 
                        the right place.

           He waits for a moment, studying her face... does he realize 
           what she’s hiding?

           Then he goes back to his ledger, starts to write her name.

                                 RECRUITER
                        John... Smith... twenty-one...

                                 YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
                        ... Deborah?

           She turns on instinct when she hears her name, and there’s a 
           YOUNG MAN behind them.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Deborah Sampson, is that you?  What 
                        are you doing here?

           The Recruiter looks up, glances at the Young Man, then back 
           to Deborah.

           He narrows his eyes.

                                 RECRUITER
                        Take your hat off...

           Deborah freezes -- knows she’s been caught -- then turns and 
           runs.
                                 RECRUITER
                        AFTER HER!!  It’s a woman dressed 
                        as a man!!

           And as the Recruiter shouts the order, three CONTINENTAL 
           SOLDIERS run down the street in pursuit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE STREETS (MIDDLEBOROUGH).

           Deborah’s a strong runner, she has lengthy strides from her 
           long legs, and she’s crafty, knows this city well.

           She runs through a mass of people, zig-zagging, taking sharp 
           corners down back streets and through shops until she loses 
           the soldiers.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY -- THOMAS HOUSE -- MORNING

           Deborah runs back inside, locks the front door behind her, 
           out of breath.

           She peaks out the window, sees everything quiet on the street 
           then quickly hurries upstairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM -- THOMAS HOUSE -- MORNING

           Deborah slowly pushes the door to an empty bedroom open with 
           a long creeeeak, and quietly walks in.

           She crosses to a dusty trunk and opens it, looks at the 
           clothes inside, about to reach down and take some of them 
           out, when--

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        What are you doing in here?

           Deborah quickly turns to see Benjamin standing in the 
           doorway, his eyes red from grief and whiskey.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Thomas.

           Benjamin comes forward and looks down into the trunk, sees 
           the clothing there that once belonged to his dead sons.

           Then he looks up, taking in the way that she’s tried to 
           dress, and he understands.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        For how long?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Since I can remember.

           A moment between them, as Benjamin searches her eyes, looking 
           for truth.

           Then, KNOCK!

           Someone vigorously banging on the front door to the house, 
           below them.

           Benjamin hears, and knows what it must be, and turns back to 
           Deborah, one more question.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Why?

           She hesitates for a moment, then meets his eyes, her own 
           strong and true.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Because what we do with our lives 
                        matters, right?  So why can I not 
                        fight for my country, too?  

           He hears his own words spoken back to him, the logic of what 
           she’s saying, and what she feels, and after a moment he nods.

           Then he takes a pair of well-made breeches from the trunk, 
           two finely sewn shirts, and a cap, and hands them all to her.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Use the back door, and get out of 
                        Middleborough.  In small towns, 
                        everyone knows who we are - go to 
                        the city, and you can be whoever 
                        you like.  

                                 DEBORAH
                        Thank you.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Kill two of them for me, alright?  
                        One for James, and the other for 
                        Andrew.

           And she nods, as he turns and leaves, Deborah following him 
           back down the stairs.

                                                                CUT TO:
           THE HALLWAY (THOMAS HOUSE).

           Where Deborah splits off from Benjamin and goes towards the 
           kitchen while he walks to the front door where there’s still 
           vigorous pounding from the other side.  

           They pause and share one last look down the hallway -- one 
           last nod -- then when she turns and is out of sight, he opens 
           the door.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What is it?

           On the other side: the three CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS sent to 
           chase Deborah.

                                 SOLDIER
                        We’re looking for your house 
                        servant, sir.  

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Why?

                                 SOLDIER
                        She’s been caught doing 
                        something... undecent.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Well, she’s not here.  I gave her 
                        the day off.

           They look back at him, a bit incredulous, and he opens the 
           door wider.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        You’re welcome to come in and take 
                        a look for yourselves, if you’d 
                        like - her room’s up the stairs and 
                        to the right.

           And as the soldiers come into the house, going up the stairs, 
           looking for Deborah--

                                                                CUT TO:

           POURING RAIN (NIGHT).

           And Deborah rides through the storm, her long hair damp on 
           her face and shoulders, clothes completely soaked through.

           There’s a LIGHT in the distance, coming from a window, and 
           then a sign for THE ADMIRAL INN.

           She rides towards it.
                                 DEBORAH (PRE-LAP)
                             (softly)
                        I run to you, my Lord, for 
                        protection...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM -- THE ADMIRAL INN -- NIGHT

           Deborah stands in front of a dirty mirror, wet hair falling 
           past her shoulders as she wraps a long piece of white linen 
           around her chest, wincing as she binds her breasts flat.

                                 DEBORAH
                        ... and to be my rock, my mighty 
                        rock, and my fortress...

           Then she raises a pair of scissors and begins to cut her hair 
           short, close to the scalp, like a boy’s, long strands falling 
           at her feet.

                                 DEBORAH
                        ... and I ask for your strength to 
                        now be my strength...

           And as she continues to work, cutting closer, continuing her 
           prayer... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BOSTON -- ESTABLISHING

           Smoke rises from chimneys above a city nestled against the 
           infamous harbor on one side and bustling, narrow streets on 
           the other.

           SUPER: Boston, Massachusetts -- April 7th, 1781.

           Move closer to the city, feel the energy emanating from it, 
           and see it in the people’s eyes, these streets that gave the 
           spark of revolution.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREETS -- BOSTON -- DAY

           Deborah walks through the city, her short hair covered 
           beneath the cap that Benjamin gave her, and she’s wearing the 
           breaches and shirt, too, so she looks like a young man.

           She passes a grocer on one side, and then a baker, and 
           finally comes to--

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GUN STORE -- BOSTON -- DAY

           Deborah walks in to see a room filled with all sorts of 
           firearms mounted on the walls; muskets, pistols, everything 
           in between. 

           There’s a PROPRIETOR behind the desk, who stands when she 
           enters, and one other customer.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        How can I help you, sir?

           She pauses, notes the use of the word ‘sir’, and it gives her 
           confidence.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m looking to buy a musket.  

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        And for what, might I ask?  There’s 
                        different firearms for different 
                        purposes.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m enlisting today.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                             (smiles)
                        Understood.  We’ve got plenty of 
                        muskets that are good for killing 
                        Redcoats.

           The Proprietor turns to survey his inventory as Deborah 
           watches, then the other Customer speaks up, behind them.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        They give you one when you enlist, 
                        you know.  A musket, that is.

           Deborah turns to look at the man: he’s average height, 
           carrying a bit of extra weight in the stomach that also gives 
           him a thick neck and broad shoulders; in 1781 he was 46 years 
           old, and his name is Paul.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I suppose I wanted to look the part 
                        when I showed up.

                                 PAUL
                        There’s looking the part, and then 
                        there’s being the part. 
                             (points to the wall)
                        Might I suggest a Screw-Barrel 
                        Flintlock?

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        Excellent suggestion.
           The Proprietor places the PISTOL in front of them.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s an English gun, but don’t let 
                        the manufacturing deter you.  
                        Muskets take a long time to reload, 
                        and you never know when you might 
                        need an extra bullet.

           She looks at Paul, then back to the Proprietor, and nods.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’ll take it.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        Very good.  And thank you for your 
                        service.

           She starts to count out her money, then takes the pistol, as 
           behind her Paul leaves.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE STREETS (BOSTON).

           Where Deborah jogs a few paces to catch up with where Paul 
           walks through the people.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Thank you.  For the recommendation.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s the least I can do.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Are you a soldier?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m a dentist.

                                 DEBORAH
                        How does a dentist know so much 
                        about guns?  And war, too, I 
                        suppose.

           He pauses, turns to her, a small smile pursed on his lips.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m from Boston, young sir.  This 
                        revolution was born in these 
                        streets.  

           And then with a tip of his cap, he continues on his way, 
           disappearing back among the people. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. STREETS -- BOSTON -- MORNING

           Deborah stands in another recruitment line filled with young 
           men, she’s still dressed as a boy, and has her new PISTOL 
           tucked in her belt at her waist.

           She waits her turn.  There’s an OFFICER behind a desk, 
           similar to how it was set up in Middleborough, filling out 
           paperwork. 

           She looks behind the Officer to see a large poster with a 
           picture of a snake, and the initials of all the colonies, 
           with a caption beneath: 

           “JOIN OR DIE.”

                                 OFFICER
                        Next!

           It’s her turn, and she stands in front of the Officer.

                                 OFFICER
                        Name and age?

           She doesn’t hesitate this time.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Robert Shurtleff.  21.

           He looks up at her.  Takes in her appearance.  The clothing.  
           The pistol at her hip.

                                 OFFICER
                        Can you read, Mr. Shurtleff?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I can.

                                 OFFICER
                        Then raise your right hand and 
                        repeat these words.

           He hands her a sheet, and she looks down at it, then reads 
           the oath--

                                 DEBORAH
                        I, Robert Shurtleff, have this day 
                        voluntarily enlisted myself as a 
                        soldier in the American Continental 
                        Army, for one year, unless sooner 
                        discharged: and I do bind myself to 
                        conform, in all instances, to such 
                        rules and regulations as are, or 
                        shall be, established for the 
                        government of this army.  
                             (beat)
                        So help me God.
                                 OFFICER
                        Good.  Now sign here.

           The Officer points to the bottom and Deborah signs, then he 
           takes her regiment assignment and hands it to her.

                                 OFFICER
                        Congratulations, Mr. Shurtleff, and 
                        welcome to the 4th Massachusetts 
                        Regiment of the Continental Army.  
                        Your Congress thanks you for your 
                        service.

           Deborah stands there for a moment, and the Officer looks past 
           her.

                                 OFFICER
                        Next!

           She comes back to reality, and quickly walks away, holding 
           the paper he gave her, and then when she’s far enough, lets 
           herself look down at it.

           And as she reads it, and the small smile starts to spread 
           across her face...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. AERIAL SHOT -- MILITARY CAMP -- MORNING

           Dawn breaks softly over a small encampment of Continental 
           Soldiers.

           SUPER: 4th Massachusetts Regiment, Springfield, MA -- May 
           13th, 1781.

           Tents stretch in neat rows across a field for as far as the 
           eye sees.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB (PRE-LAP)
                        READY!!!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FIELD -- MILITARY ENCAMPMENT -- MORNING

           All the NEW RECRUITS are assembled in a long line, pointing 
           their muskets towards straw targets shaped roughly as men in 
           the distance, and we find Deborah among them, dressed in the 
           same clothes.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        AIM!!!
           They all pick their marks as Captain Webb walks behind the 
           line, inspecting the formation and each of the soldiers.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        FIRE!!!

           CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. 

           Instead of explosions and musket balls, hammers click against 
           steel.

           The muskets aren’t loaded.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Ammunition is scarce for the entire 
                        army, and it has been for some time 
                        now.

           Captain Webb comes around to stand in front of the new 
           recruits.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        That means the first bullets you 
                        fire will be on the battlefield, 
                        but the only thing that you need to 
                        remember is exactly what I just 
                        told you.
                             (beat)
                        Ready, aim, fire.
                             (then)
                        Do you understand?

           They answer as one.

                                 RECRUITS
                        YES, SIR!

           He paces in front of them, making eye contact, speaking 
           softer now.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Stand close to the man next to you.  
                        Watch over him as you’d want to be 
                        watched over, and don’t be afraid 
                        if he falls.  The British are the 
                        greatest military force ever 
                        assembled, so some of you standing 
                        here today will indeed fall, but 
                        we’re going to win this war, 
                        because this is America, and this 
                        is our country, and we’re going to 
                        defend it with everything that we 
                        have in us. 
                             (meets their eyes)
                        That’s why you’re here, isn’t it?
           Close on: Deborah’s eyes, which tells us that’s exactly why 
           she’s here.

                                 RECRUITS
                        YES, SIR!

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Good.  Now head to your barracks 
                        and get outfitted with a uniform 
                        and job assignment.

           Captain Webb walks away, as the Recruits break ranks and we 
           follow with Deborah, as she goes with them towards--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRACKS -- MILITARY ENCAMPMENT -- MORNING

           Deborah stands in line with the other recruits until she’s in 
           front of an OFFICER.

                                 OFFICER
                        You’re tall.  Looks like a large to 
                        me.

           He tosses her a UNIFORM, and as she takes it, and looks down,  
           there’s reverence in her eyes as she touches the white vest 
           and blue coat, the polished buttons sewn into red trim.

                                 OFFICER
                        You’re going to be assigned cooking 
                        duty, so that means report to 
                        Messhall after you bunk up.

           And as she nods...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MILITARY ENCAMPMENT -- DAY

           Deborah walks back the way she came, through the long rows of 
           tents, then pauses, looking around, she took a wrong turn 
           somewhere.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        They only give you one, so take 
                        some advice and keep it as well as 
                        you can.

           Deborah turns to see William Jaffers sitting on a cut tree 
           stump, outside a tent that’s larger than the rest, needle and 
           thread in hand, his Hessian sword at his hip, as he tries to 
           mend a hole in his uniform.

           He looks closer at Deborah, sees her face, narrows his eyes.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Have I met you before?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I don’t think so.  It’s my first 
                        day.

           She turns and starts to walk away--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Wait.  You look familiar.  I’m sure 
                        of it.

           She pauses, slowly turns back as he studies her features, and 
           thinks quickly, nods to the uniform in his lap, trying to 
           distract.

                                 DEBORAH
                        You’re doing that wrong.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What?

                                 DEBORAH
                        You have to run the thread under 
                        the stitching.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Under it?  What do you mean?

           She hesitates, but with no other choice goes over and takes 
           the uniform and demonstrates, as he raises an eyebrow, 
           impressed at her skill.

           She starts to hand it back, then a voice from behind them--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB (O.S.)
                        Where’d you learn how to sew like 
                        that?

           Deborah turns to see Captain Webb and knows that she needs to 
           think quickly again.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Eight younger brothers, sir.  We 
                        had no parents to speak of, growing 
                        up, so I had to learn everything 
                        around the house.

           He stands there, and studies her face: her eyes, her chin, 
           then further down.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        What’s your name?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Robert Shurtleff, sir.
           Another moment, as the Captain takes her in, then he makes 
           his decision.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Come with me, Mr. Shurtleff.

           And he walks past her and into the large Captain’s tent, and 
           after a backwards glance at William, she has no choice but to 
           follow after him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Captain Webb’s tent is sparsely decorated; there’s a table, 
           two chairs, and a small cot, the same as his soldiers are 
           issued.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        This happened at the Court House, 
                        and I’m going to be seeing the 
                        General soon - do you think you can 
                        help me?

           She doesn’t understand, then he takes off his jacket and 
           shows her the sleeve where there’s a large tear running up to 
           the elbow. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        I can see what I can do.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Good.  Have it back to me by 
                        tomorrow.  Did they give you a job?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Yes, sir.  Cooking duty.  

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        I’m changing it.  You’re going to 
                        be my new aide-de-camp.  Do you 
                        have a bunk yet?

                                 DEBORAH
                        No.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Jaffers!

           As soon as the Captain yells, the flap to the tent opens and 
           William walks in.
                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Help Mr. Shurtleff here find a 
                        bunk, and make sure that it’s close 
                        to mine - he’s going to be my new 
                        aide-de-camp.

           William salutes, then leads Deborah out of the tent, carrying 
           the Captain’s jacket in her arms.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TENTS -- MILITARY ENCAMPMENT -- MORNING

           William and Deborah leave together and he shows her away from 
           the tent, through the organized rows.

                                 DEBORAH
                        What’s an aide-de-camp?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s doing whatever the Captain 
                        needs, really.  Fetching things.  
                        Errands.  

                                 DEBORAH
                        But aide-de-camps are still allowed 
                        to fight, right?  

                                 WILLIAM
                        No.  Your place will be with the 
                        Captain, to do anything that he 
                        needs.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Are you sure?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, considering that I’ve been 
                        the Captain’s aide-de-camp from 
                        Guilford Court House until about 
                        five minutes ago... yes, I’m fairly 
                        sure.

           She pauses.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Wait - am I taking your job?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You are.  And it’s a happy day for 
                        me, because that means I’m a 
                        Lieutenant now.

           They get to the QUARTERMASTER’S TENT, and William takes a cot 
           from the attendant, which he passes to Deborah, then starts 
           back the way they came.
                                 DEBORAH
                        Where are we going?

                                 WILLIAM
                        The Captain said to find you a tent 
                        near his own.  So here we are.

           They come to a tent that looks like all the rest, and William 
           pushes the flap open and goes inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- MORNING

           Deborah walks in and looks around; the tent’s completely 
           empty except for William’s cot in the corner, and a small 
           trunk next to it.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I don’t get my own tent?

                                 WILLIAM
                        There’s already three men in all 
                        the others.

                                 DEBORAH
                        How come there’s not three men in 
                        here.

                                 WILLIAM
                        There was.  

           A moment, as she looks at him, and she understands when she 
           sees the emotion in his eyes.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m sorry.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s war. 
                             (then; trying to convince 
                              himself)
                        Men die in war.

           He allows himself one more moment, then nods to the far side 
           of the tent.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You can get yourself set up over 
                        there.

           Deborah goes to put her cot down, as she looks back at him, 
           over her shoulder, wondering how she’s going to make this 
           work, and keep her secret.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:
           THE TENT (LATER).

           It’s night now, and the tent’s lit by a small candle, light 
           flickering across Deborah’s face as she sits in the shadows 
           and sews the Captain’s uniform.

           Behind her, William’s changing his clothes, unbuttoning his 
           shirt and taking it off.

           His chest is sinewy and taught, and he’s still young, really, 
           only on the verge of manhood, with room left for him to fill 
           out.

                                 DEBORAH
                             (nods to the scar on his 
                              shoulder)
                        How’d that happen?

           He looks over at her, then glances at the red and angry flesh 
           that’s been poorly stitched together.

                                 WILLIAM
                        A Hessian.  

                                 DEBORAH
                        Did you kill him?

           He’s down to his underwear now, and doesn’t want to talk 
           about it, so he walks over to the candle and blows it out.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Let’s get some sleep - it’s going 
                        to be a long march tomorrow.

           And she watches through the darkness as he lays on his cot, 
           pulling a blanket up, his eyes staring at the ceiling. 

           Then, after a moment, Deborah puts aside her work, lays down 
           on her cot, too, fully clothed, still wearing her hat, even, 
           as she holds her cross and begins to silently whisper her 
           prayer before sleep.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY

           The Continental Army is marching with Captain Webb and a few 
           other Officers on horses at the front while the rest follow 
           on foot, in disciplined formation.

           Deborah walks behind Captain Webb’s horse, and William’s next 
           to her -- she sees a SIGNPOST on the side of the road, and 
           William catches her looking at it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Something the matter?
                                 DEBORAH
                        Nothing, it’s just... I’ve never 
                        been outside of Massachusetts 
                        before.

           He smiles.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s a whole big country out there, 
                        Robert Shurtleff.
                             (then)
                        Are you ready to fight for it?

           She gives him a look, then he half-smiles, which she returns, 
           as they continue on past the signpost and into Connecticut.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN’S TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- DAY

           All the Officers are gathered in Captain Webb’s tent, and 
           there’s a map on a table in front of them, pieces set on it 
           to represent different armies.

           Deborah walks between the men, pouring water into glasses, 
           and William’s among them, too; the youngest and newest junior 
           officer.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        The Marquis de Lafayette and the 
                        French forces are approaching from 
                        the east and north to shadow 
                        Cornwallis’ movements and keep him 
                        engaged in Virginia.

           Captain Webb, in his freshly sewn uniform, moves two pieces 
           on the map, one in the Atlantic Ocean, and one to the north, 
           in Maryland, so that they’re on either side of Cornwallis in 
           Virginia.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        General Washington is in Delaware, 
                        and he’ll march south soon, while 
                        General Greene, who’s rallying our 
                        troops in South Carolina and 
                        Georgia, will swing north and meet 
                        him here, in Virginia...
                             (taps the map at Virginia; 
                              where Cornwallis’ piece 
                              sits)
                        ... trapping Lord Cornwallis 
                        between our forces.

           An OFFICER speaks up--
                                 OFFICER
                        Will we have enough men to defeat 
                        him?

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        With the French helping... we 
                        might.  But before that happens, 
                        Washington has sent to us directly 
                        with orders to lay siege to New 
                        York City.  

                                 OFFICER
                        New York City?  

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        It’s going to be a false offensive.  
                        When we attack, the British will 
                        send riders for reinforcements, and 
                        that’s what the General wants.  
                        Except, we only want riders going 
                        south, so Cornwallis thinks our 
                        forces are occupied here in the 
                        north.  Which means we need to 
                        intercept all riders they send 
                        north towards Albany.
                             (taps the map; just west 
                              of Manhattan)
                        There’s only one bridge from 
                        Manhattan to New Jersey, here at 
                        Tarrytown - that’s the bridge the 
                        riders’ll take, and we need to be 
                        there to make sure they don’t make 
                        it.

           Deborah inches her way forward, so she can see the map, and 
           follow what Webb’s showing his officers.

           William speaks up, all youthful brashness, eager to get back 
           into action.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I can hold the bridge, with a small 
                        detachment - if you go personally, 
                        or any other officer they know, 
                        they might suspect something.

           Webb nods--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Take fifty soldiers and don’t let a 
                        single one of those bastards off 
                        that island.  The rest of you’ll be 
                        with me, at the city - the siege of 
                        New York needs to look convincing, 
                        so that they take the bait.

           All the OFFICERS salute before they leave, and then it’s just 
           Deborah left with Captain Webb, as she clears the map.
           He watches her, narrowing his eyes.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        You realize what you just saw is of 
                        the very strictest confidentiality - 
                        even in our own camp.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Yes, sir.

           She’s gathered the map, and puts it away, and he notes her 
           body language.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        There’s something else that’s 
                        wrong?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I was just wondering... what’s my 
                        place going to be?

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        You’re my aide-de-camp.  So your 
                        place will be with me, wherever I’m 
                        at.

                                 DEBORAH
                        And during a siege, that’s by the 
                        cannons, isn’t it?  Behind the 
                        army, and away from everything 
                        that’s happening?

           He sees the look on her face, and in her eyes, and knows what 
           it is that she’s after.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        What, you want to go with Jaffers, 
                        is that it?  You want your first 
                        blood?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’d like to fight, yes.  And I  
                        think I’d be a good candidate to go 
                        on his mission.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        And why’s that?  Have you fought in 
                        a battle before?  Killed a man?  
                        Fired a musket, even?  

           She’s about to open her mouth, but can’t find an answer, so 
           instead--

                                 DEBORAH
                        With all respect, sir, I didn’t 
                        sign up to pour water and sew 
                        uniforms.
                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        No.  You signed up to follow 
                        orders, and you have yours, and 
                        they’re final.  Do you understand?

           A heavy moment, then she nods, her eyes meeting his, and 
           there’s fire in them--

                                 DEBORAH
                        Yes, sir.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Good.  You’re dismissed.

           And then Captain Webb goes to his desk as Deborah gathers the 
           last of the used glasses and walks outside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CAPTAINS’S TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- NIGHT

           Deborah stands outside the Captain’s tent, unhappy with 
           what’s happened. 

           She looks back where she just came from, then down the rows 
           towards her tent, silently weighing something in her head.

           Then she comes to her decision, starts to walk, with purpose 
           in her stride now, and maybe some defiance, too, as we--

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- MORNING

           Deborah stands outside the tent that she shares with William 
           as he cinches his Hessian sword to his waist, then picks up 
           his musket and shoulders a SATCHEL to take with him on his 
           march to Tarrytown.

           He gives her final instructions.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’ll have to learn the rest of 
                        the job on the fly, but there’s 
                        really not much to it, just fetch 
                        anything that he asks for - you go 
                        to the Messhall for food or drink, 
                        and the Quartermaster for anything 
                        else, and make sure to tell them 
                        it’s for the Captain so you get it 
                        quickly and you get the best.  
                        Understand?

           She nods.
                                 WILLIAM
                        And when you’re in his tent, and 
                        there’s other Officers there, just 
                        stay out of the way - the main goal 
                        of the job is to be seen and not 
                        heard...

           She nods again, but there’s another look behind her eyes now, 
           an anger that he doesn’t see.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’ll do just fine, and you can 
                        tell me all about the siege when I 
                        return. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        The false siege.

           William gives her a look, then another soldier walks up 
           behind them, puts his arm around William’s shoulder, this is 
           TATUM SCOTT (20s).

                                 SCOTT
                        The men are ready to get a move on, 
                        Jaffers, and these Redcoat bastards 
                        sure as hell aren’t gonna kill 
                        themselves, are they?

           There’s a look between Deborah and Scott, as he tips his hat 
           to her. 

           And then Scott and William leave, towards the fifty men 
           gathered in the distance.

           Deborah watches as they join the other soldiers, and then 
           start their march, jealousy in her eyes as they leave camp.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN’S TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- DAY

           Captain Webb’s meeting with more of his officers; they’re 
           going over siege strategy, and have a detailed map of New 
           York City in front of them.

           He turns to Deborah, standing at attention by the tent flap, 
           but she’s staring into the distance, her thoughts clearly 
           elsewhere.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Shurtleff.  

           She doesn’t answer.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Shurtleff!!!
           She looks up, and sees him holding out a kettle for her to 
           refill.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        More coffee.

           Deborah takes the pot and walks outside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MILITARY ENCAMPMENT -- DAY

           Deborah walks between the tents, until she comes to the 
           Messhall, soldiers sitting at tables outside having their 
           lunch. 

           But she keeps walking.

           She goes past the soldiers eating, and on towards--

           A FIELD.

           At the edge of camp, where SOLDIERS are drilling, lined up in 
           formation, pretending to shoot at targets in the distance on 
           their Officer’s orders, the same as we saw Deborah doing her 
           first day.

           And as their hammers CLICK, the Officer sees Deborah walking 
           by, calls to her--

                                 OFFICER
                        Hey!!  You, there.  Where the hell 
                        d’you think you’re going?

           She gives him a look -- doesn’t miss a beat -- speaks with 
           confidence.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Take a piss.

           She keeps walking, and the Officer accepts that, goes back to 
           his men, as she comes to--

           THE FOREST.

           Where she walks through the trees, towards a LARGE OAK where 
           she finds hidden under a pile of leaves a MUSKET and SATCHEL, 
           like the one that William wore when he left.

           She came out and hid this gear here last night, so she’d be 
           able to come back for it.
           She shoulders the satchel, grabs the musket, then starts 
           jogging silently through the trees, tossing the coffee pot 
           aside as she goes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY

           William marches at the head of his men with Tatum Scott next 
           to him; they’ve been marching for awhile, and the sun’s high 
           above.

           Then, behind the soldiers, Deborah slips from the trees and 
           joins the men marching at the back, one of the soldiers 
           raising an eyebrow.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Had to take a piss.

           He doesn’t say anything, just nods and turns back forward, 
           and a small smile spreads across her face.

           That excuse seems to work for everything.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TARRYTOWN -- DAY

           The Continentals keep marching, turn a bend, and the trees 
           start to part as in front of them is the small village of 
           TARRYTOWN.

           They walk towards it, and as they get closer, William stops, 
           stands on the side of the road to speak to his men as they 
           pass by him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’ll make camp outside the town -  
                        get some lunch and eat a little 
                        extra because the Redcoats will be 
                        here soon.

           He looks at the men as they pass, and Deborah moves as far 
           from him as she can, turns her head so he doesn’t see her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREETS -- TARRYTOWN -- DAY

           William stands with the MAYOR of Tarrytown at the edge of the 
           city where the bridge crosses the Hudson River, Manhattan on 
           the other side.
                                 WILLIAM
                        So this is it?  And there’s no 
                        other bridges?

                                 MAYOR
                        No.  Ours is the only way on or off 
                        the island to the west or north, if 
                        you care to stay dry.

           William takes in the bridge, making strategic calculations as 
           to the best way to defend it. 

           There’s foliage all around, and his men can blend in with the 
           trees and bushes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        The British might be here as early 
                        as this afternoon, so please tell 
                        your people to leave as soon as 
                        possible.

           The Mayor nods, and turns to go back to the city and tell the 
           villagers what’s about to happen.

           William leaves, too, in the opposite direction, back towards 
           the outskirts, and--

           THE CONTINENTAL CAMP.

           Where his men are sitting around a fire they’ve built to cook 
           their meal, as behind them villagers start to evacuate the 
           town.

           William is about to get some food himself, when he pauses.

           Deborah tries to turn away, but he sees her this time, and 
           walks over.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What the hell are you doing here, 
                        Shurtleff?

                                 DEBORAH
                        The same thing as you, I’d suspect.

                                 WILLIAM
                        The Captain told you not to come,  
                        and that was a direct order!  Back 
                        to camp.  NOW!

           The other soldiers turn to look, as the scene plays out, 
           waiting to see what’s going to happen, but Deborah doesn’t 
           back down.

           She’s got that fire back in her eyes again.
                                 DEBORAH
                        No.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Then I’ll take you myself.

                                 DEBORAH
                        There’s not enough time.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Scott!

           Tatum Scott stands, starts to walk to them, but Deborah’s 
           eyes never leave William’s.

                                 DEBORAH
                        The British will be here soon, 
                        you’ve said so yourself, twice now.  
                        It’s more than a day’s march back, 
                        and you can’t spare any men to take 
                        me, and I won’t go on my own.

           William pauses.  Glaring back at her.  Because he knows she’s 
           right...

                                 WILLIAM
                        So that’s what you came for, then, 
                        is it?  To make a fool of me, and 
                        yourself, too?

                                 DEBORAH
                        No.  I came to fight.

           And with that, she walks past him, and there’s nothing he can 
           do but watch her go.

                                 SCOTT
                        He’s right, you know.  We’re going 
                        to need every man that we’ve got.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Goddammit, of course I know that!

           And Scott raises his eyebrows, and then his hands, too, as he 
           leaves, and William shakes his head, as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON:

           Deborah’s face, as she smears dark pine tar across it, until 
           her skin’s black, and the only color showing is the white of 
           her eyes.

           She turns and walks through the town, past the buildings, and 
           comes to--
           THE BRIDGE (TARRYTOWN).

           Where the Continental Soldiers are hidden among the trees 
           with pine tar smeared on their faces, too, blending in with 
           the foliage, the troops split evenly between the North and 
           South sides of the bridge.

           Deborah carries two muskets, and takes her place among the 
           soldiers on the North side where each Continental holds a 
           musket and has an extra on the ground.

           Then she looks across the road, at the South side, where she 
           sees--

           William’s sitting there watching her, with Scott next to him, 
           and the other half of the soldiers.

           Deborah meets William’s eyes for a moment, then she turns 
           back to the bridge, takes out her cross, starts her prayer:

                                 DEBORAH
                             (sotto)
                        The Lord is my shepherd; he 
                        restoreth my soul, and leads me on 
                        the paths of righteousness...

           Scott taps William on the shoulder, and he turns to see a 
           group of red-coated BRITISH SOLDIERS, in the distance, 
           marching towards the bridge.

           William watches them for a moment, then turns to Scott, 
           whispers--

                                 WILLIAM
                        If anything happens to me, make 
                        sure you get the men back to the 
                        main army as quickly as possible. 

           Scott nods, as British keep coming, all told about 100 of 
           them, which is twice the number of Continentals waiting to 
           ambush them on the bridge.

           SUPER: “The Battle of Tarrytown” -- July 15th, 1781.

           The Continentals all look to William, waiting for his word to 
           spring their trap, and he waits, letting them get closer.

           The first Redcoat sets his foot on the bridge, then the rest, 
           and it’s not long until all the soldiers are near the middle.

           William quietly raises his hand.

           The British keep marching, almost to where the Continentals 
           are hiding, near the other side of the bridge, and the town. 

           There’s another breathless moment, William waiting for the 
           exact right time, then-- 
                                 WILLIAM
                        NOW!!!

           He brings his hand down as the Continentals rise and open 
           fire, exploding a VOLLEY into the ranks of British soldiers.

           BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!!!

           The bridge erupts in a cloud of musket smoke as the first 
           wave of British fall, dead before they hit the bridge.

                                 WILLIAM
                        SECOND VOLLEY, READY!!!

           Then Continentals reach down and grab their spare muskets, 
           Deborah among them, and she takes aim, into the mass of 
           Redcoats--

                                 WILLIAM
                        FIRE!!!

           BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!!!

           More Continental musket fire, and another wave of British 
           soldiers fall. 

           The rest of the Redcoats see the trap now, and OPEN FIRE 
           themselves-- 

           Three CONTINENTALS around Deborah go down with bullets to the 
           chest, and one soldier screams as he takes a shot in the 
           face.

           Then British dive to safety -- to the sides of the bridge -- 
           and there’s smoke everywhere, making it hard to see anything, 
           for either side.

           William yells to his soldiers--

                                 WILLIAM
                        RELOAD!!!

           It’s a race as Continentals and British each hurry to reload, 
           filling barrels with powder and musket balls, packing it 
           tight, and it’s at the exact same moment that they each swing 
           their rifles back up, and--

           BANG, BANG, BANG!!!

           Shots ring from both sides, and a bullet tears through the 
           sleeve of Deborah’s uniform; she looks down, but there’s no 
           blood.

           Around her, more Continentals falls, and so do more Redcoats, 
           across from them.
           William looks around, they don’t have the element of surprise 
           anymore, and they’re outnumbered on the bridge.

                                 WILLIAM
                        RETREAT!!! EVERYONE BACK TO THE 
                        CITY!!!

           The Continentals turn and run back towards Tarrytown as more 
           musket shots ring out -- BANG, BANG!! -- and two Continentals 
           fall, shot in the back.

           The British chase after them, and in the confusion we follow 
           with Deborah, who’s running as fast as she can, then there’s 
           an EXPLOSION and a musket ball flies past her ear, just as 
           she dives--

           BEHIND A BUILDING.

           Where she lands on her back and finishes reloading her musket 
           again, jamming a bullet into the barrel, then looks across 
           the street to see--

           WILLIAM.

           Who’s also hiding behind a building, and as he peaks around 
           and sees the British charging towards them -- what he wants -- 
           he draws his Hessian sword.

                                 WILLIAM
                        ONE MORE VOLLEY!!!

           And as the British pour into the city, the Continentals jump 
           from behind buildings and fire a final round-- 

           BANG, BANG, BANG!!!

           And more British fall in the streets -- blood spilling across 
           cobblestone -- and the remaining Redcoats fire their last 
           shots at the Continentals in desperation--

           BANG, BANG!!!

           And two more Continentals fall, but William has his moment 
           now, and yells--

                                 WILLIAM
                        SWORDS!!!  BAYONETS!!!  CHARGE!!!

           The Continentals SCREAM and CHARGE at the British -- bayonets 
           lowered -- and to Deborah’s right, she sees William out in 
           front, leading them. 

           He meets the British first -- parries a blow -- then runs a 
           Redcoat through the stomach with a swift and practiced stroke 
           from his sword.
           Deborah sees this, then lets out her own cry--

                                 DEBORAH
                        AHHHHHH!!!!

           And she charges with the rest of them, towards the mass of 
           soldiers fighting, and through the smoke Deborah finds a 
           Redcoat and thrusts her bayonet, catching him in the side-- 

           He GRUNTS in pain, then turns and thrusts back at her, but 
           she’s quick, and--

           She DUCKS as his bayonet goes high, stabbing the air where 
           her head was only a moment before.

           Then she thrusts upwards as hard as she can and buries her 
           bayonet in his chest, as blood spurts up her arms and across 
           her face, and he screams--

                                 REDCOAT
                        AHHHHHHH!!!

           Then he chokes, coughing on blood pooling in his mouth, and 
           as he falls Deborah sees another British soldier running at 
           her, his bayonet held low and levelled at her stomach.

           She tries to pull her own bayonet back, but it’s stuck in the 
           chest of the man she’s just killed.

           She flexes and pulls as hard as she can, but it doesn’t 
           budge, not an inch, and as the British soldier reaches her-- 

           She abandons her bayonet, dives to the ground, out of the 
           way, as the Redcoat SWINGS, then stands over her, and she’s 
           unarmed.

                                 REDCOAT
                        Treasonous rebel scum.

           He’s about to stab her, when -- BANG!! -- there’s a shot from 
           the distance, and it rips into his shoulder, and he falls.

           On the ground, he grits his teeth in pain, and she sees a 
           loose rifle next to her, reaches for it and rips the bayonet 
           from the end, turns with it, and--

           ... STAB!!!

           She buries the entire blade in the man’s stomach, and he lets 
           out his death cry as she scrambles to her feet and rips her 
           rifle free from the first corpse.

           Then she turns to rejoin the fighting, where she sees a 
           British soldier engaged with a Continental, getting the upper-
           hand, and she runs to them.
           The Redcoat raises his CURVED SWORD, about to bring down a 
           terrible blow, as she thrusts her bayonet deep into his back.

                                 REDCOAT
                        AHHHHHHH!!!

           He FALLS with a scream, as the Continental he was fighting 
           finishes him off, and Deborah turns to survey the action 
           around her.

           She sees William, on the other side of the street, as he 
           parries a blow, then stabs a REDCOAT up to his hilt and rips 
           his sword back in a shower of blood.

           Then, all the Continentals pause, blood covering faces, and 
           look around the bridge. 

           There’s heavy casualties on both sides, but the bridge is 
           theirs, and so is the battle. 

                                 WILLIAM
                             (nods)
                        Well done, men.

           Then, William hears something, and turns to see a not-yet-
           dead REDCOAT on the bridge, blood pouring from his stomach.

           William walks over and looks down -- the soldier’s young, 
           barely even a teenager -- he turns back and calls to his men--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Does anyone here know medicine?

                                 REDCOAT
                        N-n-n-n-o-o.

           He looks back to the young soldier, blood pooling in his 
           mouth, staining his teeth red.

                                 REDCOAT
                        F-f-f-inish it.  P-p-lease.

           William sees a rifle, barely out of the boy’s reach, and he 
           picks it up.

           He hesitates for a moment.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Close your eyes.

           The boy pauses, looks up at the sky -- the birds, the trees, 
           clouds floating in blue -- taking it all in, one last time, 
           then closes his eyes tight and nods. 

                                 REDCOAT
                        A-a-alright.
           William aims the rifle.

           He waits for a moment, not enjoying this, but knows it has to 
           done, then grits his teeth as he squeezes, and--

           ... BANG!

           The boy’s head snaps back, as the explosion pierces the sky, 
           and his body lies still.

           William turns back to his soldiers, the musket still in his 
           hand, and makes his decision:

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’ll take the time to bury 
                        everyone that died here today.  
                        Theirs, too.  Then we head back 
                        south.

           All the soldiers nod, the air heavy around them, as they 
           start to gather the bodies, getting ready to separate them 
           and dig graves.

                                                               FADE TO:

           THE HUDSON RIVER.

           Where Deborah stands up to her ankles in the water, splashing 
           some on her face, scrubbing away the pine tar and blood as 
           best she can.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        Was it worth it?

           Deborah turns to see William come to the bank of the river 
           next to her and dip his sword in, rinsing the blood off.

                                 DEBORAH
                        We won.

           He gives her a side-eyed glance, as he wipes the blade clean.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We would’ve won whether you were 
                        here or not, so I’ll ask you 
                        again... was it worth it?  

           She looks at him, and then answers with complete honesty, 
           even if not answering the question.

                                 DEBORAH
                        It all happened quicker than I 
                        thought it would.  At least, all 
                        the times that I’d imagined it. 
           He waits for a long moment, looking at her, then softens a 
           little.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Some people say it gets easier, but 
                        it doesn’t.  It’s the nights that 
                        are the worst - not many of us get 
                        much sleep anymore.

                                 DEBORAH
                        So what happens?  You just lay 
                        there and stare at the ceiling?

                                 WILLIAM
                        And wait.  And then soon enough the 
                        next day comes.

           He SPLASHES water on his face, wiping off his pine tar, too, 
           starts to take off his clothes, shirt first, then trousers.

           He glances at her, sees her watching him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Take your clothes off.

                                 DEBORAH
                        What?

                                 WILLIAM
                        The next chance for a bath could be 
                        weeks.

           He’s down to his underwear, and he takes that off, too, so 
           he’s completely naked.

           Then he walks into the river, up to his chest, starts to 
           scrub the dirt and blood from his body, sees her still on the 
           bank.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m not too bad - I’ll just splash 
                        some on my face.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What are you talking about?  You’re 
                        filthy.

           She looks down at herself, and it’s true -- her uniform’s 
           ripped and torn, and she’s covered head to foot in dirt, 
           blood, pine tar.

           She opens her mouth, about to answer, searching for some 
           excuse, then sees something and squints her eyes as she looks 
           into the distance--

                                 DEBORAH
                        What’s that?
                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s what?

           Then it comes into the focus.

                                 DEBORAH
                             (sotto)
                        Shit...

           And it’s completely instinctual as Deborah grabs her musket, 
           and starts to sprint. 

           William spins around, sees her take off, then spots what’s 
           caught her attention--

           IN THE DISTANCE: there’s THREE REDCOATS swimming their horses 
           across the river, almost to the bank, leaving Manhattan and 
           nearly to New Jersey.

                                 WILLIAM
                             (louder)
                        Shit...

           William quickly pulls his clothes back on, only half-dressed 
           as he starts to run, following after her, as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           WITH DEBORAH.

           Branches whipping past her face as she sprints and when she 
           gets close to the Redcoats she slows down, making her way 
           quietly through the trees, remaining out of sight as the 
           British ride their horses out of the river.

           The two men in front wait as the third man behind catches up, 
           and Deborah quietly brings her musket around, taking aim at 
           the first rider.

           She lines him in her sights, knowing how important this first 
           shot is going to be -- hesitates for a moment longer -- then 
           squeezes the trigger, and--

           ... BANG!!!

           The bullet explodes in a cloud of smoke and rips into the 
           Redcoat’s chest -- throws him from his horse -- dead before 
           he hits the ground.

           The other two RIDERS don’t know how many men there are, just 
           that it’s an ambush, so the first yells to his companion--

                                 REDCOAT
                        RIDE!!!  NOW!!!  TO ALBANY!!!
           And they both take off, galloping into the woods, as Deborah 
           runs to the man she just shot and picks up his musket.

           She sees his horse nearby, and jumps onto its back, starts 
           racing after the two Redcoats, as behind her--

                                 WILLIAM
                        ROBERT!!!

           William runs after her, but he’s still too far away, and she 
           doesn’t hear him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FOREST.

           Where Deborah lays flat against the horse’s back, musket in 
           one hand, reins in the other.

           Her horse jumps over a fallen log, and she starts to gain on 
           the Redcoats as she raises her musket, trying to take careful 
           aim from the bouncing back of the horse, taking a moment to 
           line up the shot, then--

           ... BANG!!!

           Another explosion of smoke, but her shot goes wide, and 
           buries into a tree.

           The First Redcoat glances over his shoulder, sees that it’s 
           only one soldier chasing them, and turns to his companion.

                                 FIRST REDCOAT
                        There’s only one of them!  And he’s 
                        just fired his only shot.

           The Second Redcoat looks, too, and knowing what this means, 
           they both pull their horses to a stop, and turn back to face--

           DEBORAH.

           Who jerks hard on her reins, and her horse comes to a 
           skidding halt, facing the two Redcoats, deep in a clearing in 
           the New Jersey forest.

                                 FIRST REDCOAT
                        Only one of you?  And you’ve 
                        already spent your shot...

           Deborah looks between them, knows she doesn’t stand a chance, 
           so--

           She KICKS her horse to a gallop again, heading in the 
           opposite direction, riding through a branch that catches her 
           uniform, ripping a hole across the chest. 
           The Redcoats carefully take aim as she rides, and then, from 
           behind her--

           ... BANG!!!

           She ducks when she hears the explosion, but the shot’s low 
           and buries itself deep into her leg--

                                 DEBORAH
                        Mmmpppphhhh...

           She grimaces against the pain and blood spilling from the 
           fleshy part of her upper thigh as the Redcoats start to ride 
           after her.

           They’re chasing her now, and she’s injured, bleeding, and as 
           they start to get closer, closer, closer, the Second Redcoat 
           takes aim with his musket, and--

           ... BANG!!!

           Another shot rings out -- rips into the neck of Deborah’s 
           horse, as-- 

           Both horse and rider fall, and Deborah’s thrown heavily to 
           the ground in a shower of earth, and her wounded leg gets 
           trapped beneath the horse.

           She can’t move it, pinned under the entire weight of a two 
           thousand pound animal, as the Redcoats ride to her and 
           dismount.

           They slowly walk over, and stand above her, sneers on their 
           faces, knowing she’s trapped.

                                 FIRST REDCOAT
                        Well, this certainly makes things 
                        easier, doesn’t it?

                                 SECOND REDCOAT
                        If only you’d all die so easily.

           And the First Redcoat raises his musket, aims at her head, 
           about to squeeze the trigger, when--

           -- she pulls the PISTOL from inside her uniform, the Screw-
           Barrel she bought in Boston, and squeezes off a round--

           ... BANG!!! 

           The First Redcoat falls, blood spilling from a dime-sized 
           hole in his forehead.

           The Second Redcoat runs over, kicks the pistol from her hand.

                                 SECOND REDCOAT
                        Treasonous bastard!  
           He draws his curved sword, raising the blade over his head, 
           sunlight glinting off polished steel.

           She has no more tricks left to play, and knows this is going 
           to be the end now.

                                 SECOND REDCOAT
                        Long live the king.

           And just as his lip curls up in hate, about to bring the 
           sword down on her neck-- 

           ... SLICE!!!

           The side of his own neck opens in a shower of blood, cut all 
           the way through to bone.

           Then he falls, and Deborah sees William standing behind him, 
           out of breath from the sprint he just made, his Hessian sword 
           stained red again.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Are you hurt?

                                 DEBORAH
                        My leg.

           William bends down, strains all his muscles as he lifts the 
           horse enough for Deborah to pull her leg out from underneath.

           Then, when she does, he sees the blood, and the hole with no 
           exit wound on the other side, where the bullet’s still lodged 
           inside her.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We need to get you to a doctor.

                                 DEBORAH
                        No.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’ll get infected with the bullet 
                        still in there.  Can you walk?  I’m 
                        sure there’ll be one back at the 
                        village.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I can get it out myself.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What?  How?

           She looks at the dead Redcoat next to her, then crawls over 
           and rifles through his uniform until she finds what she’s 
           looking for--

           A flask, in his jacket pocket.
           Then, she takes the BAYONET off his musket, and rips her pant 
           leg open even further.

           There’s blood pooling out of the wound, and the bullet’s 
           partially visible, lodged deep in the skin.

           She starts guzzling from the flask, then pours some of it 
           over her leg and winces.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What are you doing?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Can you press here?  It’ll stop the 
                        bleeding.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You need to see a bloody doctor!

           She pauses, looks up at him, the bayonet in hand, and meets 
           his eyes.

                                 DEBORAH
                        No.  I told you.  No doctors.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why???

                                 DEBORAH
                        Just here.  On my thigh.  Above the 
                        bullet hole.

           He waits for a moment, then shakes his head as he comes over 
           and applies pressure, and she hands him the flask.

           She takes a moment to gather herself, and softly whisper a 
           prayer--

                                 DEBORAH
                        “Lord, please take my hands and 
                        guide them, and bring me 
                        strength...”

           -- then she sticks the tip of the bayonet into the side of 
           the wound, gritting her teeth in pain.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Mmppphhh...

           William watches as she works, still applying pressure where 
           she told him--

                                 WILLIAM
                        You need to push the blade in 
                        further - underneath the bullet, to 
                        wedge it out.
                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m trying.

           She digs deeper into the wound -- there’s more blood, pooling 
           in both of their hands -- and she screams against the pain--

                                 DEBORAH
                        AHHHHHH!!!!

           And with one big thrust, she finally gets the bayonet tip 
           under the bullet, wedges it out, leaving a hole in her leg as 
           William pours the remaining alcohol from the flask over it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We need to stop the bleeding 
                        otherwise you’re going to pass out.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m fine.

           He rips off a piece of his shirt and ties it tightly around 
           her upper leg. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’ll do for now until we get 
                        back - do you think you can walk?

           William watches as she stands and takes a few steps, wincing 
           as the leg starts to tighten and stiffen.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Careful, and don’t go too fast, 
                        you’ve lost a lot of blood...

           But she doesn’t listen, and William looks away, because 
           there’s something that’s caught his attention, and he walks 
           over to pick up--

           The distinct messenger SATCHEL that one of the dead Redcoats 
           is wearing around his neck.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Can you believe our luck...

           But then, just as she takes another step, Deborah stumbles 
           and falls to the ground behind him, and he turns to see her 
           land heavily.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Dammit, Robert.

           He walks over and looks down, sees that she’s unconscious and 
           is about to pick her up, but then sees something else, too.

           Through her ripped uniform, where it got caught on the 
           branch, there’s the frayed end of the cloth she used to bind 
           her breasts flat.
           He reaches out and touches it, then looks up to her face, and 
           the structure of it, as he sits back, putting pieces together 
           and trying to process what he’s just learned.

                                                               FADE TO:

           A SMALL FIRE (DUSK).

           And Deborah laying beside it, slowly blinking her eyes open 
           and looking around as in the distance the sun sets over the 
           tall Jersey oaks.

           She painfully sits up, looking down at her freshly bandaged 
           leg, remembering what happened.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        You really aren’t one for following 
                        orders, are you?

           She whips her head around and sees William walking towards 
           her, his arms full of kindling.

           Then she looks down and sees that she’s not wearing her 
           uniform, but a different shirt.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m assuming that’s why you didn’t 
                        want a doctor?

           She looks back up, meets his eyes, her own pleading with him.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Please.  Don’t tell anyone.  
                        They’ll make me go home.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Perhaps that’s where you should be.

           Her eyes flash, as he stands there, studying her, then he 
           shakes his head again.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How did I not see it before?  How 
                        could I have been so blind?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I just want to do my part.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes, but there’s rules against you 
                        doing your part - rules that you 
                        once again blatantly disregarded.
                                 DEBORAH
                        Screw the damn rules!  Why should I 
                        be told that I can’t fight for my 
                        country?  

                                 WILLIAM
                        You can fight.  There’s other ways.  
                        Just not... 
                             (searching)
                        ... just not as part of the army, 
                        and not dressed as something that 
                        you aren’t.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Something that I’m not?  What, you 
                        mean a soldier?  You don’t think 
                        I’m strong enough, is that it?  
                        That I can’t hold a musket, like 
                        the rest of you, with my weak 
                        woman’s hands that belong in the 
                        kitchen, fetching the Captain’s 
                        dinners and sewing your uniforms?
                             (her eyes blaze at him)
                        Because I’ll remind you, Lt. 
                        Jaffers, that without me those 
                        Redcoats would be half-way to 
                        Albany by now, which is something 
                        you shouldn’t soon forget.

           William looks at her, knows that she’s right, and it’s 
           painful for him, because it’s hard to be wrong, and to 
           change.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s your name?

                                 DEBORAH
                        You know my name.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s your real name.

           She meets his eyes.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Robert Shurtleff is my real name.  
                        That’s who I am now.

           He waits another moment, looking back at her, and it’s her 
           eyes that soften him, the passion and the fire.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s too dark to keep marching 
                        tonight - we’ll camp here, and go 
                        back to Tarrytown in the morning.
                                 DEBORAH
                        And then what?  When we rejoin the 
                        army?

           He hesitates for a moment, then looks away, as he tells her--

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’ll be up to the Captain to 
                        decide.

           And off Deborah’s look, none too pleased with this, knowing 
           how the Captain’s bound to feel about her...

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           LATER (NIGHT).

           Everything’s dark, and the fire’s starting to burn low; 
           William lays on one side of the flames, and Deborah on the 
           other.

           He watches as she takes out her cross, silently whispering 
           her prayer before sleep.

                                 DEBORAH
                             (sotto)
                        Our father, who art in heaven, 
                        hallowed be thy name...

           And as he watches her, through the darkness...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. TARRYTOWN -- MORNING

           Where William and Deborah come back towards Tarrytown, and 
           she walks with a noticeable limp now, every step painful for 
           her. 

           This limp is something that she’ll carry with her for the 
           rest of her life.

           When they get to the village, they look around to see there’s 
           no one there -- not any villagers or Continental soldiers.

                                 WILLIAM
                        They must have left.  I told Scott 
                        to take the men back south if 
                        anything happened to me. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        What does that mean?
                                 WILLIAM
                        It means that we’ve got ground to 
                        make up - do you think you’ll be 
                        able to make it with your leg?

           They look at each other, and then Deborah nods, defiantly.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’ll make it.

           And then he nods, too, and they begin to walk together, out 
           of the village, heading south.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY

           William and Deborah continue in silence; she hasn’t bound her 
           breasts, and also isn’t wearing her hat.

           He reaches into his pack and takes out a small loaf of bread, 
           breaks it into two pieces, offers her half.

           She takes the bread, and they both chew as they walk, and he 
           looks over at her, thinking about her story.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How’d you choose Robert Shurtleff?

           She’s silent for a moment, still chewing, then finally 
           answers.

                                 DEBORAH
                        It was my brother’s first and 
                        middle names.
                             (then; decides to let him 
                              in a little)
                        He died when he was eight.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So that was the truth, then?  About 
                        your eight brothers and how you 
                        learned to sew?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Some of it.  I did have eight 
                        brothers, and had to learn to mend 
                        their clothes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And what about the rest?

           They keep walking, and it seems like she’s not going to 
           answer, until--
                                 DEBORAH
                        We lived on a farm, and when I was 
                        ten, our father left.  That’s why I 
                        had to care for them.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Left where?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I don’t know.  One day he was 
                        there, and the next he wasn’t, and 
                        he never came back.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So your mother raised you?  And 
                        your brothers?

                                 DEBORAH
                        She tried.  And she did as best she 
                        could.  But we lived on a farm that 
                        she couldn’t tend without a 
                        husband, and she had nine young 
                        children that needed to be fed.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So what’d she do?

                                 DEBORAH
                        She took her time and found a 
                        family for each of us, then sold us 
                        to them.

           He turns to her--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sold you?  My God, that’s awful.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Is it?  What else could she have 
                        done?   She couldn’t make a living 
                        on her own without a man, and what 
                        man in Massachusetts or anywhere 
                        else would want her and her nine 
                        children by someone else?  You see, 
                        this world can be very cruel to 
                        women, and that’s something I 
                        learned when I was very young. 

           William looks back at her, starting to realize how she’s been 
           shaped, and perhaps a small piece of why she is the way that 
           she is.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So where’d you end up?  After 
                        she... sold you.
                                 DEBORAH
                        With a family in Middleborough.  
                        They were good to me - raised me in 
                        their household, and gave me food 
                        and board in exchange for my 
                        service.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s where I saw you!  I knew you 
                        looked familiar, that first day in 
                        camp.

           And a small smile finally crosses her face as she looks back 
           at him.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I thought you’d recognized me, and 
                        this was all going to be over 
                        before it even began.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I can’t believe I didn’t place you.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Why would you have?  I was someone 
                        else then.

           They’re quiet now, thinking back to that day, and the reason 
           why William was at the Thomas’ house, and it’s sobering.

                                 WILLIAM
                        They were good friends... both of 
                        them.

                                 DEBORAH
                        To me, too.

           And William gives her another look, perhaps a bit changed, 
           and they keep walking, in silence now, out of respect for the 
           dead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE DIRT ROAD (LATER).

           Deborah and William are still walking, though it’s gotten 
           dark, and then there’s a large clap of THUNDER before the sky 
           opens above them and the rain pours.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Shit.

           They start to jog, then see a soft light in front of them.

           It’s a small farm, in the distance, some ways from the road, 
           across a field.
                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s worth a shot.

           Deborah nods, as she buttons her jacket to hide her unbound 
           chest, and puts her hat back on so that she looks like a boy 
           again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FARM (NIGHT).

           Where William raises his hand and knocks on the door, until 
           it opens and there’s a weathered FARMER on the other side, 
           his WIFE behind him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We got caught in the storm.  I was 
                        wondering if we might be able to 
                        stay the night - the barn would be 
                        fine, we’re just looking for 
                        somewhere dry.

           The Farmer looks between them--

                                 FARMER
                        You’re soldiers?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Continentals.

           Another moment, then the Farmer opens the door a little 
           wider, and motions them in.

                                 FARMER
                        The barn’s for livestock.  We’ve 
                        got a spare room inside that you 
                        can share.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Thank you.

           Deborah and William walk past, dripping wet and freezing, and 
           go inside--

           THE FARM HOUSE.

           Where there’s two YOUNG BOYS (11 and 7) sitting by a warm 
           fire, and they look up at the two soldiers, now standing in 
           their living room.

                                 FARMER
                        Why don’t you take a seat in front 
                        of the fire with the boys and dry 
                        off some - we were just about to 
                        have some soup.
           Deborah and William nod gratefully and go to the fire, the 
           two young ones smiling at the strangers in their home, and 
           William and Deborah smiling back at them.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           LATER.

           The Wife’s cleared the soup from the table, and picked her 
           boys up and carried them to bed as the Farmer stands with 
           Deborah and William.

                                 FARMER
                        The one room’ll work for the both 
                        of you then?

           William looks to Deborah, who meets his eyes, then back to 
           the Farmer--

                                 DEBORAH
                        Of course.  It’ll be more than 
                        enough.

           The Farmer nods, and they follow him across the house, to 
           where he opens the door to--

           A SMALL BEDROOM.

           Where Deborah and William walk in to see a large GADSDEN FLAG 
           pinned to the wall: a coiled snake, ready to strike, and the 
           timeless words of revolution underneath:

           “DON’T TREAD ON ME”

           They both see the way the room’s decorated, and know what it 
           means, as Deborah turns back to the Farmer, sees the grief in 
           his eyes.

                                 FARMER
                        Bunker Hill.  He’d just turned 
                        sixteen.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 FARMER
                        So have we been.  

           A moment longer, then the Farmer nods, and walks to the door--

                                 FARMER
                        I’ll see you in the morning.

           When he’s gone, Deborah and William look at the single bed, 
           and the candle flickering on the night stand. 
           Then William clears his throat, sets his things on a chair:

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ll take the floor.

           Deborah nods, as she goes to the far side of the bed and 
           turns her back as she strips down, taking her shirt off, then 
           the rest of her damp clothes.

           Behind her, William unbuckles his sword, then does the same 
           thing, taking his clothes off, and carefully folding them.

           Shadows and light still flicker across the wall, as she 
           crawls under the blankets, and William lays on the floor.

           Then, William looks up, sees Deborah holding her cross, 
           silently whispering her nightly prayer, as she always does, 
           and he asks her--

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’ve read a lot of the Bible?

           She pauses.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I have.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And what does it tell you?

                                 DEBORAH
                        A great many things, I suppose.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Like what?  

           She thinks about that, for a moment, staring at the ceiling.

                                 DEBORAH
                        That we come from nothing, and 
                        before long we’ll return to 
                        nothing, but while we’re here... 
                             (beat)
                        ... while we’re here, we have the 
                        chance to do great things.

           He takes that in, thinking about it, then--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Will you say it again, but out loud 
                        this time?  So that I can hear, 
                        too?

           She pauses for a moment, then looks down at him, meets his 
           eyes -- a connection between them -- then she nods, and 
           continues.
                                 DEBORAH
                        Now the light has gone away, my 
                        Savior; so please listen while we 
                        pray.

           He closes his eyes, and his entire body seems to relax.

                                 DEBORAH
                        We ask thee to watch and keep us, 
                        and send us to a quiet sleep, in 
                        your arms, the same as we ask of 
                        you every night...

           And as she continues, and the candle burns lower, he begins 
           to drift off to sleep, for the first time in a long time, as 
           we...

                                                               FADE TO:

           THE MORNING.

           Where William blinks the sleep from his eyes, and then opens 
           them to light pouring into the room, and the sound of voices 
           in the kitchen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FARM HOUSE -- MORNING

           William walks out, fully dressed, and sees Deborah fully 
           dressed, too; chest bound, hat on, passing convincingly as a 
           man as she speaks with the Farmer and his Wife.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What time is it?  I can’t believe I 
                        slept that long.

                                 WIFE
                        It means that you needed it.

           He turns and meets Deborah’s eyes, something unspoken passing 
           between them as they walk towards the door together, and turn 
           back to the Farmer.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Thank you.  For your hospitality.

           The Farmer pauses, looks at his sons, playing on the floor, 
           then back to the two soldiers, and he meets their eyes. 

                                 FARMER
                        Finish this.  Before they ride off, 
                        like their brother did...
           And all Deborah and William can do is nod, then shake hands, 
           great emotion in their eyes, as they leave to continue on 
           their way.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE DIRT ROAD.

           Outside the Farmer’s house, where William and Deborah start 
           into the distance, away from the farm, past half-tended 
           cotton fields on either side.

           Then, there’s a noise behind them, and they quickly turn, on 
           full alert, and relax when they see--

           It’s the Farmer’s oldest son, running towards them, and as he 
           gets closer they see that he’s carrying something, which he 
           reaches out and hands to Deborah.

           And there’s a moment between them, his young eyes meeting 
           hers, then he steps back and crisply salutes them, as best he 
           knows how, before he turns and runs back towards the farm. 

           When he’s gone, Deborah and William look down to see the 
           GADSDEN FLAG that hung in his brother’s room, and they stare 
           at it: the coiled snake, the word’s underneath it, emotion 
           rising in their throats.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Is there any family that won’t be 
                        touched by this war?

           Deborah looks up at the boy, running back along the road, 
           into the distance.

                                 DEBORAH
                        That’s why we have to keep going.

           They watch him for a moment longer, then turn and start 
           walking again, heading further south.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD -- COUNTRYSIDE -- AFTERNOON

           Deborah and William keep walking, neither speaking, until the 
           road soon comes to a hill which they crest, and when they 
           look below, they pause.

           On the other side is a wide and grass-filled valley where the 
           whole CONTINENTAL ARMY is camped.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. TENTS -- MILITARY ENCAMPMENT -- DAY

           William and Deborah walk through the rows of tents, until 
           they see some of the soldiers they fought with at Tarrytown. 

           Scott’s in the middle of them, looks up from a mug of beer.

                                 SCOTT
                        Where the hell have you two been?  
                        We waited hours.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Just found some last Redcoats that 
                        needed to be killed.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, and my mother’s the Queen of 
                        England.

           Scott makes the “jerking-off” motion with his hand as he 
           laughs, and Deborah and William smile, too, as William leads 
           her past them.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Where are we going?

           They walk a few more paces, then he nods to the Captain’s 
           tent, in front of them.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Captain Webb will want to know that 
                        his aide-de-camp has returned. 

           Deborah’s face falls, because she knows what this is sure to 
           mean for her.

                                 DEBORAH
                        So this is the end.

           And William hesitates, when he hears that, and looks back at 
           her with a look that she can’t quite place.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Can I ask you something?  And I 
                        want you to tell me the truth.  

                                 DEBORAH
                        Alright.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why?

                                 DEBORAH
                        It’s not enough that I just wanted 
                        to do my part?
           He gazes impassively back at her, he wants more, and she 
           knows it.

           So she thinks about it further, taking her time, then meets 
           his eyes, and answers with complete honesty--

                                 DEBORAH
                        My whole life, in everything I’ve 
                        done, I was always told, “be seen 
                        and not heard,” same as you told me 
                        my job was, that first day in camp.
                             (then)
                        Well, for once, I wanted to be 
                        heard.  

           He looks back at her, for just another moment, then pushes 
           the flap open, and they go inside.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB (PRE-LAP)
                        Well, if that wasn’t the longest 
                        coffee run in the history of 
                        fucking coffee and runs, then I 
                        don’t know my own name.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN’S TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- DAY

           Deborah and William stand at attention, with Captain Webb in 
           front of them, glaring at Deborah as she keeps her eyes 
           straight ahead.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m sorry, sir.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        You’re sorry?  That’s the best you 
                        can do?  I should have you court-
                        martialed for not being able to 
                        tell a passable lie alone, much 
                        less desertion.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Desertion?

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        You left your post - do you know 
                        another word for it?

           Her eyes blaze--

                                 DEBORAH
                        I fought, I was--

                                 WILLIAM
                        It was my fault, sir.
           Captain Webb turns to look at William, as he steps forward, 
           interrupting.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Is that right?

           William hesitates for a moment, then looks to Deborah, who’s 
           watching him, and it’s her eyes that convince him to keep 
           going.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I told Private Shurtleff to come 
                        with me to Tarrytown - I didn’t 
                        realize it was contradicting your 
                        own orders, and I needed as many 
                        soldiers as possible.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        And you didn’t care enough to set 
                        him right, did you, Shurtleff?  

                                 WILLIAM
                        No.  He didn’t.  And that’s his 
                        fault.  But if he had, it would 
                        have all been for nothing.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        What do you mean?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Without him we wouldn’t have 
                        intercepted these.

           William reaches into his uniform and pulls out the MESSENGER 
           SATCHEL the Redcoat was carrying, hands it to Captain Webb.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We thought all the Redcoats were 
                        dead, and it was Robert that saw 
                        the last three crossing the river 
                        and he chased them down and stopped 
                        them himself.

           Captain Webb takes the dispatches, quickly starts scanning 
           through the pages.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I caught them, but they disarmed me 
                        and shot my horse out from 
                        underneath - I was all but finished 
                        until William caught up and 
                        finished them off while I was on 
                        the ground.  

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Well, aren’t you both just the 
                        picture of teamwork.
           The Captain looks back up at Deborah, and she holds her 
           breath, knowing that everything’s about to be decided.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        I took a new aide-de-camp while you 
                        were gone, so the job's filled.  
                             (then)
                        But I’m not in the business of 
                        sending soldiers home during a war 
                        in which we’re out-manned, and 
                        currently losing, so since you two 
                        work together so well, you can join 
                        Lieutenant Jaffers’ company and be 
                        his problem now.

           Deborah’s almost moved to tears, as she salutes, with a 
           shaking hand--

                                 DEBORAH
                        Thank you, sir...

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Now get the hell out of here, both 
                        of you.

           They spin on their heels, and head towards the exit, when 
           Captain Webb speaks up behind them.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Oh, and Private Shurtleff...

           They turn back and meet the Captain’s eye.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        One more time directly disobeying 
                        my orders and you will be court-
                        martialed faster than you can 
                        blink.  Do you understand me?

           A moment, then Deborah nods, and they leave, as the Captain 
           goes to his desk, reading back through the dispatches that 
           William brought.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A ROARING BONFIRE.

           In the middle of the Continental camp, and all the men 
           gathered around it.

           There’s drinking, strings and fiddles being played, men 
           clapping as a few dance a jig, and they all laugh together. 

           William sits next to Scott, a smile on his face as Scott 
           tells a joke and slaps him on the back, then William looks 
           across the fire to where Deborah sits by herself.
           He keeps talking with Scott, but his eyes drift back to her, 
           the flames between them, and something builds, too strong for 
           either to ignore, and she walks over.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What is it?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I wanted to say thank you.

           He stands and leads her away from the men, so that they won’t 
           be heard.

                                 WILLIAM
                        For what?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Earlier.  With the Captain.

           He looks back at her, his face giving away nothing.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t know what you mean.

           Scott yells behind him--

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Jaffers!  Are you still drinking 
                        like a woman, or do you need 
                        another pint?

           William looks back to see Scott gesturing to his empty beer 
           mug.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m fine.

                                 SCOTT
                        Drinking like a woman it is, then.

           Scott laughs, then goes to refill his mug, joking with the 
           men next to him, the fiddles playing faster. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        Come with me.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Where?

                                 DEBORAH
                        There’s something I want to show 
                        you.

           And without anything further, or waiting for him to respond, 
           she turns and walks away.
           He hesitates, looks around for a moment, back at Scott and 
           the men who are occupied with their jokes, and their beer, 
           none of them watching, so he follows after her.

           She makes her way between the tents, towards the edge of camp 
           and the large field beyond, her path lit by the full moon 
           above, as they come to--

           THE FOREST.

           Where she starts to move between the trees, the sound of the 
           music and men at camp distant now, no more voices, just the 
           low, rhythmic beating of the drums, and the echo of strings, 
           and he calls to her.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Where are you going?  There’s 
                        nothing out here.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I know.

           And she turns, as they stand facing each other, in the 
           moonlight, between the tall oaks reaching up towards the 
           heavens, and the light above.

           And he understands.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ve...
                             (a beat; he swallows, 
                              nervous)
                        I’ve never done it before.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Neither have I.

           She walks closer to him, so that they’re nearly touching, and 
           can feel each other breathing, chests rising and falling, 
           together.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Are you sure?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’ve never been more sure in my 
                        life.

           And there’s one more moment, and his eyes tell her that he 
           wants this, too, and then they start to kiss, lips pressed 
           together, as they awkwardly pull at their clothes.

           Once they’ve taken them off, and they’re both naked, he piles 
           the clothes together to create a make-shift bed, and gently 
           lays her down.
           He moves on top of her, his hand on her cheek, caressing her, 
           as they continue to kiss, the only thing in the world that 
           matters right now.

           And then he pauses.  Looking down at her.  Deep into her 
           eyes.

                                 DEBORAH
                        What’s the matter?

           Another moment, then he smiles.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.

           And then she smiles, too, as they begin to make love, in the 
           clearing, under the tall oak trees, lit by nothing but the 
           light of the moon above.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. CONTINENTAL ENCAMPMENT -- DAWN

           The sun rises in the distance, as a long HORN sounds, and two 
           figures hurry from the forest back across a field towards the 
           camp.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- DAWN

           William and Deborah are dressed again, in the tent that they 
           share in the Continental encampment, hurrying to pack up all 
           their belongings.  

           The horn sounds again in the distance.

                                 WILLIAM
                        The second one’s the signal to 
                        march.

           Deborah nods, and is just about to walk outside when William 
           grabs her and pulls her back behind the flap.

           He moves so that no one can see them, and kisses her again, 
           then looks deep into her eyes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m glad that I met you.  For the 
                        second time.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Sometimes our lives happen in the 
                        strangest of ways, don’t they?
           There’s another moment between them, then she smiles, and he 
           smiles, too, as they both press their uniforms flat and walk 
           outside to join the army.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY

           The Continental Army continues its march; they’re in Virginia 
           now, the heat sweltering as they get further south, chest-
           high cornfields on either side of the road.

           William walks with Scott, though he keeps stealing looks 
           towards Deborah, a few paces ahead of them.

           She’s wiping sweat from her brow, still with that slight limp 
           that she’ll never quite get rid off, and then she hears a 
           soft bird call.

           Behind her, Scott glances around, pausing for a moment, a 
           curious look on his face, then he breaks ranks and sprints 
           into the cornfield.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Scott!!  Where the hell are you 
                        going?

           William waits, but there’s no answer, and Scott doesn’t come 
           back.

           The SOLDIER next to them grins--

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        Must’ve been something he ate.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We all had the same breakfast.

           They keep marching, and Deborah keeps staring at the 
           cornfield, something doesn’t seem right to her, then another 
           bird call.

                                 DEBORAH
                        What was that?

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        Owl?

                                 DEBORAH
                        ... during the day?

           The Soldier shrugs his shoulders, about to answer, when--

           ... BANG, BANG!!
           Two shots ring out, the Soldier falls dead, a hole in his 
           chest, and the second bullet rips through a different 
           soldier’s neck.

           There’s confusion everywhere, muskets swinging up, ready to 
           fire, but there’s no one to fire at, just stalks of corn.

           Deborah’s first reaction is to turn and look at William, and 
           he opens his mouth, too, just about to say something, and as 
           soon as he does--

           ... BANG, BANG, BANG!!!

           A volley explodes from the cornfields on either side in a 
           haze of smoke and deafening noise.

           Musket balls fly towards the Continental Army, and one rips 
           through William’s skull -- exploding bone and brain -- and he 
           collapses to the ground.

                                 DEBORAH
                        NO!!!!!

           A GROUP of plainclothes SOLDIERS jump from where they’ve been 
           hiding in the cornfields and continue shooting as the 
           Continentals scramble to return fire against this faction of 
           LOYALIST AMERICANS.

           Deborah runs through all the chaos and falls to her knees 
           next to William.

                                 DEBORAH
                        William????? 

           But his eyes are already glazed in death, a look of surprise 
           in them, his skull blood-filled and broken, his last words 
           left unsaid.

           That’s how quickly death can happen.

           She stares down at him, a knot rising in her throat, not 
           wanting to believe what her eyes are showing her, then in the 
           distance...

           ... a BATTLE CRY.

                                 LOYALISTS
                        AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

           And the Loyalists begin to CHARGE, from either side of the 
           road, running out of the cornfields, and it’s soon going to 
           be hand-to-hand combat.

           Somewhere in the distance, over the noise of battle, the 
           Captain yells--
                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        ... BAYONETS!!!

           And the Continentals swings their bayonets up, just as the 
           Loyalists crash into their lines with a loud crack, and the 
           fighting turns bloody.

           Deborah’s holding William’s body when she sees THREE 
           LOYALISTS charging at her, BAYONETS levelled, and she grabs 
           her musket, quickly aims, and--

           ... BANG!

           She fires a shot, and the first one goes down, but the other 
           two keep coming -- she drops the musket, reaches into her 
           uniform and pulls her pistol, quickly aims again, and--

           ... BANG!

           The second one goes down -- she’s become a good shot -- but 
           the third keeps charging, almost to her, his mouth open wide 
           in his battle scream.

                                 LOYALIST SOLDIER
                        ... AHHHHHH!!!!

           She looks around in panic, sees William’s Hessian sword and 
           rips it from its sheath, turns to face her attacker, just as 
           he--

           ... THRUSTS!! 

           And she jumps out of the way of the bayonet, then SWINGS the 
           sword, but he parries, turns around, and -- THRUSTS again -- 
           but she dodges, then--

           ... SLICE!

           She cuts him across the back of the legs, and he SCREAMS as 
           he falls to his knees, drops his musket, clutching at his 
           severed hamstrings.

           She stands in front of him, the bloody Hessian sword at her 
           side, and he’s defenseless -- she breathes heavily, chest 
           rising and falling, then--

           SHE HACKS BRUTALLY INTO HIS NECK.

           Blood spurts up her arms, as his body slumps to the ground, 
           broken and dead.

           She stands there for a moment, looking down at him, then back 
           up, searching through the chaos of the battle, until she 
           finds--
           TATUM SCOTT.

           He’s across the fighting from her, stabbing his bayonet into 
           the back of a Continental Soldier, a man that only a few 
           minutes ago was his brother.

           She starts to walk towards him, intent on revenge, the battle 
           still raging all around, but she only has eyes for this 
           traitor, when--

           ... BANG!

           She gasps in surprise as she’s thrown from her feet by a 
           MUSKET BALL that buries itself deep into her right shoulder.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Mmmppphhh.

           She lands heavily, grunting as pain shoots through her body, 
           and her vision distorts for a moment as she looks to her 
           shoulder, sees the blood spilling from the fresh wound.

           Then, in the distance, she sees the silhouette of Scott, as 
           he starts to retreat back towards the cornfields.

                                 DEBORAH
                        No...

           She knows her chance for revenge is slipping away as she 
           tries to struggle to her feet, to go after him, but there’s a 
           LOYALIST SOLDIER running straight towards her.

                                 LOYALIST
                        Ahhhhh!!!

           She scrambles to defend herself, tries to bring the Hessian 
           sword up, but it’s too late, and he swings the blunt end of 
           his rifle, and-- 

           ... THWACK!!

           -- as soon as the butt strikes her face, her head snaps back, 
           and everything goes--

                                                               SLAM TO:

           BLACK.

           And silence.  No more sounds of battle.  Everything’s calm, 
           tranquil.  

           Then, a beating heart, soft at first, then louder.  Voices in 
           the distance.  The harsh intake of breath, and a gulp of air, 
           which--

                                                              SLAMS TO:
           A HOSPITAL TENT.

           Where Deborah sits up in bed, looking around, trying to 
           orient herself; there’s rows of beds next to her, filled with 
           wounded soldiers.

           And then she sees William’s Hessian sword, propped against a 
           chair, and the memory of what happened floods back, along 
           with the pain.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB (O.S.)
                        You’re awake.

           She turns to see Captain Webb walking towards her, from where 
           he’d just been speaking with another wounded soldier in a bed 
           further down.

           She swallows when she sees him coming, and looks down to see 
           that she’s dressed in a hospital gown now, which means that 
           he knows her secret.

           When he reaches her, he nods to the Hessian sword, on the 
           chair next to her bed.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        They found it in your hand when 
                        they carried you here - they tried 
                        to take it away but couldn’t unwrap 
                        your fingers from the handle.

           Deborah’s silent for a moment.  Looking down.  Then back up 
           to the Captain’s eyes.

                                 DEBORAH
                        They weren’t Redcoats.  Who were 
                        they?

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Loyalists.  True-blooded Americans 
                        who’ve turned their backs on their 
                        country to fight in exchange for 
                        money - the lowest and most 
                        pathetic cowards, and the worst 
                        kind of men.

                                 DEBORAH
                        We were marching, and everything 
                        was fine, and... it all happened so 
                        quickly.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        War too often does.

                                 DEBORAH
                        And Scott?  
                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        I suspect he’d been planning it for 
                        awhile now, or something similar, 
                        and I’m sure he’s a much richer man 
                        for it. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        He escaped?

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Back into the fields, to rejoin 
                        with the British, I’m afraid.

           She takes that in, then looks over at William’s sword again, 
           next to her bed, and the Captain does, too.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        It’ll be strange not seeing it at 
                        his side.  
                             (then)
                        He’d been with me since Breed’s 
                        Hill.

           And she realizes, shaking her head, as the tears start coming 
           again...

                                 DEBORAH
                             (softly)
                        I didn’t know anything about him.

           She keeps looking at the sword, living with William’s memory 
           for a little while longer, while it’s still close, and he’s 
           still all around.

           Then, she turns back to the Captain, scared of his answer, 
           but knowing that she has to ask--

                                 DEBORAH
                        What happens now?

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        You’re going to have be a little 
                        more specific than that, I’m 
                        afraid.

           She looks down at the way that she’s dressed, her unbound 
           breasts, the fact that she’s clearly and plainly a woman.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        What?  Do you think the doctors 
                        told me something that I didn’t 
                        already know?  I have two daughters 
                        at home, and I’ve never once 
                        confused them with my sons.  And 
                        besides... you have no apple 
                        beneath your chin.
                                 DEBORAH
                        You... knew?  Then... why... you 
                        could have--

           His eyes flash as he looks at her -- this is something that 
           he, too, believes in his soul.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        I could have done a great many 
                        things, that’s true, but in the 
                        end, I’m just a man, so who am I to 
                        tell someone they aren't able to 
                        fight for their own freedom? 
                             (he leans closer; truly, 
                              deeply feels this)
                        Who we are, and what we’re capable 
                        of, is something that comes 
                        directly from God, and that’s 
                        exactly what we're fighting to 
                        protect, isn’t it?  

           She swallows back her emotion.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Sir...

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        We’re in Virginia now, and almost 
                        to Yorktown.  The Loyalists have 
                        delayed us longer than we would’ve 
                        liked, as I’m sure was their 
                        intent, because the siege has 
                        already begun.  
                             (beat)
                        So get your rest, because I’m going 
                        to need every soldier available to 
                        me if we’re going to stand a chance 
                        of defeating the British once and 
                        for all.  

           He turns and starts to walk away, as she chokes back her 
           emotion--

                                 DEBORAH
                        Captain...?  

           He pauses, turns back.

                                 DEBORAH
                        You didn’t ask me my name.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        You told me you were called Robert, 
                        the first time that we met, isn’t 
                        that right?
                                 DEBORAH
                        Yes, sir.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        Then Robert’s what you’ll be 
                        called.

           And with that, and nothing more, Captain Webb turns and 
           leaves, tears welling in Deborah’s eyes, and emotion rising 
           in her throat, as we....

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD -- VIRGINIA -- MORNING

           The sun rises over the entire Continental Army, Captain 
           Webb’s troops linked with General Washington’s army, and 
           they’re camped on a low hill, above a city on the banks of a 
           wide river, and beyond that, in the distance, the mouth of 
           the great Chesapeake Bay.

           SUPER: Yorktown, Virginia -- October 14th, 1781.

           There’s a fleet of BRITISH SHIPS in the river, and further 
           out, in the Chesapeake, a larger fleet of FRENCH WAR SHIPS, 
           blocking them in.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AMERICAN LINES -- YORKTOWN -- DAY

           CANNON FIRE explodes in the distance, American artillery 
           keeping the British pinned in the fort, and the British 
           returning mortars, Webb’s regiment watching the explosions 
           from a distance.

           Then, from behind them, Deborah walks from the tents, her 
           limp more pronounced, bruises covering her face, and they all 
           turn to look at her.

           Her hair’s gotten longer, her breasts aren’t bound, she’s 
           dressed as a woman. 

           They take her in, and realize that she’s a female soldier 
           among them, with a Hessian sword buckled at her hip, and a 
           musket in her hand.  

           But they’ve all seen her.  And they know her bravery.  And 
           that she’s one of them.

           And so a SOLDIER nods.  And then another.  And then all of 
           them do, as she takes her place among their ranks, just 
           another revolutionary and patriot fighting to make a new 
           world.
           And then, in the distance--

           A WHITE HORSE.

           And we follow with it, as it rides through the Continentals, 
           a twenty-four year old CONTINENTAL OFFICER on its back, until 
           it gets to Captain Webb’s troops, and the Officer dismounts.

           This is ALEXANDER HAMILTON, who was 24 when he fought with 
           the Massachusetts 4th Regiment at Yorktown, a tall man, with 
           a proud chin and sharp eyes.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Captain Webb.  The General sends 
                        his greetings, and he has your 
                        orders.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        What would he command us to do?

           Hamilton turns and looks at all the soldiers watching, their 
           weary and dirt-stained faces, but the looks of pride still in 
           their eyes, and deep in their souls.

           And then he sees Deborah, a woman among these men, and holds 
           her eyes for a long moment -- is he going to say something to 
           her?

           But instead he smiles, and his eyes twinkle, as he turns back 
           to Captain Webb.

                                 HAMILTON
                        The General’s going to attack at 
                        nightfall, with the main army, and 
                        the French forces, too, at the 
                        north side of the fort.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        And we’re to join him?

                                 HAMILTON
                        No.  His attack is going to be a 
                        diversion.  He’ll draw the British 
                        defenses to the north, and then 
                        we’re to attack from this side, 
                        your forces and mine, from the 
                        south.

           A moment, as Captain Webb looks at the south side of the 
           fort, in the distance, then turns back to Hamilton, and he 
           nods.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        You do us honor.
                                 HAMILTON
                        Ready your soldiers, Captain, 
                        because this war is going to end 
                        tonight... 
                             (then; with a devilish 
                              grin)
                        ... which means America begins 
                        tomorrow.

           Then Hamilton climbs back onto his horse, kicks it to a 
           gallop, riding back the way he came, towards the main 
           Continental Army.

           And as Deborah follows him with her eyes, watching as he 
           rides into the distance, readying herself for what’s to 
           come...

                                 DEBORAH (PRE-LAP)
                        You make me strong, and you’re my 
                        bedrock, firm and solid beneath my 
                        feet...

                                                                CUT TO:

           CONTINENTAL TRENCHES (NIGHT).

           A deep and long bunker dug into the field 150 yards from the 
           walls of Yorktown.

           It’s nighttime, and the Continental soldiers are all here, 
           their faces illuminated by flickering light from exploding 
           mortars in the distance.

                                 DEBORAH (O.S.)
                        You’re the castle in which I live; 
                        and you’re my saviour and rescuing 
                        knight, alive in my heart...

           Webb’s at the front of his men, while further down Hamilton 
           waits with his company. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        I receive your courage, because 
                        your courage is best.  I receive 
                        your strength, because your 
                        strength is strongest.  Give us 
                        back our wings today, and let us 
                        fly...

           She finishes the prayer, then tucks her cross back beneath 
           her uniform, one more time, and looks down at the Hessian 
           sword at her hip.

           She stares at it, remembering William, then--
                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        It’s good that you brought it - 
                        he’d want it here on the 
                        battlefield. 

           She turns to look at the Continental soldier next to her, 
           watching as she looks down at the sword.

           Then he sees her hand, at her side now, shaking as she tries 
           to flex the tremor out of it.

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        I felt the same way this morning.

                                 DEBORAH
                        The same as what?

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        That today might be the day we’re 
                        asked to give everything.  And I’m 
                        scared of dying, the same as all of 
                        us are, I suspect.  But then I 
                        realized I’m only scared of dying 
                        in every way a man might die, 
                        except for one.

           She meets his eyes--

                                 DEBORAH
                        And what way’s that?

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        For my country.  

           They stand there looking at each other for a moment, then -- 
           BOOM, BOOM, BOOM -- explosions rock the north end of the 
           fort.

           Webb peers over the top, and watches as the French and 
           Continental Armies launch their false offensive against the 
           main British forces.

           Then he comes back down into the trench, and turns to his 
           soldiers, looks each of them in the eye as he addresses them.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        I’ve fought with many of you for a 
                        long time now.  We’ve marched 
                        together.  We’ve bled together.  
                        We’ve buried our brothers together.  
                        And I couldn’t be prouder to be 
                        your Captain.

           He looks among his men, tears welling in eyes, as they stand 
           tall together.
           There’s more EXPLOSIONS in the distance, increasing in 
           frequency.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        There’s a storm inside all of us... 
                        inside every soul that’s been born 
                        into this land that we now fight to 
                        call our own.  And some of us will 
                        be wounded.  Some of us will never 
                        leave this battlefield again once 
                        the bloody dawn finally comes... 
                        but how few in history have been 
                        given an opportunity such as the 
                        one that we now have before us? 
                             (stronger; steel in his 
                              voice)
                        And before we leave this trench, 
                        and go over these walls, together, 
                        as countrymen - and as Americans - 
                        even though many of us might die 
                        here tonight, first...

           He finds Deborah among the soldiers.  Meets her eyes.  It’s 
           her that’s taught him this.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        ... first we’re going to live.

           His soldiers look back at him, with love and pride, and they 
           nod, as one of them says:

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        Don’t tread on me.

           And the rest take it up, too, Deborah with them: “Don’t tread 
           on me, don’t tread on me, don’t tread on me.” 

           The words are on everyone’s lips, passing between them, as 
           further down the trench Hamilton raises his sword high in the 
           air.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Revolutionaries!  

           They all turn to look at him -- every eye in the trench 
           watching.

                                 HAMILTON
                        For our freedom, and for America, 
                        born here tonight on this 
                        battlefield...

           Then he brings his sword down and yells as loud as he’s ever 
           yelled--

                                 HAMILTON
                        ... CHARGE!!!
           And then with their own battle cries, lifting up above them, 
           the American soldiers pour over the walls of the trench, and 
           onto--

           THE BATTLEFIELD.

           Where they charge as one towards the fort in the distance, 
           Deborah struggling to keep up, with her limp and wounded leg.

           BANG, BANG, BANG!!!

           Musket fire pierces the night sky now as the Americans keep 
           running, then--

           ... KABOOM, KABOOM!!!

           Artillery shells explode around them, giant craters on the 
           battlefield, and death comes as limbs are severed from 
           bodies, then--

           ... KABOOM, KABOOM!!!

           Shells coming from the Continental lines are lobbed at the 
           fort -- huge holes blown in the walls as the mortars find 
           their targets -- just as the first wave of Americans get to 
           the outer defenses, and start to scale the hastily made six 
           foot fortifications.

           Deborah’s still lagging behind when the first Continental 
           soldiers reach the redoubts, and start to climb up and over 
           them.

           Hamilton’s leading the assault, and as soon as he and his men 
           get to the top, they jump over, and drop down inside--

           THE FORT.

           Where they fire as soon as their feet hit the ground -- BANG, 
           BANG, BANG!!! -- quickly taking out the British soldiers 
           defending the wall, though one YOUNG REDCOAT slips away 
           through the buildings.

           And as Hamilton and his men kill a few more not-yet-dead 
           Redcoats, they turn and start to fight their way to the 
           sparsely defended southern gate. 

                                 HAMILTON
                        GET THE GATE OPEN!!!  LET THE REST 
                        INSIDE!!!

           And Hamilton’s men kill the last few Redcoats as they reach 
           the gate, and push the large doors open, as we go-- 

                                                               BACK TO:
           THE BATTLEFIELD.

           Where more shells explode with deafening thunder, and more 
           Continentals fall, and then Webb sees the gates opening and 
           yells at the top of his lungs--

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        MASSACHUSETTS!!  THIS WAY!! 

           And as he leads his soldiers forward, through the gunfire and 
           mortars and past the failing redoubts, Continentals pouring 
           into Yorktown, Deborah among them--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. YORKTOWN -- NORTH SIDE -- NIGHT

           The far side of the fort, where we find Lord Cornwallis with 
           his Commanders around him, giving orders for the defense of 
           the northern battlements.

           The British forces are being SHELLED by French artillery, 
           then a mortar blows a HUGE HOLE in the fortifications, and 
           Cornwallis yells--

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        More men down to the breach!  NOW!!  
                        Defend the fortifications with 
                        everything that we have! 

           The Commander and a few other men scramble to follow their 
           orders, as Cornwallis takes out his SPYGLASS. 

           He looks at the area where the American and French Commanders 
           are, behind their lines, and sees the distinct outline of a 
           figure that could very well be George Washington, silhouetted 
           by smoke and flames.

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                             (sotto)
                        What’s your move, Washington?  
                        What’s your game?

           And then, as Cornwallis puts the spyglass away, someone calls 
           from the distance--

                                 YOUNG REDCOAT
                        Lord Cornwallis!

           The Young Redcoat that we saw fleeing from the southern 
           garrison runs to him, his face covered in dirt and blood, he 
           even forgets to bow.

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        What is it?
                                 YOUNG REDCOAT
                        The Continentals, sir - they’ve 
                        breached the south end of the fort.

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        That’s not possible.

                                 YOUNG REDCOAT
                        It is, sir.  I’ve seen it.  They’re 
                        inside the walls.

           Cornwallis spins around, brings the SPYGLASS back and puts it 
           to his eye to see the American forces, led by Hamilton and 
           Webb, breaching the redoubts, and pouring inside the southern 
           gate.

           He’s breathless for a moment, knowing what this means, then 
           turns back--

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        Who’s your Commander?

                                 YOUNG REDCOAT
                        O’Hara, sir.

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        Find him and tell him to take his 
                        company and defend the south end of 
                        the fort.

           The Young Redcoat salutes, then runs off towards the 
           fighting, to do as Cornwallis has commanded, and as 
           Cornwallis turns back--

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE SOUTHERN END (YORKTOWN).

           Where American soldiers fire their muskets at the token 
           British Garrison that’s left, and the Redcoats in front of 
           them fall, bullets piercing flesh, and among the Continental 
           ranks we find Deborah.

           She takes aim, a British soldier in her sights, pulls the 
           trigger, and there’s an explosion from her musket as the 
           Redcoat dies.

           She runs to him, grabs his already-loaded musket as she 
           slings her own discharged rifle over her shoulder for later, 
           then sees Captain Webb at the front of their company, leading 
           them personally.

           BANG, BANG, BANG!!!
           He fires, with his soldiers, and more American bullets tear 
           through British flesh, and then the resistance is all but 
           gone. 

           Hamilton’s at the front of everyone, and he turns and looks 
           further into the fort, through the buildings, and his eyes go 
           wide, as he yells--

                                 HAMILTON
                        REFORM!!!  REFORM!!!  EVERYONE BACK 
                        TOGETHER!!!

           Then Deborah sees it, too -- the Young Redcoat, and General 
           O’Hara, jogging towards them with a massive company of 
           British reinforcements.

           And with General O’Hara’s troops the British now outnumber 
           the Continentals two to one.

                                 HAMILTON
                        ON MY COMMAND!!!

           But even with these odds, the Americans will still fight, 
           with everything they have in them, as Hamilton draws a sword 
           and raises it high in the air.

                                 HAMILTON
                        READY!!!

           All the American soldiers form a line, some reloading, 
           Deborah among the ones standing at the back, behind a line 
           kneeling in front, and there’s a soldier next to her from 
           Hamilton’s company.

                                 HAMILTON
                        AIM!!!

           He glances at her, and she looks like a girl now, not 
           bothering to hide it anymore.

           He’s about to open his mouth, then sees the look in her eyes, 
           the fire -- and she nods -- and he waits a moment, then he 
           nods, too.

           They turn back and aim together at the British that are 
           forming in front of them, as Hamilton yells--

                                 HAMILTON
                        ... FIRE!!!

           BILLOWS OF SMOKE, AND -- BANG, BANG, BANG!!! -- AMERICAN 
           BULLETS TEAR THROUGH THE BRITISH SOLDIERS, AND A SCORE OF 
           THEM FALL, DEAD.

           But the rest are still very much alive.
                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        READY!!!

           Deborah watches as across from them, GENERAL O’HARA raises 
           his own sword, and--

                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        FIRE!!!

           The most horrifying moment of a soldier’s life -- to stand 
           stationary as a wall of bullets flies at your body and 
           there’s nothing to do except pray.

           ... THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.

           British bullets find their targets, and the two men on either 
           side of Deborah fall, but she’s spared.

                                 HAMILTON
                        BAYONETS!!!

           Deborah looks around, and sees the dead men next to her, and 
           the dead men in front of her, then Captain Webb picks up 
           Hamilton’s cry-- 

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        BAYONETS!!!  MASSACHUSETTS MEN, 
                        BAYONETS!!!

           There’s a few more shots -- BANG, BANG!! -- two more 
           Americans fall, then--

                                 HAMILTON
                        CHARGE!!!

           The Americans scream their battle cries, then charge towards 
           the British across from them -- bayonets levelled -- and 
           Deborah raises the Hessian sword, as she charges and screams 
           with them--

                                 DEBORAH
                        AHHHHHHHHH!!!

           The British brace themselves for impact, as General O’Hara 
           moves towards the back of his men, so that he doesn’t see any 
           of the action, contrary to Hamilton and Webb who are leading 
           the American charge themselves, and are the first men to slam 
           into--

           THE BRITISH LINES.

           Where the two sides meet in a dizzying clash of upended 
           bodies and both sides start to hack and slice with blades and 
           bayonets.
                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        STAND STRONG!!!  STAND STRONG!!!  
                        GIVE NO QUARTER!!!

           And when the British hear their commander, they gather 
           themselves, and begin to fight back against the Continental 
           surge.

           Deborah is caught in the mass of bodies, and then they part 
           and she finds herself face to face with a British soldier, as 
           he SWINGS--

           ... SLICE!!!

           -- and she JUMPS out of the way, and his blade goes wide as 
           he pulls his sword back around, one more swing at her head, 
           and she PARRIES.

           Then she backs up, both breathing heavy as they take the 
           measure of the other, and he cocks his head to the side, a 
           mocking smile on his face when he sees who it is that he’s 
           fighting--

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        ... a girl???  

           And then Deborah CHARGES -- SWINGS at his head -- and he 
           ducks, hits her in the face with the butt of his weapon, and 
           she stumbles backwards.

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        If you bloody Rebels are enlisting 
                        your kitchen maids, then things 
                        must really be desperate.

           Deborah wipes the blood from her nose, as she looks up at him 
           with murder in her eyes, and they begin to circle each other.

           She’s focused, and then CHARGES -- SWINGS, and he PARRIES -- 
           then she feigns going low, slicing at his legs, and when he 
           tries to parry, she spins, and he brings his blade up, but 
           it’s too late, as--

           SHE STABS HIM IN THE HEART.

           The Hessian sword pierces all the way through his chest and 
           protrudes from his back, and his eyes go wide as he looks 
           down at his death.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Not bad for a kitchen maid, eh?

           And then Deborah rips the sword out, and the British 
           soldier’s body falls.
           She looks back to the fighting, and sees a British soldier 
           reloading his musket, packing bullet and powder, and as he 
           raises the barrel, aims at her--

           ... BANG!!!

           He fires as Deborah dives out of the way, and the shot goes 
           wide, but she’s off-balance, and he charges--

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        AHHHH!!!

           And she tries to defend herself, but he swings his musket, 
           knocks the sword from her hands, then slams the barrel into 
           her midsection, and she falls.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Mmmpphhhh.

           She’s sprawled in the dirt, and looks up, his bayonet raised 
           over her head, about to come down and end her life, as she 
           reaches inside her uniform, pulls out her pistol, and--

           ... BANG!!!

           The soldier falls with a bullet in his chest, and she stands 
           and picks her sword up, runs him through for good measure, 
           then turns to see--

           Another SOLDIER.

           Who sprints at her, his bayonet levelled, and in one neat 
           move she swipes it away, then slashes him across the back of 
           the legs.

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        AHHHHHH!!!

           He falls in pain, grabbing at his hamstrings, and just as he 
           does--

           Behind him, from where he just came from, there’s another 
           Redcoat with a loaded musket, aimed at her.

           ... BANG!!!

           The shot rings out, and before she can react -- the musket 
           ball tears through her shoulder and knocks her from her feet.

           The soldier whose legs she sliced crawls over on top of her, 
           a knife in his hand, and he tries to bring it down on her 
           throat, but she grabs his wrist.

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        Little Rebel bitch...
           He spits as she wrestles with him, but he’s stronger than she 
           is, and her shoulder’s spilling blood, and losing strength, 
           and just as the knife’s almost to her neck...

           ... a BAYONET BLADE appears through his chest, and his eyes 
           bulge as he falls off her, and she sees a Continental soldier 
           above them.

           The Soldier reaches out, grabs her hand and pulls her to her 
           feet, then turns and heads back into the fray.

           Deborah catches her breath for a moment, then limps after 
           him, blood coming from her left shoulder, but she’s come too 
           far to give up the fight now.

           BEHIND THE BRITISH.

           General O’Hara surveys the fighting, and after the initial 
           surge, his men have started to fight back fiercely, but 
           they’re being overrun.

           They don’t have the same heart or spirit as the men that 
           they’re fighting against, or the same justness of cause as 
           their enemy-- 

           And it shows.

           Then as more and more British are cut down, and the Americans 
           will soon overrun them, O’Hara turns to the soldier next to 
           him--

                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        Call for the militia.  Quickly.  
                        Let’s let these “Americans” kill 
                        each other.

           And the soldier salutes, and runs into the night, deeper into 
           the fort, as we go--

                                                               BACK TO:

           DEBORAH.

           As she fights with the Continentals, sporadic gunshots all 
           around as she sees a Continental locked in a brawl with a 
           Redcoat, and runs over--

           ... SLICE!!!

           She cuts the Redcoat across the back, and he falls to the 
           ground with a loud scream, then she turns to survey the 
           battle.
           They’re winning, pushing the Redcoats back, but then from the 
           darkness, a drum beat begins, and then another Company joins 
           the British regiment, plainclothes soldiers that she’s seen 
           before.

           It’s the Loyalist Militia.

           Her eyes turn to steel.  She searches through them as they 
           aim their muskets, and -- BANG, BANG, BANG!!! -- they fire 
           and the front line of American soldiers fall in a bloody 
           heap.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        ... CHARGE!!!

           And Webb leads the American cry as they rush towards the 
           militia -- and the two sides meet -- the Continentals already 
           battle-weary, and the Loyalists fresh.

           ... HACK, SLASH, SLICE!!!

           The mud now turns red with blood, as men from both sides 
           fall.

           Deborah’s in the middle of the fray, doing her part, but also 
           frantically searching through the enemy, looking for one 
           soldier in particular.

           And then she finds him.

                                 DEBORAH
                        SCOTT!!!!

           She yells, but he doesn’t hear as he cuts down a Continental 
           with his bayonet, then takes out a knife and STABS him in the 
           throat.

           Then he turns, and sees Deborah coming at him, and he grins 
           as he takes her in--

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, look at that - who would’ve 
                        guessed...

           But she has only one thing on her mind, and no time for 
           words, as she--

           ... SWINGS!!!

           And he ducks her sword, and her blow goes wide, as he notices 
           the blade she’s carrying.

                                 SCOTT
                        Did your boyfriend give that to 
                        you?  He didn’t die well, in the 
                        end, did he?  The filthy traitor...
           And she CHARGES -- he dodges her, she rushes past -- and he 
           SLICES across her midsection, and blood flows from her 
           stomach.

                                 DEBORAH
                        AHHHHHHH!!!!

           She looks down, notes her bleeding, then back up to see the 
           mocking sneer on his face.

                                 SCOTT
                        I knew there was something weak 
                        about you.

                                 DEBORAH
                        You’re a bastard and a coward.  And 
                        you chose the wrong side.

                                 SCOTT
                        No.  I chose the side that paid me 
                        more, the same as any wise man 
                        would do.  They call this a 
                        revolution, but no matter what they 
                        call it, war’s always been a 
                        business, and you should have stuck 
                        to sewing our uniforms, where you 
                        belonged.

           She charges again -- SWINGS!!! -- but he ducks, and knees her 
           in the stomach, knocking the breath from her, then he knocks 
           the sword from her hand, and--

           ... CRACK!!!

           He backhands her across the face, so she falls to the ground, 
           spitting blood from cracked lips.

                                 SCOTT
                        They really shouldn’t have sent a 
                        woman to do the work of men.

           He bends down, picks up the Hessian sword from the ground, 
           levels it at her chest.

                                 SCOTT
                        How does it feel, knowing you’re 
                        about to die, and that this was all 
                        for nothing?

                                 DEBORAH
                        You should ask yourself the same 
                        question.

           Deborah reaches into her uniform, takes out her pistol, 
           points it at him, cocks the hammer and glares into his eyes.

           And now there’s fear.
                                 SCOTT
                        No.  Wait...

                                 DEBORAH
                        You’re a traitor, and the worst 
                        kind of man.  And now it’s the end.

           She stands, holding the pistol pointed at him, and he sees 
           his death in front of him -- doesn’t realize that the 
           pistol’s not loaded -- then--

           ... KABOOM!!!

           There’s a huge EXPLOSION from an artillery shell that knocks 
           Deborah from her feet, and as she falls, Scott sees his 
           chance and starts to run.

           Deborah looks up from the ground, knows she can’t catch him, 
           not with her limp, then sees the soldier next to her, the one 
           she killed earlier.

           She picks up his musket, drops to one knee and carefully 
           takes aim at Scott’s back as he runs, she’ll only have one 
           shot at this.

                                 DEBORAH
                             (sotto)
                        Lord, please hear my prayer, and 
                        guide my hand, and help my bullet 
                        fly straight...

           And she hesitates for a moment, her finger hovering over the 
           trigger, then she squeezes, and--

           ... BANG!!!

           Flint sparks powder, and the musket explodes a cloud of 
           smoke, as the bullet flies through the air, making its way 
           through the battle until it buries itself in Scott’s back, 
           and he falls.

           She drops the musket, and picks up the Hessian sword, and 
           walks to where he’s crawling in the mud, and steps on him 
           with her boot.

           He turns and looks up at her, into her clear blue eyes, which 
           have never had more fire, or more strength.

                                 SCOTT
                        Please... I’m sorry... I’ll give 
                        you more money than you could 
                        possibly imagine... I have that 
                        now... I’ll show you my purse... 
                        please... please... I’ll make you 
                        rich...
           She sees him slobbering, begging, and it disgusts her, as she 
           shakes her head, the tip of her sword hovering over his 
           throat.

                                 DEBORAH
                        You deserve worse.

           And he opens his mouth, about to beg and plead, but she wants 
           none of it, and--

           ... SHHFFFTT!!

           She thrusts down, her blade piercing his neck, and blood 
           pools in his mouth as he chokes, writhing in pain, and then 
           he finally lies still, eyes glazed in death.

           And then, after a moment, Deborah turns to survey the battle, 
           and sees the militia being pushed back now, as well as the 
           British regulars.

           The Americans cheer, as they start to win the day, and see 
           victory within their grasp, overrunning their enemies, as we 
           go--

                                                               BACK TO:

           THE BRITISH LINES.

           And General O’Hara, standing behind the last men he has left, 
           watching his soldiers cut down by the Continentals, their 
           lines folding on themselves.

                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        My God...

           And then -- BANG! -- a musket ball flies close to his head, 
           and he ducks, the closest he’s been to action, and it shakes 
           him.

           He waits one more moment, then turns from the fighting and 
           hurries back across the fort, heading towards--

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE NORTH SIDE (YORKTOWN).

           Where Cornwallis is still giving orders for the defense of 
           the fort against Washington’s army, and the French that are 
           fighting with him.

                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        Sir...

           Cornwallis turns to sees General O’Hara, out of breath, in 
           front of him.
                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        We fought, as well as we could, my 
                        Lord, but I’m afraid we couldn’t 
                        push them back... 

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        What the hell do you mean?  You had 
                        twice their numbers!

                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        It wasn’t the numbers, it was...
                             (then; almost awe in his 
                              voice)
                        ... it was the way that they 
                        fought...

           It’s the only way that O’Hara can explain it, and all he can 
           do is shrug.

           Cornwallis stands staring at O’Hara for a moment longer, then 
           turns to the south side of the fort, and looks for himself, 
           with his spyglass-- 

           And he sees the last few British soldiers defeated, their 
           numbers dwindling down to nothing, the pride of the Americans 
           swelling with every step they take.

           Cornwallis puts the spyglass away, then stands in silence for 
           a moment, before he looks at the ground, a proud man that’s 
           been broken.

                                 GENERAL O’HARA
                        What are your orders, sir?

           Cornwallis still looks at the ground, lost in his thoughts, 
           and perhaps what his place in history will be now, after 
           what’s happened tonight.

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                             (sotto)
                        Is this how it ends?  Is this how 
                        an empire falls?

           Another moment of silence, then Cornwallis finally shakes his 
           head.

                                 LORD CORNWALLIS
                        It’s over, General.  Order your men 
                        to retreat...  
                             (then; his eyes turned 
                              down)
                        It’s time to give Washington my 
                        sword.
           And as General O’Hara salutes, and turns to leave, back into 
           the night, Cornwallis looks out again, on his failure, 
           everywhere in front of him...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE SOUTH END (YORKTOWN).

           Where the Americans are finishing off the last of the British 
           Soldiers and Loyalist Militia, the ground littered with three 
           times as many enemy dead as Continentals.

           Deborah staggers along, still fighting, she’s losing a lot of 
           blood from her shoulder, and her stomach, but she won’t give 
           up.

           And just as fierce as the fighting had once been, in a 
           moment, it suddenly seems to stop.

           Then, in the distance--

                                 BRITISH SOLDIERS
                        RETREAT!!!! RETREAT!!!! RETREAT!!!!

           The call spreads among the British soldiers at the south end, 
           and then echoes through Yorktown, so everyone hears, as the 
           Americans watch their enemies turn and run.

           Hamilton smiles from ear-to-ear, as he shakes the hands of 
           men all around him.  Webb breathes heavily, covered in mud 
           and dirt and blood.  

           And Deborah bends down, to her knees, and picks up a handful 
           of dirt.

           Then she stands, lets the dirt slip through her fingers, 
           watching it fall, as a Continental Soldier nearby notices, 
           and asks--

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        What’s that?

           The last of the dirt falls back to the ground, and she waits 
           another moment, then turns and looks at him. 

           And then she smiles.

                                 DEBORAH
                        It’s ours.

           And as the Continental Soldier smiles, too, and trumpets 
           sound in the distance, signalling the surrender of the entire 
           British Army...

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. BATTLEFIELD -- YORKTOWN -- MORNING

           Sunlight spills across the bloody battlefield as the BRITISH 
           COMMANDERS ride out from Yorktown, and then the CONTINENTAL 
           COMMANDERS ride from their army to meet them in the middle of 
           the field.

           We watch this from afar, and though we don’t see them 
           individually, among the Americans are Alexander Hamilton, 
           Nathanael Greene, and George Washington, and they ride to 
           meet O’Hara and the British.

           (NOTE: Lord Cornwallis claimed he was sick on the day of the 
           surrender and sent General O’Hara to give his sword to 
           Washington in his place)

           And as the Americans reach the British, and stop riding, and 
           the formal ceremony of surrender begins, both armies 
           watching...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MEDICAL TENT -- YORKTOWN -- MORNING

           Deborah sits in a hospital bed, still muddy and covered in 
           blood, and there’s a bandage on her face as a NURSE works on 
           her shoulder.

           The Nurse pries the bullet from where it’s still embedded 
           deep in Deborah’s muscle, and she grimaces as the Nurse 
           works.

                                 NURSE
                        Almost there.  Almost there now, 
                        almost got it out...

           And then the bullet comes loose, and the Nurse binds a 
           bandage over the small hole as she drops the bullet in a pan 
           nearby.

                                 NURSE
                        You handled that well.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’ve had some practice.

           The bandage is tied off, and the Nurse smiles as she puts 
           Deborah’s arm in a sling.

                                 NURSE
                        It cut through a lot of the muscle - 
                        so it’s a good thing it was your 
                        left shoulder, instead of the 
                        right.
           Then, the Nurse is finished, and just as she’s about to 
           leave, she pauses, turns back.

                                 NURSE
                        Thank you.  For fighting for us.  
                        For all of us.

           A moment, as Deborah meets the older woman’s eyes, then she 
           nods.

           And after one last smile, the Nurse leaves, and Deborah lays 
           back in her bed.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB (O.S.)
                        We need to stop meeting like 
                        this...

           Deborah turns to see Captain Webb walking towards her, still 
           covered in dirt and blood, too, he’s been speaking with his 
           wounded soldiers.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        I saw you fighting, and I wanted to 
                        say thank you... for proving me 
                        right.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I didn’t do anything that any of 
                        the other soldiers didn’t.

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        I know, Robert.  But I don’t think 
                        even you really believes that.

           They wait there for a moment, such respect between them, then 
           the Captain takes a sealed letter from his jacket and hands 
           it to her.

                                 DEBORAH
                        What’s this?

                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        A summons for you.  To see the 
                        General.
                             (beat)
                        It’s above me, now.

           She looks down at it, and sees George Washington’s personal 
           seal, and nods.

           Then she looks back up, and meets the Captain’s eyes, one 
           last time.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Thank you.  For letting me do my 
                        part.
                                 CAPTAIN WEBB
                        No, Robert.  
                             (beat)
                        It’s we who thank you.

           Then, after one more look between them, the Captain stands 
           back from her bed, and he salutes her crisply, before he 
           turns and leaves. 

           And as tears well in her eyes...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD -- YORKTOWN -- DAY

           Deborah walks among the soldiers, her face bandaged, her arm 
           in a sling.

           Her hair’s grown longer, and she hasn’t bound her breasts for 
           some time now.

           The men look at her as she passes, and then nod to her, 
           because they saw her fighting, too -- and now she’s one of 
           them.

           And she keeps walking, through the men, until she finally 
           comes to--

           A LARGE TENT.

           Where two CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS stand guard at the entrance, 
           and she walks to them, hands them the summons that Captain 
           Webb gave her.

           They look at it, then--

                                 CONTINENTAL SOLDIER
                        He’s waiting for you.

           She pauses for a moment, gathering herself, then takes a deep 
           breath as she walks inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GENERAL WASHINGTON’S TENT -- YORKTOWN -- DAY

           Deborah walks in to see across from her, sitting behind a 
           large desk, the man who by this point was already an American 
           legend.

           GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON (50): an enormous man for his time, 
           standing 6’2, takes his reading glasses off and looks up as 
           she enters.
           He stands and takes her in, every inch of her, from toes to 
           head, then--

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You’re taller than I thought you’d 
                        be.

           Deborah bows in front of him, but he walks around from his 
           desk and puts a hand on her shoulder, stopping her, a small 
           smile on his face.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Please.  Don’t bow.  One bows to a 
                        king, and that’s what we’ve been 
                        fighting so hard to rid ourselves 
                        of, isn’t it?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Sir...

           He pauses.  Still looking back at her.  Not quite sure yet 
           what to make of her.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        When did you enlist in the army? 

                                 DEBORAH
                        In April, sir.  In Massachusetts.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        And you told them your name was 
                        “Robert Shurtleff,” from what I 
                        gather.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        And what was your name before that? 
                        Before you enlisted?

           A moment, then--

                                 DEBORAH
                        It was Deborah, sir.  
                             (beat)
                        Deborah Sampson.

           General Washington looks back at her, and it’s almost as if 
           he’s looking through her, his eyes penetrating to her very 
           soul.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        What I’ve been trying to figure 
                        out, since I first heard your 
                        story, and who you were, was why do 
                        what you did?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                        Why go through all the trouble of 
                        deceiving so many, just to carry a 
                        rifle with these men?

           She pauses for a moment, gathering herself, and then meets 
           his eyes and speaks from deep within her soul.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’d always felt it, sir.  Deep 
                        inside of me.  What it would mean 
                        to have this country, for all of 
                        us.
                             (thinking back, tears 
                              welling)
                        And then it was something someone 
                        said to me once.  “Life is 
                        precious,” they said, “and what we 
                        do with our lives matters.”  I 
                        heard that, sir, and well... 
                             (beat)
                        I suppose I wanted my life to 
                        matter.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        And you thought that one soldier 
                        could make a difference in all 
                        this, among all the many thousands 
                        that are fighting?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Yes, sir.  I did.  Because it would 
                        make a difference to me.

           He holds her eyes for a moment, digesting this, unexpectedly 
           moved and emotional.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I have no sons or daughters of my 
                        own.  Nor will I.  Instead, I ask 
                        the people of this land to send 
                        their sons to me, to march and 
                        bleed and risk everything they have 
                        for this idea that we’ve been 
                        fighting for.

                                 DEBORAH
                        They do it gladly, sir.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I hope that’s true, Ms. Sampson.  
                        More than anything, I do hope 
                        that’s true...

           Another moment between them, then Washington goes to his 
           desk, and picks up a letter.

           He walks over and hands it to her.
                                 DEBORAH
                        What’s this?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Your discharge.

           She looks back at him, and tears begin to well in her eyes, 
           and he softens the blow.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You were shot in the leg at 
                        Tarrytown.  And then in the 
                        shoulder, on the march to Yorktown, 
                        and again in the other shoulder 
                        yesterday.
                             (beat)
                        You should have been sent home on 
                        medical leave months ago, and any 
                        lesser soldier most certainly would 
                        have been.
                             (then)
                        This is an honorable discharge from 
                        the Continental Army with full 
                        commendation for your service.

           The tears start to come down her cheeks now, as she looks 
           back at him.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        For what?  You’re a soldier of the 
                        Revolution.  A treasonous Rebel, 
                        like all the rest of us, and I 
                        suppose now...
                             (beat)
                        Well, I suppose now we’re all 
                        finally Americans, too, aren’t we?

           And then he smiles, and she smiles, too, as she salutes, and 
           turns to the exit.

           But, before she goes--

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Ms. Sampson...

           She pauses, and turns back to him, meets his eyes.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        As soon as you walk out of this 
                        tent, Robert Shurtleff is going to 
                        cease to exist.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                        But unless I’m very mistaken, what 
                        he did is going to matter, a great 
                        deal, and perhaps even more than 
                        either of us will ever know.  
                             (beat)
                        So your country thanks you for your 
                        service.

           And then, with one last nod, and a final salute, she turns 
           back to the exit, and pauses for a moment, thinking about 
           what the General just said. 

           Then, a small smile crosses her lips, just for herself, and 
           for what she’s done, as she pushes the flap open and walks 
           back outside, into the light.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TENT -- MILITARY ENCAMPENT -- DAY

           Where Deborah’s finally alone in her tent, and she slowly 
           takes off her uniform jacket, it’s still muddy, torn, stained 
           with blood, and she carefully folds it as it is, not changing 
           anything.

           Then she takes William’s Hessian sword, and gently puts it on 
           top of her folded jacket, then opens a trunk and sets both 
           inside.

           She looks down at them for a long moment, and then as she 
           closes the trunk...

                                                               FADE TO:

           A LARGE FIELD.

           Filled with long rows of corn at the end of a growing season 
           that’s been too hot and dry, the stalks are withered, the sun 
           beating down on them.

           And in the field a FARMER works under the hot sun, with his 
           son (EARL, 8) next to him, this is:

           BENJAMIN GANNETT (34).

           He stands and looks into the distance, across the field, to 
           where a tall woman with a pronounced limp walks towards him, 
           their daughter next to her.

           SUPER: Sharon, Massachusetts -- September 20th, 1804.

           Deborah’s face is lined with age, and when she reaches 
           Benjamin, she smiles, kisses him on the lips as she surveys 
           the field and he wipes his brow.
                                 DEBORAH
                        How’s it been?

                                 BENJAMIN 
                        Long.  And it’s still hot.  But 
                        with Earl’s help here we’re going 
                        to manage.

           Benjamin ruffles Earl’s hair, as Deborah lets go of their 
           daughter’s hand, and she runs off to play with her brother in 
           the field.

           They look at the children, and then speak softer, so they 
           don’t hear.

                                 DEBORAH
                        You’re not going to be able to do 
                        it all, are you? 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Not before winter, no.  But we’ll 
                        do the best we can.

           Deborah and Benjamin watch the children for another moment, 
           then Deborah turns to her husband, and there’s sadness in her 
           eyes, and his, too.

                                 DEBORAH
                        It won’t be enough.  And you don’t 
                        have a wife that’s able enough to 
                        help.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        You took three bullets.  I’m just 
                        thankful that you’re alive, and we 
                        found each other, and now there’s 
                        peace again, and will be for our 
                        children.

           And he smiles, and kisses her again; it’s a good man that 
           she’s found.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        We’ll find a way to manage, 
                        Deborah.  Like we always have.

           She turns to look at their children, still playing in the 
           corn, and she wants to believe her husband, but they both 
           know he’s just trying to be strong--

                                 DEBORAH
                        Can you watch them for the 
                        afternoon?  

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What’s the matter?
                                 DEBORAH
                        Nothing, I just... I have an 
                        appointment in the city.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I can go with you, if you’d like.

                                 DEBORAH
                        And let the fields go untended?  We 
                        can’t.  

           And he looks back at her, and sees her eyes, and he nods, 
           knowing his wife, and the look on her face, and she kisses 
           him on the cheek. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        I love you.

           Then she turns and starts back towards their farmhouse, in 
           the distance, as Benjamin watches her go before turning back 
           to his work.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM -- GANNETT HOUSE -- DAY

           Deborah walks into the bedroom and goes to the closet where 
           she moves clothes aside, then pulls a chest forward that we 
           recognize.

           She lifts the lid, opens it and looks down, sees her uniform, 
           still folded neatly with blood stained on it, and the Hessian 
           sword, dusty from the years, but unmistakable, and then next 
           to them, the Gadsden Flag that the Farmer’s son gave to her 
           on the road to Yorktown.

           And as she looks down at everything, so much history in such 
           a small box...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREETS -- BOSTON -- DAY

           Deborah walks the streets of Boston, the same as she once did 
           as a younger woman, though now she’s wearing her uniform of 
           the Continental Army with three holes in it; one in each 
           shoulder, and the thigh.  

           She looks around and sees that the city’s changed -- the 
           promise and spirit that it once held has been realized; 
           there’s pride in the air, and in the people’s eyes, and the 
           way that they walk.
           People turn to look at her as she walks past them, a woman 
           wearing the uniform of a soldier, something strictly reserved 
           for men.

           And she keeps going, through the streets, until she finally 
           comes to-- 

           THE BOSTON COURTHOUSE.

           Where she stops in front of it, looking up at the tall 
           building, then down at the pocket watch she carries, checking 
           the time.

           Then she puts the watch away, and takes out her cross, the 
           same one she’s always worn around her neck, and holds it 
           tightly.

                                 DEBORAH
                             (sotto)
                        Please, Lord, lend me your strength 
                        today, lend me your strength one 
                        last time...

           And as she continues her prayer, she starts up the steps, 
           head held high, fire in her eyes again, walking as proudly as 
           her limp allows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COURTHOUSE -- BOSTON -- DAY

           Deborah stands in front of a whigged and powdered JUDGE, 
           seated above her, and the pews next to him filled with more 
           similarly dressed men -- and no women -- the jury that will 
           hear her case.

           The Judge has her Continental discharge papers in hand, as 
           well as her enlistment papers, studying both through thick 
           glasses, and then he takes the glasses off and looks up, 
           holding only one of the sheets.

                                 JUDGE
                        And why is it exactly that you 
                        think you deserve to collect a 
                        soldier’s pension? 

                                 DEBORAH
                        Because I was a soldier, sir.
                                 JUDGE
                        Your discharge papers seem to be in 
                        order, but these enlistment papers 
                        are for a Robert Shurtleff - and I 
                        think I can say with absolute 
                        certainty that’s not who stands in 
                        front of the court.

                                 DEBORAH
                        But it is, sir.  I’m Robert 
                        Shurtleff.  

                                 JUDGE
                        Then who’s Deborah Sampson?

                                 DEBORAH
                        I’m her too, sir.

                                 JUDGE
                        And could you please explain to the 
                        court how that’s possible?

           She pauses for a moment, gathering herself, then meets the 
           judge’s eyes.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Robert Shurtleff’s the name I used 
                        so that I could enlist.

                                 JUDGE
                        So you lied on this paper and then 
                        signed it?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Yes, sir.

                                 JUDGE
                        And now you want to be paid for 
                        your dishonesty?

                                 DEBORAH
                        No.  I want to be paid for being a 
                        soldier, which is only what I was 
                        promised.
                             (beat; as the Judge looks 
                              down at her; narrowing 
                              his eyes)
                        I can barely walk some days because 
                        of the bullet I took in the leg at 
                        Tarrytown.  I took two other 
                        bullets, in either shoulder, one at 
                        Yorktown, and the other on the road 
                        there, when we were ambushed. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Who is the “we” that you’re 
                        referring to?
                                 DEBORAH
                        Captain Webb’s company, sir.  The 
                        4th Massachusetts Regiment.  

                                 JUDGE
                        And what is it that you do now, Ms. 
                        Sampson?  After you’ve retired from 
                        your soldiering.

           She notices his mocking tone, but she continues on anyways, 
           because she has to.

                                 DEBORAH
                        We run a farm, sir.  My husband and 
                        me, up in Sharon.  But with my 
                        injuries, I can’t even hold my own 
                        children in my arms, much less be 
                        of any help to him in the fields, 
                        or really in the kitchen, either.  
                        And our children are still small, 
                        so they’re not able to help yet,, 
                        and if we have one more winter like 
                        the last one, then...
                             (she pauses; her emotion 
                              rising)
                        Well, then I’m not sure if we’ll 
                        make it.

           She swallows.  Gathers herself.  Meets the Judge’s eyes with 
           her own.

                                 DEBORAH
                        I lied when I enlisted, sir.  It’s 
                        true, and I don’t deny it.  But I 
                        fought.  Like all the other 
                        soldiers.  And I just want a 
                        pension, the same as the men I 
                        stood and bled with.  Not more, not 
                        less.  That’s all that I’m asking 
                        the court.

           He pauses for a moment, looking back at her, then comes to 
           his decision.

                                 JUDGE
                        While I personally sympathize with 
                        your cause, the court does not find 
                        it possible to reward perjury and 
                        dishonesty with coin, and to do so 
                        would set a very dangerous 
                        precedent.
                             (then)
                        I’m sorry, Ms. Sampson.  But the 
                        law is the law.

           She stares back at him in disbelief, as he’s about to dismiss 
           her, then--
                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Has everything that we fought and 
                        died for been so quickly forgotten - 
                        have we turned our backs already on 
                        those who gave everything for our 
                        freedom?

           Deborah turns to see an old man walking through the pews 
           towards them, and then she recognizes him--

           It’s Paul, the man from the gun shop, who suggested that she 
           buy the screw-barrel pistol that saved her life more than 
           once.

           And the Judge recognizes him, too.

                                 JUDGE
                        What are you doing at the court, 
                        Mr. Revere?

                                 PAUL
                        I saw the notice for Ms. Sampson’s 
                        trial in the ledger, and thought 
                        I’d pop by.

           Deborah turns and looks at him, and he looks back at her with 
           a kindly smile, and a wink-- 

                                 PAUL
                        It’s good to see you again.

           And she realizes that this is infamous Revolutionary hero and 
           patriot Paul Revere...

                                 JUDGE
                        And do you have something else to 
                        add?

                                 PAUL
                        Only that I’d wish for you to 
                        reconsider your position, for your 
                        sake, as well as for Ms. Sampson’s, 
                        too, of course.

                                 JUDGE
                        For my sake?

                                 PAUL
                        You’re standing here before God, 
                        about to levy a gross measure of 
                        injustice, though I’m sure that’s 
                        not your intent.

                                 JUDGE
                        A gross measure of injustice?  She 
                        lied, Mr. Revere.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDGE (CONT'D)
                        She raised her hand, swore an oath 
                        before God, and then broke it.

                                 PAUL
                        We’ve all broken oaths, sir.  Every 
                        single one of us standing in this 
                        room.  And that’s why we’re free, 
                        and this land beneath our feet is 
                        our own.

           A moment, then Paul turns to Deborah, and points at her, as 
           he speaks louder--

                                 PAUL
                        And it took many years, and too 
                        much blood, but it’s soldiers like 
                        the one standing before you that we 
                        have to thank for all that we have 
                        now.

                                 JUDGE
                        She could be lying and making the 
                        whole thing up.  She could have 
                        gotten that uniform from her 
                        brother, or a dead soldier on the 
                        side of the road, or any number of 
                        places.

                                 PAUL
                        You have her discharge papers.  If 
                        I’m not mistaken, they were signed 
                        by General Washington himself. 

                                 JUDGE
                        It’s Washington’s signature, but it 
                        was signed for Robert Shurtleff -  
                        not Deborah Sampson.

                                 PAUL
                        And yet that’s who’s standing 
                        before you, isn’t it?  Robert 
                        Shurtleff.  And also Deborah 
                        Sampson, a soldier of the 
                        Revolution, who fought for all of 
                        us.  Is she a woman?  Of course she 
                        is.  Did she lie when she enlisted?  
                        She did, there’s no denying it.
                             (then; he looks around the 
                              room; meeting every eye 
                              he can find)
                        But let it be said, today, as 
                        clearly as anything has ever been 
                        said... that if even half the men 
                        in this room have as much courage 
                        and strength of heart as this 
                        woman, then well... 
                             (then; softer, and with a 
                              smile)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Well, this will be a very great 
                        country, indeed.

           A moment, all eyes in the room on Paul Revere, and he nods to 
           the Judge.

                                 PAUL
                        Do the right thing, sir.  Do the 
                        right thing, here before God and 
                        the law, and compensate this 
                        soldier for the service she gave to 
                        her country.

           The Judge sits back in his chair, and meets Deborah’s eyes, 
           in front of him, and he looks her up and down, perhaps 
           challenging and changing his idea of who a soldier is, and 
           what it means to be a hero.

           Then he turns to look at his jury, and can see tears 
           glistening in men’s eyes, and already knows what their 
           decision will be...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COURTHOUSE -- BOSTON -- DAY

           Paul Revere and Deborah walk out of the courthouse together, 
           and back onto the streets of Boston, people coming and going 
           around them.

                                 PAUL
                        The pension won’t be much, but it’s 
                        something, and it’ll get your 
                        family through the winter, and 
                        likely the next, too.

           Deborah takes that in, gratefully nodding her head, then 
           turns back to look at him.

                                 DEBORAH
                        When I met you before.  Here in 
                        Boston.  You told me you were a 
                        dentist.

                                 PAUL
                        And I am.

                                 DEBORAH
                        But, your ride... you’re a... 
                        you’re a hero.

                                 PAUL
                        We all are, aren’t we?  All of us 
                        who fought for this country.  
                        Yourself included.  I did my part.  
                        You did your part.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                             (smiles)
                        And now here we are, and it’s truly 
                        a beautiful thing, isn’t it?

           They pause, and look at each other, the infamous harbor in 
           the background, where this all began.

                                 DEBORAH
                        How did you really know to come 
                        today?

                                 PAUL
                        In my old age I’ve made it my 
                        business to have an interest in the 
                        affairs of the veterans of our 
                        Revolution, and your story was of 
                        particular interest to me. 
                             (beat)
                        And, like I told the Judge, I saw 
                        it announced in the ledger.

                                 DEBORAH
                        But you knew me.

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.  But not until I showed up 
                        today.

                                 DEBORAH
                        How?  You saw me for a moment, in a 
                        shop, thirteen years ago - how did 
                        you recognize the same person in 
                        court today?

           He looks back at her, for a moment, and then he smiles, all 
           the way to his eyes.

                                 PAUL
                        In case you haven’t realized it, 
                        yet... you’re quite unforgettable, 
                        Ms. Sampson.

           And then with a tip of his hat, he turns and starts back on 
           his way.

           Deborah waits for a moment, watching as he leaves, then she 
           looks at all the people around her, the smiles on their 
           faces, the lives they’ve built, and the happiness that 
           freedom brings.

           And then she smiles, too, small at first, then bigger, as she 
           walks into the distance, back towards her farm, and her 
           family, and as she does:
           THE CAMERA CRANES UP:

           Above all the buildings of Boston, and we see the entirety of 
           this great city, the place where a Revolution was born, and 
           the people that lived there, and helped make this country 
           their own.

           Then we push in towards what was once a Continental Flag, but 
           is now an AMERICAN FLAG, 15 stars and 15 stripes, sewn in 
           bright and proud colors, snapping in the breeze, high above 
           everything, keeping watch.

           And as we hold here...

                                                               FADE TO:

           TEXT ON THE SCREEN.

           After filing several formal petitions, and with lobbying from 
           Paul Revere, Deborah Sampson finally received her pension, 
           and on her death from Yellow Fever in 1827, her children were 
           issued additional compensation by a Special Act of Congress, 
           “for the relief of the heirs of Deborah Sampson, a soldier of 
           the Revolution.”

           In 1983, Governor Michael Dukakis and the state legislature 
           named Deborah Sampson the Official Heroine of the 
           Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and May 23rd to be known as 
           “Deborah Sampson Day.”

           She’s buried in Rock Ridge Cemetery in Sharon, Massachusetts, 
           where one side of her tombstone reads: “Deborah Sampson, 1760-
           1827,” and the other: 

           “Robert Shurtleff, 1781-1783.”

                                         THE END
