           EXT. HONG KONG FERRY - DAWN

           JASON BOURNE (40s) stands at the front of a ferry. Before him- 
           the Hong Kong Skyline. He’s worn down, exhausted from being 
           chased, a look of steely determination glints in his eyes.

           EXT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAWN

           Bourne reaches the base of the skyscraper. He looks up- fifty 
           floors of metal and glass. 

           He goes into the building, swiping a key card as he does. 

           Around the corner sits an unconscious security guard.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAWN

           Keeping his head down, Bourne enters an elevator. He hits the 
           button marked 48. He stands, shifting in place, watching the 
           lights mark his ascension. 

           The elevator opens. He steps out into the hallway.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAWN

           In the hallway, a YOUNG CLEANING LADY (25) pushes a cart down 
           the hall. The hallways is clean, corporate- the walls made of 
           frosted glass. The Cleaning Lady and Bourne glance at each 
           other for a moment. She gives him the slightest of nods. 
           Caught off guard- he smiles at her.

           In that moment, a HENCHMAN (40s) jumps out from one of the 
           hallway doors and opens fire-

           -Bourne grabs the Cleaning Lady and dives head-first through 
           one of the frosted glass panels. The Cleaning Lady screams. 

           Cleaning cart toppled over, Bourne grabs the mop sticking out 
           and breaks it over his knee.

           IN THE HALLWAY-

           The Henchman carefully steps down the hallway, gun at the 
           ready.

           WHAM

           -Bourne comes out swinging, wielding two halves of the mop 
           like billy clubs. He snaps at the Henchman’s arms, sending 
           the gun out of his hand. 
           The two are in a stand-off. Bourne swings, hitting the 
           Henchman on the side of the head with a dull thunk. He swings 
           again. The Henchman grabs the mop handle only for Bourne to 
           drop it and kick him straight through another glass wall.

           The Henchman regains his footing, now armed with half a mop 
           handle, and swings at Bourne, who ducks and strikes the 
           Henchman in the gut, rises up, cracks him on the back of his 
           head. 

           He goes down- unconscious. 

           The Cleaning Lady is curled up against a desk- 
           hyperventilating. Bourne turns towards her. Behind Bourne, 
           another door opens- a SECOND HENCHMAN.

                                 CLEANING LADY
                             (In Chinese)
                        LOOK OUT!

           Bourne turns- 

           BLAM.

           The bullet hits Bourne straight in the face. Blood and brains 
           splatter against the adjacent glass wall. 

           He slumps to the ground. 

           The Second Henchman looks up- sees the Cleaning Lady. The 
           Cleaning Lady grabs the gun knocked on the floor next to her 
           and pulls the trigger with her eyes closed- sending the 
           Second Henchman on his back.

           The hallway is empty. 

           The elevator door dings and opens. An empty elevator presents 
           itself.

           The Cleaning Lady gets up and sprints to the elevator, 
           stepping over Bourne’s dead body as she does.

           The elevator doors shut on her.

           A phone begins to ring.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           TOM MILTON (29) sits in his underwear at a desk. It’s the 
           dead of night. 
           Tom looks to his cell phone, sitting on his desk. The screen 
           brightly reads “BAILEY” in demanding letters. He hits the 
           silence button.

           In front of him, a computer screen glows brightly. The words: 
           “The Cleaning Lady gets up and sprints to the elevator, 
           stepping over Bourne as she does.” in bold at the end of the 
           page.

           Tom takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, frowning. 

                                 TOM
                        Fuck. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Tom hops out of bed. One side of the bed is made, completely 
           untouched.

           He goes to his closet- half of the closet is stuffed with his 
           clothes. The other half is completely bare. 

           As he pulls on his shirt, he notices a lone HIGH HEEL sitting  
           in the dark corner of the closet. Sneering, he grabs at it.

           EXT. TOM’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Tom steps out in the Los Angeles morning. He walks to his 
           car, dropping the high heel in the black garbage container 
           sitting in front of his house. 

           Tom gets into his car and begins to start it. He stops and 
           looks over to the black garbage container. 

           He gets out of his car, retrieves the shoe, and returns to 
           his car with it.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - MORNING

           Tom drives down La Brea. The high heel sits on the passengers 
           seat next to him.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - MORNING

           The elevator opens. Tom steps into a production office, 
           wearing a hooded sweatshirt and headphones around his neck. 
           He is simultaneously in his element and vaguely out of place. 

                                 MISSY
                        Hi Tom.
           Tom approaches the front desk, where MISSY (26) sits, beaming 
           at him.

                                 TOM
                        Hey Missy. How are you?

                                 MISSY
                        Fiiiine. Are you here for Jeff?

                                 TOM
                        Uh, Jeff and Mike, yeah.

                                 MISSY
                        I don’t see you on their schedule-

                                 TOM
                        Oh, no. I just wanted to run 
                        something by them- a little idea I 
                        had for the script- shouldn’t take 
                        long.

                                 MISSY
                        Oh... Kay- why don’t you have a 
                        seat and I’ll let them know you’re 
                        here.

                                 TOM
                        Thanks.

           Tom takes a seat in the waiting area. On the wall behind him 
           are posters for THE BOURNE IDENTITY, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, 
           THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, THE BOURNE LEGACY and THE BOURNE 
           CONSPIRACY.

           Across the room is a framed poster. The entire poster is 
           black- with the words THE BOURNE RESURRECTION and 2022 on the 
           bottom. 

           Tom’s phone makes a ding. He produces it from his pocket. The 
           screen reads MISSED CALL: BAILEY.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           MIKE (50) and JEFF (55) sit on one side of the conference 
           table. Tom sits on the other side. Mike exhales. Jeff rubs 
           his eyes. 

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s just be clear. I don’t think 
                        you kill off Jason Bourne in the 
                        opening. If you do, he has to 
                        either come back twenty minutes 
                        later- or...
                                 JEFF
                        -Or it’s a flashback movie. 

                                 MIKE
                        It’s called Resurrection.

                                 JEFF
                        Have we locked that in?

                                 TOM
                        We’ve already established that 
                        Jason Bourne isn’t a person, he’s 
                        an idea.

                                 JEFF
                        We tried that with Legacy. 

                                 MIKE
                        I mean, we didn’t really try it.

                                 TOM
                        This is the point! He fucking dies! 
                        Jason Bourne gets his head blown 
                        off in the first ten minutes of the 
                        movie and-and- the movie just keeps 
                        going from there!

                                 JEFF
                        What do you mean it just keeps 
                        going? We hand it off to another 
                        Treadstone agent?

                                 TOM
                        No! We hand it off to whoever- it 
                        becomes the cleaning lady’s movie. 
                        SHE becomes Jason Bourne. 

           Silence.

                                 MIKE
                        She’s the spy? Like a North by 
                        Northwest kind of thing?

                                 TOM
                        I’m saying she’s a normal civilian 
                        who sees some fucked up shit, and 
                        we just are with her as she handles 
                        the situation-- or doesn’t.

                                 JEFF
                        So you’re pitching us a Jason 
                        Bourne comedy.
                                 TOM
                        NO! It’s... Fuck Damon, Fuck Renner- 
                        you want realism in the franchise- 
                        let’s get real! This guy would have 
                        his head blown off in five minutes. 
                        No one is going to see that coming! 
                        Shit happens and people have to 
                        deal with it in the real world, 
                        that’s what people want to see!

           Jeff and Mike trade glances. 

                                 JEFF
                        Look... Tom. We’re really big fans 
                        of yours.

                                 MIKE
                        We love what you did with the 
                        superhero genre. You really changed 
                        the game.

                                 JEFF
                        But there’s a difference between 
                        changing the game and changing the 
                        sport. Universal wants Jason Bourne 
                        6. Not Cleaning Lady 1. And we want 
                        you to win this. 

           Silence. MISSY knocks on the glass window to the conference 
           room and indicates to her watch, pointing at Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I gotta- Jeff, can you-

                                 JEFF
                        Yup.

           Mike gets up to leave. Tom watches him, deflated.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        We believe in you Tom. We believe 
                        in your voice and we believe in 
                        your vision. We believe you can 
                        reinvent the wheel, and that’s what 
                        we want. But it still has to be a 
                        wheel. It’s still gotta turn. Still 
                        gotta roll.

                                 TOM
                        Right. I understand the metaphor. 
                        Okay.

           He sighs.
                                 JEFF
                        We really appreciate you bringing 
                        us in on the process like this. 
                        Feel free to call us up any time if 
                        you have more problems like this. 
                        We’d rather hear the bad ideas 
                        first so we can get to the good 
                        ideas sooner.

                                 TOM
                        Sure. Thanks, Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                        Looking forward to that draft. 
                        We’re big fans.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

           Tom walks through the production office, raising his 
           headphones to his head. 

           As he reaches the exit, he sees Mike offering a woman a seat 
           in his office. He catches a glimpse of the woman- CHLOE (31) 
           short black hair, a leather jacket, and combat boots. 

           Mike speaks to her animatedly. Tom slows his walk, but 
           presses on.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY

           Tom stands outside a building, bobbing his head to the music. 
           He stares at a doorway.

           A moment- then Chloe steps out. Tom takes off his headphones. 
           He waves at her. She doesn’t see as she lights a cigarette. 
           She begins walking the opposite way down the sidewalk.

                                 TOM
                        Hey! Chloe!

           Tom breaks out into a run.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Chloe! Chloe!

           Chloe stops. She turns as he catches up.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hey. I thought that was you.

                                 CHLOE
                        Tommy?
           Chloe pushes her sunglasses up into her hair and hugs him, 
           keeping her cigarette in her mouth.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Holy fuck! I haven’t seen you in 
                        forever. 

                                 TOM
                        I saw you upstairs, I couldn’t 
                        believe it was you.

                                 CHLOE
                        Well. It’s me!

                                 TOM
                        What have they got you doing up 
                        there?

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh god, they want me to write this 
                        new Jason Bourne movie. 
                        Resuscitation?

                                 TOM
                        Resurrection. I think.

                                 CHLOE
                        One of those, yeah. Mike Gladstein 
                        was just saying they’re still head-
                        hunting for someone to crack it. 
                        They’re doing the whole Battle 
                        Royale ‘best draft wins’ bullshit. 
                        What were you in for?

                                 TOM
                        It’s a... Spec script they really 
                        like. 

           Chloe nods impressed.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh, Fuck you. Of course.

                                 TOM
                        Well. Just, work real hard, you 
                        know.

           She stubs out a cigarette and lights another one.

                                 CHLOE
                        What’s it about?
                                 TOM
                        Um... It’s about a dimension-
                        travelling alien who falls in love 
                        with the... President’s... 
                        Daughter. It’s like a 2021 
                        Pocahontas.

                                 CHLOE
                        Wow. Sounds like a tough sell.

                                 TOM
                        Kind of writes itself actually.

                                 CHLOE
                        Sure. Well, I’d love to read it 
                        when you get a chance.

                                 TOM
                        I’ll send it over to you one of 
                        these days. Have you seen anyone 
                        from AFI recently?

           She shakes her head.

                                 CHLOE
                        Not really, but I heard that Josh 
                        is doing something for Marvel.

                                 TOM
                        That’s... Unexpected. Josh. Wow.

                                 CHLOE
                        Are you still married?

                                 TOM
                        Still? Uh- no. Divorced. Actually. 
                        Just.

           He holds up his left hand.

                                 CHLOE
                        Aw. I’m sorry!

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, no, it’s okay, really.

                                 CHLOE
                        Well, listen, I’ve gotta ditch. It 
                        was really good to see you though! 
                        Let’s grab a drink or something in 
                        a few weeks.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah- you too- okay-
           Chloe walks down the sidewalk, lowering her sunglasses again. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Send me that Pocahontas script!

                                 TOM
                        Will do. Good luck with Bourne!

           Chloe turns to face him, still walking backwards, and puts a 
           finger to her lips, ‘shhh’ before turning again. 

           Tom frowns.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. 

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAWN

           Jason Bourne lies on the ground, eyes open, bullet hole in 
           his forehead. He blinks.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Tom sits down at his computer. He goes to facebook. He 
           reaches Chloe Okomura’s page. He scrolls through it for a 
           moment, before clicking on photos.

           He scrolls through photos of Chloe at Cannes, Chloe at an 
           awards ceremony, holding a silver trophy while making a ‘V’ 
           with her fingers and sticking her tongue out. He smirks at 
           this.

           Tom reaches a photo of Chloe and a group of young people 
           standing on a grand set of outdoor steps. The header reads 
           AFI Class of 2014. 

           Tom is in the photo, poking his head out from the crowd. He 
           looks at the comments. “Babies” “OMG I’m so fat” “back when 
           we believed we would have careers.”- you get the gist. 

           At the far right of the photo stands an OLDER MAN, clearly 
           not one of the students. He is tall with salt-and-pepper hair 
           and a Van Dyke- even in the distant photo there’s an 
           indescribable glare in his eye.

           Tom stares at the photo

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:
           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           The man in the photo is inaudibly yelling- he stands up and 
           tosses a chair behind him- it hits the brick wall and bounces 
           to the floor.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Tom contemplates for a moment. Then: switches his browser to 
           google. He types in- RON SPARROW DIRECTOR.

           He clicks on the first result. The phone rings.

           Tom picks it up.

                                 TOM
                        Hello? Oh, hey Pop...

           INT. PHO RESTAURANT - DUSK

           TOM sits across a table from his father, LARRY (60) both 
           sipping at their ramen.

                                 LARRY
                        So? You haven’t said anything!

           Tom shrugs.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Good? Is that good?

                                 TOM
                        I’m nervous. 

                                 LARRY
                        You? You kidding? Nah.

                                 TOM
                        Pop, I’ve never. I mean... If I nab 
                        this, it’s like... Five... Five 
                        hundred grand.

                                 LARRY
                        It’s a lot of money. Proud of you.

           Tom thinks about this.

                                 TOM
                        What if I don’t land it.

           Larry shrugs.
                                 LARRY
                        Then it’s a good learning 
                        experience. You’re in the big 
                        leagues right now, I mean- Jason 
                        Bourne? I think you were about ten 
                        when the first movie came out, I 
                        remember taking you to see it. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s a lot of money.

           Larry waves him off.

                                 LARRY
                        Forget the money. You’re young. 
                        You’re single again. You don’t need 
                        money. You can float along like 
                        this for another decade if you need 
                        to. Money is great, but do it for 
                        the joy. 

           Tom nods- good advice.

                                 TOM
                        I just feel like- if- if I can 
                        really nail a take on it. You know- 
                        really try to bring something 
                        different... I mean, they always 
                        say the best idea always wins

                                 LARRY
                        It’s true. It’s true everywhere. 
                        The best idea always wins. Except 
                        in academia and politics. And wall 
                        street. 

           Tom looks at his phone.

                                 TOM
                        Shit. I gotta go, Pop. Sorry.

                                 LARRY
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        I got a thing- I got a- I’m seeing 
                        a show, a professor of mine.

                                 LARRY
                        Oh, that’s right.

                                 TOM
                        I told him I’d be there, you know-
                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, go, go- don’t be late!

                                 TOM
                        Okay, bye Pop!

           Larry watches Tom rush out of the restaurant. He smiles as he 
           watches his boy sprint down the sidewalk. 

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           The small theater is dim. On stage, a young Woman and an 
           older Woman wearing the same hospital gown stare at each 
           other. Around them are panels of mirrors, reflecting back 
           onto each other.

           Their actions mirror each other. When one raises their right 
           hand, the other raises their left, etc.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I look into the mirror and all I 
                        see are the choices I’m bound to 
                        make- no matter what, always 
                        getting older and squandering the 
                        seconds away.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        I look into the mirror and all I 
                        see are the choices I never made. 
                        All that waisted potential. The 
                        person I always could have been, 
                        never came to be.

           The light dims on the Young Woman. The Old Woman is now on 
           stage by herself. She turns to the audience.

                                 OLD WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        From the inside looking out- I’m 
                        old. I’ve got wrinkles. Grey hair. 
                        I can’t move like I used to. Nobody 
                        wants me the way they did. 

           The light dims again. The Young Woman is now illuminated.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        But from the outside looking in, 
                        I’m still that same girl. Same 
                        wants. Same dreams.

           The Young Woman begins to slide out of her hospital gown, 
           revealing her naked body to the audience. 
                                 YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        This is who I am. Inside. 
                        Underneath. All around.

           The light flickers a final time, revealing the Old Woman, 
           naked before the audience.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        You don’t see what I see. You don’t 
                        feel what I feel. And fuck you for 
                        judging me. I may be old, and 
                        tired. But I’m still that girl. I’m 
                        still that girl. 

           The lights fade down.

           Tom sits in the audience, crowded amongst the rest with a 
           perplexed look on his face. In darkness, the crowd begins to 
           applaud. Tom joins in.

           The lights go up. RON SPARROW (50s) stands in between the 
           Young Woman and the Old Woman. Together they take a bow. 
           Sparrow raises a palm to quiet the applause.

                                 SPARROW
                        I just want to say, we’ve got two 
                        phenomenal actors here, Ms. Jenna 
                        Douglass and Elaine Williamson, 
                        they’ve worked with me to try to 
                        deliver just a tiny kernel of 
                        fucking truth into our lives. 
                        Without them this never would have 
                        gone all the way to the stage.

           He backs up and re-sparks the applause. Tom emphatically 
           nods. 

           EXT. THEATER - NIGHT

           A small group hangs around the front of the theater. Tom 
           watches from the distance, eyes darting around the sidewalk. 
           Sparrow steps out, shaking a few hands along the way, but 
           briskly moving from the crowd to his car.

           Tom chases after him, hopping into the street to get around 
           the sidewalk crowd. A car honks at him.

           He catches up to Sparrow.

                                 TOM
                        Ron! Ron! 

           Sparrow keeps walking.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Ron!

                                 SPARROW
                        Yeah?

           He turns to see Tom. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Hey there.

                                 TOM
                        Hey, it’s Tom Milton- I was in your 
                        class in 2013-

                                 SPARROW
                        Yeah, hey! Good to see you.

           Sparrow extends his hand, still walking. Tom ambles to keep 
           up. 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, you too. Hey, I just caught 
                        your show-

                                 SPARROW
                        You saw that thing, huh?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.

                                 SPARROW
                        What did you think?

                                 TOM
                        Well, I thought it was brilliant.

           Sparrow slows down.

                                 SPARROW
                        Really.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.

                                 SPARROW
                        Brilliant.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.

                                 SPARROW
                        What was so brilliant about it?
           Tom hesitates- Sparrow’s warmth has manifested into something 
           else- aggression?

                                 TOM
                        Uh... Well, it was beautifully 
                        directed-

                                 SPARROW
                        And what was so beautiful about the 
                        direction?

                                 TOM
                        ... The... Blocking. And staging. I 
                        really liked the... Mirrors.

           Silence.

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. Well hey, Tom, good to see 
                        you, really appreciate you taking 
                        the time to see the brilliant show.

           Sparrow unlocks his car and gets in. Tom watches him. He 
           hesitates, then goes around into the street and knocks on the 
           window. Sparrow rolls it down.

                                 TOM
                        Sorry, listen. Um- I was wondering 
                        if we could get... Coffee or 
                        something- I... 

                                 SPARROW
                        What’s your problem?

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 SPARROW
                        You clearly didn’t come to see my 
                        brilliant show. You’ve got a 
                        problem and you think I’m going to 
                        solve it for you. Lets cut the 
                        foreplay, spit out the problem and 
                        I will help you. But don’t waste 
                        half the night playing catch up 
                        when you don’t give a shit.

                                 TOM
                        ... I... I’m working on a writing 
                        assignment for a big movie.

                                 SPARROW
                        What movie?
                                 TOM
                        A... Big one.

                                 SPARROW
                        Uh-huh.

                                 TOM
                        And I’m trying to bring something 
                        new to it... I really... I want 
                        people to... Fucking... Feel 
                        something. Really punch them in 
                        their faces, but everyone seems to 
                        just want more of the same thing.

           Sparrow eyes Tom. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Huh.

                                 TOM
                        What?

           Sparrow rolls his window up in Tom’s face. Is he leaving? He 
           hops out of the car, re-locks it and brushes past Tom.

                                 SPARROW
                        Are you coming?

           Tom breaks out into a run to keep up with him.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Sparrow and Tom sit across from each other in the outdoor 
           seating of a small bar. A musician plays a ukulele on the 
           stage in the belly of the bar. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Have you kept up with any of your 
                        classmates?

                                 TOM
                        One or two... Uh, I saw Chloe, 
                        today actually.

                                 SPARROW
                        Chloe. She’s doing well for 
                        herself, huh? An Emmy now.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. She’s something.
                                 SPARROW
                        And you? You had a run of success. 
                        Right out the gate, right?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, I- you know about that?

                                 SPARROW
                        Alumni connection stuff. That movie 
                        really got you started, huh?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, it was a huge paycheck and I 
                        got a lot of offers after but...

                                 SPARROW
                        But nothing came through.

                                 TOM
                        Right.

                                 SPARROW
                        And now, you’ve go a big movie on 
                        your hands.

                                 TOM
                        Maybe.

                                 SPARROW
                        What is it?

           Tom looks around, uncertain.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Come on, spill it. I’m a fucking 
                        teacher, what am I going to do with 
                        that information?

                                 TOM
                        It’s the next Jason Bourne movie.

                                 SPARROW
                        Is it gonna be with Damon, or the 
                        other guy.

                                 TOM
                        Damon.

           Sparrow whistles.

                                 SPARROW
                        Sounds like some good problems.
                                 TOM
                        Well, yeah.  Like I said- I just... 
                        I really want to do something 
                        different with this movie.

                                 SPARROW
                        Why?

           Tom thinks about it.

                                 TOM
                        I just don’t want to go on 
                        autopilot and write some spy movie 
                        that anyone could write.

                                 SPARROW
                        Change your fucking attitude, dude. 
                        You think anyone can do what Tony 
                        Gilroy does? You think that happens 
                        on it’s own? Those movies are the 
                        creme de la creme of the spy genre 
                        in your generation, and you’re 
                        calling it a dumb spy movie?

                                 TOM
                        That’s not what I mean-

                                 SPARROW
                        Then what do you mean?

                                 TOM
                        I just... I don’t want to just 
                        follow in those footsteps. If I’m 
                        going to write something, I want to 
                        write something... New. 
                        Something... 

                                 SPARROW
                        You want the truth.

           Tom stops. 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.

                                 SPARROW
                        I get it. So what is the emotional 
                        truth of this character? 

                                 TOM
                        What?
                                 SPARROW
                        What is the emotional truth of 
                        Jason Fucking Bourne?

                                 TOM
                        He’s... He’s a spy-

                                 SPARROW
                        That’s a job. Come on. What is the 
                        emotional truth. What is he after? 

                                 TOM
                        He wants to clear his name.

                                 SPARROW
                        Why?

                                 TOM
                        Because he’s innocent.

                                 SPARROW
                        So?

                                 TOM
                        They government is trying to catch 
                        him-

                                 SPARROW
                        So fucking what?

                                 TOM
                        They’ll kill him-

                                 SPARROW
                        So fucking what?

                                 TOM
                        He doesn’t want to die-

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay, neither does fucking anyone, 
                        that doesn’t make him fucking 
                        special, so fucking WHAT? Why do we 
                        want to spend ANOTHER two hours 
                        with this shmoe? What the fuck is 
                        the point?

                                 TOM
                        -He’s thrown away his life to the 
                        government so he’s lived less than 
                        any of us, and he wants- wants 
                        another chance.

           Ding.
                                 SPARROW
                        Ah. Second chances. Or in his case, 
                        what is this, the fifth, sixth 
                        movie?

                                 TOM
                        Sixth.

                                 SPARROW
                        Sixth chances. Get to the core. 
                        Make us care. Do you care? Do you 
                        give a flying fuck?

                                 TOM
                        About Jason Bourne?

                                 SPARROW
                        YES!

                                 TOM
                        Yeah- He’s-- yeah.

                                 SPARROW
                        You give a fuck?

                                 TOM
                        I think so?

                                 SPARROW
                        GIVE A FUCK! GIVE A FUCK for Jason 
                        Bourne. Give a fuck for his second 
                        chance. What does that chance mean? 
                        What did he never get the chance to 
                        do? What is he fighting for? What 
                        is the primal choice that makes him 
                        get up in the morning and fight 
                        for? Are you asking these 
                        questions? Fucking find out!

           Patrons sitting around Tom and Sparrow are staring at them. 
           Tom shifts nervously. Sparrow pays them no mind- cool fucking 
           cucumber.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah... yeah. Okay. Okay. 

                                 SPARROW
                        You want to do something different- 
                        you do this for all of your 
                        characters. Put in the work dude. 
                        That’s the only answer anyone 
                        should ever have for you. 

           Silence. Sparrow stares off at the ukulele player. 
                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        If you’re not using what’s real, 
                        you’re just wasting everyone’s 
                        fucking time. Giving them an hour 
                        or two to forget that they’re going 
                        to die. That’s all that movies are. 
                        A distraction from the 
                        inevitability of our own demise.

           Sparrow turns back to Tom. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Got it?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah-

                                 SPARROW
                        Good.

           Sparrow gets up, leaving Tom at the table. A waiter comes 
           over and delivers two drinks. Tom sits, dumbfounded. 

           INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT

           Tom drives up La Brea. He looks to the seat next to him. The 
           high heel sits tipped over on the passengers seat.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAWN

           The spot where Jason Bourne was laying is vacated. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom walks into his apartment. He takes off his coat and 
           tosses it on the floor. He holds the high heel in his hand, 
           placing it on his kitchen table.

           He flops down on his couch, removing his phone. He opens up 
           texts, and composes a text to BAILEY:

           We should have given it a second chance.

           He looks at the words, beaming back at them. He deletes them 
           and lies down on the couch.
           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Tom (22) Chloe (24) and a gaggle of other STUDENTS sit in an 
           empty room, dozens of chairs but no tables. They all talk 
           amongst each other. 

           On the other side of the room, a door opens. Sparrow (50) 
           steps in. The room instantly drops to a hush. He drops his 
           bag by the door and removes his jacket. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. Who wants to work. 

           The room is silent. Sparrow waits.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Chloe. Josh. Get up.

           Chloe and JOSH (25) take their chairs to the front of the 
           room. They turn them towards each other. Facing each other, 
           full eye contact- there’s silence.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Chloe first.

           A long pause. Chloe’s eyes pass over Josh.

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re fat.

           Hushed giggles around the room. 

                                 JOSH
                        I’m fat?

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re fat.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m fat.

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re fat.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m fat?

                                 CHLOE
                        YOU’RE FAT!

           Silence.

                                 JOSH
                        Why are you yelling?
                                 SPARROW
                        Start over. 

                                 JOSH
                        Why?

                                 SPARROW
                        No questions. Too intellectual. 
                        Josh start.

           Josh groans, then turns his eyes to Chloe. A moment.

                                 JOSH
                        I like you.

                                 SPARROW
                        Start over. Too intellectual. Make 
                        an observation, not a feeling. 
                        Something physical. 

                                 JOSH
                        Can’t I say I like her?

                                 SPARROW
                        You can say her shoes are red. 
                        That’s about the physicality. It’s 
                        how you say they’re red.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, okay. 

           He reconsiders.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Your teeth are straight.

           Chloe laughs, a little embarrassed.

                                 CHLOE
                        My teeth are straight?

                                 JOSH
                        Your teeth are straight.

                                 CHLOE
                        My... Teeth are... Straight.

                                 JOSH
                        Your teeth are straight.

                                 CHLOE
                        Stop.
                                 JOSH
                        Stop?

                                 CHLOE
                        Stop!

           Tom watches, entranced with his fellow classmates.

                                 JOSH
                        Stop.

                                 CHLOE
                        Stop.

                                 JOSH
                        ... Stop. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. Good- so, what we saw there 
                        was an emotional transaction. 
                        Josh... Likes Chloe’s... Teeth.

           The class murmurs with laughter.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        And what did that make you feel 
                        Chloe?

                                 CHLOE
                        Kind of weird.

                                 SPARROW
                        Right. Because it’s kind of a weird 
                        thing to say. You rest with the 
                        statement until you can have an 
                        honest reaction to it- that’s why 
                        we repeat- to distil our reactions 
                        down to the truth. Good!

           Sparrow looks directly into camera.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Who wants to work?

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Tom awakens suddenly from the couch. He sits up, cracking his 
           neck. He shakes his head. 

                                 TOM
                        Jesus. 
           EXT. TOM’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Tom is on the phone.

                                 LARRY
                        How was the play?

                                 TOM
                        It was... I don’t know. Not really 
                        my thing.

                                 LARRY
                        Did you tell your teacher about the 
                        movie?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, we talked about it.

                                 LARRY
                        What did he say?

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know. I think he was 
                        helpful. I’m gonna sit down to 
                        write in a little bit.

                                 LARRY
                        Hey- just remember, I don’t teach 
                        for the money. I teach because I 
                        enjoy it. Enjoy this! This is your 
                        dream.

           Tom hesitates.

                                 TOM
                        Yup! Thanks Pop. 

                                 LARRY
                        Alright. Get to work.

                                 TOM
                        Yup, you too.

                                 LARRY
                        Oh- hey.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah?

                                 LARRY
                        Have you talked to her at all?

                                 TOM
                        ... No. No, I haven’t. Have you?
                                 LARRY
                        She called me. Wanted to make sure 
                        you were okay. Said you’re ducking 
                        her phone calls.

                                 TOM
                        ...Okay. Thanks. I’m not... Doing 
                        that. 

                                 LARRY
                        Well call her.

                                 TOM
                        Okay.

           Tom hangs up the phone. He pauses.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Tom sits down at his computer. He looks over to the high heel 
           sitting on the kitchen table.  His fingers tap at the keys.

           EXT. HONG KONG FERRY - DAWN

           JASON BOURNE (40s) stands at the front of a ferry. Before him- 
           the Hong Kong Skyline. He’s worn down, exhausted from being 
           chased, a look of steely determination glints in his eyes.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAWN

           Keeping his head down, Bourne enters an elevator. He hits the 
           button marked 48. He stands, shifting in place, watching the 
           lights mark his ascension. 

           The elevator opens. He steps out into the hallway.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAWN

           In the hallway, a YOUNG CLEANING LADY (25) pushes a cart down 
           the hall. She now wears high heels. The hallways is clean, 
           corporate- the walls made of frosted glass. The Cleaning Lady 
           and Bourne glance eye contact for a moment. She gives him the 
           slightest of nods. 

           In the reflection of the frosted glass mirrors, he sees a 
           HENCHMAN approaching him from behind. 

           In one swift motion, Bourne kicks the cleaning cart towards 
           him and gets within arms reach. He grabs the Henchman’s 
           collar and slams his head into the glass wall.
           The Cleaning Lady screams- Bourne turns- WHAM! Gravity and 
           momentum coalesce as Bourne slams a SECOND HENCHMAN into the 
           glass wall, shattering it. 

           SLAM! Bourne stomps down on the Second Henchman’s head as the 
           First Henchman regains his footing. Bourne chops him in the 
           throat then uppercuts him to the floor. Silent, efficient. 
           Lethal. 

           Bourne grabs the Cleaning Lady’s hand and leads her down the 
           hallway in the wake of broken glass and bleeding bodies. She 
           loses a high heel as she runs.

           He taps the elevator button. The door open-- 

           TOM stands in the elevator, looking sheepish, hesitant. 

           Bourne blinks at Tom’s presence- looks to the Cleaning Lady, 
           then back to Tom. 

                                 BOURNE
                        ....Hi. 

                                 SPARROW (O.S.)
                        What are we doing here?

           Tom looks to his left. Sparrow is standing in the elevator 
           with him. Bourne takes a step back as Sparrow approach him, 
           putting a hand on his shoulder.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                             (to Bourne)
                        This isn’t your fault. You’re doing 
                        good work.

           Sparrow steps into the hallway, holding a briefcase. 
           Shattered glass, blood and bodies everywhere.

           Sparrow begins to walk down the hallway. Tom peeks his head 
           out of the elevator then steps out to join him.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        So where are we? What is this, 
                        first scene? Last scene?

                                 TOM
                        It’s like... In the first fifteen 
                        minutes. I think. Still figuring it 
                        out.

           He picks the high heel up off the floor and hands it back to 
           the Cleaning Lady.
                                 SPARROW
                        Who the fuck is that?

           Tom looks to the Cleaning Lady, then to Sparrow, then back to 
           the Cleaning Lady.

                                 TOM
                        She’s the... Cleaning lady.

                                 SPARROW
                        I didn’t ask what she does, I see 
                        her stupid yellow gloves, I’m 
                        asking who is she? Why is she here? 
                        What has she got to do with 
                        anything?

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know yet- she’s just... 
                        Seems important.

                                 SPARROW
                        Does she have a name?

                                 TOM
                        ‘Cleaning Lady’ ....

           Sparrow rolls his eyes and continues down the hallway. Tom 
           looks to Cleaning Lady, who looks a little hurt.

                                 BOURNE
                        Should I just... Wait?

                                 TOM
                        Sorry- just-

           Tom steps back from Bourne and Cleaning Lady, following 
           Sparrow further down the hallway. 

           Sparrow stands over Henchman #2’s dead body, crushed in face. 
           He examines it.

                                 SPARROW
                        Might as well start here. What’s 
                        the emotional truth of this 
                        character?

                                 TOM
                        He’s a Henchman.

                                 SPARROW
                        ‘He’s a Henchman’? He’s just a 
                        piece of meat just here to be 
                        fucking killed like cattle? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SPARROW (CONT'D)
                        Sixty seconds of screen time for 
                        some ass-hat stunt man? I thought 
                        you wanted to do something 
                        different! You have to treat these 
                        people like people! People are 
                        layered. They’re good and bad. You 
                        can’t get away with that anymore.

           Sparrow turns to the Henchman and slaps him across the face. 
           Henchman #2 opens his eyes, startled.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Dead guy! This mother fucker 
                        wants you to be a body. Do you 
                        really want that?

           Henchman #2 shakes his head frantically. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t think so. 

           Sparrow reaches into the briefcase he’s holding and produces 
           an iPad.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see.

           Sparrow begins to scrub through the time line of The Bourne 
           Resurrection. We see a handful of scene’s we’ve seen so far, 
           and glimpses of the rest of the movie. Tom looks over 
           Sparrow’s shoulder, trying to get a glimpse of the action.

           Sparrow arrives at the end credits. He stops. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Uh-huh.

           He shows the iPad to Henchman #2. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Take a look at this.

           Henchamn #2 squints through the blood to see. There in the 
           end credits it says HENCHMAN #2 next to the actor’s name. 

           Sparrow looks over to Tom, supremely disappointed.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Henchman #2. You’re telling me that 
                        you want to do something different 
                        with this genre, make people feel- 
                        but you’ve got a movie with 
                        Henchman #2 as an actual character?
                                 HENCHMAN #2
                        I have a life!

           Tom jumps at the Henchman’s guttural rage. He speaks with a 
           European accent.

                                 SPARROW
                        He’s got a life!

                                 HENCHMAN #2
                        I have a family!

                                 SPARROW
                        This guy has a fucking family!

           Henchman #2 stands up and pushes Tom against the wall, then 
           walks to the middle of the hallway.

                                 HENCHMAN #2
                        I’M A FUCKING PERSON!

           Everyone is awkwardly silent at the sudden gush of emotion. 
           Jason Bourne chews the side of his mouth on the other end of 
           the hall, shifting uncomfortably.

                                 SPARROW
                        For this to REALLY be something 
                        special, you’ve got to go deep. You 
                        have GOT to go deep!

           Sparrow points at Bourne.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Jason Bourne has had five movies 
                        dude. Do we care about him? Do we 
                        know where his parents are? 

                                 TOM
                        That’s the mystery of the character-

                                 SPARROW
                        And I think that’s a lame excuse 
                        for the sixth movie. We’re paper 
                        fucking thin here. Paper fucking 
                        thin.

           Sparrow walks down the hallway, putting his hand on the 
           shuddering back of Henchman #2. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                             (to Henchman #2)
                        Do you have anything you want him 
                        to know? 
           Sparrow and Henchman #2 look down the hallway to Tom, who 
           stands like a deer in headlights. Henchman #2 aggressively 
           wipes a tear away. 

           Gentle silence.

                                 HENCHMAN #2 (MARTIN)
                        My name is Martin Dalca. I’m forty-
                        one years old. I was born in 
                        Romania and I never knew my real 
                        father. 

           Tom takes this in.

           EXT. BUCHAREST - DAY

           The Bucharest skyline sits in a haze of smog. 

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        Ever since I can remember I have 
                        had to fight to stay alive. 

           INT. DALCA APARTMENT - NIGHT

           MARTIN (10) lies on the floor, a slip of light illuminating 
           terrified eyes. He is hiding underneath a bed in a room full 
           of screams.

           Martin’s MOTHER (40) falls to the ground, inches in front of 
           him. Her nose is broken- she is sobbing. A shouting MAN 
           (Martin’s 50 year old STEP FATHER) grabs her by an ankle and 
           drags her towards him.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        My Step-Father would drink himself 
                        into rage- animalistic rage-

           In slow motion, Martin’s Step Father, smeared with blood on 
           his face, beet-red, screams at Martin’s mother, the veins in 
           his head throbbing, spit flying everywhere. A belt hurdles 
           through the air, anchored by his downward fist.

           Under the bed, Martin’s eyes narrow in fury.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        A boy can only withstand that for 
                        so long-

           Time speeds back up: Martin flies across the room and grabs a 
           KITCHEN KNIFE next to a pile of diced carrots. He scrambles 
           across the room, and shoves it straight into his Step 
           Father’s side. 
           His Step Father stumbles, dropping the belt- shocked.

                                 STEP FATHER
                        (Why did you stab me? Oh my God!)

           Martin backs up as his Step Father collapses, clutching his 
           bleeding side. 

           His mother begins to scream, panicking.

                                 MOTHER
                        (Vasil? Vasil? Can you hear me?)

           Martin’s mother turns to Martin. She lunges at him, slapping 
           at him. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        (GET OUT! GET OUT YOU BASTARD! YOU 
                        ROTTEN, ROTTEN BASTARD! YOU LITTLE 
                        LIFE RUINER!)

           She hits Martin all the way up against the door, then shoves 
           him out of the apartment and into the hall.

           INT. DALCA APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Wearing boxers, a tank top, and one sock, Martin is out in 
           the hallway. Caked with blood and sniveling, Martin shivers. 
           He clutches himself. The hallway light flickers. 

           Martin begins to walk down the hallway.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        I was ten years old when I became a 
                        man.

           EXT. BUCHAREST - ALLEY - MORNING

           Covered in dirt, Martin opens his eyes. He’s hiding 
           underneath a blanket. He sniffs. 

           He sits up. Three RATS squeal at his movement, scampering 
           away from him. 

           Martin sits up, wrapping the dirty blanket around him. He 
           sniffs again, beginning to walk down the alley. 

           He reaches a window. Sitting on the sill is a freshly baked 
           golden PIE.

           Martin considers for half a second, then grabs the pie. He 
           breaks out into a run- WHAM:
           -And falls straight into KOSTYA (40) a towering giant of a 
           man with a prominent tattoo on his neck. Martin falls back on 
           his ass- the pie is splattered all over Kostya. 

           The two stare at each other. 

                                 KOSTYA
                        (A little thief.)

                                 MARTIN
                        (Please!)

           Kostya picks Martin up by his ankle and suspends him over the 
           ground. He begins to laugh.

                                 KOSTYA
                        (You should be careful who you 
                        steal from, little thief.)

           Kostya tosses Martin into the wall head first. Martin’s head 
           splits open. He clambers to his feet, barefoot and bare 
           chested, he holds up his fists, ready for a fight- fire in 
           his eyes.

           Kostya stops- seeing that fire. He laughs.

                                 KOSTYA (CONT’D)
                        (You’re going to fight me, little 
                        thief?)

           Martin spits blood. Kostya nods, impressed. He leans down to 
           his knees- still towering. He brandishes his face towards 
           Martin.

                                 KOSTYA (CONT’D)
                        (Not afraid of me? Then go ahead. 
                        You hit me and you make it count.)

           Martin hesitates- then: WHAM. He hits Kostya right in the 
           eye. Kostya winces at it- his eyebrow is cut open. He reaches 
           into his leather jacket and produces a handkerchief. He dabs 
           at the blood, examining it. He chuckles, and stands.

           He walks towards the apartment, opening the door. He stops at 
           the open doorway and turns back to Martin.

                                 KOSTYA (CONT’D)
                        (You ought to come in, little 
                        thief. Put on a shirt.)

           Martin hesitates- unsure of what to do. Kostya sighs. He 
           reaches into his back pocket and takes out a switchblade. He 
           places it on the railing. 
                                 KOSTYA (CONT’D)
                        (Hold onto that if it will make you 
                        feel better.)

           Kostya goes inside, leaving the door open. Martin takes a 
           step up the stairs, eyeing the switchblade. A moment, then he 
           takes the switchblade and walks inside.

           INT. KOSTYA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Martin sits at a table. An OLD WOMAN serves Martin a bowl of 
           soup. He has a spoon in one hand, the open switchblade in the 
           other. He eats ravenously. 

                                 OLD WOMAN 
                        (Look at him, Kostya, he’s 
                        starved.)

                                 KOSTYA
                        (He’s a survivor, Mama.)

           Kostya sits across from Martin, a glimmer in his eye.

                                 KOSTYA (CONT’D)
                        (Aren’t you, little thief?)

           Martin meets his gaze.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        Kostya became like a father to me. 
                        And many others. But... Also, 
                        unlike a father-

           EXT. BUCHAREST - ALLEY - DUSK

           Martin and three other boys huddle on a street corner. A 
           WEALTHY MAN and his GIRLFRIEND walk arm-in-arm down the 
           street, passing the four boys. Martin keeps his eyes narrowed 
           across the street.

           Kostya is on the other side of the street, reading a 
           newspaper. He nods. Martin nods back.

           The four boys turn and follow the affluent couple down the 
           alleyway like hyenas. They all remove switchblades. 

           The boys gain on the couple and push them both- sending their 
           knives into the side of the Wealthy Man, pushing the 
           screaming Girlfriend away. In a flash, they’re all on top of 
           him, stabbing him over, and over- in his arms, chest, legs, 
           dozens of stab wounds. 
           The girlfriend cowers in the corner screaming. 

           Martin gets in the Wealthy Man’s face, sneering.

                                 MARTIN 
                        (Regards from your old friend.)

           He jams his switchblade into the Wealthy Man’s heart, then 
           runs down the alley with his three companions.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        Maybe it sounds sick to you. But it 
                        was a way to survive. To thrive. 
                        And we were a family.

           INT. ROMANIAN HALFWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

           MARTIN (20) and several other young MEN take shots around a 
           card table.

           EXT. ROMANIAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Martin and the young men shoot up a car full of passengers. 

           EXT. BUCHAREST ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Martin and a YOUNG WOMAN dance together. He lifts her up.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        You do what you can in life. You 
                        love...

           They kiss.

           EXT. RATTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Martin peeks into a window. The same YOUNG WOMAN is having 
           sex with another man.

           Martin drops down on a crate below the window, a bottle of 
           liquor in his hand. He begins to cry.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        ...You lose...

           He sniffs. He tears at his shirt, ripping it. He takes a 
           piece of the fabric and stuffs it into the bottleneck. 
           Removing a lighter, he lights the end. 
           He listens to the Young Woman moaning for a final moment, 
           then throws the bottle through the window- it erupts with 
           fire and screaming. 

           INT. MARTIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Martin leans his forehead against a wall. He begins to bash 
           his forehead into the plaster- cracking the wall. He stops, 
           crying, and slumps down to the floor. 

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        And maybe... Just maybe...

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           KOSTYA lies in a coffin, peaceful. Dressed in a black suit, 
           Martin stands over him. He reaches into his breast pocket and 
           produces the switch blade. He looks at it.

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           EXT. BUCHAREST - ALLEY - DAY

           Martin (10) picks up the switch blade from the railing. 
           Kostya smiles at him.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Martin places the switch blade on Kostya’s chest delicately. 
           He hesitates for a moment. 

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        Maybe you get through this life and 
                        die peacefully, surrounded by the 
                        people you love.

           Martin takes the switchblade back, sniffing as he walks away 
           from the coffin.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAWN

           Jason Bourne throws Martin to the ground and stomps on his 
           head- crushing him.

                                 MARTIN (V.O.)
                        Or you die brutally. With no love. 
                        And no one to remember your name.
           Out of focus, Bourne races down the hallway, leaving Martin 
           to die on the floor.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAY

           Martin stands in the hallway, tears streaming down his face 
           in righteous indignation. Tom shifts uncomfortably, hands in 
           his pockets. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I have a name. I have a life. I 
                        have loved, I have fought, I have 
                        cried. I have lived.

           Sparrow pats him on the shoulder.

                                 SPARROW
                        That’s good. Good work. Thank you.

           Martin nods, a little embarrassed, and walks further down the 
           hall, back towards Jason and the Cleaning Lady.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Now you can use this living, 
                        breathing person to your advantage. 
                        There are things about him as a 
                        character that have value that we 
                        as an audience inherently know by 
                        now.

                                 TOM
                        Like what?

                                 SPARROW
                        Take Martin’s gun away from him. 
                        Give him his switchblade. Let’s 
                        just see what happens.

           Tom looks past Sparrow, to Martin. A look of hope in Martin’s 
           eyes. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAWN

           Keeping his head down, Bourne enters an elevator. He hits the 
           button marked 48. He stands, shifting in place, watching the 
           lights mark his ascension. 

           The elevator opens. He steps out into the hallway.
           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAWN

           In the hallway, a YOUNG CLEANING LADY (25) pushes a cart down 
           the hall. The hallways is clean, corporate- the walls made of 
           frosted glass. The Cleaning Lady and Bourne glance eye 
           contact for a moment. She gives him the slightest of nods. 

           In the reflection of the frosted glass mirrors, he sees a 
           HENCHMAN approaching him from behind. 

           In one swift motion, Bourne kicks the cleaning cart towards 
           him and gets within arms reach. He grabs the Henchman’s 
           collar and slams his head into the glass wall.

           The Cleaning Lady screams- Bourne turns- WHAM! Gravity and 
           momentum coalesce as Bourne slams MARTIN against the wall- 
           BUT not without getting slashed across his cheek by Martin’s 
           switchblade.

           Martin and Bourne square off- Bourne touches his face, sees 
           he’s bleeding. 

           Two steps forward, one step back- the two engage in a back 
           and fourth jabbing contest, trying to get close enough 
           without striking. 

           Martin takes the switchblade and drives it into Bourne’s 
           wrist. Bourne shrieks, buckles to his knees and sends his 
           palm into Martin’s knee.

           Martin loses his balance and Bourne counters, sending him 
           flying backwards. The knife frees from Bourne’s wrist and the 
           two begin to wrestle for it. 

           Bourne gets on top of Martin and begins applying leverage. 
           The knife begins to turn towards Martin’s throat.

                                 MARTIN
                        No- no- no-

           Bourne shakes his head as he presses the knife closer to 
           Martin.

                                 BOURNE
                        I’m sorry- I’m sorry-

           Martin closes his eyes.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Martin looks at the switchblade. 
           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - CONTINUOUS

           Martin stares at the switchblade, centimeters from him.

                                 MARTIN
                        -Kostya-

           Bourne slams the knife down- Martin dies. Again.

           Bourne scrambles to the nearby wall, gaining his distance 
           from the fight. He winces in pain. 

           He looks down the hallway.

           The Cleaning Lady, Tom, and Sparrow are at the other end of 
           the hall.

                                 BOURNE
                        Was that... Better?

           The Cleaning Lady nods.

                                 CLEANING LADY
                        Sadder.

                                 BOURNE
                        Sadder. 

           Bourne considers this, impressed.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                             (to Tom)
                        What do you think?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah- I like it. It’s... It’s good 
                        that it’s not as easy for you to 
                        kill him-

                                 BOURNE
                        Yeah.

                                 TOM
                        -And you know- that whole- I mean 
                        that knife has so much meaning to 
                        him. You know? That’s his knife, 
                        man.

                                 BOURNE
                        That’s HIS fucking knife. That 
                        knife has a life. Just like him.

           Bourne gives a thumbs up.
                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Cool.

                                 TOM
                        So that’s it- that’s a scene. 

           Tom looks to Sparrow for approval. Sparrow looks unimpressed. 
           He points down to the other end of the hallway.

                                 SPARROW
                        You’ve got another henchman here, 
                        dude.

           Tom, the Cleaning Lady, and Bourne all look to the first 
           HENCHMAN who lies dead on the ground close to Bourne.

           A phone rings. Tom looks to Bourne. Bourne looks to Tom. Tom 
           looks to Sparrow, who stares at him, unimpressed.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom lies face first on the couch. His phone rings in his back 
           pocket. Half asleep, he reaches for it with his opposite 
           hand, struggling to unearth the phone.

                                 TOM
                        Hello?

                                 BAILEY  (O.S.)
                        Tom.

           Tom opens his eyes. He sits up.

                                 TOM
                        Bailey. I have your shoe.

                                 BAILEY 
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        No- nothing. I’m... What’s up?

                                 BAILEY 
                        I’ve been trying to call you.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, sorry, I’ve been... Just 
                        trying to do this assignment.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Do you have time to meet this week?

           Tom closes his eyes.
                                 TOM
                        Uh... No. I can’t meet this week. 
                        Maybe... Next week?

                                 BAILEY 
                        ...Tom...

                                 TOM
                        I’m just... Really busy, you know. 
                        Real busy. Things are booming. 

                                 BAILEY 
                        Yeah. Look, um... Let’s just... 
                        Monday, okay? I’ll text you.

                                 TOM
                        Monday might not be so good for me 
                        Bailey, really.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Okay, Tom.

           She hangs up.

           Tom sighs. He looks over to his laptop, glowing in a dark 
           corner. 

                                 TOM
                        ... Second chances.

           He walks over to it. He sits down.

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. TOM AND BAILEY ’S HOUSE - DAY

           Inaudibly, Tom and Bailey  (30) scream at each other. She 
           rips his laptop off of the desk and slams it into the ground. 
           Keys, plastic and metal fly everywhere.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom shakes the memory away. He begins to type.

           MONTAGE of THE BOURNE RESURRECTION:

           -Jason Bourne in Hong Kong, fighting in the hallway.

           - Bourne and the Cleaning Lady make an escape in the subways.

           - The CIA begins to work to retrace his steps. Another 
           OPERATIVE is activated.
           Tom types away furiously. 

           - The Cleaning Lady stares straight ahead, locking eyes with 
           the audience. We now see that she looks vaguely like Bailey. 

           Tom stops typing. 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DUSK

           Tom drives up a hill. He makes a left turn and begins to 
           ascend a hill.

           EXT. AFI - DUSK

           Tom parks in the AFI parking lot. 

           INT. AFI - HALLWAYS - DUSK

           Tom walks down a cavernous AFI hallway. On the walls are 
           photos of master filmmakers - Terrence Malik, David Lynch, 
           Arronofsky- all framed and perfectly mounted. 

           Tom puts his eyes forward, continuing down the hall. At the 
           end of the hallway, a gaggle of young men and women, all in 
           their early 20s- clearly younger than Tom. 

           They all speak animatedly, shouting over each other, some 
           laughing, others speak with consternation. 

           Tom weaves through the crowd and into the classroom.

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - DUSK

           Tom watches as the students begin to trickle in. He sits in 
           the far back corner. The students all take their chairs and 
           begin sitting. The clock on the wall reads 6:59.

           Tom watches the clock with anticipation. The minute hand 
           turns to 7:00. 

           The second door to the classroom opens and SPARROW walks in, 
           bringing in a sudden hush with him. He drops his coat on the 
           back of the chair on the front of the room and places his 
           briefcase on the table.

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. Good evening. Who has some 
                        work to show me?
           The students shift. Sparrow waits, attentive. One STUDENT 
           raises her hand. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Liz. Single shot master. 
                        Let’s look at it. 

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           LIZ (22) stands at the front of the classroom, hooking up a 
           laptop to an HDMI cable. 

                                 LIZ
                        So I took a scene from The 
                        Godfather.

                                 SPARROW
                        Cool.

                                 LIZ
                        It’s the scene where the... You 
                        know, the first scene where the guy 
                        asks for help for his daughter to 
                        Don Corleone. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. Let’s see it. Lights.

           The lights dim down. The screen flickers on. 

           The screen shows two students from the class sitting on an 
           outdoor bench. Nearby is a ROAD. Cars are frequently passing 
           the frame.

                                 LIZ
                        The sound is really bad. Sorry. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay.

           The class watches. 

           On the screen- the two students, wearing jeans and t-shirts, 
           speak inaudibly to each other. The camera is static, 
           photographing them from afar. 

           It’s painful to watch. Tom winces. He looks over to Sparrow- 
           only able to see the back of his head, Sparrow rubs his face. 

           The scene ends. The lights come on.

           Silence. 
                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Uhm. Okay. So. Liz.

           Liz is sheepish, blushing, but smiling.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Why are you smiling?

                                 LIZ
                        Ummm. I don’t know.

                                 SPARROW
                        Is this funny to you?

                                 LIZ
                        No.

                                 SPARROW
                        Then why are you smiling.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m nervous.

                                 SPARROW
                        You’re nervous. Okay. Good answer. 
                        Truth. Why are you nervous?

                                 LIZ
                        Well, I was originally going to do 
                        this scene in my apartment, but I 
                        couldn’t get the location and I 
                        couldn’t get a camera. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Right.

                                 LIZ
                        I wanted it to be a lot better.

                                 SPARROW
                        And... I see you hired professional 
                        actors.

           The class laughs. Liz looks to the two students in the class 
           that appeared on screen.

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah, they helped me out.

                                 SPARROW
                        And when did you shoot this.

                                 LIZ
                        When?
                                 SPARROW
                        Yes, when.

                                 LIZ
                        Today. This morning.

                                 SPARROW
                        Uh-huh. Why did you wait until the 
                        last second?

                                 LIZ
                        Well, I tried to do it last week, 
                        but it just didn’t work out.

           Sparrow looks out to the classroom.

                                 SPARROW
                        You guys buy that?

           Silence. Sparrow rubs his eyes.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Okay. So. I think this work is 
                        terrible. This is really beneath 
                        you.

           Liz gets a little more serious.

                                 LIZ
                        Right.

                                 SPARROW
                        I think that you did not look at 
                        the scene and really see what it 
                        needed, and instead it looks like 
                        you cobbled something together at 
                        the last second.

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah.

                                 SPARROW
                        You agree.

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah- I just- I tried-

                                 SPARROW
                        You mean you shot something else?

                                 LIZ
                        No, I tried to shoot something else-
                                 SPARROW
                        That’s not trying- that’s trying to 
                        try.

                                 LIZ
                        Okay...

           Silence.

                                 SPARROW
                        I think that this is a fucking 
                        travesty. I think you are wasting 
                        your time, your wasting my time, 
                        you are wasting the classes time, 
                        and you- who is paying for this?

                                 LIZ
                        For the class?

                                 SPARROW
                        For you to go to this school. Who 
                        is paying for it?

                                 LIZ
                        My parents.

                                 SPARROW
                        Your parents. You are wasting your 
                        parents money, showing up to my 
                        classroom like this.

           He stares through her. Hard. Tom watches from the back of the 
           room, riveted.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Okay? I say this with all the love 
                        and respect in the world, because 
                        you are better than this. 

           Liz has tears in her eyes. She nods. 

                                 LIZ
                        Okay.

                                 SPARROW
                        No. Not okay.

                                 LIZ
                        Right.

           Sparrow stands up and goes to the table in the front of the 
           class. He leans against it. Now he’s preaching.
                                 SPARROW
                        You cannot afford to show up with 
                        work like this. None of you can 
                        afford it. The cost is too great. 
                        And I am too terrified for all of 
                        you.

           He points out the window.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        There are TEN THOUSAND other young 
                        writers and directors in this town 
                        that want to do exactly the same 
                        thing that you do. They’ve seen the 
                        same movies. They like the same 
                        books They are writing the same 
                        scripts. But they are giving it 
                        their all. 

           Silence. In a flash, Sparrow grabs a nearby chair and hurls 
           it into the brick wall behind him.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        THE COMPETITION OUT THERE IS 
                        FUCKING RIDICULOUS PEOPLE.

           His words echo in the classroom. Dead. Silence. Liz’s eyes 
           are full of tears.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Statistically, only two of you are 
                        going to have a career in this 
                        industry. And I don’t mean as 
                        famous directors. I mean, working 
                        in film PERIOD. I believe we can 
                        change that. But it has to start 
                        TODAY. WE have to start TODAY. 

           He turns back to Liz.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        You cannot ever do this again. 
                        EVER. Your characters are living 
                        life and death and GUESS WHAT. THIS 
                        IS LIFE AND DEATH. Because you will 
                        graduate and you will be eaten 
                        alive out there. This is life 
                        people. Fucking breathe it in. You 
                        are the bottom of the barrel and 
                        you want to be the one percent. 
                        You’re going to do this assignment 
                        again, right?

           Liz nods. Sparrow nods.
                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Thank you for sharing. Who is 
                        next? 

           The room is frozen solid. Tom stares at Sparrow, fired up. 

           EXT. AFI - NIGHT

           Sparrow walks to his car. Tom runs along after him.

                                 TOM
                        Ron!

           Sparrow stops.

                                 SPARROW
                        Hey. How’s it going, kid?

                                 TOM
                        Uh, it’s good. That was a great 
                        class. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Oh. That. Yeah, you know. Once a 
                        year it seems like I’ve got to put 
                        the fear of god in them. Maybe it 
                        will get some of them thinking.

                                 TOM
                        Sure, sure, I remember. I just 
                        wanted to thank you for the other 
                        night, it really helped.

                                 SPARROW
                        Great. Glad to hear it!

                                 TOM
                        I was wondering- just, to cut to 
                        the chase-

                                 SPARROW
                        Yeah?

                                 TOM
                        What... What constitutes as good 
                        writing? I mean, I know that The 
                        Godfather is good writing. I can 
                        see it, but when it’s coming from 
                        you... How do you know anything 
                        you’re doing is ever any good?

           Sparrow eyes Tom.
                                 SPARROW
                        You can’t answer that on your own?

                                 TOM
                        Well... I think that if it... Makes 
                        you feel something, is engaging... 
                        Or... Makes you think. It’s good.

           Sparrow shrugs. 

                                 SPARROW
                        There you have it. 

           He begins to walk again.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t you already graduate?

           He begins to disappear into darkness.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Objectives, obstacles, and tactics. 
                        If you get them right, you could be 
                        doing MacBeth. Done. To. Death. It 
                        will still be compelling.

           He disappears into the night, leaving Tom under a 
           streetlight.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom types furiously at the his computer. 

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

           Tom, Bourne and the Cleaning Lady are in an abandoned house. 
           It’s quiet and empty. The three of them stand in a triangle. 

                                 TOM
                             (to Bourne)
                        Okay, so what are you... What do 
                        you want right now?

                                 BOURNE
                        Well I’ve gotta save her.

                                 TOM
                        From?

                                 BOURNE
                        The... The government guys. Over 
                        there.
           Bourne points. In the other room, sitting on couches and 
           reading magazines are four GOVERNMENT AGENTS. They all look 
           up and nod at Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Okay- so those guys are 
                        attacking... Her-

           A beat. Tom looks over to the Government Agents.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Guys?

           They look up. Folding their magazines, they start to stand up 
           and begin doing stretches. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                             (to Cleaning Lady)
                        And where are you?

                                 CLEANING LADY
                        I’m... Hiding under the sink?

           The Cleaning Lady gets under the kitchen sink.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom looks at his computer screen. Amid the scene description 
           is ‘The Cleaning Lady hides under the sink, taking short, 
           careful breaths.’

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

           Bourne and Tom stare at her.

                                 TOM
                        No. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom delete’s the last sentence and replaces it with ‘The 
           Cleaning Lady runs up the staircase...’

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Cleaning Lady runs up the staircase, one of the 
           Government agents running behind her. 
           She gets to the top of the stairs- Bourne jumps in between 
           the Cleaning Lady and the Agent and grabs his gun. Standing, 
           they wrestle for it.

           In the midst of their struggle, Bourne stops.

                                 BOURNE
                        Stop- stop- wait a second.

           Tom comes out from around the corner.

                                 TOM
                        Yes? Jason? What?

                                 BOURNE
                        I don’t know, I just... It’s kind 
                        of a weird move, I just step in 
                        between them and grab the gun?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, it’s a signature Jason Bourne 
                        move.

                                 BOURNE
                        I don’t remember doing that.

                                 TOM
                        That’s the retrograde amnesia 
                        talking. Trust me, you do this all 
                        the time!

           Tom ducks back around the corner. The struggle continues. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom types furiously ‘Bourne hits the Agent furiously before 
           pushing him down the stairs’

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bourne hits the agent with a deliberate, surgical strike 
           before letting him fall down the stairs.

                                 TOM
                        Hey- hey, hey, Jason?

                                 BOURNE
                        What?
                                 TOM
                        It actually says- you hit him 
                        furiously before pushing him down 
                        the stairs.

                                 BOURNE
                        Yeah?

                                 TOM
                        I just. That was more of a 
                        deliberate, surgical strike.

           Tom mimes the blow Jason just delivered. Bourne looks at him, 
           clueless.

                                 BOURNE
                        Okay...

                                 TOM
                        I want more... Fury.

                                 BOURNE
                        Fury.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.

                                 BOURNE
                        Okay...

           The Agent comes back up the stairs- he and Bourne reset 
           themselves, struggling with the gun. Bourne strikes him hard- 
           he goes down.

                                 TOM
                        Jason? Jason?

                                 BOURNE
                        What, dude?

                                 TOM
                        I’m just not getting the minutia of 
                        that fury. 

                                 BOURNE
                        Okay. So really- I felt like that 
                        was furious, but you want like... 
                        FURY.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

           The Agent comes back up the stairs. He and Bourne reset. They 
           begin struggling for the gun. 
           On his exhales, Jason lets out half-hearted yells before 
           striking his opponent and letting him fall down the stairs.

           Tom pops out with a thumbs up.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        That’s great.

                                 BOURNE
                        That? Really?

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom writes ‘EXT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT’

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bourne and the Cleaning Lady are in the hotel bathroom. She 
           is stitching a gaping wound in his shoulder with a sewing 
           needle.

                                 BOURNE
                        Feels like you’ve done this before. 

           She slips.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        Ow. 

                                 CLEANING LADY
                        Sorry!

                                 BOURNE
                        Hey, Tom? What the hell?

           Tom pokes his head from around the corner.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah?

                                 BOURNE
                        I mean I say it’s like she’s done 
                        this before and then she fucking 
                        lances me?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah- it’s a cute moment. Cute 
                        bonding moment.

                                 BOURNE
                        Tony Gilroy wouldn’t write this 
                        shit. 
           Tom fumes.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom stops- considers, then begins typing furiously.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bourne and the Cleaning lady continue stitching up his wound.

                                 BOURNE
                        Feels like you’ve gone this before-

           The Cleaning Lady slips- the needle goes into Bourne’s 
           shoulder- deep.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        FUCK! Okay! Okay! Jesus!

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom continues typing. ...Body floats in the water- lifeless.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Jason Bourne’s body floats in the water- lifeless.  Suddenly, 
           he thrashes awake.

           Bourne breaks the surface, gasping for air. Gunfire erupts- 

           Overhead is a bridge, where EMIL (40, villainous complete 
           with a scar across his eye) is shooting. Bourne dives back 
           under the surface.

           The bullets hit the water and the tension shatters them.

           ON THE BRIDGE: European police sirens haw in the distance. 
           Emil turns towards the street, then back towards the bridge. 

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           The Cleaning Lady races through traffic, dodging cars and 
           mopeds. 

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

           Emil takes a breath and pencil dives into the river-
           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           -Directly onto Bourne! Emil’s feet hit him square in the 
           back, sending him down to the river-bed. Bourne struggles as 
           Emil gets on top of him and wraps his arms around his neck. 

           Bourne struggles to keep his eyes open. 

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

           The Cleaning Lady looks over the edge of the bridge. Bubbles 
           rise in the river below her. She braces herself, then climbs 
           up onto the railing.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Emil is strangling Bourne with fury. CRASH!

           The Cleaning Lady lands right on top of Emil. Relieved of the 
           pressure, Bourne shoots to the surface of the river- the 
           current sweeping him and the Cleaning Lady away from the 
           submerged Emil. 

           A loud DING interrupts the mood.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom looks over to his phone. There’s a text message from 
           Bailey. He swipes his phone and reads it:

           Tomorrow 4:30 at Gusto’s. cu then. Heart.

           Tom purses his lips. Considers. He types.

           K.

           He turns back to his computer. Then he turns back to his 
           phone.

           Heart.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Bourne and the Cleaning Lady drive in a taxi, barreling down 
           a highway hitting cars left and right. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom keeps writing. 
           EXT. OCEAN COAST - DUSK

           Bloody, broken, one arm limp, Bourne and the Cleaning Lady 
           stand on a beach- a light house strobes behind them. Before 
           them are several dead bodies being taken by the current.

                                 BOURNE
                        We can’t keep doing this.

           He looks to her.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t keep doing this. 

           The Cleaning Lady is in tears.

                                 CLEANING LADY
                        We can disappear! We can just 
                        disappear! We’ve won!

           Bourne shakes his head- he’s been down this road before.

                                 BOURNE
                        I’ve been here. I’ve been here so 
                        many times. The only way they’ll 
                        ever let you go is if I’m dead.

           Bourne offers her a gun. She won’t take it. He takes her hand 
           and forces it on her. 

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        You take this. 

           He hugs her close, shaking.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. It’s okay.

           He breaks away from her and turns towards the ocean. He walks 
           away from her.

           The Cleaning Lady raises the gun.

           Tom stops typing. He looks over what he’s written. He presses 
           command + P.
           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom sits on his couch, his computer on his lap. He drags his 
           mouse over to a file labeled TLC. He clicks it and opens up 
           photos. 

           He scrolls through photos of him and Bailey- wedding photos, 
           vacation photos, a few scanned college photos- it’s clear 
           they’ve known each other for years. 

           Tom clicks on a photo of the two of them signing a piece of 
           paper, smiling and looking to the camera- a blue pen rests in 
           Tom’s hand.

           He settles on one photo of Bailey and Tom giving the camera 
           the finger, standing below a neon sign that reads ‘The World 
           is Yours’. 

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

           Tom approaches MISSY.

                        Hi, Missy.

                        Oh. Hi, Tom. I’ll let them know 
                        you’re here.

           Missy gets up, leaving Tom in the empty waiting room. 

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Mike and Jeff sit across from Tom. Tom is looking at the 
           clock on the wall above them. It reads 3:30. 

           Jeff slides a bound stack of papers - the printed script to 
           THE BOURNE RESURRECTION slowly to the middle of the table, 
           then takes his hand off of it, as if he’s just handled 
           radioactive waste.

                                 JEFF
                        Is this a joke?

           Tom looks to Jeff, then to Mike, then back to Jeff.

                                 TOM
                        Uh- no. That’s it. That’s my 
                        submission. That’s Resurrection. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’re sure this isn’t a joke.
                                 TOM
                        What’s funny about it?

                                 JEFF
                        I gotta be honest... I don’t really 
                        know what this is.

                                 TOM
                        Which part?

                                 MIKE
                        You’ve got pieces of four movies in 
                        this thing! We like the Bourne 
                        stuff, where the CIA thinks he 
                        killed the Korean spy-

                                 JEFF
                        We have to specify south. We don’t 
                        need a hacking situation.

                                 MIKE
                        And we like the shit where he and 
                        the girl go on the run and take on 
                        the Triads, that’s where it really 
                        picks up.

           Tom nods- this was expected.

                                 JEFF
                        But then there’s this weird... 
                        Thirty minute segment that shows 
                        the lives of all the 
                        subordinate....

                                 MIKE
                        Henchmen.

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, I couldn’t keep track, 
                        Martin, Ivan, Boris-

                                 MIKE
                        We don’t need to know their life 
                        story. You can just say Henchman 
                        #2, and we get it.

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll say- I was interested in their 
                        stories, but that’s just such a 
                        different kind of movie, you know? 
                        You set them all up and you get us 
                        caring about them and then Bourne 
                        just kills them.
           Tom springs to life!

                                 TOM
                        YES! Yes. That’s it! That’s my 
                        point! You care! We have to care 
                        about the people he’s killing.

                                 MIKE
                        Tom, they’re bad guys! It’s an easy 
                        trope!

                                 TOM
                        No! That trope is dead! No one is 
                        just a bad guy. Osama Bin Laden 
                        isn’t just a bad guy. People have 
                        layers- dimensions- you know? You 
                        can’t just be evil, you can’t just 
                        be good-

                                 MIKE
                        Osama Bin Laden IS just a bad guy?

                                 JEFF
                        What about this whole thing where 
                        she kills him at the end?

                        Oh, see- I read that differently, I 
                        read that as she was going to, but 
                        in the last second she stopped and 
                        we’ll see in the next one what 
                        happens. Was I right?

                                 TOM
                        She kills him.

                                 JEFF
                        But then how do we follow it up?

                                 TOM
                        Look... You guys wanted me to 
                        reinvent the wheel- this is how you 
                        fucking do it!

           Dead. Fucking. Silence.

                                 MIKE
                        Tom- I’m sorry. We love your work.

                                 JEFF
                        There’s great writing in there. A 
                        lot of extra snippets you can use. 
                                 MIKE
                        But it’s not this movie.

                                 TOM
                        Hold on-

                                 JEFF
                        We wanted to bring you in to have 
                        this discussion just to make sure 
                        we weren’t idiots. 

                                 MIKE
                        We’re big fans.

                                 TOM
                        Mike-

                                 JEFF
                        We’re gonna go in a different 
                        direction for Ressurection.

           Missy knocks on the window and taps her watch. 

                                 MISSY
                        We’ve got your next appointment 
                        waiting. 

                                 MIKE
                        Jeff, can you-

                                 JEFF
                        Sure.

           Jeff steps out of the conference room. Mike and Tom are 
           alone.

                                 MIKE
                        I really wanted this to work out, 
                        kid. I just can’t figure out what 
                        you were thinking. 

           Mike extends his hand across the table. Tom takes it. They 
           shake.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad we could have a talk this 
                        frank. We’re big fans of you, Tom. 
                        We really are.

           Tom nods. 
           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY

           Thunder booms.

           Tom sets out onto the LA streets. Rain begins to fall. 

           INT. GUSTO RESTAURANT - DAY

           Rain pours. Tom steps into the upscale GUSTO’s soaking wet. 
           He holds Bailey’s high heel in his hands. A waitress 
           approaches him.

           He sees Bailey (30) sitting by the window. She doesn’t just 
           look like the Cleaning Lady- she IS the Cleaning Lady. He 
           points to her and goes. He catches her eyes. She doesn’t get 
           up.

                                 TOM
                        Hey.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Hey.

                                 TOM
                        Sorry I was late, I was just-

                                 BAILEY 
                        Working.

                                 TOM
                        In a meeting, yeah.

                                 BAILEY 
                        It’s okay.

                                 TOM
                        I have your shoe.

           With one finger, Bailey  slides a small folder across the 
           table. Tom eyes it.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Cut right to the chase, huh?

           She smiles at him sweetly.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Get in and out of the scene as 
                        quickly as possible, right?

           Tom smiles at this. She listened to him. He nods. 
                                 TOM
                        Pen?

           She reaches into her purse and takes the pen out. Tom stares 
           at it. It’s a shitty blue bic pen. 

                                 BAILEY 
                        What?

           The rain rages against the glass next to them.

                                 TOM
                        We signed the lease to our first 
                        apartment with a pen just like 
                        this. Started our lives together 
                        with a shitty blue... Pen. 

           He nods to himself, then begins signing the papers within the 
           folder. Bailey  watches him carefully.

                                 BAILEY 
                        One more, on the bottom.

                                 TOM
                        Right.

           Tom finishes signing. 

                                 BAILEY 
                        Thank you.

           Tom offers her the pen. She shakes her head.

                                 BAILEY  (CONT’D)
                        Keep it. You’re the writer.

           Tears in his eyes, he laughs, struggling to keep himself 
           composed.

                                 TOM
                        You... 

           He lets out a controlled sigh, then stands up.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Have a nice life, Bailey .

           He begins to leave.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Tom-

           He stops. He turns back to her, hope in his eyes.
                                 TOM
                        Yeah?

                                 BAILEY
                        Can I have my shoe?

           He’s holding the shoe in his hands. 

           INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

           Rain pelts against the windshield. Tom cries as he drives. He 
           passes pedestrians in the rain. He turns on the radio. 
           Singin’ in the Rain is playing. 

           He watches them go by- a homeless man pushing a shopping 
           cart, a young couple dancing under a street light. He changes 
           the station- Only Fools Rush In.  

           EXT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom pulls his car to the curb. He turns off the car. 

           Clutching the steering wheel, he lets out an angry yell. 

                                 SPARROW (V.O.)
                        Who wants to work?

           Tom lets his head bang against the steering wheel. He closes 
           his eyes, listening to the rain pelting against the glass.

                                 SPARROW (V.O.)
                        Who wants to work?

           He opens his eyes and gets out into the rain.

           EXT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rain pouring, Tom walks down the sidewalk towards his 
           apartment.

                                 SPARROW (V.O.)
                        Come on. Don’t be shy- who wants to 
                        work? Chloe? Good. Okay, who else?

           Tom picks up the speed. He opens the door to his apartment 
           building- it closes behind him-

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - DAY

           -Leading him into his classroom, soaking wet. 
           Tom’s classmates look at him. Sparrow sits at the front of 
           the room.

                                 SPARROW
                        Tom. Nice of you to join us. You’re 
                        up.

           Tom looks around, confused. 

                                 TOM
                        ...Sorry I’m-

                                 SPARROW
                        Come on. Let’s go.

           Tom takes off his jacket and goes to the other side of the 
           room. There’s an empty chair across from Chloe who sits 
           waiting for him.

           Tom sits. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Anytime you’re ready. Tom, you 
                        first.

           Tom looks Chloe up and down. She has a thin, embarrassed 
           smile. Tom rests his eyes on her cleavage. 

                                 TOM
                        I like your tits.

                                 CHLOE
                             (laughing)
                        You like my... Tits?

                                 TOM
                        I like your tits.

                                 CHLOE
                             (weirded out)
                        You like my tits.

                                 TOM
                        I like your tits.

                                 CHLOE
                             (defensive)
                        Don’t like my tits.

                                 TOM
                             (sorting it out)
                        Don’t like your tits?
                                 CHLOE
                             (insistent)
                        Don’t like my tits.

                                 TOM
                             (resigned)
                        Don’t like your tits.

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. Great, let’s stop there. What 
                        is the exchange we see here?

           A student raises his hand.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Josh.

                                 JOSH
                        Rejection.

                                 SPARROW
                        Well, we’re seeing an advance being 
                        made, he’s admiring Chloe, and 
                        she’s saying that she doesn’t want 
                        him to admire her in that way.

           Sparrow stands up.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        When you’re directing scenes. 
                        Writing scenes. You don’t need all 
                        that dialogue. You don’t need all 
                        that STUFF.

           Sparrow turns towards the audience. The camera begins to 
           close in on him.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        You just need the right word, or 
                        right camera move for a simple 
                        human transaction. A simple moment 
                        of truth.

           The camera closes in on Tom. Sparrow snaps out of the 
           momentary trance and goes back to his seat. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to try something a 
                        little bit different now. Chloe? Go 
                        back to your seat.

           Chloe does. Tom is up front by himself now.
                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Tom. 

           Tom sits before Sparrow. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Stand up.

           He does.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Get yourself comfortable, wherever 
                        you want to be.

           Tom wanders around for a moment, then sits on the table in 
           the front of the room. Sparrow nods. He turns back towards 
           the class.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        When you’re dealing with scenes... 
                        Characters... Plot... It’s all in 
                        service of the truth. When you’re 
                        writing a character and their 
                        dialogue, you want to use these 
                        tools to get to their emotional 
                        truth using imaginary 
                        circumstances. So, Tom. What I want 
                        to do is construct an imaginary 
                        circumstance with me.

                                 TOM
                        Okay. Anything?

                                 SPARROW
                        Shut up. No. Not anything. It’s 
                        going to be what I’m going to tell 
                        you. Are you parents alive?

                                 TOM
                        Yes.

                                 SPARROW
                        Both of them?

                                 TOM
                        No.

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay... Got a wife?

                                 TOM
                        Uh, yes.
                                 SPARROW
                        Good. She’s healthy? Happy?

                                 TOM
                        Yup.

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. We’re going to create an 
                        imaginary circumstance involving 
                        your wife so we can uncover the 
                        emotional truth for your scenes and 
                        characters. Ready?

           Tom looks back to the class- the entire room is ogling him. 
           He is on stage here.

                                 TOM
                        Yup.

                                 SPARROW
                        Let’s talk about the moment that 
                        she dies. Where are you when you 
                        hear the news?

           Tom thinks about this.

                                 TOM
                        I’m... In the hallways. Here at 
                        AFI. Uh... My phone rings, and it’s 
                        her mother.

                                 SPARROW
                        No. 

                                 TOM
                        No?

                                 SPARROW
                        You’re about to give us a scene of 
                        a phone call where someone tells 
                        you about something. You see, 
                        you’re already distancing yourself 
                        from the raw emotion, placing 
                        location and people in between you 
                        and your wife. 

                                 TOM
                        Okay, okay, I got it. Um... 
                        We’re...

           INT. GUSTO RESTAURANT - DAY

           Tom looks at Bailey, frowning at him.
           EXT. TOM AND BAILEY ’S HOUSE - DAY

           Tom and Bailey lie in a hammock together.

           INT. TOM AND BAILEY ’S HOUSE - DAY

           Bailey lies in a reclining chair. She has IVs hooked up to 
           her. She is thin, pale, bald and wheezing. 

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Tom blinks.

                                 TOM
                        We’re in our home. 

                                 SPARROW
                        What is she wearing?

                                 TOM
                        She’s wearing a hospital gown.

           INT. TOM AND BAILEY ’S HOUSE - DAY

           Indeed, Bailey is wearing a checkered hospital gown over her 
           top. Below that, sweatpants- a dark stain on the knee.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        And sweatpants. With that ketchup 
                        stain from the one time we ever 
                        went to McDonalds in the entirety 
                        of our relationship. 

           EXT. MCDONALDS - NIGHT

           Tom and Bailey sit outside a McDonalds, laughing together. 
           Ketchup spills out of Bailey’s burger- she laughs in feigned 
           frustration.

           EXT. LAUNDRYMAT - NIGHT

           Bailey frowns as she rubs at the stain in the pants.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        She could never get it out.
           INT. TOM AND BAILEY ’S HOUSE - DAY

           Tom surveys Bailey’s frail body. At her feet, furry pink 
           socks.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        And those furry pink socks that 
                        give me hives when she sleeps with 
                        them on.

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Tom’s eyes are closed.

                                 TOM
                        She’s wearing those too.

                                 SPARROW
                        How does she look?

           INT. TOM AND BAILEY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Tom looks at Bailey. She is balding, her hair is thin.

                                 TOM 
                        She’s losing her hair. It’s from 
                        chemotherapy. I can see her 
                        skeleton trying to poke out of her 
                        skin. Her eyes look so tired.

           Bailey looks out at Tom with sad eyes.

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Sparrow paces around Tom. Tom takes a deep breath.

                                 SPARROW
                        Let’s go to the actual moment that 
                        she dies. Okay?

                                 TOM
                        Okay.

           INT. TOM AND BAILEY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Bailey is looking out the window. Her breathing is irregular.

                                 SPARROW (V.O.)
                        She’s struggling to breathe. She’s 
                        squeezing your hand-
           Bailey grabs Tom’s hand. Squeezes it. Tom is crying.

                                 SPARROW (V.O.)
                        She looks over to you. 

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Tom has tears running down his face. Sparrow is right behind 
           him.

                                 SPARROW
                        What do you say to her? Something 
                        you’ve never heard before. Don’t 
                        think, just say it.

           INT. TOM AND BAILEY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Tom wraps his arms around her. He clutches her.

                                 TOM
                        I’m so sorry I fucked everything up 
                        and I love you so fucking much. 

           He clutches her frantically. 

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Sparrow’s voice is calm.

                                 SPARROW
                        In her last breath, she says 
                        something to you, what is it, 
                        something you’ve never heard 
                        before, say it now.

           INT. TOM AND BAILEY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Calm, Bailey kisses Tom’s cheek. 

                                 BAILEY 
                        Just try to enjoy the ride.

           They’re clutching each other. Tom breaks from her. She is in 
           his arms- lifeless.

           INT. AFI - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Sparrow steps away from Tom. Tom is gushing tears and snot. 
           Sparrow turns to the classroom.
                                 SPARROW
                        The entire relationship. Boiled 
                        down to one interaction. “I am so 
                        sorry I fucked everything up, and I 
                        love you so fucking much.” 
                        Countered with “Just try to enjoy 
                        the ride.”

           Sparrow looks over to Tom, beaming.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Take a bow, Tom.

           The class gives Tom scattered applause as he wipes his tears. 
           Tom looks down to his feet.

           On the floor is the shitty blue bic pen. 

           Tom reaches down to pick it up. He looks up.

           The classroom is empty. 

           The Camera pulls back from Tom. 

           Sparrow stands behind him.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        That was pretty impressive shit.

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 SPARROW
                        I’ve been teaching for twenty years 
                        you know. I had a handful, maybe 
                        three students that ever really 
                        threw themselves into the work like 
                        that. 

           Tom looks around.

                                 TOM
                        What’s happening here?

                                 SPARROW
                        I want you to stick with me here. 
                        You became addicted to that 
                        feeling, didn’t you?

                                 TOM
                        The truth.
                                 SPARROW
                        It’s our job to create an 
                        experience. To help people make 
                        sense of their fucked up days. 
                        Or... TO give a little bit of 
                        escapism. That’s the name of the 
                        game.

           Tom stands up. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Tom, this has been fun. We had a 
                        little bit of AFI, we had a little 
                        bit of Jason Bourne. You threw in 
                        some stuff about your ex-wife, but 
                        you didn’t really go into the 
                        amount of detail we were all 
                        hoping... But you’ve kind of got to 
                        get to the fucking point.

           Tom grabs his coat and walks towards the door.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Oh, come on! We’re just starting to 
                        get somewhere!

           INT. AFI - HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           Tom runs down the hallways. The photos of famous filmmakers 
           are moving- they’re all laughing at him.

           Tom dives towards the door- blowing it open-

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom slams the door behind him, soaking wet from the rain. He 
           snaps on the light.

                                 TOM
                        I’m dreaming. I’m dreaming. Weird 
                        dream, weird dream time.

           He walks towards the hallway when BANG!

           A gunshot rings out. 

           Tom hits the floor, shrieking. 

           A Man in the shadows begins shooting at Tom. Tom hops over 
           his couch- stuffing and feathers fly in the air. 
           The shooting stops. Tom looks under the couch. A pair of feet 
           step towards the hall. 

           Tom reaches into his shirt pocket, grabbing something. He 
           watches as the feet take a step backwards- the spring 
           forward, leaping over the couch-

           -Tom turns onto his back, whipping out the shitty blue ball 
           point pen- stabbing MARTIN in the neck.

           Martin gags as blood spatters on Tom’s face.

           Tom wrestles to get out from under Martin. He pushes the gun 
           away as Martin clutches his neck. Tom backs up, putting his 
           hands on his head.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        What- what? What?

           Martin extends his bloody hand to Tom, as if asking for help. 
           Tom backs up- right into JASON BOURNE.

           Tom shrieks. Bourne slams Tom against the wall, covering his 
           mouth.

                                 BOURNE
                        Do you want to get out of this 
                        alive?

           Tom nods, frantically. Bourne releases Tom. 

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have much time. Do you 
                        have a newspaper?

                                 TOM
                        Listen man, I’m having some weird 
                        fucked up dream or something right 
                        now-

                                 BOURNE
                        Look! You need to get it together, 
                        Milton. I don’t have time to 
                        explain, but we’re not in a dream 
                        and you’re not having one of your 
                        little writing sessions. Training 
                        is over.

                                 TOM
                        Training is over?

                                 BOURNE
                        Newspaper- paper towels, something.
           Tom nods.

                                 TOM
                        Right-

           He goes to the drawer under the kitchen sink, taking out a 
           thin stack of newspaper. 

                                 BOURNE
                        Roll it up for me.

           Bourne goes to the oven and turns on the gas, opening the 
           door. Tom rolls up the paper. Bourne snatches it from him and 
           stuff it in the toaster. He pops the timer down. He’s 
           efficient, surgical. Bourne is back.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got one minute. 

           Bourne heads for the door. Tom stands, flabbergasted. 

                                 TOM
                        What the fuck is happening?

           He follows Jason Bourne into the night.

           EXT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bourne approaches Tom’s car, looking around for followers.

                                 BOURNE
                        Unlock it.

           Tom pats down his pants. He shakes his head.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t have my keys.

                                 BOURNE
                        I’ve got mine.

           Bourne slams his elbow into the window. It shatters. He pops 
           the lock and gets in the car. 

                                 TOM
                        Jesus-

                                 BOURNE
                        Get in!
           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Bourne rips out the wiring underneath the steering wheel. 

                                 TOM
                        You can actually do that?

                                 BOURNE
                        Tom, I need you to think. How did 
                        you get to your apartment?

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 BOURNE
                        LISTEN! How did you get to your 
                        apartment just now?

                                 TOM
                        I drove here.

                                 BOURNE
                        Are you sure?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah I...

           Tom stops. Bourne starts the car.

                                 BOURNE
                        You didn’t drive here, did you. You 
                        ran down the AFI hallways and 
                        crashed into your own apartment. 

           Tom realizes Bourne is right. He nods. Bourne slams into 
           gear, the car peels away from Tom’s apartment as it blows up.

           INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT

           The car cruises down a highway, Bourne deftly avoids traffic, 
           swerving between lanes, weaving around cars.

                                 BOURNE
                        I’ve been trying to put the pieces 
                        together, but I’m missing 
                        information. I need you to tell me 
                        the first thing you remember.

                                 TOM
                        What, in my life?
                                 BOURNE
                        I don’t mean ideas- not 
                        abstractions. What’s the very first 
                        thing you can remember. 

           Tom thinks. 

                                 TOM
                        I don’t understand the question!

                                 BOURNE
                        Tom, he’s coming for you-

                                 TOM
                        Who!

                                 BOURNE
                        I don’t know! All I know is that I 
                        have to protect you, and I can’t do 
                        that unless you tell me the rules!

                                 TOM
                        Protect me from what? What rules?

           CRASH.

           The car collides head on with an oncoming truck. 

           INT. STATIONARY CAR - NIGHT

           Bloody, dazed, Tom blinks. His head is cracked open. He looks 
           over- the air bags have deployed.

                                 TOM
                        Jason? Jason?

           Bourne stirs. His eyes flutter. He looks over to the 
           passenger’s window. Tom does as well.

           Sparrow is leaning down to the window. He makes a rolling 
           gesture with his hand- the international sign for roll down 
           your window.

           Tom does.

                                 SPARROW
                        What the fuck are you two doing?

                                 TOM
                        What?

           Sparrow grabs Tom by his collar and drags him out onto the 
           highway.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Traffic is piled up around the accident. Tom stumbles to his 
           feet, squaring off against Sparrow.

                                 TOM
                        Help! Help!

                                 SPARROW
                        Stop it. Stop it, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        HELP ME!

           Jason gets out of the car. He stumbles over the hood, 
           reaching for Sparrow- he slips, trips, and falls unconscious 
           to the ground.

           Tom gains distance from Sparrow. Cars honk in the held up 
           traffic, headlights surround them.

                                 SPARROW
                        Tom, stop it. Tom. STOP IT.

           All at once, the honking stops. Tom looks into the 
           headlights. He squints. All of the cars are empty. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done some good work, kid. 
                        Good effort here. But you can’t 
                        just meander around for hour after 
                        hour without arriving at a point.

           Tom is really upset- shaking.

                                 TOM
                        What’s happening to me?

           Sparrow purses his lips and gives Tom his first ever genuine 
           look of sympathy. 

                                 SPARROW
                        You’ve been trying to make sense of 
                        all of this without any real 
                        narrative flow. It’s very avant 
                        garde of you, but if you ever 
                        expected Universal to pay for Jason 
                        Bourne resurrection, you should 
                        have known this wouldn’t fly.

                                 TOM
                        I didn’t get the assignment! I 
                        failed.
                                 SPARROW
                        So what.

                                 TOM
                        So what, so NOTHING! Whatever! I’ll 
                        just move on, do another movie, 
                        write something else, fuck it man! 
                        Fuck it, fuck you!

                                 SPARROW
                        Come here.

           Tom freezes.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        I want to show you something. Come 
                        here. Seriously. 

           Hesitantly, Tom takes a step towards Sparrow. Sparrow puts an 
           arm over Tom’s shoulder and points. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        What do you see there?

           Tom searches.

                                 TOM
                        Where?

                                 SPARROW
                        Right there. What do you see. It’s 
                        going to take your a second. You 
                        gotta see outside the box.

           Tom blinks. 

                                 TOM
                        Where?

           Sparrow looks right into the camera.

                                 SPARROW
                        There.

           Tom joins his look- right into the camera.

           Looking from behind Tom and Sparrow, a FILM CREW stands in 
           front of them. Cameras with crew, a small sound team, a 
           DIRECTOR watches a monitor with headphones. A script 
           supervisor takes notes.

           Tom looks over his shoulder-
           180 degrees to a SECOND FILM CREW catching a second angle of 
           coverage.

           Tom backs up.

                                 TOM
                        Oh god-

                                 SPARROW
                        I’ve been trying to tell you for a 
                        while, pal, I’m sorry.

                                 TOM
                        What is this?

                                 SPARROW
                        This is a movie. We’re in a... 
                        Fucking movie. There’s a script. 
                        There’s a camera crew- there’s 
                        actors-

                                 TOM
                        Shut up.

                                 SPARROW
                        You’re starring in a movie about a 
                        writer, god help us. You’ve got a 
                        whole lot of people who have been 
                        very patiently waiting for 
                        something to happen and-- you’ve 
                        confused the movies with real life!

           Tom backs up shaking his head venomously. The film crew 
           adjusts itself around him.

                                 TOM
                        That’s not true. That’s impossible.

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay, you’re skeptical. That’s 
                        fine. Look at that guy. Who is that 
                        guy?

           Sparrow points at Jason Bourne, lying on the pavement.

                                 TOM
                        That’s... A figment of my 
                        imagination Jason Bourne?

                                 SPARROW
                        Ma-Maaaa? Mah! Matt Damon? That’s 
                        Matt Fucking Damon, dude.
           Tom bends down look- he DOES look a lot like Matt Damon! Tom 
           shakes his head incredulously. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        You ready to get skull fucked? 
                        You’re in a movie where Matt Damon 
                        is playing Jason Bourne, who is now 
                        back to playing Matt Damon. 

           Tom backs up.

                                 TOM
                        No. 

           Sparrow steps forward- gaining on him. The film crew isn’t 
           trying to hide anymore- they are surrounding them.

                                 SPARROW
                        Your father? Larry? The audience 
                        didn’t even know his name. Paper 
                        fucking thin. Eating ramen noodles 
                        and never to be heard from again?

                                 TOM
                        I don’t have to talk to my dad 
                        every day!

                                 SPARROW
                        Your ex-wife? Bailey? Everything we 
                        know about her came from that 
                        fucking exercise of imaginary 
                        circumstances- WHO THE FUCK IS SHE?

                                 TOM
                        Please stop it-

                                 SPARROW
                        You’ve been playing around 
                        pretending to be Charlie Fucking 
                        Kaufman and Tony Fucking Gilroy, 
                        we’re 80 minutes in and guess what, 
                        we’re fucking bored of your shit.

                                 TOM
                        I’m just doing the best I can-

                                 SPARROW
                        And I’ll do you one further. You. 
                        Are Tom Milton. Paper thin, Tommy 
                        Milton. A character in a movie. A 
                        writer wrote you. An actor plays 
                        you, motherfucker. You’re ten 
                        different people’s slice of 
                        reality. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SPARROW (CONT'D)
                        A freak in a really misguided 
                        attempt at cinema. A movie with 
                        scenes that are way too long. You 
                        are a device to help the people out 
                        there-

           Sparrow points into the lens- at us.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        -make sense of their reality.

                                 TOM
                        NO!

           SLAM!

           Tom belts Sparrow directly in the face.

           Absolute fucking chaos breaks out. Tom turns to THE CAMERA 
           and punches it- cracking the lens. It falls on its side, 
           catching a brutal scuffle lopsided. 

           POV switches to ANOTHER CAMERA, shaky and held above the 
           crowd as Tom fights against the film crew shooting his life. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Let me out! LET ME OUT 
                        MOTHERFUCKERS!

           Tom kicks at the DP before grabbing the boom pole from the 
           sound guy and swinging it around- we hear it all.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You get the FUCK AWAY FROM ME! 
                        DON’T FOLLOW ME! GET THE FUCK AWAY!

           Tom runs.

           The camera in fact does not follow him. He stays shattered on 
           its side- however the sound of Tom running can still be heard 
           loud and clear.

           Black screen.

           INT. BLACKNESS - NIGHT

           The sound of Tom running.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Oh my god oh my shit oh my sweet 
                        fucking god oh shit oh jesus-

           -and so on.
           The sound of a metal door opening. Echoing footsteps as Tom 
           scales a set of stairs in what must be some kind of concrete 
           staircase. He pants loudly into his mic. Another door slams. 

           He gasps for breath- it feels like an eternity.

                                 TOM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh god what is happening. What is 
                        happening.

           Tom lets out a small sob. It echoes into the cavern of 
           nothingness. 

           Silence.

            Silence.

             Silence.

              Silence.

               Silence.

                Silence.

                 Silence.

                  Silence.

                    Silence.

                     Silence.

                    Silence.

                   Silence.

                  Silence.

                 Silence.

                Silence.

               Silence.

              Silence.

             Silence.

            Silence.

           Silence.
                        There’s an entire minute of silence.

                            Yes, it’s very uncomfortable.
                                 SPARROW (O.S.)
                        Tom?

                                 TOM
                        SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP! JUST SHUT 
                        YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!

                                 SPARROW
                        What are you doing, kid?

           Tom is crying.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t want to do this anymore.

                                 SPARROW
                        Come on, open your eyes.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t like this.

                                 SPARROW
                        Why?

                                 TOM
                        If I’m just a character in some 
                        stupid movie then what’s the 
                        fucking point?

                                 SPARROW
                        It’s not about what to show or not 
                        to show. It’s about creating a 
                        catharsis for the audience.

           INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET - NIGHT

           Tom opens his eyes. It’s extremely dark in the cramped 
           janitors closet. Sparrow stands in the doorway. Tom looks up 
           at him, pale as a ghost.

                                 SPARROW
                        You are a character in a movie. 
                        Fact. People are watching you. 
                        Fact. If they’re not watching it in 
                        a theater, they’re watching it in 
                        their homes, or maybe on a city 
                        bus. You can’t control anything 
                        except for what goes on this screen 
                        right here. THIS Is our reality, 
                        and it’s all you’ve got. Because if 
                        they get bored, they’ll turn you 
                        off, forget you, and then you’re 
                        truly dead. 
           Tom looks up at Ron. Then into the camera.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        That’s right. There they are. Wave 
                        hello.

           Tom waves, in a daze. Sparrow kneels to the floor to meet 
           Tom’s gaze.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Now, by my count, we’re about 85 
                        minutes into this movie. 

                                 TOM
                        85?

                                 SPARROW
                        This ain’t Lord of the Rings, kid. 
                        You’ve only got a little while 
                        until they start rolling the 
                        credits. That’s our lifespan, dude. 
                        That’s all we get. This is your 
                        story. You want truth? You want to 
                        make us FEEL something? Then accept 
                        the reality of the situation, and 
                        do something with it.

           Tom rises and pushes Sparrow.

                                 TOM
                        I’M NOT YOUR FUCKING MONKEY! I’M 
                        NOT HERE FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT! 
                        YOU WANT ME TO SING AND DANCE AND 
                        DO ALL THIS SHIT FOR YOU- OKAY! 
                        HERE WE GO!

           In the hallway outside of the Janitors closet, a BRASS BAND 
           begins to play, much to Tom’s surprise. 

           He watches them play- they look back at him, uncertainly.

                                 SPARROW
                        You’re not dancing. 

           The band comes to a slow halt.  

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Tom steps out into the hallway, surrounded by the Brass Band.

           Tom looks to Sparrow. He holds in his tears. 
                                 TOM
                        I feel like I’m blowing it. 

           Sparrow nods sympathetically.

                                 SPARROW
                        Well... yeah. We’re all blowing it, 
                        a little bit. You think anyone is 
                        really happy with their lives?

           Tom considers this.

                                 TOM
                        Okay.

           Sparrow smiles.

                                 SPARROW
                        You got about ten minutes. What do 
                        you want to do with it?

                                 TOM
                        God. Okay. I guess... Fix my 
                        marriage and... Fix this movie. 

                                 SPARROW
                        It’s all about second chances. 
                        Remember?

           Tom breaks through the brass band, walking down the hallway. 
           Sparrow follows. 

           EXT. GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY - SUNSET

           Bailey stands by a railing of the Griffith Observatory, 
           looking out over the city. 

           From far away, across the parking lot- Tom and Sparrow watch 
           her. 

                                 SPARROW
                        Is this going to be a little bit of 
                        ‘Say Anything?’

           A MAN comes up behind Bailey . We don’t see his face, but the 
           back of his head looks an awful lot like Matt Damon’s. He 
           puts his arm around her. She twists into him, smiling- 
           surprised. She hugs him and gives him a quick kiss before 
           beginning to speak animatedly. 

           Tom watches this, surprised.
                                 TOM
                        Wait, what the fuck is that?

                                 SPARROW
                        Surprised?

                                 TOM
                        She can’t... I mean, this is my 
                        movie right, who the fuck is that 
                        guy?

                                 SPARROW
                        I guess if you’re not going to 
                        write scenes with her, she’s just 
                        going to do her own thing.

           Sparrow looks over to him.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        What? Does that not make sense?

                                 TOM
                        Not really.

                                 SPARROW
                        So. Rewrite it. 

           Tom watches the couple walk around the observatory. 

                                 TOM
                        No... Maybe another time.

           Sparrow smiles at this.

                                 SPARROW
                        Sure. 

           Tom turns towards the city.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        Last stop?

                                 TOM
                        I guess so.

                                 SPARROW
                        Okay. Go get em.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

           Tom walks up to MISSY.
                                 TOM
                        Hi Missy.

                                 MISSY
                        Hi, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Hey- so I know you and I haven’t 
                        ever really spoken, but I always 
                        like what you wear and you’ve got a 
                        good... Like, look about you that 
                        makes you a likeable character and 
                        you’re always really soothing to 
                        see, but there hasn’t been much 
                        else other than that, so I just 
                        wanted to say sorry that I’m... I 
                        don’t know. So self absorbed. You 
                        never got to be a real character. 
                        Are Jeff and Mike in?

           Tom walks past Missy and into the office.

                                 MISSY
                        Uh- ?

           Tom walks into the belly of the production office. 

           In the conference room, Jeff and Mike are speaking with 
           Chloe. Tom looks to the ceiling.

                                 TOM
                        Of course.

           Tom bangs on the glass window. Everyone turns to him. He 
           waves.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Tom opens up the glass door. 

                                 TOM
                        Hey guys! How convenient that 
                        you’re all here! It’s like 
                        someone’s writing this. 

                                 JEFF
                        Tom, we were actually in a meeting-

                                 TOM
                        Uh-huh. I bet you were.

                                 MIKE
                        Dude, you can’t just come in here.
                                 TOM
                        What were you guys talking about?

                                 JEFF
                        The Bourne Movie.

                                 TOM
                        Predictably, but what specifically.

           Jeff and Mike eye each other nervously.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah- I’m sorry, I just... Let’s 
                        just- hey Chloe, sorry- let’s just 
                        skip the angry at me part because 
                        we don’t have a lot of time left, 
                        and lets just get on with the show.

                                 JEFF
                        Show?

                                 TOM
                        I’ve got a pitch for you. All of 
                        you. You too, Chloe. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Who the fuck do you think you are?

                                 TOM
                        I’m just getting through my movie 
                        here-

                                 CHLOE
                        No, hey- hello?

           Tom stops. Chloe is standing up now.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        I got the same fucking education as 
                        you, you can’t just go around 
                        playing god because you figured it 
                        out.

                                 TOM
                        Sorry?

                                 CHLOE
                        Get the fuck out of here, Tom!

           Tom hesitates.

                                 TOM
                        ...No. 
           Angry, Chloe stomps around the table, grabs Tom by his shirt 
           collar and picks him up-

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hey- hey!

           And tosses him through the glass divider. Tom rolls to his 
           feet. He grabs a stapler off of the nearest desk, opens its 
           mouth wide and brandishes it defensively. 

           Chloe grabs a pair of scissors and the two of them face off 
           in the middle of the production company.

           Chloe swings for Tom- misses. Tom swings the stapler and 
           punches a staple into the back of her hand. She swings at him 
           again- the scissors go into his shoulder. 

           Tom yells in agony, buckling under the pain. Chloe withdraws 
           the scissors- raises them again and swings down over Tom’s 
           head.

           Tom catches her wrist at the last possible second- the 
           scissors are centimeters away from Tom’s face. He struggles 
           to keep her at bay. 

           Chloe scowls at him, putting all her strength downwards.

           BANG.

           Chloe’s brains get blown out. 

           Bloody, bruised and broken Jason Bourne stands on the 
           opposite end of the production company, lowering his gun.

           Tom gasps for breath, and nods at Jason.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Thanks Jason Bourne.

           Jason Bourne gives Tom the thumbs up. 

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tom takes a seat at the conference room table. Jeff and Mike 
           stare at him speechless.

                                 TOM
                        Sorry about that.

            Tom takes a deep breath.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        The Bourne Resurrection takes place 
                        ten years after the original. 
                        Sticking with the trope of the 
                        movies we all know and love, Jason 
                        Bourne is framed by a government 
                        agency for a crime he didn’t 
                        commit. 

           EXT. OCEAN COAST - DUSK

           Jason Bourne sits on the rocks of the ocean coast, looking 
           out to the sea. He rubs his fingers through his hair.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        But Jason isn’t out for vengeance. 
                        All he wants is a second chance at 
                        life. 

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tom is seated at the conference room.

                                 TOM
                        This time he falls in love. With a 
                        cleaning lady.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAY

           IN SLOW MOTION: Bourne falls through a shattering glass wall 
           with the Cleaning Lady in his arms, firing at MARTIN as he 
           does so. He holds onto her tightly with one hand.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff sits up.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s the Cleaning Lady’s name?

           Tom thinks about it.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - DAY

           Jason is falling in slow motion- The Cleaning Lady is 
           clutching him tightly. She loses one of her high heels.

           Time speeds back up. Martin flies through the air, jumping 
           towards Bourne with a SWITCH BLADE in his hands.
           Bourne catches the blow with crossed wrists, barely 
           deflecting it. Inches away from him is a shitty blue bic pen.

           Bourne struggles to keep Martin’s knife at bay while reaching 
           for the pen. 

           He grabs it, and shoves it into Martin’s neck.  He pushes 
           Martin off. 

                                 BOURNE
                        What’s your name?

           She is curled up against the nearby wall. Bourne sits up, 
           offers her a hand.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. It’s over. It’s done. 
                        What’s your name?

           She looks deep into Bourne’s eyes.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Bailey.

           Bourne smiles.

                                 BOURNE
                        Bailey. 

           The elevator bell dings. Bourne looks to it.

                                 BOURNE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get us out of here now.

           Bailey watches as Bourne stands up, gripping the bloody bic 
           pen.

           INT. HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Bourne steps into the hallway just short of the elevator 
           doors. They open- another guard steps out-

           SHUNT!

           Bourne shoves the ballpoint pen into the guard’s hand, 
           causing him to drop his gun. He chops at the guards throat 
           and sends his elbow onto his shoulder, effectively silencing 
           him. 

           He looks to a SECURITY CAMERA in the corner, and then to 
           Bailey.
                                 BOURNE
                        Bailey. It’s gonna be safer for you 
                        if you come with me.

           Jason is holding her shoe. He offers it to her.

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff and Mike listen, engaged.

                                 MIKE
                        But why is it going to be safer if 
                        she comes with you?

                                 TOM
                        He doesn’t want to get any more 
                        blood on his hands. There are 
                        cameras watching them everywhere. 
                        He’s not going to let someone else 
                        die because of him.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bailey is stitching up a gash in Bourne’s shoulder. She 
           pricks him. He winces.

                                 BOURNE
                        First time?

                                 BAILEY 
                        Sorry.

           He smiles.

                                 BOURNE
                        It’s okay.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        He will fight for her. He will die 
                        for her. Because it doesn’t matter 
                        if she loves him. It’s not even 
                        about love. 

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Tom stands, orating before Jeff and Mike.

                                 TOM
                        It’s about getting a second chance 
                        at being the person he was, before 
                        he was Jason Bourne. 
           EXT. OCEAN COAST - DUSK

           Bourne and Bailey walk along the coast, wrapped around each 
           other. All smiles.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        You wanted me to reinvent the 
                        franchise. This is how you do it. 
                        Give us something to hope for. Show 
                        a little behind the curtain. Give 
                        us a little more Matt Damon than 
                        Jason Bourne-

           Indeed, Bourne is talking more animatedly than we have seen 
           him in three movies.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Sure, we’ll give you villains. 
                        International terrorism. Brutal 
                        fights with everyday household 
                        objects. Fine. But this is a story 
                        about life. 

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mike and Jeff look at each other, then back to Tom. Tom 
           blinks at them.

                                 TOM
                        Did any of what I just said make 
                        any sense?

           Smiles come over their faces.

           INT. CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT

           Grauman’s Chinese Theater is packed to the brim. On the 
           screen- Jason Bourne and Bailey run down a hall before 
           jumping out of a window. 

           Tom sits in the audience, watching the movie. His eyes drift 
           across the audience. He sees his father, who nods at him 
           proudly. He nods back. 

           He sees Mike and Jeff. He sees Chloe, sitting in a wheel 
           chair with her head bandaged. She sits next to Martin, who 
           ignores Tom. Tom smiles with embarrassment.  

           On the screen, a dripping wet Jason Bourne talks to Bailey.
                                 BOURNE
                        This isn’t me anymore. I’ve been 
                        running in circles for so long, I 
                        don’t even know who I’m running for 
                        or why. How long can you punish 
                        someone? How long can someone take 
                        that kind of punishment.

           In the audience, Matt Damon gives Tom the thumbs up. Tom 
           smiles politely, then gets up.

           INT. CHINESE THEATER - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Tom walks along the hallway, looking at black and white 
           hollywood photos.

                                 BAILEY  (O.S.)
                        Hey stranger.

           Tom turns. Bailey is there, dressed in a ball gown. Tom 
           smiles at her.

                                 TOM
                        I didn’t think you’d come.

                                 BAILEY 
                        How do I look?

                                 TOM
                        You look great. 

                                 BAILEY 
                        Why aren’t you happy?

                                 TOM
                        What do you mean?

                                 BAILEY 
                        Dude, you wrote a Jason Bourne 
                        movie! You’re like the shit now. 
                        You’ve been talking about this 
                        since we were twenty- why aren’t 
                        you fucking psyched?

                                 TOM
                        I’m... I don’t know. I’m psyched. 
                        It’s just hard when it’s... 

                                 BAILEY 
                        What?
                                 TOM
                        Movies aren’t real. You know? None 
                        of it’s real.

           Bailey goes up to him and gives him a big hug.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Are there people in there watching 
                        that movie? Having an emotional 
                        experience?

                                 TOM
                        ... Kind of.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Then it’s real.

           She kisses him on the cheek.

                                 BAILEY  (CONT’D)
                        Try to enjoy your fifteen minutes. 
                        You’re only a writer.

           Tom nods. Bailey starts to walk away.

                                 TOM
                        Bailey.

           She stops.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        If I told you that... You were a 
                        character in a movie- right now, 
                        and that everything is just... Fake 
                        and you’re just a construct of 
                        someone’s imagination, what would 
                        you say to me?

           She thinks about it.

                                 BAILEY 
                        Like... All *this* is a movie?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.

                                 BAILEY 
                        And our life is a movie.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.
                                 BAILEY 
                        If you’re the one calling all the 
                        shots, I guess in this hypothetical 
                        reality in which I’m a movie 
                        character in a movie you’ve 
                        written, I’d ask you why we ended 
                        up divorced. 

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know. You were the one that 
                        was pushing for it. 

           She gives him a sly little smile.

                                 BAILEY 
                        You gonna let your characters push 
                        you around like that?

           That makes him smile.

                                 TOM
                        You should see how I pushed Jason 
                        Bourne around.

           Bailey makes her way down the hallway.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Bailey?

                                 BAILEY 
                        Mmhm?

                                 TOM
                        For what it’s worth... I’m sorry 
                        that I... I don’t know. I’m sorry I 
                        couldn’t keep us together. 

                                 BAILEY 
                        Make sure someone cool plays me.

           She disappears on the other end of the hall.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah...

           Tom walks down the hallway towards a pair of double door. 

           INT. CHINESE THEATER - LOBBY

           Tom walks to the lobby. He goes to the concessions stand. An 
           USHER waits for him.
                                 USHER
                        Movie’s almost over.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. 

                                 USHER
                        Want to take a snack for the road?

           Tom considers. 

                                 TOM
                        Um... No thanks.

           Tom looks around.

                                 USHER
                        Help you with something?

                                 TOM
                        I’m just looking for a... Friend. I 
                        thought he might be here. But he’s 
                        not here.

                                 USHER
                        Maybe he’s watching the movie. 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. Maybe. 

                                 USHER
                        You should get back in there. 
                        You’re missing the ending. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s okay. I know what happens.

           The Usher smiles at him. 

                                 USHER
                        Are you sure?

           Tom looks at the Usher, then back to the lobby doors. 

                                 TOM
                        ... No. I guess I’m not. 

           Tom heads towards the theater.

           INT. CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT

           Tom resumes his seat. 
           Jason Bourne and Bailey walk along the beach. Closing moments 
           of the film. They’re arm-in-arm together. 

           They pass TOM, sitting on a beach bench.

           He waves to them. They wave back, smiling. Tom watches them 
           walk along into the distance. 

                                 SPARROW (O.S.)
                        You’ve had fifteen minutes where 
                        you are literally God-

           Tom looks over to Sparrow, who has appeared next to him.

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        -You are the author of your 
                        reality. You can fly! You can 
                        create entire worlds! That folding 
                        city thing they did in Inception- 
                        you could have done that- and 
                        instead- 

                                 TOM
                        I didn’t want to turn it into a 
                        different kind of movie. 

           Sparrow shakes his head. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I was looking for you in the lobby.

                                 SPARROW
                        I wanted to be here instead. Where 
                        are we?

                                 TOM
                        Maui.

                                 SPARROW
                        Better than the Chinese theater. 

           Tom nods. The two friends look out to the sunset together.

                                 TOM
                        Think anyone is going to enjoy 
                        this?

           Sparrow laughs.

                                 SPARROW
                        I don’t know. Not your problem 
                        anymore. The movie’s over.
                                 TOM
                        I’m glad you were here for this.

                                 SPARROW
                        Glad to be here.

           The END CREDITS begin to roll. 

           The image doesn’t fade out. Instead, it stays, for the entire 
           credits. Tom and Sparrow talk back and forth, commenting and 
           joking on the names in the credits. 

                                 SPARROW (CONT’D)
                        You think Tony Gilroy will get a 
                        special thanks?

           They laugh when they see he does. 

           The credits end. 

                                 TOM
                        We’re still here.

           Sparrow nods.

                                 SPARROW
                        Yup. Post-credit’s scene. Lucky 
                        you. Mr. Marvel.

                                 TOM
                        Something important is supposed to 
                        happen, right, like some sequel 
                        shit?

           Tom turns- looking for a clue- only to come face to face with 
           a gun barrel. 

           He follows the gun barrel up a suited arm, until he reaches 
           the face-

           -of Daniel Craig as James Bond. He smirks at Tom. 

           Tom gets up- on his feet in a flash and begins to run across 
           the beach, towards the camera-

           CUT TO BLACK.
