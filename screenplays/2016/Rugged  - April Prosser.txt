                                                            OVER BLACK:

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        Oh God please, I don’t want to die!

           EXT. SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS - DAY 

           FOG rolls ACROSS a rocky ALPINE RIDGE. KATE (think Kristen 
           Wiig) filthy, terrified, covered in cuts and bruises - hangs 
           from a CRUMBLING SLOPE, CLINGING to a BREAKING BRANCH. A die-
           hard optimist... except for now that she might actually die. 

           BLAIR, (think Amy Schumer) 30, drinks a little too often to 
           be in great shape, tries to PULL Kate back onto SAFE GROUND:

                                 BLAIR
                             (yells over shoulder)
                        Help!! Anne, Cassie, quick!

           But no one’s coming -- it’s up to Blair. She STEELS herself. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        OK, I can do this. Do you trust me?

                                 KATE
                             (whimpers, sincerely)
                        Not really.

                                 BLAIR
                        I need you to trust me. 

                                 KATE
                        I don’t trust you. Get someone 
                        else. Please!

                                 BLAIR
                        Kate - give me your hand. 

           Kate SHAKES her head, frantic. But just as the BRANCH snaps, 
           Kate lets go - SLAP! - connecting with BLAIR’S HAND. Their 
           eyes locked, Blair uses every trembling muscle to DRAG her 
           up. It’s heartwarming, heroic... Until Kate SLIPS from 
           Blair’s grip and FALLS OUT OF SIGHT INTO THE ABYSS.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Oh no! Oh shit! Oh fuck! 

           ANNE, 34, and CASSIE, 28, arrive moments too late - to find:

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I think I killed our boss. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           OPENING CREDITS: WE SEE A DREAMY SEQUENCE OF STARTING A JOB:

           INT. GREEN TECH - FLASHBACK MONTAGE

           A young, hustling LOFT SPACE for a 25-person SILICON VALLEY 
           TECH STARTUP. MOD CUBICLES in the middle - and a GRAFFITI 
           FOREST MURAL painted across the WINDOWS and GLASS OFFICES. 

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        You know when you start a job and 
                        everything is new and exciting? 

           The quirky tech CEO, EMMETT introduces Kate to coworkers. 

                                 EMMETT
                        This is Kate, our new VP of Sales. 

           KATE’S OFFICE: Kate assembles her team: Blair, Cassie (think 
           Ellie Kemper) - equal parts enthusiastic and naive, and Anne - 
           (think Rashida Jones) reserved, here to work not play.

                                 KATE
                        Blair, Cassie, Anne: welcome 
                        aboard...

           CUBICLES: Anne, Blair and Cassie SIT in adjacent desks - 
           working the PHONES - already firing on all cylinders. 

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        It’s when everyone tries their best 
                        to work hard and get along. Our 
                        sales team operates like a relay 
                        race. Cassie finds the leads, Blair 
                        closes and Anne handles contracts. 

                                 CASSIE
                        New lead for you!

           Blair NODS, finishing her own CALL. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Great decision, Paul, you’re going 
                        to be very happy!
                             (hangs up)
                        Booyah! Anne, email coming shortly!

                                 ANNE
                        On it. 

           Blair PICKS UP the next CALL. Kate PASSES BY, impressed.

                                 KATE
                        Good job, team. You’re on fire. 
                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        Of course, the more you get to know 
                        people, the more you get to know 
                        their quirks. Like there’s always 
                        that one overly-cheerful coworker 
                        just waiting for you to arrive.

           MORNING: Cassie waves them over to watch a CAT VIDEO. 

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s cats talking about God! You 
                        have to watch until the end!!

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        Or the slightly standoffish one... 

           LUNCH: Anne STANDS uncomfortably as the whole office sings 
           her “HAPPY BIRTHDAY”, GIVING her cake - which she DECLINES. 

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        Or the one who works harder at 
                        getting out of work than working.

           EVENING: Blair, wearing an “I LIKE BAGELS” t-shirt and 
           sunglasses, NODS OFF at her DESK, hands on keyboard. 

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        And before you know it, this 
                        unspoken hierarchy forms between 
                        the dominant personalities and the 
                        weaker. The cynical one starts 
                        picking on the naive one... 

           NIGHT: Blair FAKE-READS from her PHONE to a riveted Cassie.

                                 BLAIR
                        Cassie, did you see your horoscope? 
                        “Hey Aries, you deserve a treat! 
                        Take coworkers out for a round of 
                        drinks and you’ll be glad you did.”   

                                 CASSIE
                        Omigosh, wow!

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah, geez, I guess drinks on you 
                        tonight... Anne, you in?

           Anne stifles a SMILE, SHAKES her HEAD - not wanting to 
           partake.  

                                 ANNE
                        Aw, sorry, I’m not drinking. Scott 
                        and I are doing a cleanse.
                                 BLAIR
                        Pregs?

                                 ANNE
                             (smirks)
                        No. Not every married person wants 
                        kids.

                                 BLAIR
                             (dumbfounded)
                        Why else wouldn’t you be drinking?

           DAY: Anne receives an EMAIL from Blair - “I’m so sick, could 
           you cover for me?” Anne replies, “Of course! Feel better!! :)

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        And at first you pass these things 
                        off as funny. As long as the job 
                        gets done. But... they say 
                        familiarity breeds contempt. 

           ANOTHER MORNING: Cassie STANDS UP while on her desk phone - 
           doing weird, limber STRETCHES and BENDS to POP her JOINTS. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (into phone, pitching)
                        Hi, I’m calling from Green Tech. We 
                        make charging stations for electric 
                        vehicles... Yes, the future is now! 

           Meanwhile, Blair pours a COFFEE in the coffee station and 
           HUMS INCONSPICUOUSLY, SLIDING over to the OFFICE BAR to POUR 
           BAILEYS in before heading back to their desks. Anne notices. 

                                 ANNE
                        It’s eight o’clock somewhere, huh?

                                 BLAIR
                        Oof... Had a work drinks last night 
                        I’m still easing out of. 

                                 ANNE
                        Your dedication is inspiring. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Closed it. It’s not easy to have so 
                        many flaming margaritas but those 
                        are the sacrifices I’m willing to 
                        make for this job.
                             (turns to Cassie)
                        Dude, quit being weird. You’re 
                        giving boners to the engineers.

           A LINE of nerdy SOFTWARE ENGINEERS watch Cassie bend over.
                                 CASSIE
                             (covers phone, defensive)
                        My sciatica acts up when I’m 
                        stressed. Good lead, line two! He’s 
                        starting a new software company.

                                 BLAIR
                        Does he have revenue? Employees? 
                             (off her unsure look)
                        The last lead you sent was a kid in 
                        middle school pitching me his 
                        science project. 

                                 CASSIE
                        What, he had a good idea. 

                                 KATE  (V.O.)
                        And after days upon months upon 
                        years, you find yourself becoming 
                        more and more annoyed... Ditzy 
                        becomes dumb, standoffish becomes 
                        bitchy and lazy becomes degenerate.

           ANOTHER MORNING: Cassie emails, doing WEIRD STRETCHES in her 
           CHAIR - in back pain. Anne RECEIVES an email from Blair - 
           “Flu, could you cover?”  Anne FIRES OFF, “I guess so.” 

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t believe she gets paid the 
                        same amount as us. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I think she gets more.

                                 ANNE
                        What?!

           KATE’S OFFICE: Anne meets with Kate.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to tattle but Blair’s 
                        been missing work a lot and I think 
                        if you addressed it, she’d listen. 

                                 KATE
                        Totally, yes, absolutely, will deal 
                        with it right away. 

           MORNING: Anne ARRIVES- sees Blair’s empty chair. Shakes her 
           head, irritated. Kate did nothing about it. 

           DAY: The three girls WORK side by side, on the phone, 
           disgruntled, all at breaking points for different reasons... 
                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        Until finally if they do it one 
                        more goddamn time you’re going to 
                        lose your fucking mind and no one 
                        can stand working together and the 
                        whole system breaks down.
                             (then, ominous)
                        That was today.

           Cassie guns for a deep knee pop, waving PHONE at Blair. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Blair! 

                                 BLAIR
                        No. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Blair-Blair! It’s a good one!

                                 BLAIR
                        NO. You waste my time with these 
                        terrible leads. And if you yoga pop 
                        one more time, I’ll hurt you. 
                             (turns to Anne)
                        Why didn’t you tell me AAA’s not 
                        signing?!

                                 ANNE
                             (mutes her own call)
                        Oops, I’m sorry, I didn’t want to 
                        interrupt your afternoon nap.

           Blair WAVES contracts in Anne’s face.

                                 BLAIR
                        They were closed with me which 
                        means you fucked the end game. 

                                 ANNE
                        Oh right, I fucked it?

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah, with your negative juju. 

                                 ANNE
                        Please. You probably blacked out 
                        and forgot to get back to them. You 
                        know drinking all day’s not how 
                        work works, right? This isn’t Mad 
                        Men. And stop waving these in my 
                        fucking face!
           Anne grabs the PAPERS, THROWS them back at her. Kate walks 
           up, showing a group of INVESTORS around... 

                                 KATE
                        I’m so excited to introduce you to- 

           Kate sees the girls, ABOUT-FACE-TURNS one moment too late. 
           The Investors LOOK ON in shock as Blair YANKS Anne’s HEADSET 
           off and THROWS it behind her, KNOCKING Cassie off of her 
           CHAIR into a PLANT... 

                                 KATE (V.O.)
                        And that’s when the big boss 
                        notices...

           INT. GREEN TECH - EMMETT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Quirky startup decor: bean bags, Nintendo, outdoorsy photos. 
           The eccentric, obtuse CEO, Emmett (think Bill Hader), SITS 
           across from Kate. This is the source of our voice-over.

                                 KATE
                        ... and you get called into his 
                        office and he stares blankly at you 
                        and you get nervous. 

           He stares at her. 

                                 EMMETT
                        You know I’m not your therapist, 
                        right? I just asked if you can fix 
                        your team...

                                 KATE
                        Oh! Yes! Sorry, no, yes, I do think 
                        this is fixable-

                                 EMMETT
                        --You just said no one can stand 
                        working together.

                                 KATE
                        Right but who really likes their 
                        coworkers, am I right? 
                             (off his look)
                        I mean I do. Everyone’s amazing. 
                        But elsewhere in other offices.

                                 EMMETT
                        Kate, look at my career. Do you 
                        know why I’m considered an 
                        innovator?

                        I saved Groupon from bankruptcy in 
                        2008 when I forced the entire staff 
                        to live in a commune for a month. I 
                        sent a team of Google engineers 
                        scuba diving to increase 
                        productivity, the list goes on. 
                        What got me here? ...My brain? 

                                 KATE
                        No.

                                 EMMETT
                             (surprised)
                        No? 

                                 KATE
                        Sorry, you set it up like that 
                        wasn’t the answer. 

                                 EMMETT
                        It’s not, you’re correct. But it 
                        was supposed to be a trick 
                        question. Okay. How about my gut?

                                 KATE
                             (now unsure)
                        No.

                                 EMMETT
                        Yes, gut. I go on gut. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh, I almost said yes, was just 
                        expecting three... 

                                 EMMETT
                        I don’t look at résumés, they only 
                        tell me what someone’s done - I 
                        look at what someone can do. I see 
                        you, Kate. I see so deep within 
                        you, I’m inside you right now. Do 
                        you know where I’m going with this?

                                 KATE
                        I hope not. 

                                 EMMETT
                        Most bosses would have taken one 
                        look at your bio and thrown it 
                        right in the garbage. “Loser. 
                        Next.” And they’d be right. You 
                        probably shouldn’t be a supervisor.

                             (humbly, whispers)
                        Well, fifteen years experience- 

                                 EMMETT
                        --But my gut said you were going to 
                        do something special so I gave you 
                        a shot. I find you less intolerable 
                        than I find most sales people. 

                                 KATE
                        Thank you. 

                                 EMMETT
                        Perhaps because you remind me of my 
                        great Aunt. Or that you say yes to 
                        pretty much everything I say... 

                                 KATE
                        Yes... 

                                 EMMETT
                        But you’re a pleaser. I think you 
                        avoid conflict.   

                                 KATE
                        Uh-oh, have you been talking to my 
                        ex? I’m kidding - a little personal 
                        relationship humor - listen, okay, 
                        I take full responsibility here. I 
                        wanted to give them a chance to 
                        resolve things on their own but hey 
                        if it’s time to bring the hammer 
                        down, then it’s hammer time.

                                 EMMETT
                        Do you really mean that or are you 
                        just saying it to avoid conflict? 

                                 KATE
                        What part?

           He PICKS UP a photo of him SUMMITING the harrowing, ice-
           capped peak of K-2 alongside three red-headed IRISH MEN.

                                 EMMETT
                        Do you know what this is?

                        my life.

                        We had to wring out our socks and 
                        drink the sweat when things got 
                        rough but we made it through. We 
                        didn’t start off as friends but we 
                        ended as goddamn brothers - excuse 
                        me, I get passionate about this.

                        You want us to do a team building?

                        That sounds too corporate. Let’s 
                        call it a digital detox-- Nah, 
                        that’s so trendy... perhaps think 
                        of it as one long happy trail.

           Did he mean that innuendo?

                                 KATE
                        Okay...

                        Get out in nature. Disconnect with 
                        society to connect with each other. 
                        I think you should take them on a 
                        three-day hike up Mount Angeles. 

                                 KATE
                        Wait, that’s it? We just have to go 
                        on a hike? Yes! Like with a guide?

                        Kate, fuck a guide. FUCK-A-GUIDE.

                             (rallying)

                                 EMMETT
                        You’re leading! I don’t care how 
                        good your team is if they’re not 
                        being led. There’s no better way to 
                        learn how to work together than 
                        hiking a mountain. You can’t 
                        “accidentally” get to the top. If 
                        you do it, that means you really 
                        had to work and live together 
                        nonstop for three days. It’s no K-2 
                        but if you can summit, you can save 
                        your team. Do you get what I mean?
                                 KATE
                        Yes, if we get to the top, we’ve 
                        proven we can work together?

                                 EMMETT
                        I mean that if you don’t get a 
                        photo at the top everyone’s fired.

                        Everyone - as in- to be clear, who

                        the top, not to bother coming back.

                        very nervous about getting stuck in 
                        the desert again... Now a champagne 
                        brunch I’ve heard can be quite 
                        bonding-

                             (grim)
                        And we do this or everyone’s fired. 
                        Without severance. And it’ll be 
                        tough to find a new job without a 
                        recommendation from this one.

                        I can do trail wine. 

           Kate LOOKS at Anne, hopeful. Anne GROANS, relenting.

                        Fine. Whatever. If I don’t have to 
                        watch Blair pick her ear with a pen 
                        anymore, why not?

                        --Okay. Cassie? 

           They LOOK at Cassie, who is already stressing. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (whispers, counting down)
                        “Sciatica” in five, four, three... 

                                 CASSIE
                        Believe me, I’d love to be in the 
                        Great Outdoors and out of this 
                        stupid chair with my sciatica-
                                 BLAIR
                        Whaaaat?! You have sciatica?! Why 
                        didn’t you ever tell us?! 

                                 CASSIE
                        But I have a big solar panels demo 
                        on Tuesday. Plus my P’s about to 
                        start and I have a heavy flow.

                                 KATE
                        You do grasp there’s no job to come 
                        back to if you don’t do this?

                                 BLAIR
                        She doesn’t. Doesn’t grasp that. 
                             (calls out, waves iPhone)
                        Cassie, did you see your horoscope? 
                        “Hey Aries, if someone offers an 
                        adventure, your life depends on 
                        saying yes.” Wow, so cryptic - I 
                        wonder what it means. 

           Cassie considers this - LEANS BACK in her CHAIR, debating...

           Anne has to look away to suppress a smile. Cassie’s CHAIR 
           suddenly collapses under her. She FALLS TO THE GROUND. She 
           GETS UP with PRIMAL RAGE, violently SHAKES the CHAIR. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I hate this motherfucking fucking 
                        fucker!!! Fuck this, let’s do it. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (frightened, whispers)
                        Too late to change my answer back?

                                 KATE
                        Alright, “summit a mountain, save 
                        our team.” Let’s do this. 

           As they start to HEAD OUT... Anne TURNS to Kate:

                                 ANNE
                        You know what you’re doing, right?

                                 KATE
                        Absolutely, I’ve gone backpacking 
                        with my ex. This will be great!  

                                 KATE (PRELAP) (CONT’D)
                        I have no idea what I’m doing. 
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           A TRAIL MAP of the Sierra Nevada Mountains is ROLLED OUT. 
           Kate and her super-athletic / trainer ex-boyfriend, MIKE, 40, 
           the eternal bachelor, SIT at THE BAR, LOOKING at it. 

                                 MIKE
                        Come on, you’ve done this before. 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, with you. That’s different. 

                                 MIKE
                        Eh, I was always weighing you down. 
                        He actually picked a pretty popular 
                        hike on Mount Angeles. Look: 

           He SCRIBBLES START and END SPOTS as he talks: 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        The best way to do it is leave a 
                        drop-car here and start here on 
                        Thousand Lake Trail. Night one 
                        you’d camp at Crane Lake...

                                 KATE
                        Aw, at least that sounds pleasant.

                                 MIKE
                        Come up Devil’s Neck night two. 

                                 KATE
                        Not as pleasant. 

                                 MIKE
                        And summit day three. There’ll be 
                        plenty of markers and other hikers. 
                        I have some gear you can borrow and 
                        I’ll make a list for REI. 

                                 KATE
                             (nods, overwhelmed)
                        Thank you. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’ll be great. Don’t worry. 
                        People do this all the time. I wish 
                        I could come. 

                                 KATE
                        Me too...

           He DRAWS SMILEY FACES on TWO MOUNTAIN TOPS... much less 
           intimidating now. She LAUGHS, LEANS against him, longingly.
           His phone BUZZES, “Sarah.” She looks. He uncomfortably FLIPS 
           it. She PULLS AWAY, crushed but covering. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Well, I don’t want to keep you.

                                 MIKE
                        No, don’t forget to get bear spray. 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, thank you so much for the 
                        help. You’re right, this will be 
                        great. How hard could this be?!

           INT. REI - NIGHT

           ON TV: a Mountain Biker SOARS in SLOW-MO down a SKI SLOPE, a 
           River Rafter takes a JAGGED LEAP through WATERFALL MIST, a 
           Rock Climber DANGLES from a HARROWING CLIFF...

           Anne, Cassie and Blair WATCH - no fucking way. Kate cheerily 
           APPROACHES with a SHOPPING CART, HOLDING her LIST.

                                 KATE
                        Mike gave me a list of everything 
                        we need. 

           A friendly FEMALE REI EMPLOYEE approaches. Kate FLAGS her.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Oh good, which is the backpacking 
                        aisle?

                                 FEMALE REI EMPLOYEE
                             (gestures to entire store)
                        You’re looking at it. 
                             (off Kate’s overwhelmed 
                              look, comforting)
                        Outdoor enthusiasts this way. 

           They FOLLOW behind with the CART. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What about outdoor iffy-ists?

                                 FEMALE REI EMPLOYEE
                        What are you guys looking to do?

                                 BLAIR
                        As little as possible. Which aisle 
                        is that?
                                 CASSIE
                        We’re backpacking Mount Angeles.

                                 BLAIR
                        Allegedly. Or we hang at base camp, 
                        we’ll see how it plays out. 

           Kate rallies the troops, HEADING into the TENTS SECTION.

                                 KATE
                        Okay girls, stay close! We have a 
                        budget but if we stick to the list, 
                        we should be in and out in thirty! 

           Kate TURNS. No one’s behind her... 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        And they’re gone. 

           Anne and Blair look at the FREEZE-DRIED FOOD SECTION. 

                                 ANNE
                        Ooh, a quinoa one!

                                 BLAIR
                        Mac and Cheese? I’m listening. 

           Blair OPENS the bag of freeze-dried MAC AND CHEESE.

                                 ANNE
                        Don’t eat that. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (eats, almost spits out)
                        Oh my God. 

                                 ANNE
                        Okay you’re eating it. You’re still 
                        eating it.

                                 BLAIR
                             (mouth full)
                        Are you obsessed with me? 
                             (takes another bite)
                        Can I live?

           Cassie FLIPS through a clothes rack, tries a JACKET on. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Do we need rain jackets? Does this 
                        make me look lumpy?

           Anne spots a NERDY REI EMPLOYEE, follows him.  
                                 ANNE
                        Do you have any flares?

                                 NERDY REI EMPLOYEE
                        We don’t carry anything 
                        combustible... Well, except those. 
                             (nods towards camp stoves)
                        We do have glow tubes and whistles. 

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah - don’t feel like those are 
                        going to help a lot. 

           Blair STARTS TOSSING things into the CART: bear spray, bug 
           jacket, first aid kit, blister medic, water purifier... 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yep. Feels necessary. Yep. Freeze 
                        dried ice-cream?! Hello, obviously, 
                        that’s in, don’t waste my time.

           A MALE REI EMPLOYEE tries to help, holds up different items. 

                                 MALE REI EMPLOYEE
                        Camp mirror?

                                 BLAIR
                        Why would anyone want to know what 
                        they look like during this? 

                                 CASSIE (O.S.)
                        They sell hiking dresses! Hurry!

                                 BLAIR
                        Other than her. 

           Kate puts a STOVE in the CART - starts REMOVING extra items.

                                 KATE
                        We’re on a budget and sticking 
                        together! Did no one listen to me?!
                             (notices Customers)
                        And I’m still talking to myself...

           LATER, the CASHIER scans items out of their overloaded cart. 
           Kate MOANS LOUDER every time the TOTAL dings up and up to: 
           $2,187. Kate SWIPES her PERSONAL CARD. Anne NOTICES. 

                                 ANNE
                        You’re not using the business card?

                                 KATE
                        Nah, I’ll just use this for now. 
           Anne DOUBLE-TAKES: is Kate paying for this? As Kate PUSHES 
           the CART out:

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Leave the tags on everything. 
                             (to REI clerk)
                        I’m just kidding! 
                             (to girls)
                        I’m not kidding. 

           INT. ANNE AND SCOTT’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Anne’s husband, SCOTT, PACKS her CAMP GEAR while she WATCHES. 
           She’s clueless how to prepare and he’s happy to oblige.

                                 SCOTT
                        These techie business ideas crack 
                        me up. 

                                 ANNE
                        I’m just trying to see it as good 
                        exercise. Believe me, if I knew any 
                        places hiring, I’d quit in a blaze 
                        of glory. 

                                 SCOTT
                        At least you like camping. 

                                 ANNE
                        Sure, when you handle the tent, the 
                        fire, the food... and I sit in a 
                        fold-out chair providing my good 
                        personality because obviously: 
                        equal division of labor.

                                 SCOTT
                        Is that what you were providing? 
                        All this time I never knew. 

                                 ANNE
                        Yes, I’m a delight. Every time’s a 
                        good time.

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t forget to bring warm clothes. 

           Anne LIFTS UP a STACK of HIKING OUTFITS, proud of herself. 

                                 ANNE
                        Got it! All by myself. 
                             (jokes)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I’m not sure why you want to have 
                        kids when I’m already like your 
                        five-year-old... 

                                 SCOTT
                             (laughs)
                        That’s true. Speaking of - did you 
                        hear Tracey and Doug are pregnant?

           This is a loaded topic. She gets up to FILL her THERMOS.

                                 ANNE
                        Do you think one thermos is enough?

                                 SCOTT
                        Am I on mute? What just happened?

                                 ANNE
                             (teasing, re: him packing)
                        Why mess with a perfect thing?! You 
                        used to not want kids either. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Because we were twenty-six. We were 
                        still getting settled.

                                 ANNE
                        Can we not talk about this right 
                        now? I’m already stressed. Can we 
                        talk about it when I get back?

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah. 

                                 ANNE
                        Okay, we’ll talk about it when I 
                        get back. I love you. 

           Anne WALKS OVER and KISSES him meaningfully. 

           INT. BLAIR’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Final packing. Blair removes TWO WINE BOTTLES off her wine 
           rack and STUFFS them in her already-full BACKPACK. Doesn’t 
           fit. She TAKES OUT a WATER BOTTLE, thinks for a moment, then 
           FILLS it with a bottle of wine. 

           INT. CASSIE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Cassie WEARS a cute HIKING OUTFIT, CURLS her HAIR - giving it 
           that perfect wave. What? This has to last three days, guys!
           EXT. KATE’S DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING 

           Mike helps STRAP a BACKPACK on Kate. It’s intimate - to her. 

                                 MIKE
                        Is this too much for you?

                                 KATE
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        The weight. Is it too heavy?

                                 KATE
                             (struggles, lying)
                        Oh. No, it’s okay. 

           He BUCKLES her stomach STRAP.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll be really impressed if you 
                        pull this off. I don’t feel like 
                        you’d ever have tried something 
                        like this when we were dating. 

                                 KATE
                             (adjusts straps, bravely)
                        Well, guess it’s the new me... 

                                 MIKE
                        I like it. So, just pull these to 
                        tighten the straps. Too loose, it 
                        will give you back problems, okay?

                                 KATE
                             (trying to remain casual)
                        So, there’s signs for Crane Lake, 
                        right? Where we stop for the night?

                                 MIKE
                        Yes. 

                                 KATE
                        And it’s super easy, just follow 
                        the trail, it’s not rocket science?

                                 MIKE
                             (smiles, comforting)
                        Yes, you got this. It’ll be just 
                        like when we did this. Except with 
                        your whole team depending on you.

           She nods, then suddenly struggles to breathe. 
                                 KATE
                        I think I’m having second thoughts. 

                                 MIKE
                        Aw, I was kidding. Come on, what 
                        about the new you?

           She SHAKES her HEAD, bends over, full panic-attack starting. 
           She frantically starts unfastening her pack.

                                 KATE
                        Old me’s very persuasive. Oh god. 
                        Can’t breathe. Feel hot. There’s no 
                        escape if they start fighting. You 
                        know I don’t love confrontation. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, I know. When I broke up with 
                        you, you literally ran away.

                                 KATE
                        Is it too late to do that now?

           Mike LOOKS OVER as Anne and Blair both PULL UP. 

                                 MIKE
                        Think it might be, yes. 

           EXT. KATE’S DRIVEWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Kate helps Anne and Blair FINISH LOADING Kate’s red FOUR-
           RUNNER and Blair’s yellow VW BUG. Anne, looking yoga-fit in 
           Lulu Lemon’s, notices Blair’s huge wedgy in SAFARI SHORTS.

                                 ANNE
                        Nice “Dora the Explorer” shorts. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s called fashion, ever heard of 
                        it? 

                                 ANNE
                             (under breath)
                        I didn’t think you were supposed to 
                        wear a wedgy after Labor Day. 
                             (then, looks around)
                        Where’s Cassie? Anyone text her?

           Cassie’s car SQUEALS UP, WAVES out the WINDOW. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Sorry I’m late! Can I park in your 
                        driveway? I got lost.
           Cassie PARKS in the DRIVEWAY, HOPS out.

                                 ANNE
                        You’ve been here like seven times. 
                        You have GPS.

                                 CASSIE
                        I was trying to do it without GPS. 
                        It’s the best way to learn.

           Cassie HAULS her PACK into Blair’s VW BUG. Hops inside. 

           INT. KATE’S CAR - SAME

           Anne sits on the passenger side, waiting, bemused, as Kate 
           GIVES Mike a very-long HUG goodbye. Kate finally GETS IN. 

                                 ANNE
                        That’s your EX-boyfriend? Mmmkay. 

                                 MIKE
                        Your window’s down. Good luck out 
                        there, girls. If you see a bear... 
                        try not to let him eat you! 

           Their concerned FACES as both cars DRIVE OFF...

           EXT. THOUSAND LAKES EXIT TRAIL - PARKING LOT - LATE MORNING

           Cassie and Blair DROP OFF Blair’s VW and get into the back of 
           Kate’s four-runner for the final drive. 

           INT. KATE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Kate DRIVES. Cassie’s WEDGED in back between BACKPACKS and 
           Blair, keeps LEANING AGAINST her along this BUMPY ROAD.

                                 CASSIE
                        Why, again, do we need two cars?

                                 KATE
                        It’s a drop-car so we can hike from 
                        one side to the other.

                                 BLAIR
                             (to Cassie)
                        Ugh, you’re on me. 

           Blair ADJUSTS, trying to put an inch between their BARE LEGS. 
                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Can you lean the other way? You’re 
                        all over me. 

                                 CASSIE
                        There’s nowhere for me to go. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Lean forward or something! 

                                 CASSIE
                        I have to stare at the road or my 
                        eyes get wobbly. I’m very prone to 
                        car sickness. 

                                 KATE
                             (keeping it light)
                        Don’t make me separate you two...

                                 ANNE
                        Please do. 
                             (looks at mountains ahead)
                        Is that Mount Angeles?

           Blair LOOKS, POINTING to a CRAGGY OUTCROPPING of ROCKS. 

                                 BLAIR
                        That one? It looks like Everest.

                                 KATE
                        No, that’s a hill. That’s Mount 
                        Angeles. 

           Kate POINTS to the TOWERING BEHEMOTH behind the HILL.

                                 BLAIR
                        That silhouette thing? That could 
                        take our whole lives to cross. 

                                 KATE
                        See how the ridges look like wings? 
                        Angel wings... 

                                 BLAIR
                        How couldn’t we? It’s taking up the 
                        entire sky.

                                 ANNE
                        Looks like gargoyle wings. 
                                 BLAIR
                        You know how you say yes to 
                        something because it’s in the 
                        future but then it’s actually 
                        happening and suddenly every second 
                        is filled with a little more dread 
                        than the second before?

                           KATE
                                                     CASSIE AND ANNE
           Whaaat?
                                              Yes. 

           EXT. FOREST ACCESS ROAD - DAY

           ABOVE SHOT: KATE’S CAR kicks up dust along the winding road. 
           Pulls into the Thousand Lakes Trail Parking Lot. 

           EXT. KATE’S CAR - LATER

           Kate tries to USHER the girls, doing everything she can to 
           wave them towards the trail - it’s like herding cats. 

                                 KATE
                        We really gotta move faster if 
                        we’re making it to the first pass 
                        before dark. Can we zip up and go? 
                        Everyone zip up and go?! Zipppp?!!

           No one’s listening. Cassie inhales her woodsy surroundings. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh wow, that air! What time is it, 
                        people? Team building time!

           Anne TALKS on her CELL to Scott. 

                                 ANNE
                             (into phone, whispers)
                        Can you hear me? I love you... Can 
                        you still hear me? I miss you.

           Blair sees FOUR CUTE GUY BACKPACKERS embarking on the trail. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (interest piqued)
                        I wonder if anyone is on Tinder on 
                        this mountain. 

           As Blair STARES at her PHONE, she WALKS right into a BUSH. 

                                 KATE
                             (to herself)
                        This is gonna go well. 
           EXT. THOUSAND LAKES BASIN TRAILHEAD - MINUTES LATER

           They CHEERS with WATER BOTTLES in front of the SIGN.

                                 ANNE
                        I guess this is really happening...

                                 CASSIE
                        Wait - isn’t it bad luck to cheers 
                        with water?

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s why I spiked mine with wine. 

           And they’re off! Kate CLAPS her HANDS, CHEERING from behind.

                                 KATE
                        Alright, crew! We can do this! 
                        “Summit a mountain, save our team!”

                                 CASSIE
                        I can’t wait to see the top. I’m 
                        not sure if I’ve actually hiked a 
                        mountain. I feel like I have but I 
                        might have just seen it on TV. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Great story. Tell it again. 

                                 KATE
                        Hey guys, why don’t you wanna play 
                        poker with cats in Africa? ... 
                        Because if they’re not a CHEETAH, 
                        they’re probably a LION!

           Blair GRUNTS. They TRUDGE on in silence, getting a RHYTHM 
           along the wooded trail, gaining elevation. A steady climb up. 
           Cassie at the helm, then Anne and Blair. Kate brings up rear. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (excitedly snaps photos)
                        The wildflowers are purple! 

           Blair - clearly already struggling - TRIPS, SCRAPING HER SHIN 
           - RESUMES WALKING... Blood trickles down her sock. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Bleeding to death! No one stop, 
                        don’t worry, I’ll just walk it off. 
                             (wipes sweat, flails)
                        Sunscreen in eyes, now blind! 
                                 KATE
                        You okay?
                             (to Anne and Cassie)
                        Guys. 

           Anne, irritated, and Cassie, ANTSY, reluctantly WAIT. Blair 
           STOPS panting, GRIPS a TREE. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Holy shit, you have to be in 
                        superhuman shape to scale this.

           TWO OLD WOMEN BACKPACKERS with trek poles easily PASS them. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        No comment. 

           A PUPPY and an OLD DOG amble past with THREE OTHER BREEDS. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Do they even have owners?!

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t do this if we’re gonna keep 
                        stopping. It’ll take forever. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Then don’t stop. I don’t care. Win 
                        the day, Anne. Go for it. Someone 
                        give that woman a blue ribbon!

                                 KATE
                        Mike was saying if you maintain a 
                        steady pace you utilize far less 
                        energy than stopping and starting 
                        and commenting on everything.  

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m going to ignore the last part. 

           Blair reluctantly pushes on... Anne and Cassie gratefully 
           CONTINUE. They begin a STEEP SECTION of tight switchbacks. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (sing-songy)
                        So, Kate... what’s the deal with 
                        Mike?

                                 KATE
                        Nothing... He’s my ex. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Why’d you break up?
                                 ANNE
                        Cassie-

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s okay, that’s part of what 
                        this trip should be: reconnecting. 
                        Getting to know each other on a 
                        more personal level. Mike just felt 
                        like we were more friends. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Ooh, so now you’re just friends? 
                        Cut the chord on that shit. 

                                 KATE
                             (smiles)
                        I like having him in my life, I 
                        don’t want to cut him out. Maybe if 
                        I wait long enough... Which I know 
                        doesn’t sound great when I say it 
                        out loud but if you heard it in my 
                        head, I really think you’d agree. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah, that’s super unhealthy. Drop 
                        the Mike, walk off stage. 

                                 CASSIE
                        “Stage” of arrested development.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, maybe that’s enough personal 
                        connection for one day. This trip’s 
                        about our team. Let’s focus on 
                        that, huh?

           Blair NOTICES a LIZARD scurry past.  

                                 BLAIR
                        A lot of nature happening. Do we 
                        think there’s bears creeping?

                                 KATE
                        Oh, we’d be lucky to see a bear. 

                                 BLAIR
                        We may have differing definitions 
                        of luck. 

                                 ANNE
                        What is the bear protocol? Climb a 
                        tree? Stand your ground? Outrun the 
                        coworkers?
                                 CASSIE
                        Luckily, I’m the fastest!

                                 BLAIR
                        Not if I trip you and hop over your 
                        body to freedom. 

                                 KATE
                        Don’t worry, if bears come creepin’ 
                        I’ll bear-spray their peepin’. 
                             (off their looks, serious)
                        Also if we make noise, they stay 
                        away. Mike says you can just firmly 
                        clap and shout, “Hey, Bear” around 
                        corners so you never startle one.

                                 CASSIE
                             (claps, cheerful)
                        Hey Bear! Hello Bear!

                                 BLAIR
                        You’re not calling it to dinner... 
                        Or maybe you are. 

           Something RUSTLES in the bushes. Blair startles. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Guys. Shit just got real. 

           Blair RAISES her THERMOS, threateningly, whispers: 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Something huge on the move. This is 
                        not a drill. We got a fast-movin’ 
                        bogey at three o’clock. 

           From out of the SHRUBS, the monster emerges. A SQUIRREL. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Squirrel. Squirrel sighting. 
                        Everyone’s welcome. Could’ve had 
                        rabies. 

                                 ANNE
                        Wow, you saved us.

           EXT. THOUSAND LAKES TRAIL - THREE MILES LATER

           They make a STEEP DESCENT into THE THOUSAND LAKES BASIN. 
           Blair HUFFS and PUFFS, struggling. Kate looks at a map. 

                                 KATE
                        Okay, almost halfway to Crane Lake! 
                                 BLAIR
                        Ah, why are we going back down to 
                        go up? This is not efficient.

                                 ANNE
                        Take it up with the mountain. 

           They approach a FORK in the path. 

                                 KATE
                        Hey, Yogi Bear says if you see a 
                        fork in the road... pick it up. 
                             (off silence, explains)
                        Fork?

                                 BLAIR
                        No time to laugh... or energy, 
                        desire. 

           Cassie POINTS excitedly at a SIGN for LAKE CLOSURE. 

                                 CASSIE
                        “Lake Closure!” Kate! It’s a sign 
                        that you should get over your ex! 
                        We should go there!

                                 ANNE
                        It’s not named “Lake Closure.” It’s 
                        literally saying the lake’s closed. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (beat, defensive)
                        Oh. It’s still technically a sign. 

           EXT. THOUSAND LAKES TRAIL BASIN - LATER

           Cassie and Anne CROSS COUNTRY through MEADOWS and LAKES. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Should we wait?

           They turn and wait for Blair and Kate who’ve fallen behind. 
           They see Blair approach a TILTING TREE - look skeptically at 
           it like it might CRASH on her any second and HURRIES under.

                                 ANNE
                        If we tell her there’s a full bar 
                        at the top, think she’ll go faster?

           A HIKER COUPLE pass Cassie and Anne, exchange friendly waves.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Hi. 
           Once they pass, Anne sees the WOMAN has a baby on her back. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Can you imagine doing this with a 
                        baby?

                                 CASSIE
                        Sure!

           Anne SHAKES her HEAD - no thanks. Turns on her HEEL, onwards.

                                 ANNE
                        We can just arrive first. Let’s go. 

           They CONTINUE ON. Teaming off together. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Lake number one. Only nine hundred 
                        ninety nine to go. 

           They see the next BODY OF WATER coming up. 

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Lake two. Nine hundred ninety eight 
                        to go. 

                                 ANNE
                        I think that one’s just a pond. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Ope. Nine hundred ninety nine still 
                        to go.

           Anne immediately regrets pairing off with her. 

                                 ANNE
                        I’m pretty sure Thousand Lakes is 
                        just a hyperbole. You really don’t 
                        have to count each one aloud.

           Anne WALKS faster. Cassie WALKS faster too, closing the gap. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on here, Cassie?! Are 
                        you trying to mug me?

           EXT. CRANE LAKE - HOURS LATER

           Cassie and Anne SCRAMBLE UP a STEEP WALL OF ROCKS to reach 
           the pass for Crane Lake - their breaking spot for the night. 
           They SET down their PACKS, exhausted but victorious.  

           Anne kisses the rock. 
                                 ANNE
                        Ah! 

                                 CASSIE
                        We made it! Omigosh, the victory is 
                        so sweet after-

                                 ANNE
                        -We can stop talking. 

           Kate FOLLOWS right behind them. 

                                 KATE
                        Day one done, girls! A third of the 
                        whole trail!

           They take in the spectacular sight of the ICE-BLUE LAKE. 

           Blair is still slowly TRUDGING UP the TRAIL far BEHIND THEM, 
           DRENCHED in sweat. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (calls up, bottom of soul)
                        This is dumb. I hate this. I quit! 
                        None of you helped me!

                                 ANNE
                        No one helped us either.

                                 BLAIR
                        This is supposed to be team 
                        building not the Olympic Trials. I 
                        bet Louis and Clark never left each 
                        other in the dust. 

                                 KATE
                        You’re almost there, Blair... 

                                 CASSIE
                        Nothing to it but to do it! 

                                 BLAIR
                             (between panting breaths)
                        Fuck. Everyone. And everything. 
                        That’s ever. Existed. 

           Blair USES every ounce of energy left - to finally reach the 
           TOP, PANTING. She DITCHES her BACKPACK, MAD AS HELL. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        No one talk to me. I’m going to sit 
                        on that rock and cry for an hour. 
                        Maybe longer, don’t time me.
           She WALKS towards a ROCK and SITS on it, facing away. 

           EXT. CRANE LAKE - LATER

           Anne and Cassie do YOGA, POINTING their LEGS into the air in 
           HALF DOWNWARD DOG - silhouettes against a majestic backdrop. 

                                 CASSIE
                        This is great for my sciatica. 

                                 ANNE
                        Oh good, you hadn’t brought that up 
                        for awhile. Almost forgot. 

           Blair begrudgingly DRAGS herself over.

                                 BLAIR
                        You’re working out after working 
                        out? What is wrong with you people?

                                 ANNE
                             (flat, to Blair)
                        We told you - post-hike yoga. It’s 
                        on the schedule. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I thought you said yogurt. It was 
                        the only thing keeping me going.

           Meanwhile, Kate TALKS on her cell as she UNPACKS the tents. 

                                 KATE
                             (into phone)
                        Hi Emmett. We made it. This may be 
                        the last time we have signal. Yeah, 
                        it’s going so well, we might even 
                        drink each other’s socks for the 
                        fun of it!  

           Weirded out, Cassie MOVES her balled-up socks closer. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (looks at her phone)
                        Ugh, how does she have service? I 
                        can’t get this text to go through.

                                 CASSIE
                        Is it important?

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah. “Bottomless mimosas.”

           Blair shows them a guy’s DICK PIC next a CARAFE OF MIMOSA.
                                 ANNE
                        Ahh! Warn someone!

                                 BLAIR
                        I thought I just did... Bottomless?

                                 CASSIE
                             (confused, then realizes)
                        Ohhhh... because he’s not wearing 
                        anything on bottom, I get it!

           Kate HANGS UP, WALKS over. 

                                 KATE
                        Alright, we should set up the tents 
                        so we can get cooking. 

           Everyone looks at the pile of POLES and FLAPS, unsure.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, okay, alright... so first 
                        we should... are there directions?

                                 CASSIE
                        These pole-thingamaboppers lace 
                        through these flapper deals, right? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Usually when I help “pitch a tent,” 
                        my titties are involved.  

                                 ANNE
                        Helpful. 

           Anne picks up a NYLON TENT with two fingers, grossed out. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Ohhh, it’s wet... 

                                 KATE
                        Let’s shake it out. 

           Anne WAVES IT around like a FLAG, drying it out - it gets 
           STUCK in a TREE. She YANKS it free and WHIPS Cassie’s face. 

           Blair SNAPS TENT POLES - trying to figure out what goes 
           where. The POLE unsnaps and BOPS her on the HEAD. 

           A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS: A hilarity of errors watching these 
           girls with no teamwork skills try to pitch their first tent. 
           But finally, they STAKE down a FINISHED SEMI-LOPSIDED TENT. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Victorious!
           Cassie picks up a REMAINING PIECE.

                                 CASSIE
                        What’s this extra flap for?

                                 KATE
                        No idea. Let’s not worry about it. 

                                 ANNE
                        Okay, thanks, guys. Need a quick 
                        nap. Wake me for dinner, please.

           Anne STARTS CLIMBING inside, worn out. Blair stops her. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Whoa, not so fast and furious, this 
                        is my tent. 

                                 ANNE
                        No, it’s not. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yes, it is. I wouldn’t have wasted 
                        all my energy making your tent.

                                 ANNE
                        I thought it was nice of you to 
                        help. Certainly didn’t ask you to. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Guys, remember I’m actually who 
                        dibbsed this because it’s fuscia?

                                 BLAIR
                        Well, we can all sleep in there 
                        because I have no energy left. 

                                 ANNE
                        Four can’t fit! It’ll take you five 
                        minutes now that you learned how. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It’ll take you five minutes now 
                        that you learned how. 

                                 KATE
                        It’ll take us five minutes now that 
                        we learned how! 

                                 CASSIE
                        Guys! I don’t know why no one 
                        remembers I’m who hiked this in. 

           A GUST OF WIND FLIPS the TENT, BLOWS IT AWAY. No one notices. 
                                 KATE
                        Come on, this doesn’t need to be a 
                        thing. I’ll make them, it’s okay. 

                                 ANNE
                        No, Kate, you shouldn’t have to. 
                        This is what happens at work. She 
                        always gets everyone else to do the 
                        hard work for her. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Ah, but you wanting to hide in a 
                        tent and not talk to anyone seems 
                        totally out of character.

           They finally NOTICE the tent has blown off and RUN after it. 

           EXT. CRANE LAKE - TWILIGHT

           Kate, Cassie, Blair SIT around the saddest, tiny CAMPFIRE. 
           Kate empties a DEHYDRATED BLOCK of FOOD onto the small stove.

                                 KATE
                        Mike’s fires always seemed bigger.

                                 BLAIR
                        This could take awhile.

           Kate CALLS OVER to Anne who’s SITTING by herself, reading. 

                                 KATE
                        Anne? 

                                 ANNE
                        Is food ready?

                                 KATE
                        Not yet. Whatcha doing over there? 

                                 ANNE
                        I’m just... I dunno. 

           Anne COMES OVER to sit, exhausted, SLAPS a mosquito.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, is anyone else getting bit? 
                             (scratching, to mosquito)
                        I’ll burn you alive, asshole, to 
                        send a message to all your friends.  

                                 BLAIR
                        I thought you were vegan. Those are 
                        all God’s little creatures.
                                 ANNE
                        I’m not vegan. I’m gluten-free. You 
                        know there’s a difference, right? 

                                 BLAIR
                        I know they’re both annoying. 

                                 KATE
                        Okay, while this cooks, it seems 
                        like a good chance to do exercises. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Why are we doing so much exercise?! 

                                 KATE
                             (pulls out print-outs)
                        Team building exercises. 

                                 ANNE
                             (leans over, reading)
                        Did you just Google, “How To Do 
                        Your Own Team-Building?”

                                 KATE
                             (hides papers, defensive)
                        Maybe... Okay, everyone here has 
                        great qualities and if you have a 
                        compliment, why keep it to 
                        yourself, right? Let’s go around 
                        and say the first word that pops in 
                        your mind about the person beside 
                        you. I’ll start: Blair... Funny. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Aw, thank you! Okay... Cassie.
                             (nods at Cassie, cheery)
                        Useless.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hey!

                                 KATE
                        No, keep it positive. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Sorry. Okay... Aspergers?

                                 ANNE
                             (covers mouth, laughs)
                        Yes.

                                 KATE
                        No! 
                                 BLAIR
                        You said the first thing...?! I 
                        don’t get this game. 

                                 KATE
                        Alright, maybe everyone will feel 
                        more like spilling the beans after 
                        we bake some beans, hmm? 

                                 ANNE
                             (under breath)
                        Doubts it. 

                                 KATE
                        We’ve got gluten-free miso tofu 
                        quinoa for Anne and beef stroganoff 
                        for the rest of us. 

           Kate POURS the SLUDGE in everyone’s BOWLS. They TAKE A BITE 
           OF the watery MEAL, seeming to chew forever. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Is the beef stroganoff supposed to 
                        be... soup?

                                 ANNE
                        It’s like it starts with an 
                        aftertaste.

                                 BLAIR
                        Like cum. 

           The girls all PUT their PLATES down. 

                                 ANNE
                        Okay, ruined that. 

                                 BLAIR
                        ‘Cause it’s Beef Strokin’ Off. 

                                 KATE
                        No, we got it. That was clear.
                             (looks at box)
                        Did we somehow miss a step?

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, the part where we go home and 
                        eat real food? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Perhaps, a lovely two-buck chuck 
                        will take the edge off.

           Blair PULLS a WINE BOTTLE out of her PACK - to their awe.
                                 ANNE
                        You actually hauled wine up here?

                                 KATE
                        No wonder your pack was so heavy! 

                                 BLAIR
                        Not all heroes wear capes. 

           Blair PASSES out CUPS. Cassie eagerly sets to work UNCORKING 
           IT with a wine screw. The CORK breaks inside the BOTTLE. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Crap. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Amateur hour. Here, hand it to me. 

           Blair PUSHES the CORK inside the BOTTLE with her INDEX FINGER 
           and her finger gets stuck. Her FACE goes SLACK with HORROR. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Oh no. 

                                 ANNE
                             (smirks)
                        Amateur hour. 

           Blair TWISTS her finger FRANTICALLY - finally FREEING it.

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh God, I was afraid that’s how it 
                        ends. Walking around a mountain 
                        with my finger stuck in a bottle. 
                        Alright, drink up, people. A little 
                        cork never hurt anyone. 

           Blair POURS their drinks as Kate HANDS out PENS and PAPERS. 

                                 KATE
                        Okay, I know trust exercises can be 
                        cheesy but I think if we take this 
                        next one seriously, it could be 
                        great. Everyone anonymously write 
                        down your greatest fear.  

           Anne aggressively SLAPS another MOSQUITO.  

                                 ANNE
                        Seriously? No one’s getting bit? 

           As everyone WRITES fears, Kate looks at everyone, admiring.
                                 KATE
                        I’m proud of everyone today. 
                        Teamwork makes the dream work! 

                                 ANNE
                             (smirks, looks)
                        Did you just read that off there?

                                 KATE
                        Stop looking at my paper. 
                             (then, reading)
                        First rule of team building: don’t 
                        talk about team building. 
                             (then, looks up)
                        Just kidding, it doesn’t say that. 
                        But sincerely- today wasn’t easy. 
                        We have a ways to go but it was a 
                        good first step.

                                 BLAIR
                             (nods touched then sniffs)
                        Okay, someone thinks they’re some 
                        kind of fart ninja in this group 
                        and I just want you to know I smell 
                        what’s going on and it’s not cool.

                                 KATE
                        Moving along - everyone draw a fear 
                        and read it aloud.

           Everyone PUTS their PAPERS in a HAT. Kate MIXES them up. 
           Blair DRAWS first, reads it aloud.  

                                 BLAIR
                        “That I’ll lose all my hair.” 

                                 CASSIE
                        That’s my fear, too! Whose it that?

                                 BLAIR
                             (holds up paper)
                        Yours. It’s your handwriting. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh. Alright... 
                             (draws from hat, reads)
                        “I fear my best love is behind me.”
                             (to Kate)
                        Your best love is not behind you. 

                                 KATE
                             (grins, embarrassed)
                        Who says that was mine?!
                             (draws one, reads)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, this says: “Team building 
                        exercises.” Real nice, guys. 

                                 ANNE
                             (laughs, busted)
                        Okay, I’ll do it for real... Um, my 
                        deepest fear right now? ...Having 
                        kids, probably...

           Everyone “oohs”, LOOKING at Anne, nodding supportively.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        It’s like bungee jumping. If you 
                        spend too much time standing on the 
                        edge, you psych yourself out... 
                             (clams up, drinks)
                        Do you want to hear this? You don’t 
                        want to hear it... 
                             (to Blair, pointed)
                        You’re going to make fun of me. 

                                 BLAIR
                        No, I’m not. I didn’t know “people 
                        wanting kids” was still a thing. I 
                        thought we’d moved past that.

                                 CASSIE
                        But they’re so cute! And you can 
                        dress them just like you. 

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, I guess at 34 I’ve gotten too 
                        used to my lovely selfish lifestyle 
                        and don’t wanna give it up now. 

                                 KATE
                        What’s Scott think?

                                 ANNE
                             (debating how to reply)
                        There in lies the rub. His      
                        “boy-ological” clock’s going off...
                             (changes subject)
                        Alright... last one:
                             (draws last one, reads)
                        “That I’ll be trapped next to the 
                        Farter tonight.”

           They all GLARE at Blair. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What? So much for anonymity! That’s 
                        legit my greatest fear. That and 
                        obviously a world without wine.  
                                 KATE
                        Alright, thanks everyone for your 
                        honesty - of varying degrees. Now 
                        we’ll set these free into the fire. 

           Kate ceremonially CRUMPLES them into the FIRE - but the 
           FIRE’S so small, the papers PUT it OUT... And then BLOW AWAY. 
           They sit in darkness for a MOMENT. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (wryly)
                        Well. Hope you all found that to be 
                        a powerful exercise.

                                 BLAIR
                        Yes, the answers are blowing in the 
                        wind. 

           Anne SLAPS CRAZILY at her NOSE, EARS, CHEEKS for a MOSQUITO. 

                                 ANNE
                        I can hear the fucker whining!! 
                             (miserable, to Kate)
                        My legs are killing me, this bug’s 
                        clearly the only one eating. Should 
                        we just call it a night?

                                 KATE
                        Sure I’d call this a strong first 
                        day. What’s it- almost midnight?

                                 CASSIE
                        6:30. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (hugging the wine)
                        Yeah, you guys should hit the hay.

           They hear COMMOTION in THE DISTANCE... Yelling? Rustling?

                                 ANNE
                        Oh shit. Did you hear that?

                                 CASSIE
                        That was definitely close by.

                                 BLAIR
                        Was it this way?

           Blair STANDS, starts creeping towards the noise. 

                                 ANNE
                        Don’t go towards it... Well, this 
                        is where we die. 
                                 KATE
                        Yeah, Blair, let’s maybe not go 
                        towards the strange sound. Blair?

           They see across the lake... FOUR MALE CAMPERS and a DOG.

                                 BLAIR
                        Boys! Look at their native food!

                                 CASSIE
                        And their native fire! 

                                 ANNE
                        And their native tents! 

                                 BLAIR
                        Dibs on the dude with the guitar! 
                        Unless he plays any Jason Mraz... 
                        and then dibs on the guy with the 
                        beanie. 

                                 KATE
                        Guys, this is bonding time for-

           They’re already GONE. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        A few minutes only! Tomorrow’s a 
                        big day!

                                 BLAIR (PRELAP)
                        Can we never leave?

           EXT. BOYS CAMPSITE - LATER

           This is a magical oasis of BOOZE and FEAST. The same FOUR 
           GUYS Blair spotted in the parking lot perform uber-masculine 
           roles as the girls sit at this new, huge campfire in awe.  

           FANTASY SLOW MO... as ONE SHIRTLESS GUY, six pack abs, chops 
           wood with an axe. He wipes the glistening sweat off his brow. 

           ANOTHER GUY stokes an impressive bonfire. 

           PETE, the guitar player, strums a melodic tune. 

           JACOB - scruffy, ruggedly handsome - bites into juicy meat, 
           rips it from his mouth. Passes a plate of heavenly food onto 
           the girls - sausages, corn, freshly-caught trout. The girls 
           TAKE ravenous, heavenly bites.

           Kate looks CONCERNED - this wasn’t the point of the trip...
                                 JACOB
                        Does anyone want more corn?

                                 ANNE
                        Could you pass the Cholula? 
                             (re: entire situation)
                        This is an upgrade...

                                 CASSIE
                        Best thing I’ve ever eaten.

                                 JACOB
                        Camp food always tastes better. 
                             (chews something hard)
                        Yep. Spoke too soon. Okay, that’s a 
                        rock. 

           The Golden Retriever BRINGS a stick to Pete - he TOSSES it in 
           the fire. Blair PETS the dog, trying to flirt with Pete.

                                 BLAIR
                        He retrieves firewood?! We need one 
                        of these. What’s his name?

                                 PETE
                        Yellow. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Hello Yellow...

           Yellow starts aggressively sniffing Blair’s CROTCH. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, hello, okay. Mellow, Yellow. 
                             (quietly, to Yellow)
                        Listen, not sure what you’re trying 
                        to point out but let’s cool it. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Did you guys catch this fish?

                                 JACOB
                        Yeah.

                                 BLAIR
                        So, you camp all the time, huh?

                                 ANNE
                        Will you help us with our tents?

                                 KATE
                             (embarrassed, to guys)
                        Oh. You don’t have to do that. 
                        We’ve imposed too much. 
                                 JACOB
                        You’re not imposing.

                                 BLAIR
                             (to Kate)
                        See? We’re not imposing. 

                                 PETE
                        But you really don’t know how to 
                        pitch a tent? You might wanna learn 
                        how before you go any further. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Or we follow you around the next 
                        few days, we’ll see how it goes.
                             (theatrically)
                        Does this sweeten the deal?

           Blair pulls out another WINE BOTTLE - to the GUYS’ CHEERS. 

                                 KATE
                        How many do you have in there?!

           LATER, a JOINT gets passed around the campfire. Pete plays a 
           FOLK SONG on his GUITAR. Blair TEACHES Cassie how to SMOKE. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Like this: empty your lungs, 
                        lightly puff. 

           Cassie EMULATES her in a very exaggerated, very serious, WIDE-
           EYED WAY. Making exaggerated PUFFS - trying way too hard. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Why do you look like such a weirdo? 

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t know how to do it! 

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t believe you’re not a pot-
                        head. It would explain so much...

           Later, the guys - all high - RACE each other to set up the 
           GIRLS’ TENTS the fastest at the guys’ campsite. Kate covers 
           her eyes, shakes head - probably shouldn’t be allowing this? 

                                 JACOB
                             (calls out to guys)
                        Remember to hang the food so we 
                        don’t attract bears. 
                             (to girls)
                        Are you girls paying attention? 
                                 ANNE
                        I’m learning a lot here. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh, that’s where that flap goes. 

                                 PETE
                        What would you all have done if you 
                        hadn’t met us?

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s what I wanna know.

           AS THE NIGHT GOES ON: Music switches to DRUM-CIRCLE HIGH-
           HIPPIE TRIBAL DANCING... Pete HOLDS his HANDS UP in an 
           “EMBRACING THE SKY” Chief-esque DANCE. Everyone follows his 
           moves in a Woodstock-level high. Blair is vibing him hard. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m not on drugs. I’m in them. 
                             (looks at joint on hand)
                        They’re on me. 

                                 ANNE
                        Ooh. Someone’s throwing up tonight. 

           Kate SITS on a LOG, TALKING to Jacob and looking at the 
           stars. The moon is just beginning to peek over the mountains. 

                                 JACOB
                        Look how you can see the stars 
                        starting to dim. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh, because the moon’s coming up? 
                        Like God’s flashlight seeing what 
                        we’re up to. 

           Jacob offers a bag of assorted candy-store candies to Kate, 
           including a hilariously large red gummy bullfrog.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Who buys that?! 

                                 JACOB
                             (proudly)
                        It’s a bullfrog. 

                                 KATE
                             (laughing hard)
                        I know! I know it’s a bullfrog. But 
                        who buys that out of all the 
                        candies in the store?
                                 PETE
                        I do.

                                 KATE
                             (shakes head grinning, 
                              takes sour patch instead)
                        How often do you guys go camping?

                                 JACOB
                        They always go for Pete’s birthday-

                                 KATE
                        -For Pete’s sake!

                                 JACOB
                        What?

                                 KATE
                             (laughs, no answer)
                        I’m sorry, I really don’t know.

                                 JACOB
                             (grins, continuing)
                        But this is actually my first year 
                        to join. I’m Jewish so-

                                 KATE
                        --What is it with this “Jews don’t 
                        camp” thing? It’s an actual fact 
                        Jewish people don’t like camping?!

           Blair STOPS DANCING, POINTS a FINGER in the AIR, vindicated. 

                                 JACOB
                        I was going to say I’m Jewish so 
                        usually their trip falls on the 
                        high holidays which is a bummer 
                        because I LOVE camping- 

                                 KATE
                        Oh!

                                 JACOB
                        I’m just kidding. She’s right. Jews 
                        don’t camp. The only camps our 
                        people do are summer. 

                                 KATE
                        And internment. 

           She COVERS her own MOUTH in horror. 

                                 JACOB
                        Did you make a holocaust joke?!
                                 KATE
                        I immediately regret it. No. 
                             (scrambling for anything)
                        I meant, internship camps for 
                        college hopefuls... 

                                 JACOB
                        No, no, no, you’re terrible-

                                 KATE
                        --Nooo...

                                 JACOB
                        Yes. WOW. Glad at least I know now.  

           Kate PUTS her HEAD down, shamefully. He likes her. 

                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Ah, you’re so nice I can’t even 
                        pick on you. I mean, I might have 
                        to - because that was massively 
                        inappropriate. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m so sorry. I’m not anti-semitic. 
                        I’m anti-me! I’m going to wake up 
                        in cold sweats for years over this.

                                 JACOB
                        It’s okay. You’re this sweet, 
                        little cute-faced bigot. I’m glad I 
                        didn’t give you my bullfrog. No, 
                        I’m actually kind of glad you said 
                        that because it means nothing I say 
                        could be worse. You just gave me 
                        the golden ticket. 
                             (calls out)
                        When are the rapings, m’ladies?

                                 CASSIE
                        What?! Sick! 

                                 ANNE
                        Not funny. 

           Jacob PUTS HEAD DOWN beside Kate. She laughs. 

                                 JACOB
                        We are oh-for-two here. 
                             (changes subject)
                        So... you said you’re on a team-
                        building trip?

           She LOOKS OVER at her TEAM getting DRUNK, HIGH or HORNY... 
                                 KATE
                        Yeah. Maybe not your traditional 
                        kind at the moment but this is the 
                        best they’ve gotten along, so it 
                        must be somewhat effective, right?

           Jacob NODS, smiling at her, wants to KISS HER. She realizes 
           this - bashfully LOOKS AWAY. Notices Blair FOLLOWING Pete 
           into his tent. We see them TAKING THEIR SHIRTS OFF inside. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (calls out)
                        We can see you!

           Blair and Pete continue, not hearing, their SHADOWS seeming 
           to fold onto each other in a strange way - are they 69’ing?

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t - I can’t even tell what’s 
                        happening. 
                             (calls out, pleading)
                        No, please. Alright. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - EARLY MORNING

           Everything is still. SEVEN TENTS set up, FOOD hung in TREES. 
           A CROW sits on top of a tent and SQUAWKS. Wake up, assholes. 

           INT. PETE’S TENT - MORNING

           Blair COVERS her EARS with the SLEEPING BAG.

                                 BLAIR
                             (croaks, pleading)
                        BE QUIET. 

           The crow stops... Then SQUAWKS MORE. Blair pulls a leaf off 
           her face, sees Pete asleep beside her. He FARTS in their 
           sleeping bag. GROSSED OUT, she tries to slip out, the tent 
           CRACKLING with EVERY MOVE.

           EXT. CRANE LAKE - MORNING

           Anne and Cassie SIT on ROCKS, WATCHING the BIRDS floating on 
           the LAKE. Blair EMERGES from Pete’s tent and JOINS them. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Morning. 

                                 ANNE
                        No alarm clock needed, huh?
                                 BLAIR
                        Do you think the birds talk the 
                        same shit about us at night? Like:
                             (valley-girl voice)
                        “We’ve got an early morning, could 
                        you monsters keep it down?!”

                                 CASSIE
                        Did you know crows are highly 
                        intelligent? They have a very 
                        advanced social system. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah - I noticed. 

           Blair LOOKS at a CALIFORNIA QUAIL with a hilarious PLUME on 
           its forehead staring at her. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                             (to bird, unimpressed)
                        Really?

           The BIRD PUFFS UP its BEAUTIFUL NECK. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Please, I can do that. 
                             (makes double chin)
                        It’s nothing to brag about. 

           Cassie TAKES IN the serenity with SEVERAL DEEP EXHALATIONS. 

                                 ANNE
                        You alright over there, Cassie?

                                 CASSIE
                        I love it out here. I didn’t 
                        realize how much I needed this. 

                                 ANNE
                             (turns to Blair)
                        So, did you have “fun” last night?

                                 BLAIR
                             (wise, soulful)
                        We had a romantic relationship, 
                        just two kids teaching each other 
                        about love. But then he farted in 
                        the sleeping bag all night.

                                 ANNE
                             (small smile)
                        Oh no! Your biggest fear come true.
                                 BLAIR
                             (nods, grimly)
                        I got stuck next to the Farter. 
                        Speaking of, did Kate have “fun?” 

           They TURN to see but THE CAMPSITE is just hidden from view. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - SAME

           Kate PACKS her TENT alongside the guys. Jacob STRAPS his PACK 
           on, hates to say goodbye but the other guys are watching. 

                                 JACOB
                        Maybe we’ll see you out there? 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah. You’re ending at Devil’s Neck 
                        tonight, too?

                                 JACOB
                        Yeah, we’re gonna be fishing a 
                        couple more days than you so-

                                 KATE
                        --Well, see ya.
                             (realizes she cut him off)
                        You were still talking, I knew a 
                        goodbye was coming and I just 
                        couldn’t stop the momentum of my 
                        words. 

                                 JACOB
                             (laughs)
                        Alright, well, good luck out there.

           Pete and the other guys WAVE BYE to her. 

                                 PETE
                        Tell everyone we said bye. Sorry we 
                        gotta get going. 

                                 KATE
                        No, we do, too. Thanks for letting 
                        us mooch off you guys. 

           She gives one last awkward SMILE to Jacob and HEADS towards:  

           EXT. CRANE LAKE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kate APPROACHES the girls, BACKPACK on, ready to go.
                                 KATE
                        You kids ready to get a move on?

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah. Let’s hurry up and dip so I 
                        don’t have to give Pete my number. 

                                 KATE
                        He just left. He told me to say 
                        bye. They wanted to get fishing. 

                                 BLAIR
                        He dipped on me?! Who does that?
                             (humbled)
                        How’d he say it at least?

                                 KATE
                             (simple)
                        “Bye?”

                                 BLAIR
                        With like a twinge to it?

                                 KATE
                             (confused, shrugs)
                        A twinge? No, just normal. “Bye.”

                                 BLAIR
                        Hmm... sounds nuanced. 

           EXT. VALLEY TRAIL - MORNING

           The girls HIKE through a serene mountain meadow. They keep 
           the same order - Cassie LEADS and Kate BRINGS UP the rear.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hey guys, did you think about that 
                        I find leads at work and I’m 
                        leading here? 

                                 KATE
                             (sympathetic, cheers)
                        That’s good, Cassie. 

                                 ANNE
                        Aw, that was so sad. 

           They all burst into LAUGHTER. Blair READJUSTS her STRAPS.

                                 BLAIR
                        Ya know, this doesn’t feel as heavy 
                        today.
                                 KATE
                        Probably because you lost six 
                        pounds in wine weight. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Did I, though? Or did it just 
                        change locations...

                                 CASSIE
                        Maybe we’re getting stronger! 

                                 ANNE
                        From one day?

           Kate LOOKS at the SUN beating down on the OPEN FIELD.

                                 KATE
                        It’s gonna be a hot one. Let’s try 
                        to cover as much ground as we can 
                        and then we’ll stop at Mirror Lake 
                        to eat lunch in the shade. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Someone smells so bad. Offensive! 
                        Take care of your shit, people!

                                 CASSIE
                        Hey, whoever smelt it... 

           Anne and Kate discretely smell themselves - seem fine. Blair 
           BREAKS AWAY, irritated - then realizes with horror: 

                                 BLAIR
                        Omigod... it is me. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM - MORNING

           The four guys are PEPPERED ALONG the BANK of the STREAM, 
           RIGGING UP their fly rods and taking their FIRST CASTS. 

                                 JACOB
                        Hey, what fly are you gonna use?

                                 PETE
                        Elk Hair Caddis. 

                                 JACOB
                        I thought we’d see those girls 
                        passing by now. 

                                 PETE
                        They’ll turn up when they need help 
                        with their tents, I’m sure.  
           Jacob LOOKS DOWN and sees a BEAR PRINT in the MUD. 

                                 JACOB
                        Hope they brought bear spray.

           EXT. LAKE - SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS - DAY 

           The TREES and BLUE SKIES are a perfect mirror image reflected 
           in Mirror Lake. A WATERFALL cascades into it. They excitedly 
           drop their packs and STRIP DOWN to their UNDIES to WASH UP. 

                                 ANNE
                        Well, H.R. would deem this wildly 
                        inappropriate. 

           Anne DIPS her FEET in the ICY, REFRESHING WATER. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, wow. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Is it cold?

                                 ANNE
                             (pained)
                        It’s so fucking cold. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Ahhh. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It hurts so good. 

                                 ANNE
                        Ya know, I’m not sure the last time 
                        my feet actually touched the earth. 

                                 KATE
                        That’s true... You would never go 
                        barefoot in the city.

                                 CASSIE
                        I have to say, my sciatica hasn’t 
                        been hurting out here. 

           Blair STARES at Cassie’s unreal, gorgeous BODY.

                                 BLAIR
                        Omigod, how is your butt real? It 
                        doesn’t even jiggle. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Are you kidding? It jiggles! Look.
           Cassie jiggles her BUTT.

                                 BLAIR
                        Flinches at best. When mine gets 
                        going, time PASSES. It’s like a 
                        trained-seal clapping.

           Blair JIGGLES her BUTT. 

                                 ANNE
                        Yep, this feels about the moment 
                        the rapey mountain men appear.

           Kate LEAPS off a huge rock into the frosty LAKE, FOLLOWED by 
           Cassie and Blair as Anne HANGS lazily on SHORE. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (doggy-paddles, trilling)
                        Speaking of rapey, you seemed to be 
                        hitting it off last night, Kate. 

                                 ANNE
                        Sentences not often uttered. 

                                 CASSIE
                        He made that rape joke!  

                                 KATE
                             (smiles)
                        Oh yeah, he’s nice... Jacob. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What do we think of Jacob?

                                 KATE
                        Oh, I’m not in the right place for 
                        anyone new, yet.

                                 CASSIE
                        Because you’re not over Mike?

                                 BLAIR
                        Girl, you need to drop Mr. Friend 
                        Zone and get into Mr. Bone Zone. 

                                 KATE
                        Thank you. I’ll take that under 
                        consideration. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Nowhere better than Lake Closure!

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, still not a real place. 
           The SKY darkens. Fog ROLLS in mystically OVER THE MOUNTAINS. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Hey, look at those clouds. 

                                 KATE
                        Those aren’t clouds, that’s fog. 

           They WATCH in silent awe. This HARBINGER OF DOOM. 

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s kind of eery, isn’t it? 

           Blair’s EYES suddenly fill with TERROR - being PULLED 
           forcefully UNDERWATER. She SPLASHES frantically.

                                 BLAIR
                        Ohmygod, guys!

           Blair goes under. FIGHTS her way back TO THE SURFACE. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Are you being serious??

                                 KATE
                        Stop messing around...

           But Blair DISAPPEARS for good BENEATH THE WATER. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Ah! Blair! What’s happening?!

           Cassie SWIMS OVER to LOOK - Blair’s VANISHED. 

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Blair! Blair?!

           HOLD. 

           KEEP HOLDING. 

           FINALLY- TWENTY FEET AWAY, Blair BURSTS UP from BEHIND a ROCK 
           under the WATERFALL, THROWING her HAIR back in a sexy Ariel 
           move, singing the “African Chant” from The Lion King.

                                 BLAIR
                        Baaaaaaaaas Sowenyaaaaaa 
                        mamabeatsebaba!... HUMMMM.

           Kate and Cassie SPLASH WATER her way, over it. But Anne is on 
           shore still freaking out.

                                 ANNE
                        Oh shit, guys. Oh shit.
                                 BLAIR
                        Dude, don’t drag out the joke. 

           Anne DIGS through the BACKPACKS. Pulling everything out. 

                                 ANNE
                        Where’s the food? 

                                 KATE
                        What?

           They SWIM back to SHORE. Dripping WET, COLD, in their 
           UNDERWEAR, they start frantically RIFLING through their BAGS. 

                                 BLAIR
                        No wonder our bags felt so light.  

                                 CASSIE
                             (realizes)
                        We left it hung up in the tree. 

           They share a LOOK - shit. 

           EXT. FOREST TRAIL - LATER

           The girls are LOADED UP, Kate LEADING them down the TRAIL. 
           Adrenaline charged, hair wet. Fog descending on the trees.

                                 KATE
                        Okay, nobody panic. We’ll just 
                        backtrack. 

                                 ANNE
                        Three hours each way... 

                                 BLAIR
                        Can we dump our packs somewhere? 

                                 KATE
                        We should keep everything with us.

                                 CASSIE
                        I hate to complain. But I’m feeling 
                        pretty faint. My blood sugar’s low 
                        from skipping breakfast and I 
                        really need a snack attack. 

                                 KATE
                        Don’t worry, we’ll be back to the 
                        food any second. 

           They WALK AROUND a BEND and come face-to-face with a STEEP 
           CLIFF. Pebbles SKITTER OFF the TERRIFYING DROP... 
                                 BLAIR
                        Well... We fucked up. 

           Kate PULLS OUT a TOPOGRAPHIC MAP, trying to pinpoint their 
           location. They all LOOK. 

                                 KATE
                        This shouldn’t be here... 

                                 ANNE
                             (realizes with dread)
                        But it is here... Which means... we 
                        shouldn’t be here. 

                                 KATE
                        Alright, we’re still OK. We’re on:
                             (unsure, points at map)
                        ...One of these cliffs, I think. 
                        Mike would know how to read this 
                        better than me. 

                                 BLAIR
                        A paper map? It looks like a buncha 
                        varicose veins. How do you zoom in?

           Anne POINTS to one of the HUNDREDS of LAKES... 

                                 ANNE
                        Okay, we were just at Mirror Lake. 

           Anne TRACES her FINGER to the EDGE of a CLIFF. Then TRACES 
           backwards leading from Mirror Lake to Crane Lake. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Somehow we took the wrong trail so 
                        we just need to head back to there. 

                                 CASSIE
                        But we don’t know where we are. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Who cares where we are? Let’s just 
                        head back in the direction we came 
                        and get the food.

                                 CASSIE
                        We can’t head back if we don’t know 
                        where we’re going. 

                                 ANNE
                        We do know where we’re going. We 
                        just need to backtrack to Mirror 
                        Lake and then we’ll find the right 
                        trail to get back to Crane Lake. 
           Anne and Blair TURN to start HEADING BACK - can’t take 
           Cassie’s idiocy right now. Kate TURNS to Cassie. 

                                 KATE
                        We’re gonna be fine, don’t worry. 
                        This is all part of the adventure.

           EXT. FOREST TRAIL - LATER

           The girls excitedly SPEED UP towards a CLEARING, relieved to 
           see the first signs of a BODY OF WATER ahead. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Is that a lake?!

                                 ANNE
                        That’s the lake!

           They STOP IN their TRACKS, LOOKING at a SMALL, MUDDY LAKE. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        That’s a lake. 

                                 BLAIR
                        More of a cesspool. 

                                 ANNE
                        Are we... lost?

                                 CASSIE
                        I told you, guys.

           This sinks in... 

                                 BLAIR
                        I don’t want to die up here!

                                 KATE
                        Guys, let’s not freak out.. Does 
                        anyone have signal?

           They all PULL their CELL PHONES out of the BACKPACKS. 

                                 ANNE
                        Dead. 

                                 KATE
                        Same. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Dead... just like us. I’d never 
                        have sexted Jeremy if I knew it’d 
                        get in the way of a helicopter. 
                                 CASSIE
                        I still have fourteen percent!

                                 KATE
                        Do you have signal?!

                                 CASSIE
                        No. But I think you can call 911 
                        even without service.  

           Cassie DIALS. They all WAIT - everything riding on this.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not ringing. 

           Everyone DEFLATES. Kate pulls out the MAP. 

                                 KATE
                        Let’s see...

           Anne takes the map - to Kate’s surprise - but deferentially 
           allows it. Anne POINTS to three possible lakes. 

                                 ANNE
                        Okay, if we were at Mirror Lake - 
                        here’s the closest options for what 
                        lakes we might now be at. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Would you guys please listen? We 
                        never were at Mirror Lake. Look at 
                        the map - it doesn’t look like it. 

                                 KATE
                             (gently)
                        Drought. Things could have changed. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (can’t think of the word)
                        There was the splashy thing! The 
                        thing where the water comes down. 
                        The drought changed that?

                                 ANNE
                        The splashy thing? A waterfall?

                                 CASSIE
                        Yes. My mouth moves faster than my 
                        brain sometimes. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (irritated, like a dog)
                        What are you trying to tell us, 
                        Lassie? -I mean, Cassie? 
                                 CASSIE
                        I think we got off trail when we 
                        went to the boys camp last night 
                        and never got back on this morning.

                                 ANNE
                        Hold on a second, we were following 
                        you this morning... 

                                 CASSIE
                        I wasn’t leading. I thought you 
                        were leading.

                                 BLAIR
                        You were in front! Saying that 
                        stupid thing about leading!

                                 CASSIE
                             (not listening)
                        Yeah! Waiting for someone to tell 
                        me which way to go! I didn't have 
                        the map! Why would anyone think I 
                        knew?!

           Kate COWERS behind the MAP, blocking out the conflict.

                                 KATE
                        This is quickly approaching my 
                        worst nightmare. Ha! Okay, let’s 
                        calm down. Panicking won’t help. 

                                 ANNE
                             (freaking out, internal)
                        Ohmygod... They call this Thousand 
                        Lake trail. We could be at any of 
                        these...

                                 BLAIR
                             (to Cassie)
                        Why did anyone trust you?! You get 
                        lost just leaving the house.

                                 CASSIE
                        Excusez-moi but you’re why we even 
                        left our camp last night.

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, you sniffed men in the air 
                        and HAD to chase after it.

                                 BLAIR
                        Wow, you weren’t complaining when 
                        you were sucking down sausages!
                                 ANNE
                        You were the one suckin’ on a 
                        sausage! 

           Kate steels herself: knows this is her chance to lead.

                                 KATE
                        Guys! Please! This isn’t helping! 
                        We need to take stock. Does anyone 
                        have food that wasn’t in the bag?

           They SHAKE their HEADS. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, we can live awhile without 
                        food. I’ve seen Survivor. Please 
                        tell me we have the water filter. 

           Blair and Anne are both unsure - LOOK OVER TO...

                                 CASSIE
                             (quietly)
                        I put it with the rest of the food. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Perfect. Why don’t we smash all the 
                        flashlights while we’re at it?! 

                                 KATE
                        How much water is left?

           The girls SET DOWN four half-full THERMOSES. This is bad. 
           Anne KNEELS, the heat of panic taking hold, retreats inward. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (trying to stay strong)
                        Okay, uh...
                             (less strong)
                        Okay, uh...
                             (full-panic)
                        Okay, uh...

                                 CASSIE
                        What’s happening to her right now?

                                 KATE
                             (emphatic but tearing up)
                        Okay, we’re gonna be fine. Okay? 

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s hard to believe you when 
                        you’re fully weeping. 
           Kate SNAPS OUT of it - takes the MAP back from Anne - taking 
           back control. Kate points to the PARKING LOT on the MAP.

                                 KATE
                        Alright. We just have to head south 
                        right? The parking lot’s south - no 
                        matter where we start from. I’ll 
                        just tell Emmett we couldn’t do it. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Are you gonna get fired? Are we all 
                        getting fired for not getting the 
                        photo on top?

                                 KATE
                        I’ll take the blame, this is my 
                        failing.

                                 BLAIR
                        I’ll photoshop us onto a 
                        screensaver. Who cares? 

                                 KATE
                        No, I’m not going to lie. But we 
                        don’t need to worry about that. 
                        Right now I just want to focus on 
                        getting you guys back safe. 

                                 ANNE
                             (fretful)
                        How do we even know what’s south?

           Kate LOOKS AROUND. Sun behind fog. How do you tell direction? 

                                 KATE
                        Birds! Birds fly south for the 
                        winter and north for the summer... 
                             (unsure, thinking)
                        So, in early Autumn, they...?

           They LOOK at a group of SITTING BIRDS. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Those birds aren’t flying at all.

           Blair TOSSES a rock - the birds FLY in ALL DIRECTIONS.

                                 BLAIR
                        Crap.

                                 KATE
                             (thinks, then)
                        Wait. Is there a compass on the 
                        phone?
           Cassie LOOKS on her PHONE - lights up. She points it: SOUTH. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Yes! That’s due south. 

                                 KATE
                        Let’s move, quick. 

           They HEAD in that DIRECTION with purpose.  

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           They BUSHWHACK through THICKLY WOODED FOREST - following the 
           COMPASS - no time to spare, STICKS and SCRATCHES be damned. 
           The phone DINGS. They STOP - hopeful. 

                                 BLAIR
                        You have signal?!

                                 CASSIE
                             (gasps in delight, looks)
                        Yes! 
                             (reading new email)
                        “It’s been awhile since you updated 
                        your credit score.” That’s 
                        ridiculous, I just did a month ago. 

           Cassie HOLDS the PHONE up, RUNNING around crazily. DIALS 911. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Cassie, if this works, I’ll never 
                        make fun of you again! 

           Cassie eventually SLOWS to a STOP - nothing. 

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s still not connecting. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Bit of an over-promise, anyway...

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s down to three percent. 

                                 KATE
                        Try texting Emmett we need help. An 
                        SMS might go through more easily. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (texting aloud)
                        Okay... “S.O.S.” 

           She HITS SEND - just as it AUTOCORRECTS to “SEX.” 
                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Ah! It auto-corrected to SEX.

           She quickly TYPES “S.O.S.” again. Autocorrects “SEX” again. 

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh no!

           She tries a THIRD TIME - same. The the PHONE shuts off. 

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        I just texted our CEO: sex sex sex!

           They STAND THERE, all hope waning. Kate points forwards. 

                                 KATE
                        Okay, we still know this way’s 
                        South. We just need to keep moving. 

           Kate looks at the giant SEQUOIAS - they look eerily the same. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        This way, right? It’s this way. 

           She POINTS FORWARD again, less sure. They follow. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Does anyone remember that saying 
                        about moss? It grows on the north 
                        side of a tree, right? ...Or south?

           No one knows.

                                 CASSIE
                             (thinking aloud, unsure)
                        A rolling stone gathers no moss...?

                                 BLAIR
                        You know when a stewardess tells 
                        you how to buckle your seat belt 
                        and you're like, “please, I got 
                        this” so you tune out but later if 
                        you were crashing, you'd be like:
                             (falling down well voice)
                        “Wait, what’s the part about how 
                        the seat cushion device workkkks?!!

           Kate WALKS beside Anne, who has gone silent with stress.  

                                 KATE
                        You okay? You’re not talking much. 

                                 ANNE
                        There’s not much to say. 
                                 KATE
                        That doesn’t stop the others. 

           Kate smiles but Anne barely NODS. Blair SETS down her PACK. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I know this is bad timing but 
                        nature calls. Do we have t.p.?

                                 KATE
                        No, just use a leaf. Although, not 
                        that leaf. That’s Poison Oak. Or 
                        any leaves like this: 

           Kate POINTS to some GREEN LEAVES. 

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s like every leaf! 
                             (huffs off behind tree)
                        Prison has more perks! We had a 
                        good life - we had homes with 
                        perfectly good doors and fridges 
                        and toilets - and decided, we’re 
                        tired of having it all, let’s go 
                        outside where there’s nothing!

           Kate LOOKS UP through the thick tree coverage... 

                                 KATE
                        Okay, we just need perspective on 
                        where we are and we’ll be okay. 

           THE CAMERA FLIES UP the TOWERING SEQUOIA TRUNK - a hundred 
           meters high - a skyscraper in the sky. We ZOOM OUT to see 
           acres in every direction... and realize how screwed they are. 

           EXT. FOREST - MILES AND HOURS LATER

           They SLOG ONWARDS - weak but pressing forward. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (mumbling to herself)
                        My Dearest Eugene, I’m lost in the 
                        woods. Everything hurts: head, 
                        shoulders, knees and toes. Please 
                        tell Ma I love her. Make sure Bessy 
                        combs her hair and Pa feeds the 
                        pigs. I fear the worst, withdrawals 
                        are setting in. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hey, at least you don’t have a 
                        withdrawal headache! 
                                 BLAIR
                        Don’t say headache. If I think 
                        about one I’ll -Ugh- here it comes. 

           LATER, Blair HOVERS to a STOP, RUBS her TEMPLES, gagging. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (bashful)
                        I know a natural pain killer but I 
                        don’t want to say. 

                                 ANNE
                        Say!

                                 CASSIE
                        ...An orgasm. 

                                 BLAIR
                        With who?!

                                 CASSIE
                        No, hands solo. It changes blood 
                        flow towards your pleasure sensors.

                                 BLAIR
                        Great idea! I’m gonna go masturbate 
                        right now. Quick, pinch my nipples. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Told you I didn’t want to say... 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yes, as exciting as that sounds to 
                        go rub myself down in Poison Oak 
                        Central while the sales staff waits 
                        for me, shockingly I’d rather die 
                        with a small rice grain of dignity. 

           LATER, Blair VOMITS in a BUSH, guzzles the last of her water.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                             (mutters to self)
                        It’ll be fun, they said. It’ll be 
                        like a vacation, they said. 

                                 KATE
                        Are you okay?

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m not awesome. 

           Kate REMOVES items from Blair’s bag and stuffs it in her own, 
           lightening Blair’s load. Kate straps the bulky pack back on. 
           Cassie, concerned, and Anne, openly disdainful, watch her. 
                                 KATE
                             (to Anne and Cassie)
                        Do you guys need any help?

                                 CASSIE
                             (shakes head, worried)
                        Are you gonna be okay?

                                 KATE
                        I’m fine, I’m fine.

           Kate looks up at the sky darkening past late afternoon. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, just so we’re clear... who is 
                        going to notice us missing if we 
                        don’t show up tomorrow? Boyfriends, 
                        roommates, husbands, anything...

                                 CASSIE
                        Just our coworkers on Monday. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Same, no one tomorrow. 

                                 ANNE
                        Scott will if he doesn’t hear from 
                        me by late tomorrow night. 

                                 BLAIR
                        One person in our group has someone 
                        who cares about them. Maybe we 
                        should reevaluate our life choices. 

                                 KATE
                        One is enough. So, if he reports us 
                        missing tomorrow night, Search and 
                        Rescue would probably wait until 
                        first light which means thirty-six, 
                        forty-eight hours at the soonest...

                                 BLAIR
                        Soonest is Tuesday? It’s Saturday! 
                        What about Sunday and Monday?

                                 CASSIE
                        There’s a lot of area for a search 
                        team to cover. 

                                 ANNE
                        Without food or water in this heat.

                                 BLAIR
                        At the soonest? The soonest?
                                 ANNE
                        Yes, we got that part, Blair. 

                                 KATE
                        That’s why we should keep heading 
                        south, we can’t afford to wait... 

           They START again. Kate ADJUSTS her overloaded pack on her 
           shoulders, wincing silently. Anne SQUISHES her foot into:

                                 ANNE
                        Ugh! I stepped in poo!

           Anne starts WIPING her SHOE against a TREE, repulsed. 

                                 KATE
                        That looks like human poo.

                                 CASSIE
                             (looks around, excited)
                        Definitely people poo. It’s fresh, 
                        too. Are we near civilization?! 

                                 KATE
                        There must be a trail near here.
                             (yells out)
                        Hello! Can anyone hear us?!

                                 ANNE
                             (yells out)
                        We need help!

                                 CASSIE
                        Who pooped here?!

                                 BLAIR
                        Uh, guys... I think that’s my poo. 

                                 KATE
                        What? That’s impossible.

                                 BLAIR
                        I kind of doubt anyone covered 
                        their poo with one twig and one red 
                        leaf for effect like I did. 

                                 CASSIE
                        You’re supposed to bury it! Dig a 
                        hole six-inches deep. No trace!

                                 BLAIR
                        Not really the point right now. You 
                        should be thanking me for leaving 
                        breadcrumbs. Am I a hero? Maybe. 
                                 ANNE
                        That’s the opposite of breadcrumbs. 
                        Fuck, we’re walking in circles?!

           They PUT their PACKS down. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        We need to stop. This tactic’s not 
                        working. We’re wasting energy. The 
                        more un-lost we try to be, the more 
                        lost we become.

                                 KATE
                        I wish Mike were here, he’d know 
                        what to do. 

           Blair and Anne have had enough with Mike. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Would you stop it with the “Mike?” 
                        It doesn’t help!

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, you’re who dragged us out 
                        here. You should know. 

                                 KATE
                             (trying to remain upbeat)
                        To be fair I didn’t say I was a 
                        wilderness survivalist. I know how 
                        to hike a trail. 

                                 ANNE
                             (stewing, to herself)
                        Well - not really since it took a 
                        day to notice we weren’t on one.

                                 BLAIR
                        Why are we even here? Everyone 
                        knows team building is a joke. No 
                        one ever changes from it. It’s just 
                        this dumb excuse for boundary 
                        crossing. I don’t need coworkers to 
                        know my fears. I need them to pass 
                        the fucking stapler. 

                                 ANNE
                        I should have quit, I was planning 
                        on quitting. I should have listened 
                        to my instincts. 
                                 KATE
                        Guys! I know this is stressful and 
                        everyone’s upset but we need to 
                        make a plan before dark. You guys 
                        are right. I can do this with or 
                        without Mike.

                                 BLAIR
                        Without. 

                                 KATE
                             (corrects herself)
                        Yes, without. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Yeah, this is only a three-day 
                        hike. We can handle this!

                                 BLAIR
                             (weary, speaks slowly)
                        Cassie, this is only three days if 
                        we know where the fuck we are. 
                        Otherwise, this hike is very long 
                        and never ends and then we die. 

                                 CASSIE
                             (horror)
                        I have the big solar panels demo. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Once again missing the point.  

           EXT. CLEARING - EVENING

           Kate and Anne COLLECT ROCKS to spell out “HELP” while Cassie 
           and Blair YELL INTO THE CANYONS.

                                 CASSIE
                        HELP WE’RE ON A TEAMBUILDING TRIP 
                        AND GOT LOST AND RAN OUT OF FOOD. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Maybe edit it a bit. HELP!

                                 CASSIE
                        ANYONE OUT THERE?! 
                             (then)
                        I’m realizing I never get to yell 
                        at the top of my lungs. I have a 
                        really powerful voice. 
                             (sighs, looks around)
                        If we weren’t lost, I’d be in awe 
                        of how beautiful this place is. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CASSIE (CONT'D)
                        I mean, how do some of these plants 
                        survive in such arid conditions? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Can we focus?
                             (yells)
                        PLEASE SAVE US... OR JUST ME! 

           Cassie SPOTS bright, red berries along the BUSH. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hey, rose hips! 

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh totally, I recognize those 
                        bright red berries. They’re on 
                        every brochure of what not to eat.   

                                 CASSIE
                        No, these are safe! You can trust 
                        me. They’re high in anti-oxidants.

                                 BLAIR
                        Thanks but I’ll wait twenty-four 
                        hours to see how you fare first.

           IN THE FAR DISTANCE, Blair sees a CESSNA PLANE. They start 
           CHASING AFTER IT. WAVING. POINTING AT THEIR “HELP” SIGN. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Omigod! Hey!!! 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hello there!!!

           Kate and Anne RUN OVER. 

                                 KATE
                        Yes, down here!!

                                 ANNE
                             (yelling at sky)
                        Why are we yelling! You can’t hear! 
                             (realizes)
                        Or see us... 

           It never CROSSES OVER, DISAPPEARING behind the MOUNTAINS -
           along with the sun. They go silent in disappointment. 

                                 CASSIE
                        If we had a mirror, we could use it 
                        as a signal. 

           Blair realizes something - damn. 
                                 BLAIR
                        Ahhhh. The guy at REI asked me if I 
                        wanted a camp mirror. 

                                 ANNE
                        We need sun for that, anyway. And 
                        fuck REI. They can eat my ass. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Wow, okay. 

                                 ANNE
                        I’m serious. They’re worthless. 
                        They don’t even carry flares. They 
                        said they only have whistles and 
                        glow sticks. 
                             (then, considers)
                        Except... 

           Anne starts DIGGING through Kate’s PACK and excitedly pulls 
           out the camp stove butane canister.  

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        If this explodes, it’s sure to get 
                        some attention. 

           EXT. CLEARING - EVENING

           Kate HOLDS the canister in front of a SMALL CAMPFIRE. The 
           others WATCH from a SAFE DISTANCE away, expectant, hopeful. 

                                 KATE
                             (calls out)
                        Could this start a forest fire?

                                 ANNE
                        I hope not. 

                                 KATE
                        Why won’t you do this again?

                                 ANNE
                        Too scared...
                             (pleads)
                        You’re the boss! 

           With TREMBLING FINGERS, Kate TOSSES the canister into the 
           FIRE and RUNS FASTER than any Olympian towards them. ARMS 
           pumping, HAIR flying... 

           She TRIPS and spectacularly FALLS - to everyone’s horror. The 
           CAMPFIRE puffs ominously HIGHER behind her... 
           She yelps, SCRAMBLES to her FEET. Finally REACHES them - she 
           BENDS over, catching her breath... TURNS to see...

           Nothing. The CAMPFIRE resumes its NORMAL. DAMN. LEVEL. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yep. That’s gonna save us. 

                                 ANNE
                        Is it empty? Did we use it up?

                                 CASSIE
                        You sure you turned the safety off?

                                 KATE
                        Maybe I didn’t do it right...

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

           FOR A MOMENT: Everything’s DEVILISH RED. FLAMES LICK the SKY. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Did it right. 

           They CHEER, HIGH-FIVING as the BURSTS return to a safe level. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Way to go, Kate! And Anne!

                                 ANNE
                             (high-fives Kate)
                        Yeah!!!

                                 BLAIR
                        We’re not totally helpless!

                                 KATE
                        That definitely got some attention. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS 

           THE CAMERA ZOOMS across the miles... capturing reactions to 
           the explosion... A grazing MOUNTAIN GOAT freezes, 
           listening... A pack of BIRDS squawk and scatter... 

           The Four Guys are SETTING UP their TENTS at Devil’s Neck. 
           They stop and turn in surprise...

                                 JACOB
                        What was that?

                                 PETE
                        Probably thunder. 
                                 JACOB
                        Didn’t sound like thunder. They 
                        should have caught up by now, 
                        right? Should we look for them?

                                 PETE
                        They probably took one look at 
                        Devils Neck and turned around. 
                             (teases)
                        Or maybe she’s just avoiding you. 

           Suddenly, a loud crack of THUNDER growls. They look up.  

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        See?

           EXT. CLEARING - SAME

                                 ANNE
                        Please tell me that’s someone’s 
                        stomach. 

           As if in response: wind RUSTLES in. GATHERING CLOUDS.

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh, this feels promising.  

                                 KATE
                        It’s pretty dry - it’s probably not 
                        that big a deal...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - SAME

           Jacob looks out, concerned, at the impending weather. 

                                 PETE
                        Sure hope they learned how to make 
                        a tent. 

           EXT. FOREST - EVENING

           POURING HEAVIER than you’ve ever seen. The fire is out. The 
           girls HOLD a single TENT FLAP over their HEAD, HUDDLING 
           together. Kate finally lets down her optimistic veneer... 

                                 KATE
                        Well, this sucks fucking ass. 

           So much WATER gathers on TOP of their FLAP that it TIPS onto 
           their HEADS. A river of rainwater gushes by their feet. HAIL 
           starts pelting down on them. 
                                 ANNE
                        Ow! Side rain! Is that hail?! Are 
                        you kidding me?!

           The TREES sway ominously. They LOOK at the HAIR standing 
           STRAIGHT UP on their ARMS from static electricity... 

                                 KATE
                             (yells over wind, worried)
                        Uh-oh. That’s not a good sign...

                                 CASSIE
                        How far away do you think it is? 

           A LIGHTENING BOLT explodes and hits a PINE TREE beside them. 
           EVERYTHING FLASHES BLINDING WHITE: as the TREE SPLITS in 
           HALF, BRANCHES TIMBERING down on both sides as THUNDER booms.

           They SCREAM, DROP the FLAP and start RUNNING for their lives. 

           INT. KATE’S TENT - NIGHT

           THE MASSIVE DOWNPOUR beats upon their hastily-made TENT. They 
           CLIMB inside, drenched. Freezing cold. Shivering. Breath 
           visible. But relieved for shelter. Kate ZIPS the DOOR, HANGS 
           LANTERN. They PEEL off wet LAYERS. Anne YANKS off her 
           dripping SOCKS.

                                 ANNE
                        So much for waterproof boots. 

           Kate PUTS a BAG in the CENTER.

                                 KATE
                        We can put any wet stuff in here. 

                                 ANNE
                        So, everything. 

           Blair faces modestly towards a corner, PULLS off her SHIRT.

                                 BLAIR
                        Don’t look at me. 

                                 ANNE
                        Why would anyone try to be looking 
                        at you? 
                             (wryly)
                        Besides, I can see your rock-hard 
                        nipples in the shadows. 
           INT. TENT - MINUTES LATER

           They’re WEARING every DRY ITEM they have, looking hilarious: 
           long pants tied for scarves, wool sweaters as hats - inside 
           their sleeping bags, RUBBING HANDS together to warm up. 

           TIMBER GROANS outside as GALE-FORCE WINDS BLOW their TENT. 
           Cassie unzips the tent - gusts of rain BLOWING IN. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What are you doing?!

                                 CASSIE
                        At least we have water to drink.

           Cassie pulls in a pot of rainwater and sets a new one 
           outside. She REZIPS the TENT, takes a drink from the pot. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Great, so we can live to die of 
                        starvation. 

                                 ANNE
                        Pretty sure this is End of Days, 
                        biblical kind of rain. 

                                 KATE
                        We’ll just have to wait this out. 

                                 CASSIE
                        What if we get out of this and 
                        discover the world ended while we 
                        were out here and we’re the last 
                        four left?

                                 BLAIR
                        I’d finally eat your poison-berry.

           Cassie’s LEG GRAZES Blair’s and Blair SCOOTS away, annoyed. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I saw in a movie once that people 
                        who die in the wilderness, die of 
                        shame. They die thinking, “How 
                        could I have gotten myself into 
                        this?” Not doing the one thing that 
                        could have saved them... 
                             (dramatic pause)
                        Thinking. Did you see THE EDGE? 
                        Alec Baldwin, Anthony Hopkins? It's 
                        pretty under-rated.
                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, if I ever get out of this, 
                        I'll be sure to check it out.

                                 KATE
                        Everyone stop saying “if.” Dead 
                        people say “if.” Cassie’s right - 
                        we’re smart, we can think our way 
                        through this. Tomorrow we’ll find a 
                        vantage point. 
                             (then)
                        As long as it doesn’t flash flood 
                        and we drown. 

           THUNDER bangs again. This is grim. Anne POKES the BOTTOM SIDE 
           of the TENT - it’s floating over the RAINWATER. 

                                 ANNE
                        Oh yeah, we’re floating. 

           INT. TENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           The RAIN putters to a stop. They’re SITTING AGAINST each 
           other’s BACKS like a chair. Hungry, bleary, desperate.

                                 BLAIR
                        Does anyone remember food?

                                 KATE
                        It was good. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I feel like I didn’t appreciate it 
                        enough. Like there were times I ate 
                        things without enjoying every nib.

                                 ANNE
                        I’d even eat our disgusting first 
                        night’s dinner at this point. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It pains me to know someone found 
                        my freeze-dried ice cream and is 
                        enjoying it with their friends like 
                        a bunch of assholes. 

                                 ANNE
                        I’ve done diets where I eat every 
                        other day. It’s called intermittent 
                        fasting. Just picture you’re full. 
                        Your stomach adjusts after awhile. 
                                 CASSIE
                        How long does that take?

                                 ANNE
                        A couple weeks. 

                                 BLAIR
                        We’ll have eaten Cassie by then! 
                        Ugh, why couldn’t we be stuck on a 
                        “dessert” island? Where the sands 
                        are made of cookie crumbles. 
                        Survival of the fattest. 

                                 ANNE
                        Why do I feel like you’ve thought 
                        of this before?

                                 KATE
                             (notices)
                        It sounds like it’s finally let up.

                                 BLAIR
                        Good, because I have to pee. 

           Blair MOVES - which makes Cassie fall over. Blair TAKES one 
           last SIP of WATER. Sniffs something FOUL... SNIFFS the POT - 
           the AIR - the GIRLS. 

                                 ANNE
                        Quit sniffing everything. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It smells like ROTTING ASS. 

                                 ANNE
                        Are you gonna say that the whole tr-
                             (smells it, winces)
                        --Oh. Ugh! 

                                 BLAIR
                        See?!

                                 KATE
                        Ew, that can’t be human. 

                                 ANNE
                        Come on guys. You can’t do that 
                        when we’re trapped together...

                                 BLAIR
                        Oof, I’m going out here-

           Blair UNZIPS the TENT and comes face-to-face with an eight-
           foot-tall BLACK BEAR (the source of rotting ass stench). 
                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Bear. 

           Blair matter-of-factly REZIPS the tent back up. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Omigod! Was that a black bear? It’s 
                        a black bear?! A black bear? 

                                 ANNE
                        Stop saying black, you sound 
                        racist!

           The BLACK BEAR GROWLS, SNIFFS at the DOOR FLAP, curiously. 

                                 KATE
                        We don’t have any food in here! 

                                 BLAIR
                        We’re the food! People in sleeping 
                        bags are like soft tacos to bears.

                                 CASSIE
                        No. You smell terrible to bears. 
                        Like Red Bull and battery acid. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Thanks for that self-esteem boost - 
                        but what about Gluten-Free Annie 
                        over here? She probably tastes 
                        delicious! Like a pot full of honey 
                        and pic-i-nic baskets. 

                                 KATE
                        That’s not how it works! 

           The BEAR turns from curious to aggressive, CLAWS at the FLAP. 
           The girls JUMP to the other side of the TENT, HORRIFIED. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (quietly, pleading)
                        We don’t have food! Go away!

           They suddenly NOTICE Anne... secretly SWALLOWING a nutella 
           sandwich as fast as she can. Their MOUTHS drop open in shock. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Well, well, well!

                                 ANNE
                        This is MINE!

           Blair BODY SLAMS Anne to WRANGLE it from her. Anne ROLLS, 
           SHOVING it in her MOUTH by the FISTFUL. 
                                 BLAIR
                        “Picture you’re full,” my ass! 
                        Fudge packer!

                                 ANNE
                        Thought you hated gluten-free!

           Cassie FLIES through the AIR to snatch a PIECE... 

                                 CASSIE
                        Do you have any Macadamia?! 

                                 BLAIR
                        Selfish!!! No wonder you don’t want 
                        kids! You’d starve ‘em out!

           A PIECE flies onto the WET, DIRTY GROUND and Blair EATS IT.

                                 ANNE
                        My husband made this for me. I owe 
                        no one!

           A BEAR starts pulling the FABRIC, trying to drag them off. 
           Kate, shaking, HOLDS THE BEAR-SPRAY with one hand - and 
           STARTS CLANGING a POT with the other. 

                                 KATE
                        Guys! Focus!

           They join her, grabbing pots and pans, start chaotically 
           banging... CLING, CLANG, CLONG! They slowly find a RHYTHM... 
           A drum circle. Their eyes DARTING for signs of the bear. 

           They eventually STOP- 

                                 CASSIE
                        The smell is gone. 

           They SNIFF, nodding... the BEAR fled. They SIT, chests 
           heaving from the adrenaline. Sweat turning cold. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (shivers violently)
                        Oh shit. Now I have to nervous pee, 
                        too, but I can’t go out there. 

                                 KATE
                        It’s not a serial killer, we either 
                        scared it off or we didn’t. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah, it’s the second part of that 
                        sentence I’m not comfortable with. 
                        Anne, hand me a pot.  
                                 ANNE
                        No. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I have to NERVOUS PEE!

                                 ANNE
                        Nervous pee somewhere else. You 
                        already shit on me today.

                                 BLAIR
                        Maybe you should familiarize 
                        yourself with the saying: poo onto 
                        others. You could learn something.

                                 ANNE
                        Ugh, you always think you’re funny. 
                             (fends off Blair’s reach)
                        NO.

                                 CASSIE
                        Just give it to her, Anne. When 
                        your body has to go, you get colder 
                        because it’s focusing all your 
                        energy on holding it in. 

                                 ANNE
                        Fuck that. She gave me a black eye 
                        when she death-rolled me! 
                             (ferocious)
                        If she “goes” by me, I’ll -no joke- 
                        punch her in the butthole. Try me. 

           Blair STARES her down - Anne STARES back, dead serious. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (backs down)
                        Fuckin’ A. Give me the bear spray. 

           Kate GIVES Blair the BEAR-SPRAY. Blair UNZIPS the DOOR, PEEKS 
           OUT - turns, PULLS down her PANTS and bravely SHOVES her ASS 
           out - BEAR-SPRAY perched beside her ready to SPRAY. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                             (yells at any bears)
                        YOU BETTER NOT EAT MY ASS, 
                        MOTHERFUCKER!

           EXT. FOREST - MORNING

           The world glistens green from leftover rain. A CROW SITS atop 
           their partially deflated TENT - SQUAWKS. Rise and shine!
           CLOSE UPON... THE TENT ZIPPER... stuck. They’re PULLING hard 
           from inside, one inch up, catches, one inch down... CAN’T GET 
           OUT - FIFTEEN SECONDS LATER, they finally YANK it open.

           Blair, Cassie and Anne TUMBLE OUT like a clown car. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Sciatica’s back from the stress. 

                                 ANNE
                        I know how you can fix it. Don’t 
                        ever talk about it again. 

           Blair looks at a BIRD circling above. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Look. Even that vulture is waiting 
                        for us to die.

                                 CASSIE
                        That’s a duck.

                                 BLAIR
                        Probably still waiting for us to 
                        die. 

           They walk over to Kate who is standing nearby, holding a map. 

                                 ANNE
                             (bossy, over it)
                        I think we should just follow a 
                        river downstream. 

                                 KATE
                             (points to right)
                        Well, I was thinking - the sun rose 
                        there so that’s the East. 
                             (points to left)
                        Set there - so that’s the west... 
                        Never Eat Salty Watermelon... 
                             (points behind her)
                        ...so that’s north.
                             (straight ahead, forest)
                        And that’s south. We’ll keep the 
                        mountain to the left. With the time 
                        of year, it could be a few degrees 
                        off but it’s our best bet. 

                                 ANNE
                        Ten degrees off could make a huge 
                        difference. Miles. And it’s a maze 
                        in there. Everything looks the 
                        same.
                                 CASSIE
                        Yeah, every time we go in there, we 
                        can’t see the mountains for the 
                        trees and lose perspective.

                                 ANNE
                        I learned in Girl Scouts that 
                        rivers lead to towns and towns lead 
                        to new lives where we can forget 
                        this ever happened and that’s what 
                        I’m doing.

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh, the Girl Scouts? That’s much 
                        better! Was that on the front of 
                        the box of cookies or back?

                                 KATE
                        It’s not a river, it’s a stream. 
                        What if it dead-ends, Anne? We need 
                        to stick together. 

                                 ANNE
                        Fine, I’m following the stream, 
                        then.  And no, we don’t. Whoever 
                        can follow me but I’m not trusting 
                        anyone else with my life, anymore. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Guys, the reason no one trusts each 
                        other is we don't trust ourselves. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh God, go away. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Stop -- you always treat me like 
                        I’m dumb and I’m not dumb!

                                 BLAIR
                        Aren’t you, though? Aren’t you the 
                        dumbest? 

                                 CASSIE
                        No!

                                 BLAIR
                        But dumb people are probably last 
                        to know, right? Wait, what’s this?
                             (digs fake-paper out of 
                              pocket)
                        “Hey Aries, I’ve been making up 
                        fake horoscopes for you for years.”
           Blair’s prank DAWNS on Cassie. 

                                 CASSIE
                        You’re mean. Geez la F-ing weez! I 
                        didn’t die from the rose hips, did 
                        I? I guess I must be too dumb!

           Kate CLOSES her EYES, wishing she could be anywhere else.

                                 KATE
                        Come on, guys! Blair!

           Cassie is firmly aligning with Anne now... away from Blair.

                                 CASSIE
                        Maybe we should split up. It 
                        increases our chance to find help. 

                                 KATE
                             (pleading, waving)
                        Cassie! Stop, stop! Please, stop!

                                 ANNE
                        What are you gonna do, Kate?  Oh, 
                        that’s right - nothing. Because god 
                        forbid you acknowledge conflict. 
                        Can you even see us right now? Are 
                        we invisible?

                                 KATE
                             (finally snaps)
                        Ah, fine, FINE!!! You want me to 
                        acknowledge conflict? Watch this!

           Kate picks her BACKPACK up, SWINGING it around aggressively 
           and THROWS it. It LANDS in the STREAM. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (imitates them, walks 
                              funnily, hands on hips)
                        “Ooh, I’m Anne. I’m too cool for 
                        school. But you wouldn’t know where 
                        I went to school because I don’t 
                        talk to anyone.” 
                             (then)
                        “Hello, Cassie here, I’m on the 
                        spectrum. I spend one hour of the 
                        work-day working and seven hours 
                        inspecting my fucking chair.”  
                             (drinks pine-cone)
                        “Hey, I’m Blair: Glug, glug, glug.”
                             (then)
                        Everyone says, “Ooh, it's Year Of 
                        The Woman. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Females: so in right now! What a 
                        banner year for ladies everywhere!” 
                        Except you guys!!! 

                                 BLAIR
                        That doesn’t feel legal to say. 

                                 KATE
                        I am trying so hard! I’ve tried 
                        everything! The only reason we’re 
                        out here is because I was trying to 
                        save your jobs! Which clearly 
                        doesn’t matter now because we can’t 
                        even work together well enough to 
                        get out of these woods. But I’m 
                        your boss and I deserve RESPECT!

           They STARE at her, speechless. Kate SOBERS up, goes to PICK 
           her pack up out of the stream. Puts on a now DRIPPING PACK. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Please follow me a little longer? 
                        You’re my responsibility. 

                                 ANNE
                        No, Kate, we’re not. Not anymore. 
                        Our only responsibility is to 
                        ourselves now. 
                             (to Kate and Blair)
                        Good luck following the sun. We’ll 
                        send help.  

           Anne FOLLOWS the STREAM - and Cassie follows in tow. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Good luck to you! We’ll send help!

           Blair looks at crazy Kate - with her dripping pack- not sure 
           she wants to go with her, but she ostracized the others. She 
           and Kate HEAD SOUTH... Which happens to be the same way... 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        This awkwardly is the same 
                        direction for a minute. 

           They all WALK AWKWARDLY together through the mud. The STREAM 
           finally turns off away from the trail.  

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Okay, bye!

           We see the two groups BRANCH OFF from each other. Bad idea. 
           Kate’s heartbroken over this failing but PRESSES FORWARD. 
           EXT. CLEARING - MINUTES LATER

           Kate and Blair PASS the “HELP” ROCKS... They STOP short, 
           NOTICING fresh bear scat with berries in it. 

                                 BLAIR
                        The bear shit in our HELP sign? 
                        That’s like the ultimate F.U.

           MINUTES LATER, they continue along a SERPENTINE MOUNTAIN PATH 
           snaking upwards with constant BLIND CORNERS.

                                 KATE
                        Careful, if we can take this trail, 
                        bears probably like it too. 

           They start CLAPPING. Kate CLUTCHES the BEAR-SPRAY, ready. 

                       KATE (CONT’D)
                                                          BLAIR
           Hey Bear!
                                              Hey Bear!

           Their PACE quickens with fear. Things grow more TENSE. The 
           more they CLAP, the more the ANTICIPATION and FEAR grows. 

                                 BLAIR
                        At least we got the bear-spray...

           EXT. FOREST - MORNING

           Meanwhile, Anne and Cassie cross over a FALLEN TREE, 
           continuing to walk DOWNSTREAM. 

                                 ANNE
                        At least we’re not the blonde 
                        leading the blonde. 

                                 CASSIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 ANNE
                        Nevermind. 
                             (notices)
                        Shit.

           The stream TRICKLES into a SMALL POND where the stream ends.

                                 CASSIE
                        What do we do now?

           Anne stands on top of a TREE STUMP to get perspective. 

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        See anything?
                                 ANNE
                             (scratching legs)
                        I don’t understand why I’m the only 
                        one ever getting bit. You really 
                        haven’t gotten one bite?

           Anne HEARS them before she SEES them... BUZZING. 

           YELLOW JACKETS SWARM up Anne’s LEGS from the NEST she’s 
           standing on. She YELPS and starts RUNNING for her life, 
           SWIPING madly as WASPS STING her in a frenzied circle. 

           She BELLY-FLOPS into the POND. She SWIMS underwater in the 
           SHALLOW WATER, pokes her HEAD UP. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Are they gone?!

           Doesn’t wait for the answer. Pokes HEAD back DOWN. Then, UP.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Are they gone?!

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - DAY

           Blair and Kate reach GIANT BOULDERS. Kate HURLS her PACK over 
           them and shimmies her way snugly between TWO ROCKS. 

           Blair FOLLOWS suit, a much tighter fit... She SCRAPES her 
           PALMS trying to SLIDE through, gets completely stuck. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Bad idea, bad idea. 

           Blair barely SQUEEZES back out. She tries to CLIMB OVER the 
           BOULDER but just sort of hugs it, unsure how to mobilize. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Coming. Any minute now. 

           LATER, Kate and Blair freak themselves out more with EVERY 
           FEARFUL CLAP. The DROP OFF to the left is perilous. A BULKY 
           ANIMAL lurks ahead - Blair looks again - it’s just a TREE. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Everything looks like a fucking 
                        bear ahead.

                                 KATE
                        Hey Bear! 
                                 BLAIR
                             (screaming)
                        HEY BEAR HEY BEAR HEY BEAR!! 

           They’re WALKING at such a FRANTIC GAIT, they almost don’t 
           STOP in time to realize that around the BEND:

           A MASSIVE ROCK SLIDE has taken out the trail. A MOSSY ROCK 
           comes loose and FALLS into the RAVINE a million miles below.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        There’s no way to cross. 

                                 KATE
                        This must be because of the rains.

           They hear VOICES in the DISTANCE... 

                                 BLAIR
                        Civilization?

                                 KATE
                        Rescuers? 

                                 BLAIR
                             (sniffs wind)
                        Men? 

           They carefully CRABWALK up the UNSTABLE ROCKS, still slick 
           from the rain, to LOOK. The FOG is ROLLING in, making it 
           tough to tell but in THE FAR DISTANCE they see TWO HIKERS!!!

           Kate and Blair excitedly WAVE... 

                                 KATE
                        Hey!!!

           The HIKERS wave back who seem equally surprised and excited. 
           Only to realize they’ve just run back into ANNE AND CASSIE.

                                 BLAIR
                        Un-fucking-believable. 

           But the GULLY gives way and Kate SLIDES down - grabbing for 
           anything but there’s nothing to hold onto... She SWEEPS DOWN 
           THE EDGE, clings madly to a BRANCH. The BRANCH starts to 
           bend. She LOOKS at the VALLEY a THOUSAND FEET below. Trying 
           to PULL herself up but can’t. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Kate! 

                                 KATE
                        Oh God please, I don’t want to die!
           As we saw in the opening: Blair INCHES DOWN, REACHES for 
           KATE, YELLS over her SHOULDER. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Help!! Anne, Cassie, quick!

           CUT TO: Anne and Cassie RACING towards them through TREES. 

           CUT TO: Blair GRABS for Kate’s other HAND. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Kate - give me your hand!

           Kate SHAKES her head, frantic. But just as the BRANCH snaps, 
           Kate lets go - SLAP! - connecting with BLAIR’S HAND. 

           Their eyes locked, Blair uses every trembling muscle to DRAG 
           her up. It’s heartwarming, heroic... 

           Until Kate SLIPS from Blair’s grip and falls INTO THE ABYSS. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Oh no! Oh shit! Oh fuck!

           Anne and Cassie reach the AVALANCHE PATH - moments too late. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I think I killed our boss. 

                                 ANNE
                        Oh my god. Oh my god.

                                 CASSIE
                        Kate!!

           They PEER over the TERRIFYING EDGE. FOG envelops the BOTTOM.

           Blair tries to SPEAK but breaks into SOBBING TEARS. Cassie 
           HOLDS her. Then Anne. This loss is more than they can take.   

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                             (faintly)
                        Hello? 

           They are huddled so tight, they don’t hear it at first.  

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? 

           They PULL APART. Start looking everywhere for the source...

                                 CASSIE
                        Hellooo?
           They SCAN AGAIN BELOW: Partway down, almost entirely hidden 
           in FOG is --Kate-- CLINGING to a FOREBODING LEDGE. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Kate!!!

                                 KATE
                             (always the peace-maker)
                        I’m fine, I’m okay... just a flesh 
                        wound I think!

           Kate doesn’t realize her FOOT is going in a weird direction. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (notices)
                        Ah!

                                 KATE
                             (looks, freaks out)
                        Ahhh!!

           But there’s no time to panic. She’s on a CRUMBLING LEDGE. 

                                 ANNE
                        Is there any way up?

                                 KATE
                        No. 

                                 ANNE
                        We’re gonna get you up. Drop your 
                        backpack, it’s weighing you down.

                                 CASSIE
                             (can’t help it)
                        Aw, that’s littering. 
                             (off their looks)
                        Obviously, this is worth it. 

           Kate lets it DROP and skitter down the ROCKY SIDE. 

                                 ANNE
                        What do we have that’s long enough?

                                 CASSIE
                        The tents!

                                 ANNE
                        Tie them together. Quick.

           The girls frantically PULL THE NYLON TENTS out of their 
           PACKS, tying them together. They DANGLE the TIED TENTS down.
                                 BLAIR
                        We’re getting you safe, we promise.

                                 CASSIE
                        Do you trust us? Take hold. Do you 
                        trust us, Kate?

           Kate looks at the TENT ROPE - LOOKS at them. Kate TAKES HOLD. 

                                 KATE
                        I trust you. 

           They pull the TENT ROPE up... SLIDING HER slowly, surely up 
           the slippery rockface... When Kate’s STOMACH finally reaches 
           STABLE LAND, she EXHALES in TEARS, embracing the ground. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhh my God, thank you.

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh fucking Christ... Tell Emmett we 
                        nailed the trust exercise.

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, I guess we finally figured 
                        out how to use our tents, huh? 

           They LOOK DOWN at Kate’s BACKPACK - a barely visible RED DOT.

                                 CASSIE
                        Well, say goodbye to Mike’s tent. 
                             (calls out)
                        You were nice while you lasted but 
                        we don’t need you, anymore.

                                 KATE
                        Guys, I saw Angels out there.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sure. It was really scary!

                                 KATE
                        No, I mean - Mount Angeles. 

           Blair CLIMBS to a better vantage point - breaking through the 
           trees, sky opening up into an impressive vista... and LOOMING 
           IN THE DISTANCE with ridges like wings... Mount Angeles.

                                 BLAIR
                        Holy shit. That’s it. I’d recognize 
                        that angel asshole anywhere. 

           Anne and Cassie HELP Kate to her feet but she HOBBLES, almost 
           falls. Her ankle a hundred shades, swollen, bloody, sprained. 
                                 KATE
                             (gulps for air, pained)
                        Whoa... I can’t- Ah, fuck. 

                                 ANNE
                        Are you okay? 

           They help Kate sit again. She BRACES herself against a ROCK. 

                                 KATE
                        I can’t stand on it. I can’t walk.

                                 BLAIR
                        Well, we’re not leaving you here. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Yeah, there’s gotta be a way.

                                 KATE
                        Guys, please - there’s no way. 

                                 ANNE
                        No.

                                 KATE
                        Yes! Go! I’ll hold you back. You’ll 
                        get out and give me a glamorous 
                        helicopter exit. I’ll be fine. I’ll 
                        just sit against this... cozy rock. 
                        Is this a comforter? So fluffy. 

                                 ANNE
                        Goddamn it, Kate, no. That rock is 
                        not fluffy. Stop pretending you’re 
                        fine. We’re a team. We look out for 
                        each other, right? You’re making it 
                        out with us. We’ll find a way. 

                                 KATE
                             (conflicted, wipes tear)
                        Could have said it nicer. 

           EXT. RIVERBANK - LATE AFTERNOON

           Kate SOAKS her puffy ankle in the river. Blair and Anne help 
           her wrap it. 

                                 ANNE
                        I’ve had a sprain before. Does it 
                        feel like your heart’s beating in 
                        your ankle? 
                                 KATE
                        Yeah if my ankle’s having a heart 
                        attack.  

                                 BLAIR
                             (cringes, grossed out)
                        Oof, it’s like a mongoloid foot. 
                             (off Anne, defensive)
                        What? 

                                 ANNE
                        You don’t have to say it. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Kate has eyes, she knows. It looks 
                        like she’s transforming into Shrek. 
                        Not gonna be wearing a dress for 
                        awhile. Her legs look like Passion 
                        of the Christ. 

                                 KATE
                             (laughs)
                        Thanks. Great river-side manner.

           Cassie COMES OVER with TWO BIG STICKS. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Not to bring up my sciatica but the 
                        pain got so bad I made make-shift 
                        crutches once. These could work.

                                 ANNE
                        I could make a cushion on top. 
                             (shrugs, explaining)
                        Girl Scouts. 

                                 KATE
                             (nods, grateful)
                        Thank you. 

                                 BLAIR
                        And I know how to reset your ankle. 
                        I’m going to count to three and 
                        you’re going to hear a tiny CRUNCH. 
                             (off Kate’s surprise)
                        I’m just kidding, I’m not a doctor. 
                        So, what should we do?

           They all look to Kate for the plan. 

                                 KATE
                        Well, if we go back in the forest, 
                        we risk getting lost again. I say 
                        we consider our original plan. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        We know if we can get to the top of 
                        Mount Angeles, there’ll be a trail 
                        that leads us back to Blair’s car. 

                                 CASSIE
                        “Summit a mountain, save our team,” 
                        right?

                                 ANNE
                        Summit a mountain, save our team. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Summit a - are we all repeating it?

                                 ANNE
                        Kate, are you up to this?

                                 KATE
                        I’m willing to try if everyone is 
                        on board. Do we have solidarity?

           They LOOK at Blair. She LOOKS back. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Hey, if peg-leg can do it, I can.

                                 KATE
                        Then it’s settled: we’ll leave at 
                        first light tomorrow. It’s going to 
                        be a long haul. Would have been 
                        tough in normal conditions but I’m 
                        gonna really be leaning on you guys 
                        for support. We’re gonna need all 
                        our strength. Anne, can you use 
                        those Girl Scout craft skills to 
                        make a fishing net or pole? Blair, 
                        think you can finally learn how to 
                        make a proper tent and fire? 

           They NOD. Kate LOOKS next to Cassie - debating her skills... 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        And Cassie you’re good with... your 
                        skills are... 

                                 CASSIE
                        --I want to kill. 

                                 KATE
                        Alright, then. 
           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Cassie TIES a KNIFE to a STICK with VINE. A HUNTING SPEAR.

           Blair PITCHES a TENT - Anne reaches inside and pulls off the 
           mesh pocket attached to the ceiling. 

           Anne uses the NET POCKET to make a FISHING NET. 

           Kate BOILS water.  Blair CARRIES over fistfuls of BERRIES. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Cassie said these are 
                        hallucinogenic berries! Win-win. 
                             (off their looks)
                        What? We all help in our own ways.

                                 CASSIE
                             (quietly, to others)
                        It’s rose hips but it’s the only 
                        way I could get her to eat them.

           Anne WATCHES a ROBIN soar through the air. The song, “SUMMER 
           BREEZE,” plays over her reverie. 

                                 SEALS AND CROFTS
                        Summer breeze, makes me feel fine. 
                        Blowing through the jasmine in my 
                        mind. 

           The Robin lands in her NEST and begins feeding her fluffy, 
           squawking BABY ROBIN. Anne’s lost in thought - a nice 
           cinematic moment until Cassie BURSTS IN:

                                 CASSIE
                        Good find. I’ll go get my club. 

                                 ANNE
                        No!
                             (covers, casual)
                        I mean, no. That’s not enough food. 
                        Fish are jumping over there... 

           EXT. CLIFF - EVENING

           Cassie, Anne, Blair and Kate (on her new make-shift CRUTCHES) 
           STARE OUT at a WHOOSHING WATERFALL cascading from the BEDROCK 
           above into a SUNKEN PLUNGE POOL twenty feet below them. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Fish City. We just gotta catch one. 
                                 BLAIR
                        Not to add a wrinkle to this plan 
                        but how are we getting down there?

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, it’s too steep-

                                 ANNE
                        --I’ll go. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What? Really?

                                 KATE
                        You don’t know how deep it is.

                                 ANNE
                        Sometimes you just gotta take the 
                        leap, right? Don’t stand at the 
                        edge too long... 

           Anne BRACES herself and JUMPS into the WATER. She LANDS BELOW 
           with a HUGE SPLASH - resurfaces. WAVES to them she’s okay. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        UNIMAGINABLY COLD!

           Cassie DROPS the FISH NET DOWN. Anne SWIMS over to GRAB IT. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Don’t go chasing waterfalls! 
                             (notices, to Cassie, grim)
                        We got company. 

           Cassie turns, sees THREE SQUIRRELS stuffing their cheeks with 
           BERRIES from the basket. She LIFTS her SPEAR like a warrior. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Time to hunt. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - LATER

           Blair SQUEEZES her EYES SHUT - HOLDING DOWN a squirrel as 
           Cassie SMASHES it with a ROCK. Blair peeps - yelps. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (repulsed, impressed)
                        Damn, that is some rugged ass shit. 

           Cassie nods, appreciates the small acknowledgement.
                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        You’re really in your element here, 
                        huh? 

                                 CASSIE
                        Maybe more than the office?

                                 BLAIR
                        Cassie, I’m sorry for always 
                        treating you like you’re dumb. 
                        You’re not. You’re... trusting. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I know, I need to work on that. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Don’t. I mean, you can - I don’t 
                        want you to get abducted. But I 
                        think we’re just smart in different 
                        ways. You work hard - I could 
                        probably stand to learn from you. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Well, thank you. 

           Cassie SHARPENS her KNIFE against the ROCK. 

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Now we skin. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Glad we had that talk before you 
                        said that.  

           EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET

           SQUIRREL SKEWERS and TROUT blackens over the fire. They all 
           TRY their first bites, their first meal in two days. 

           They so want it to be delicious. After a few chews, it’s 
           clearly NOT. 

                                 ANNE
                        Hmm, the squirrel is... gamey? 

                                 BLAIR
                        How did those guys make their trout 
                        not taste like mud?

                                 KATE
                        No, you know what this tastes like?
                             (meaningful)
                        Like hope. 
           They NOD, contemplating this.  

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m so glad you didn’t say cum. 
                             (off their looks)
                        The last dinner?!

                                 ANNE
                        Not this joke again. 

           They LOOK OUT at their view... The FOG has DISSIPATED - 
           leaving the MOST STUNNING SUNSET ever seen. RAYS OF LIGHT 
           descend from the HEAVENS as the SUN SINKS behind the RANGES, 
           leaving THE ENTIRE LAND in a WARM PURPLISH GLOW. 

                                 KATE
                        Ya know, there’s this poster by my 
                        StairMaster at the gym... 

                                 ANNE
                        You still use a StairMaster?

                                 BLAIR
                        Was the Nordictrack broken? 

                                 KATE
                        Stay with me. It reads... “Only the 
                        man who is not hungry says the 
                        coconut has a hard shell.”

           Kate BITES heartily into her SQUIRREL SKEWER. 

                                 CASSIE
                        We weren’t hungry enough, yet? 

                                 KATE
                        We kept waiting for someone else to 
                        save us. I just think we’re so over-
                        reliant on everything else - men, 
                        technology, this convenience 
                        culture - at least I am - and we 
                        finally realized we’re capable of 
                        being our own heroes. 

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, I’ll toast to that.

           They TOAST their ROASTING STICKS of squirrels to that. 

                                 BLAIR
                        But really, on this Stair Master, 
                        are you wearing neon spandex? I 
                        just need to set the scene.  
           Kate waves her off, smiling. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        When you make a good joke but all 
                        you hear are actual crickets. 

           The girls listen to CHIRPING CRICKETS - ROAR LAUGHING. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - STARRY NIGHT

           They SIT outside their TENTS, dinner long-finished - 
           STARGAZING. An unending SKY machine-gunned with STARS.

                                 ANNE
                        My parents used to say, if you see 
                        a shooting star together, you’re 
                        supposed to be friends forever. 

                                 CASSIE
                        They “used to say?”

                                 ANNE
                        They both passed away when I was 
                        eleven.  

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh no, what happened?

                                 ANNE
                        My mom died of cancer and about two 
                        weeks later my Dad had a heart 
                        attack. They say “broken heart,” I 
                        dunno. It certainly broke my heart. 
                             (gathers self, rallying)
                        Yeah, 1992 was not a great year for 
                        me. But I made it through that so 
                        what the hell does this mountain 
                        possibly have?

                                 KATE
                        I’m so sorry, Anne. I had no idea. 

           Cassie PUTS her ARM around her. 

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, that’s okay, thanks guys, 
                        obviously it’s been awhile but 
                        clearly it still has an effect on 
                        me. I became more private after 
                        that. Maybe it’s even tied to my 
                        having kids fear, who knows? 
                        Anyway, I guess there’s probably a 
                        lot we don’t know about each other. 
                                 BLAIR
                        I feel like we all had some 
                        misconceptions about each other. 

                                 ANNE
                        Here’s to getting to know each 
                        other better.

                                 BLAIR
                        When we get outta this, Cassie’s 
                        horoscope says to take us all out 
                        for drinks to do just that... 
                             (then, jokingly relents)
                        Okay, FINE - first round’s on me. 

           They smile, STARE at the SKY. Blair sees a SHOOTER - squeals.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Did you guys see it?! Right there! 

           They SHAKE their HEADS, disappointed.  

                                 CASSIE
                        Uh-oh. You saw a shooter by 
                        yourself? That means you’re gonna 
                        spend the rest of your life alone. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Nice try. Gotta wake up a lit-tle 
                        earlier to get me, Cassie. 

           Cassie grins, busted. Kate RUBS her ANKLE, thoughtfully... 

                                 KATE
                        Guys, I’m sorry, this whole 
                        thing... was my fault. 

                                 ANNE
                        No... 

                                 KATE
                        It’s true, the reason we even need 
                        a team building. Our communication 
                        issues stemmed from me. Conflicts 
                        are natural and I did you guys a 
                        disservice thinking if I ignored 
                        them, they’d just go away. 
                        Obviously that’s the opposite of 
                        what happens. But we’re having a 
                        lot more open, honest discussions 
                        from now on, I’ll tell you that 
                        much! 
                                 BLAIR
                             (jokes, concerned)
                        Great. 

           They LAUGH. 

                                 ANNE
                        I’ve been wanting to ask. Did you 
                        pay for this with your own money?

                                 KATE
                             (humble)
                        Oh, well, we were on a budget and 
                        we went over. I didn’t want to push 
                        my luck asking for more. 

                                 ANNE
                        So, you paid for this whole thing?

                                 KATE
                        It’s not that big a deal. I knew 
                        it’d be worth it. 

                                 ANNE
                        Why do you believe in us so much?

                                 KATE
                        I like you guys. Sometimes you just 
                        don’t make room for each other. But 
                        I knew you were capable... which is 
                        why I set this whole “getting lost” 
                        thing up.

                           BLAIR
                                                          ANNE
           What?!
                                              Shut up...

           Anne and Blair LEAN IN, mouth agape - utterly shocked. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (bursts into a smile)
                        I’m just kidding. I wanted to take 
                        that further and say we’re a block 
                        from the parking lot but I can’t. 

                                 ANNE
                             (playfully slaps at Kate)
                        Agh!

                                 CASSIE
                        I knew she was joking!
                             (high-fives Kate)
                        You guys are so gullible sometimes!
                                 ANNE
                             (continuing, to Kate)
                        Well, you should make sure Emmett 
                        reimburses you. He can afford it 
                        and it’s Step One in developing 
                        conflict resolution skills. 

                                 KATE
                             (hates saying yes)
                        Ah... okay... I know I need to work 
                        on that. I also know I need to drop 
                        the Mike. I’m realizing I only 
                        wanted him back so much because 
                        it’s what I know, I was just afraid 
                        of letting go. But it’s time to let 
                        someone new in. Enter the bone 
                        zone, as they say. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yes! 

           THREE METEORS streak across the sky. They SHRIEK, happily.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, what about three streakers?!

           SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE: a PACK of coyotes HOWL and YIP. 
           The girls hush in surprise... Cassie CLIMBS to her FEET and 
           HOWLS along. The rest STAND beside her, beneath the GLOWING 
           MOON, around the SIMMERING FIRE and really, really let go. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN

           The LIGHT at sunrise is PURE GOLD. The chilling air of dawn. 
           Cassie EMERGES, SITS ALONE, ENJOYING the serenity. She 
           presses her PALM against the EARTH in prayer. The others 
           quietly ARISE from their TENTS, PULLING her from her reverie. 

                                 KATE
                        You ready to get home?

                                 CASSIE
                             (heavy-hearted)
                        Yeah. 

           She STANDS, DUSTS off her HANDS... Blair sees a MURDER OF 
           CROWS - her morning alarm clock. They SQUAWK.

                                 BLAIR
                        What’s that saying about eating 
                        crow? Caw!

           The CROWS fly off. Blair smiles, victorious. The girls begin.
           EXT. VALLEY - MORNING

           The girls APPROACH the RIVER. Anne SPLASHES in first. 

                                 ANNE
                        It’s not that deep. It’s mid-thigh.

           Cassie WADES IN - much shorter - the water REACHES her BELLY. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Mid-thigh on who?

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING

           The four guys FINISH HIKING, PILING PACKS in their TRUCK. 

                                 JACOB
                        Ugh, I can’t wait to take a shower 
                        and have a beer.  

           Pete sees a YELLOW VW with an “I LIKE BAGELS” bumpersticker.  

                                 PETE
                             (laughs)
                        Look. That one’s gotta be Blair’s.

                                 JACOB
                        No, can’t be. They were supposed to 
                        finish yesterday.

           Pete NODS towards the Green Tech parking permit. 

                                 PETE
                        I dunno. Isn’t that their company?

           Jacob SIGHS, knows what he must do - PULLS his PACK back out. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 GUY #1
                        Come on, dude. 

           Jacob starts HEADING BACK. 

                                 PETE
                        Come on, I’m sure they’re fine. 
                        There’s rangers for this shit... 
                             (Jacob keeps walking)
                        Damn it, wait up.
                             (reluctantly grabs pack, 
                              waves to the other guys)
                        We’ll be back. Don’t drink my beer!
           EXT. RIVER - MORNING

           The girls FORD a FAST CURRENT. It’s dangerous but they HOLD 
           ONTO the PERSON in front of them, using HIKING STICKS. Kate 
           PIGGY-BACKS on Blair’s back. All finding their rhythm.

                                 BLAIR
                             (singing)
                        “Cause baby there ain’t no mountain 
                        high enough. Ain’t no valley low 
                        enough. Ain’t no river wide enough 
                        to keep me from getting to you!”

           Blair’s STICK BREAKS. Her FEET lose GRIP on the ROCKY BOTTOM, 
           threatening to rip her and Kate DOWNSTREAM. Blair panics. 

                                 ANNE
                             (grabs Blair, steadying)
                        I got you, I got you guys. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (heart racing)
                        I’m good. I better get a promotion 
                        for this. 

                                 KATE
                        Let’s worry about making it back, 
                        first. 
                             (then)
                        Also, what would you be promoted 
                        to? My job? No. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Worth a shot. I mean, technically 
                        your vagina is on my neck, I’d like 
                        to point that out. Really taking 
                        one for the team here... 

           They REACH shore and look at the TOWERING MOUNTAIN ahead.

                                 ANNE
                        This must be the backside of 
                        Devil’s Neck. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (muttering, as they go)
                        Fabulous, what’s next? Dead Woman’s 
                        Pass? Swift Current Killer? Oh fun, 
                        here comes Breakneck Ridge!

           EXT. MOUNT ANGELES - LATER

           They BACKPACK up the BACKSIDE of the MOUNTAIN. 
           This is not a path. It’s FRACTURED GRANITE - each step 
           tenuous. Especially with Kate LEANING on them for support. 

           Blair GRIPS a ROCK, steadying herself. It CRUMBLES, tenuous. 
           She WIPES sweat off her FOREHEAD, leaving a SMUDGE of dirt. 
           Uncaring, she TAKES the NEXT STEP onwards...

           They’re all quiet - joke time over - FOCUSED on the TASK at 
           HAND. The absolute most EXCRUCIATING FIGHT of their lives. 

           But finally they CREST the grueling PEAK... only to LOOK UP 
           and see the thousand times BIGGER, SHADOWY, DOMINEERING 
           MOUNTAIN before them... it’s so VERTICAL, it looks like a 
           CLIFF WALL they’ll be WALKING STRAIGHT UP. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Damn it. The top’s never the top 
                        with this thing, is it...

                                 ANNE
                        Are you guys gonna be okay?

           Blair and Kate NOD, weary but willing. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN VISTA - DAY

           Pete and Jacob reach a LOOKOUT POINT. They HEAR a FEW HIKERS 
           approaching - just a family. 

                                 JACOB
                        Hi, did you guys happen to see four 
                        women? Thirty-somethings?

                                 PETE
                        Probably looked like they had no 
                        business out here?

           The Family shakes their heads. Jacob SCANS below... nothing. 

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        This is pointless. Man, we tried. 
                        I’m sure they went home. There’s no 
                        way they made it this far.

           Jacob SIGHS, nods - taking ONE LAST LOOK. They TURN to go. 

           EXT. MOUNT ANGELES - DAY 

           And from the other side of the mountains, we see the girls 
           finally REACHING the actual summit. 
                                 BLAIR
                        Oh, thank God, there’s nothing 
                        above us but sky. 

                                 ANNE
                        Yes!

                                 KATE
                        Wait-- where’s the trail?? 

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh no, there has to be a trail...

                                 BLAIR
                        Did we do this all for nothing?!

           They’re pushed so far past their limit - they have nothing 
           left. They LOOK for signs of anything. And then they SPOT THE 
           TRAIL one SUMMIT over... just one KNIFE-EDGED RIDGE away.

                                 KATE
                        You gotta be kidding me. 

                                 ANNE
                             (looks with dread)
                        Is there even a safe way to cross?

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m gonna go with no. 

                                 CASSIE
                        How do we even do it with Kate?

           EXT. ALPINE RIDGE - DAY

           THE CAMERA ZOOMS ACROSS THE KNIFE-EDGED RIDGE: to find the 
           four SCOOTING ALONG on their BUTTS - inch by inch - TIED to 
           each other with a SHORT TENT ROPE TIE. 

                                 ANNE
                        Please don’t die, please don’t die, 
                        please don’t die. 

           Every SMALL, TERRIFIED SCOOT takes them inches CLOSER.

                                 BLAIR
                        Tell Emmett we nailed the ropes 
                        course.  

           They chuckle nervously. They finally, finally ARRIVE AT the 
           BEAUTIFUL FUCKING SECURE GROUND of MOUNT ANGELES SUMMIT...
           Cassie and Anne help Kate back onto her crutches. AND FROM 
           OUT OF THE MIRAGE: THE TRAIL... BLURS into sharp focus.

                                 ANNE
                        Ho-ly shit.

           They all start laughing hysterically with relief. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (genuine)
                        I’ve never accomplished anything 
                        even close to this. I didn’t think 
                        I had it in me...

                                 CASSIE
                             (soulful)
                        I think I did know... I just needed 
                        to be reminded. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (stands, untying herself)
                        Yeah, conquered you, bitch!
                             (dirt crumbles, she trips, 
                              freaks out)
                        Too soon. 
                             (saving face)
                        Loose gravel, watch out. 

                                 KATE
                        Good teamwork, good teamwork, good 
                        teamwork. 

                                 ANNE
                        Team work makes the dream work.

                                 KATE
                        Should we take the photo?

           They PUT their ARMS around each other for this epic moment 
           and snap a SELFIE with Cassie’s camera. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Judging from the amount of calories 
                        I burned, I’m fairly sure I must 
                        look like a supermodel right now. 

           They HOLD EACH other close. It looks like one of those 1970s 
           photo of seasoned hikers on the highest rock atop the world.  

                                 ANNE
                             (faux unhappy)
                        We’re gonna have to be friends 
                        forever now, won’t we?
                                 CASSIE
                             (smiles)
                        Even longer. 

           They’re all pretty but dirty, TWIGS in their HAIR, CLOTHES 
           TORN... you would never have described them as rugged when 
           you first met them... 

           But these some RUGGED ASS BITCHES now. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeehaw!!!!

           THE CAMERA SPINS AROUND FOR THIS PANORAMIC MOTHERFUCKING 
           MAGNIFICENT VIEW... The entire Sierras beneath them. 

           AS THEY LOOK OUT TOGETHER: arms AROUND each other, seeing the 
           CRAZY MILES TRAVERSED... and the final miles remaining... 

                                 KATE
                        There’s our trail. We did it! 

                                 ANNE
                        We got our asses kicked by the 
                        Sierras and lived to tell the tale. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Maybe they’ll call us pioneers.

                                 BLAIR
                             (jokes)
                        We’re natives now, Cassie. We 
                        couldn’t blend back into society if 
                        we tried.

           They TURN and begin their DESCENT DOWN THE TRAIL... 

           EXT. TRAIL - DAY

           They continue the STEEP DESCENT down - past FIELDS OF PURPLE 
           WILDFLOWERS. Cassie snaps PICTURES. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What if we get back and Emmett’s 
                        like, no I meant the G8 Summit. The 
                        political conference. Why would I 
                        want you to summit a mountain?!

                                 ANNE
                             (laughs, then)
                        I’m gonna tell Scott I’m ready to 
                        take the leap. How hard can popping 
                        out a couple babies be after this? 
                                 BLAIR
                        And I for one plan to drink less... 
                        at work. I mean, work harder. 

                                 CASSIE
                        ...And I quit. 

           They LOOK at Cassie in shock. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Wait, what?

                                 KATE
                        Cassie...?

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sorry, the longer I’ve been 
                        away, the more I realize I don’t 
                        want to go back. I feel like my 
                        life’s meant for more than sitting 
                        in a bad chair staring at fake 
                        trees... and this is the start.

                                 BLAIR
                        We just hiked a mountain to save 
                        our jobs that you don’t even want? 
                        Shit. Even if I wanted to quit, I 
                        never will now. 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, no one’s quitting damn it!

                                 CASSIE
                             (hurt, confused)
                        But I found my life’s passion...?

                                 KATE
                             (immediately relents)
                        Sorry, thought I’d give this 
                        conflict resolution a try... Went a 
                        little strong outta the gate. 
                             (then, sincere)
                        Okay. I mean that wasn’t the point 
                        of a team building trip at all but 
                        it was about us becoming a team and 
                        we did that. And if you’re happy 
                        I’m happy. That’s the bigger point.

                                 BLAIR
                        Totally. 
                             (quietly)
                        Considering I was the only one who 
                        didn’t mention quitting, should a 
                        raise at least be discussed?
                                 KATE
                        No. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Wrong time, I get it. 

                                 KATE
                        Maybe I’ll put you in charge of the 
                        holiday party. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Sold. 

           EXT. TRAILHEAD - EVENING

           They STOP SHORT at what they SEE...

                                 KATE
                        Well, if that isn’t the most 
                        beautiful sight I’ve ever seen. 

           Blair’s VW in the parking lot. They EXHALE with relief.

                                 BLAIR 
                        I want to apologize to everyone if 
                        I got a little cranky back when I 
                        thought we were gonna die. 

                                 CASSIE 
                        Yeah, thank you, Kate, for always 
                        staying so strong.

                                 KATE 
                        Are you kidding? I was lying my ass 
                        off. I was sure we were dead. 
                             (they laugh, then)
                        But hey maybe being a leader 
                        doesn’t mean always knowing the 
                        right direction, it means never 
                        fucking giving up. 
                             (they nod, then)
                        We should keep moving, it uses more 
                        energy to stop and start. 

           They HURRY towards Blair’s car with Kate hobbling behind. 
           Kate sees a note tucked in the hood, picks it up to read: as 
           YELLOW the dog RUNS up, BARKING. It SNIFFS Blair’s crotch. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Don’t even try. I’m warning you. 

           They SEE Jacob, Pete and the others STRANDED by their TRUCK. 
                                 JACOB
                             (brightens, seeing Kate)
                        Hey. 

                                 KATE
                        Hey! Do you need help?

                                 PETE
                        Our truck died. You don’t happen to 
                        have jumpers, do you?

                                 BLAIR
                        I do believe I do. Who’s asking?

                                 ANNE
                        So, to be clear... are you guys 
                        asking us to save you? 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Pete’s truck ROARS to life. Jacob says goodbye to Kate. 

                                 JACOB
                        We went looking for you and these 
                        bozos left the car running and 
                        killed the battery. 

                                 KATE
                        You went looking for us? 

                                 JACOB
                        Yeah, although clearly you can take 
                        care of yourself. What happened?

                                 KATE
                        Ah, well, that’s a “bottle of wine” 
                        kind of story. 

                                 JACOB
                        Can I call you to arrange that?

                                 KATE
                        Sure. I mean, I need to charge my 
                        phone for like two days. But then 
                        yeah. I’d like that. 

                                 JACOB
                        Oh, I saved something for you. 

           He RUNS back to his PACK, DIGS out the last candy left in the 
           bag. The bullfrog gummy bear. She GRINS. 
                                 JACOB (CONT’D)
                        Don’t knock it ‘til you try it. 

           INT. BLAIR’S VW - MOMENTS LATER

           Kate sits in the passenger seat - happy, hopeful. Blair gets 
           in the driver seat, looks at her. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Splitsie on that gummie?

           Kate smiles. Then SHOVES the entire gummie in her mouth. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I miss old Kate. 

           EXT. FOREST ACCESS ROAD - EVENING

           OVERHEAD SHOT: The VW bug drives back. 

                                 BLAIR (O.S.)
                        Man, TBT the time a bear tried to 
                        eat us. That was hilarious.

                                 CASSIE (O.S.)
                        Can I charge my phone? I wanna see 
                        if Emmett replied to my “sex sex 
                        sex” text, yet!

                                 ANNE (O.S.)
                        Why are you driving so slow?

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s Pot Hole City out here.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        You’re going under the speed limit.

                                 BLAIR (O.S.)
                        This is my comfort level. I have 
                        poor night vision. Can I live?

                                 ANNE (O.S.)
                        Ah, great, this is gonna take a 
                        hundred hours to get home. 

           And off the LONG and WINDING ROAD, someone cues up, “AIN’T NO 
           MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH.” And they sing their hearts out... 

                                                              FADE OUT.
