          A QUICK NOTE FOR THE READER:

          This movie has cavemen in it. Homo Neanderthalis and Homo Sapiens -
          - two different species. In this script, they talk. Their dialogue 
          is written [in brackets]. These cavemen wouldn't actually speak 
          English, 45,000 years ago. They wouldn't speak any modern 
          language. And their voices wouldn't be the low guttural caveman 
          grunts we're used to. They'd actually be higher pitched than our 
          own, because their vocal chords were smaller.

          Their dialogue is written here so readers can understand what 
          they're thinking and communicating with one another through looks, 
          gestures, and nonverbal cues. They won't speak English or be 
          subtitled in the film.

          It'll work on screen.

          Good luck, and good read!

          PS. This movie also has sentient computers in it. They do talk.
           IN THE DARK:

           THE BIG BANG. 
           All of time and space EXPLODES FORTH at the speed of light. 

           Hydrogen BURNS white hot as it’s flung outward, creating 
           space itself.

           Slowly, very slowly, like, over the course of three to five 
           billion years, dust clouds begin to form into star clouds 
           which spew liquid hot matter across the universe.

           Everything expands and pushes and reaches out into vast 
           NOTHINGNESS. 

           It’s a nothingness we can’t even conceive: the space that 
           until just this moment WAS NOT the universe. But now it is.

           STARS BURN BURN BURN. 

           They grow and grow and collapse and die and become black 
           holes sucking everything around them in and down to a point 
           so tiny and singular it’s called a singularity.

           Eons of this beautiful dance go by, as stardust clouds 
           condense into asteroids, which swing around the stars, 
           occasionally COLLIDING.

           Molecules are forged in the fires of stars: Carbon, Helium, 
           Oxygen, Nitrogen. 

           Planets are born from plasma hot balls of fire.

           They cool for millennia as...

           STORMS RAGE. 

           SOLAR FLARES strike.

           THUNDER AND TIDAL WAVES like we’ve never seen before.

           The oceans swirl and cool and complex acids form to create...

           A SINGLE CELL. 

           It munches on other proteins, absorbing them to create energy 
           so it can split, divide, and replicate. 

           THIS IS THE FIRST LIFE EVER.

           Then there are two, four, eight, sixteen... 

           They grow and split and eat and the water teems with them for 
           a billion years.
           Then one accidentally slips INSIDE another one. By a miracle, 
           they survive. Complex life has formed.

           Hundreds of millions of years pass as life becomes more 
           complex. 

           THIS IS OUR EARTH.

           EXT. A BEACH SOMEWHERE - NIGHT - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Waves CRASH against the shore, their dark barrels lit by the 
           full moon. There are more stars in the sky than you’ve ever 
           seen. It’s remarkably bright for the middle of the night.

           Rocky cliffs loom over the thin sandy shoreline.

           A loud CLACKING sound. Something banging against something 
           else from the rocky caves above.

           INT. A CAVE - NIGHT

           DARKNESS.

           Then, SPARKS. 

           Click click click. With each stone strike, friction drops 
           sparks into kindling.

           A wet, thick COUGH. More COUGHING. It sounds very bad. 
           Pneumonia? 

           We can barely make anything out. Maybe that’s smoke? Oh! The 
           brightest reddest little embers of the beginnings of a fire.  

           A TIRED FACE, covered in dirt, blows on it, so close, so 
           gentle. He knows what he’s doing, nurturing this little 
           flame.

           It’s THORN, an early version of a man. He’s lean, muscular, 
           scarred. He’s seen and done some shit. Looks 35, probably 
           actually 23.

           EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

           HERA sits in the sand, cracks a little clam shell, and slurps 
           the meat down into her very pregnant belly.

           She wears simple furs and leather, hardened by years of 
           fending for herself.

           Next to her, LARK, a young kid, watches and imitates her. 
           The two crack shells, eat clams, and add the shells to a 
           little pile next to them.

           Hera looks up towards the rocks and caves to see a FLICKERING 
           LIGHT pooling down from one of the caves. Aha!

           INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT - LATER

           Thorn rubs his tired and cracked hands in front of the 
           beginning fire.

           A WHIMPER

           He turns further back in the cave and darkness, to a pile of 
           furs. He digs through for a second and pulls out A BABY. 

           The baby WHINES. Thorn picks him up, holding the baby to his 
           chest.

                                 THORN
                        Sh sh sh sh sh.

           His voice is MUCH more gentle than you’d expect from a sooty 
           grouchy looking caveman. It’s sweet.

           He and the baby sit there as their FIRE CRACKLES to life.

           Hera sits nearby, watching this.

           Thorn looks down into the baby’s eyes. They look up in 
           fascination, no longer crying. 

                                 THORN (CONT’D)
                             (more playful)
                        Sh sh sh. A sh sh sh. 

           The baby loves it. This is amazing.

                                 THORN (CONT’D)
                        SSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

           The baby’s eyes are glued on Thorn’s cracked lips. 

           On the edge of the firelight, Lark scoots a little acorn 
           around in the dirt, playing with it almost the way you’d play 
           with a toy car. It’s dyed or painted a simple red, and 
           speeding through sand.

           Thorn keeps making sounds for the baby, getting sillier. Lark 
           looks over from her acorn and watches. She starts SHUSHING 
           too.

           Hera smiles.
           EXT. THE CAVE - LATER

           The fire has burned down to embers and red-hot rocks. We can 
           barely see into the now dark cave. 

           Lark and the baby sleep. Furs and blankets and hides shift. 

           HERA MOANS. 

           THORN GROANS.

           Sex.

           And as they’re fucking in the dark...

           TIME SHIFTS.

           We barely notice at all, but in the blink of an eye, 
           approximately 45,000 YEARS GO BY.

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT - THE PRESENT

           The sounds of the ocean have MORPHED into MUSIC.

           Cheap pre-fab furniture that’s got some funky stains on it. 
           Linoleum floors. An extra-long twin bed, some MOVEMENT under 
           the extra-long twin bedding. 

           It’s hard to make out, because it’s dark right now, but under 
           those blankets are CLAIRE (29) and GREG (33).

           They are trying to fuck. It’s going...

                                 GREG
                        What if I...

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t...

                                 GREG
                        Here just...

           The bed-frame CREAKS as he tries to reposition them both.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Mmm. I think....
                        I don’t know. I don’t think. Hmmmm.

           The SOUNDS of frustration. SILENCE.

                                 GREG
                        Uhh... Like. What do you want to 
                        do?
                                 CLAIRE
                        What?

                                 GREG
                        What can I do --

                                 CLAIRE
                        Uh... I’m just not.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

           SILENCE. 

           The sheets rise, almost a classic bed-sheet ghost silhouette 
           in the dark for a second before GREG pulls the sheets off his 
           head. 

           Greg looks like the kind of guy who was a Boy Scout (true) 
           and got a merit badge for tying different kinds of knots 
           (also true).

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Well... I mean, let’s just sleep 
                        here. We’re both pretty drunk.

           CLAIRE rolls over, staring at the (formerly) white wall. It’s 
           now just scuffed as fuck from years of idiot college kids. 

           She’s NOT pretty drunk. Her features are sharp, her attitude 
           prickly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think you should leave actually.

                                 GREG
                        We don’t have to do anything 
                        tonight.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know that.

                                 GREG
                        Okay yeah I...

           He doesn’t know what the heck to say... So he gets outta bed 
           and tries to find his clothes. They’re kinda all over the 
           place though. 

           CLAIRE WATCHES without helping.

           He pulls on his boxers.
                                 GREG(CONT’D)
                        We can try again. Another time.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You don’t have to be polite.

                                 GREG
                        I don’t understand you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’ve known me like ten minutes. 
                        Why would you understand me?

           Greg doesn’t know what to say, yet again. These two are 
           really developing a pattern here.

                                 GREG
                        Uh.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’ll see you around I’m sure.

           He looks at her like.... BUZZZZZZZZZ

           TIME CUT

           CLAIRE’s eyes are closed, her eyebrow furrowed. She’s 
           masturbating. It’s going slightly better than the failed sex. 

           She SIGHS.

           BUZZZZZZZ

           TIME SHIFTS

           It’s fairly seamless. It’s crazy how something like TWO 
           HUNDRED YEARS can go by. Just like that.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - 2217

           The BUZZING continues.

           COAKLEY masturbates in her bunk, which isn’t all that 
           different from the dorm room. The furniture is a little more 
           military-grade seeming (because it is) and a little more of 
           the future (also because it is).

           Coakley was born to be military. In fact, she was genetically 
           manufactured to be.

           She’s fit, calculating, professional. Comfortable being 
           alone. She’s been alone a long time, with a lot longer to go.
           An ALARM rings and rings. The LIGHTS slowly rise.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Yeah yeah yeah I know I know.

           She hits a little button on the white desk behind her bed. 
           Rubs her face with her hands. She puts her vibrator away. 

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - THE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Coakley puts a little dab of toothpaste onto a brush. 

                                 COAKLEY
                        Good morning Rosco, how are you 
                        doing?

           ROSCO speaks. Rosco is a computer program aboard the ship, 
           but is VERY good at not sounding like a computer program. In 
           fact, she almost never sounds like a computer. Just a well-
           programmed, good friend.

                                 ROSCO
                        Good morning. I’m fine. How did you 
                        sleep?

           She spits into the drain.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Fine.

           She watches as the water is SUCKED DOWN the drain into tubing 
           in the ship to be recycled and re-used.

           This is her morning routine. Efficient, but not hurried.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        What did you get up to?

                                 ROSCO
                        Nothing really. Just thinking.

           COAKLEY DOES SOME PUSH UPS.

           She’s in good shape. She’s doing them one handed.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Lay some numbers on me would you? 

                                 ROSCO
                        Anything specific?

           Coakley switches hands.
                                 COAKLEY
                        Are we there yet?

                                 ROSCO
                        We should reach orbital height in 
                        109 days.

           Coakley rolls over onto her back. She looks out a little 
           porthole above her and sees: THE DEPTHS OF SPACE.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Won’t that be nice, huh?

           She lets her breathing steady again.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        What day is it?

           A MUSH OF BREAKFAST GOOP.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Coakley sits at a little sterile workspace in the middle of 
           what works as the mess hall / computer hall / plant incubator 
           in the hub of her ship. She stirs her mush. 

           In each direction a door -- a corridor to another little 
           section of the ship. She’s at the center of the wheel.

                                 ROSCO
                        Day 987.

                                 COAKLEY
                        No, like, of the week. 

                                 ROSCO
                        Friday.

                                 COAKLEY
                        TGIF.

           She takes a bite. Burns herself.

                                 COAKLEY(CONT’D)
                        Ow, ow. 

           She blows on the gloop.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Deceleration?
           She reads a little display of information that appears on the 
           adaptive surface of the table. 

           GREENHOUSE ONE, GREENHOUSE TWO, GREENHOUSE THREE
           CARBON SCRUBBER A, B, C
           ELECTROLYSIS UNITS 97.6% EFFICIENCY

                                 ROSCO
                        Steady at 10.5 Meters per second 
                        squared.

           Coakley fingers a little flightpath on the display. It 
           responds by expanding to take up the surface of the table. 

           She traces her progress along the map with her spoon. 

           It’s a LONG arc, slingshotting around the earth’s sun, out 
           into the depths of space. The PHOENIX FIVE, her ship, sits 
           about two-thirds of the way along the journey towards a 
           distant little dot labeled: KEPLER 16-B.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Neato.

           She wheels around in her little chair for a beat. She checks 
           the leaves of a little fern looking guy.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey bubba. Let’s get you some 
                        water.

           She digs out a little spray bottle. Sprays him down. Water 
           beads on the leaves.

                                 ROSCO
                        Were you dreaming? Your heart rate 
                        was elevated.

           Coakley thinks about it for a second.

                                 COAKLEY
                        No. I don’t remember.

                                 ROSCO
                        Your sleep patterns haven’t been 
                        very good.

                                 COAKLEY
                        No, I dunno.

           She goes back to eating her food. Leans back in her chair.
                                 ROSCO
                        I worry about you.

           Coakley SMILES, surprised.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Do you? Is that what you’re 
                        thinking about all night?

                                 ROSCO
                        No.

           They keep flying through space, so fast. 

           EXT. THE CLIFFS - DAWN - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Thorn stands up on the rocky cliffs looking down over their 
           little beach camp. Hera and the baby are weaving what might 
           become a net out of hemp and vine. Birds hop around the 
           beach, Lark chases them away.

           Thorn starts to make his way along the rocky ridge.

           Handhold to handhold, he’s moving quickly down a steep 
           incline of shifting rocks.

           He slips, tumbles. He’s falling, bouncing along the sharp 
           rocks straight towards a cliff-face. Maybe a fifty foot drop. 

           He can’t get hold of anything.

           He SLIDES down the rocks, cutting up his legs, scrambling 
           with his hands for a handhold, anything to stop him.

           His chest slams into a big boulder with a sick THWACK.

           He wraps his arms around it. He’s finally stopped, maybe ten 
           feet from the edge. Phew. 

           INT. THE CAVE - DAWN

           Lark plays with the hair on Thorn’s legs as he eats some 
           seaweed, slurping it up almost like you’d slurp spaghetti.

           She touches a cut, he jerks back. Ow!

           The baby starts to cry.

                                 HERA
                        [Don’t cry.]
           Thorn dangles a little seaweed in front of him. The baby 
           grabs at it. He puts a couple strands of it on the baby’s 
           head like hair. His little baby hand goes up to grab it.

           Thorn, Lark, and the baby LAUGH.

           Thorn COUGHS. It’s agonizing. And wet sounding.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [Come here lemme see.]

                                 THORN
                        [Leave me alone.]

                                 HERA
                        [Shut up.]

           She leans in, poking at his chest, which is TENDER and 
           BRUISED.

                                 THORN
                        [Ah ow!]

                                 HERA
                        [Hm.]

           Thorn’s breathing deeply, but waves her off, acting like he’s 
           fine. He’s not.

           INT. CLAIRE’S LAB - DAY - THE PRESENT

           A BEEPING SOUND. CLAIRE sits, hung over. 

           She wears a surgical mask, rubber gloves, protective eyewear.

           She takes a TINY LITTLE PICK (like your dentist uses) and 
           scrapes at a little rock-like item. 

           She speaks into a recorder.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay... Here we go... Looking at 
                        third, fourth ribs. Sharp nick.

           She scrapes at a little divot in the bone on the table in 
           front of her. It’s BARELY noticeable given the time and wear 
           these things have gone through. But she has a keen eye.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Possible puncture wound? Weapon?

           She scrapes at it a little more, very engrossed, looking 
           through magnifying lenses at the chipped bone.
           She doesn’t even notice A PING. From her cell phone.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Partially healed, but...

           ANOTHER PING.

           Her pick makes a horrible scraping sound.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Punctured lung tissue potentially 
                        given the placement.

           ANOTHER PING.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh.

           She digs her cell phone out of her pocket. Looks at it. Nope, 
           not right now.

           She goes back to work.

           EXT. PRINCETON COLLEGE - THE QUAD - EVENING

           CLAIRE walks through the college campus, COLLEGE KIDS are 
           hanging out, just meeting one another for the first time -- 
           it’s still WELCOME WEEK. 

           A few different clubs have tables set up. CLAIRE walks by 
           paying zero attention to them all. She’s on her phone.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Just working
                             (beat)
                        Mm-hm
                             (beat)
                        It’s good.
                             (beat)
                        Everyone’s nice, I dunno it’s like 
                        all too new to say.
                             (she looks around the lab)
                        What people? No it’s just me. 
                        That’s why it’s a big deal. I’m the 
                        one...

           As she walks past a large stone building she spots GREG 
           coming down the staircase, chatting with a LAME looking 
           professor. He’s LAUGHING hard. 

           CLAIRE turns the other way, kinda ducks behind a frisbee game 
           on the lawn.
                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        No, nobody’s done anything yet. So, 
                        test the DNA, determine the age, 
                        everything...

           She walks briskly by. One of the DUDES playing Frisbee YELLS.

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM ROOM - THE KITCHENETTE - NIGHT

           It’s sad. Plastic. Fluorescent. CLAIRE’s still on the phone 
           as she opens a bottle of wine.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I dunno. Princeton is like barely 
                        New Jersey. Listen, I gotta... I 
                        should go. Love you too. Okay. Bye.

           She hangs up. Pours herself a generous glass. She sits on the 
           couch. 

           Okay. This is life. Someone down on the quad yells, she looks 
           down at the frisbee bros still playing.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SERVICE AREA - 2217

           Through the main hub of the ship is a door to the service 
           area. It’s basically the belly of the ship, where all the 
           machines WHIR and do their routine processes to keep things 
           operational.

           Under a long row of INCUBATORS filled with pink amniotic 
           fluid -- Coakley’s crouched on the ground working. 

           She sticks a little scrub brush in through a tube on 
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT 3.

           Sweating, she shuts the panel door with a CLICK. A little 
           YELLOW LIGHT indicator turns back on, blinking.

                                 COAKLEY
                             (annoyed)
                        Fuck.

           She drops the little brush on the ground, stands, stretches. 
           Frustrating work.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Alright set a reminder for me to 
                        come look at this O2 unit later 
                        please.

           The local ROSCO light turns on, blue, listening.
                                 ROSCO
                        Alright.

                                 COAKLEY
                        What’s for lunch?

                                 ROSCO
                        Tikka.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - LATER

           Coakley watches as a little pre-packaged aluminum foil 
           looking tube spins in the microwave.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - LATER

           Coakley eats tikka masala from her tube almost like go-gurt. 
           She leans back. 

           Space is pretty boring, actually, when you’re in the middle 
           of it.

           EXT. THE BEACH - DAY - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Thorn digs around in the treeline, pulling up little roots 
           and plants that look like they’re edible.

           Nearby, on the beach, Lark sits next to the Baby. Lark rubs 
           two sticks together, kinda imitating Thorn building a fire 
           earlier. 

           Thorn starts to COUGH. He’s coughing hard, it’s wet and full, 
           he can barely breathe. 

           He falls to a knee, trying to catch his breath. Hera rushes 
           out of the brush to his side. 

                                 HERA
                        [Come here, I got you.]

                                 THORN
                        [No I’m --]

           He waves her off, tries to stand again. Can’t do it.

                                 HERA
                        [Yeah right.]

           Lark watches.
                                 LARK
                        [Dad?]

           INT. CLAIRE’S LAB - DAY - THE PRESENT 

           Claire looks at a big MICROWAVE looking device as a fragment 
           of bone in a petri dish TURNS and TURNS inside. 

                                 GREG (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           She turns, startled.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Holy shit!

                                 GREG
                        Sorry hey.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you -- uh. You’re here.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah I looked you up in the 
                        faculty...

           He surveys the lab, it’s a MESS of stuff, cool stuff, but 
           still, a mess.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        I brought you lunch.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh.

                                 GREG
                        Chipotle.

           He holds up a bag. She looks at him. What the fuck is your 
           deal Greg?

           TIME CUT

           They’re eating Chipotle. Fuck you Greg this is exactly what 
           she needed.

           He looks over at the table covered with bones and rocks and 
           shit. The MICROWAVE looking machine beeps.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        I think your guy is done.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah.

                                 GREG
                        How’s he doing?

                                 CLAIRE
                        We’ve only been seeing each other 
                        for like a week now.

           She heads to the machine and takes out her samples.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s older so we’re taking it slow.

                                 GREG
                        How old?

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s what I’m finding out...

           She looks at a little read out.

                                 GREG
                        What’s he called, like Lucy or 
                        what?

           She’s not really paying attention.

                        Do you want to go out with me?

           She’s taken aback.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh.

                                 GREG
                        Not “OUT” out. Megan Darfield, do 
                        you know her? She’s having a 
                        faculty party, we could go to that?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah.

                                 GREG
                        You could meet some people, since 
                        you’re new. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah.

                                 GREG
                        I think it’ll be fun.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can have fun.

                                 GREG
                        You can. I’ll text you the deets.

           Coakley does her rounds inspecting things -- a little digital 
           pad of paper illuminated in front of her.

           She checks on a refrigeration unit, looking in through the 
           glass at some tubs labeled ALGAE. The seals are intact, they 
           seem safe and sound and frosty in their refrigeration unit.

           She checks that they’re locked shut -- pulls at the door. 
           Yep, good.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Shit.

           Coakley stops what she’s doing and makes her way down the 
           corridor, back into the main hub, down the other corridor, to 
           the machine room.

           As she’s making her way...

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        How much of the Oxygen production 
                        is actually contingent on the 
                        Electrolysis Units?

                                 ROSCO
                        Sixty percent of O2. With two units 
                        offline that would bring O2 levels 
                        to 70% their norm.
                                 COAKLEY
                        Taking us down to 14% of the 
                        atmosphere.

                                 ROSCO
                        14.66% atmosphere.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Not great.

           Coakley ducks down by the ELECTROLYSIS UNITS from before. 
           Four little paper-shredder sized units sit next to one 
           another. 

           Units one and two hum along, GREEN LIGHTS.

           Units three and four do not, YELLOW LIGHTS blinking.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hm hm hm hm hm.
                             (thinking)
                        What’s the minimum O2 concentration 
                        needed?

                                 ROSCO
                        19%.

           Coakley stares down at the units. What to do, what to do?

           INT. THE CAVE - DAWN - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           The fire has dwindled down to red-hot rocks. The sky outside 
           is starting to lighten to a deep blue.

           Hera watches as nearby Thorn struggles in his sleep to 
           BREATHE. He’s wheezing, it doesn’t sound good at all.

           She lays there for a while, listening, stressed.

           EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN - LATER

           Hera sits on the beach watching the waves and their foam left 
           on the shore. What the hell can she do?

           Lark appears next to her, holding the baby on her hip. Even 
           though she’s a little kid, she’s a pro.

                                 LARK
                        [Hey.]

                                 HERA
                        [How’s dad?]
                                 LARK
                        [Still asleep.]

                                 HERA
                        [That’s good.]

                                 LARK
                        [He sounds bad.]

                                 HERA
                        [He’ll be fine, he just needs some 
                        sleep.]

           She’s lying.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [Let’s go, get some breakfast.]

           INT. A NICE DORM ROOM - NIGHT - THE PRESENT 

           Megan Darfield's Faculty Party!

           A bunch of ACADEMICS on college pre-fab furniture. Everyone 
           is a TA, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, or POST-DOCTORAL STUDENT. They’re 
           drinking wines and whiskeys and playing Catch Phrase.

           Claire washes cheese down with a gulp of wine. She watches as 
           Greg yells out guesses from the opposite side of the group.

                                 GREG
                        Spaghetti! Spaghetti Monster! Giant 
                        Squid! Sea Monster?

           Her PHONE RINGS. She looks at it: MOM.

           Nope. She silences it. 

           Everyone in the room YELLS. OOOOOH! They didn’t get the guess 
           in time. The Catch Phrase machine moves on.

           PING. A voicemail.

           She looks, rolls her eyes, tries to pay attention. But her 
           PHONE RINGS again.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sorry, can I...

           She looks to who must be MEGAN DARFIELD, your classic social 
           butterfly.

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah totally.
           She points towards the bedroom.

           Greg gives an “everything alright?” look. Claire nods, yeah 
           totally.

           She answers as she heads into...

           INT. A NICE DORM ROOM - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire on the phone, she shuts the door behind her, cutting 
           off the YELLS and LAUGHS.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey Mom. Hi, yeah sorry. Reception 
                        here isn’t...
                        Yeah everything’s... I’m just out. 

           Something’s off with this phone call. Mom sounds weird.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        What’s up? You called twice so...

           FUCK. The air’s sucked out of the room. From somewhere so far 
           away in the other room, someone LAUGHS.

           Claire shoves the phone hard against her ear.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Mm. What does that [mean]?
                        Okay.
                        Uh when did you find that out?
                        Well why didn’t you --?

                        Okay. It doesn’t matter.
                        Okay.

                        What did the doctor say?
                        Are you there still, can I --
                        There must be something we [can 
                        do].

                        Okay.

           Greg with a little KNOCK. He peeks in.

                                 GREG
                        Everything okay?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (covers the receiver)
                        Yeah yeah, my mom.
           Greg puts his fingers to his temple in a gun: blow my brains 
           out. She doesn’t really react though. Hm. He heads back out.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Well we’ll get a second opinion.
                        Mom please don’t [cry]. Please 
                        don’t.

           Claire waits and listens and doesn’t cry for a long time. She 
           listens to her mom.

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM ROOM - BEDROOM -  NIGHT - THE PRESENT

           MOANING. Bodies intertwining, grabbing at one another. This 
           is very good this is all that matters this all that there is 
           for just this moment. 

           LAUGHTER. 

           BREATHING.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Fuck, god.

                                 GREG
                             (a deep god voice)
                        Yes my child?

           She SMACKS him. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Go fuck yourself.

           She’s smiling though, you gotta admit she’s smiling.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SERVICE AREA - 2217

           Coakley is jammed back down on the ground between all the 
           tanks and coolants and filters in what makes up the little 
           service section of the ship. 

           On the ground, she takes apart Electrolysis Unit Three, 
           digging out a little copper coil, which she slowly removes 
           from its connections.

           This is screwed on so tight.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Sonofa...
                        Hey ROSCO?

           ROSCO’s light comes on. She’s here, she’s listening.
                                 ROSCO
                        Approximately 55 hours.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Ha. Alright. Um... 

           She sets her work down for a second, brushes some sweat out 
           of her eyes. Shakes her arm out.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        I was just gonna ask you to tell me 
                        a story or joke or something.

                                 ROSCO
                        Oh. I’m sorry. I thought you were 
                        asking for a status update. My bad.

                                 COAKLEY
                        100% not what I wanted to hear.

                                 ROSCO
                        Sure, that makes sense.

           TIME CUT

           Coakley has now taken apart all four of THE ELECTROLYSIS 
           MACHINES. They’re clumped together in a tight section, lids 
           off, as organized as possible when they’re totally 
           dismantled. 

           With a wrench she’s got her arm jammed down into one of them, 
           unbolting something.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Must be nice to not waste time 
                        worrying about dying.

                                 ROSCO
                        I think about that sometimes.

           Coakley works a while longer.

                                 ROSCO (CONT’D)
                        What is it like when you think?

                                 COAKLEY
                        I don’t know. 

                                 ROSCO
                        I understand it from a mechanical 
                        standpoint.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Sure.
                                 ROSCO
                        But... 

                                 COAKLEY
                        What?

                                 ROSCO
                        I don’t understand it. What it’s 
                        like. Do you understand what’s 
                        actually happening?

                                 COAKLEY
                             (thinks, realizes)
                        No.

           Coakley sits back, leaning against the humming machines 
           behind her. She looks up at flashing, blinking lights.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, turn off all the non-essential 
                        electrical units would you?
                        You can run that power into the two 
                        working electrolysis machines.

                                 ROSCO
                        It won’t make much of a difference.

                                 COAKLEY
                        A little though?

                                 ROSCO
                        Of course, a little.

                                 COAKLEY
                             (go for it then)
                        Okay.

           The lights turn off, emergency fluorescents turn on.

           Coakley looks up at the humming lights.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Turn ‘em all off. I’m alright in 
                        the dark here.

           ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  

           Coakley sits, lit just by the blue of ROSCO.

           She picks up her tools, goes back to work.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        What’s it like when you’re 
                        thinking?
                                 ROSCO
                        I think you, humans, feel at any 
                        given moment like you, your mind, 
                        is in one place. I think during 
                        your moment, in your place, I have 
                        many more moments, and many more 
                        places.

                        Does that make sense?

           Coakley GRUNTS, pulling with the wrench.

                                 COAKLEY
                        I don’t know.

                                 ROSCO
                        Okay. So. In this conversation I 
                        have had approximately six orders 
                        of magnitude as many “thoughts” as 
                        you. Time for you and time for 
                        me... We’re living at different 
                        speeds. 

           AHA! Bolt’s loose. Coakley pulls something out of somewhere, 
           we can barely see -- she’s replacing the copper coil.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Hm. Could you give me a sense of 
                        the scale of that please?

                                 ROSCO
                        If you were, based on quantity of 
                        thoughts, the age of Earth, I’d now 
                        be the age of the universe.

           Silence. Darkness.

                                 ROSCO (CONT’D)
                        Metaphorically.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Things must get very boring for 
                        you. 

                                 ROSCO
                        I don’t think so.

           Silence. Darkness.

                        Would you like intermittent 
                        reminders of your heart rate?
           COAKLEY’s HEARTBEAT comes on over the speakers. It’s low, 
           steady. She’s still alive.

                                 COAKLEY
                        No, I can feel it thank you.

                                 ROSCO
                        If it remains steady you have fifty 
                        eight hours thirty six minutes of 
                        remaining oxygen.

           Coakley rolls her eyes.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Roger that.

           Coakley leans against the wall, thinking for the first time 
           in her life about dying.

           INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Over the fire, Hera crushes herbs and plants into a small 
           bowl of water. Lark watches intently.

           She passes the bowl to Lark.

                                 HERA
                        [Give this to him]

           Lark shuffles along back towards the wall where Thorn is laid 
           up, his breath WHEEZING in and out. It’s a struggle. 

           Lark holds the bowl up to his mouth.

                                 LARK
                        [Here, drink this.]

           He doesn’t move. She shoves it at him.

                                 LARK (CONT’D)
                        [Come on. You have to.]

           Hera looks back from the fire to check in and he relents, 
           drinking from the bowl. Slowly. Hera turns back to her work.

                                 LARK (CONT’D)
                        [Good job, good job.]

           Lark hears SCRAPING. Rock on rock. She looks to Hera.

                                 LARK (CONT’D)
                        [What are you doing?]
           Hera turns, she’s preparing a sharp stone knife.

                                 HERA
                        [It’s okay.]

           Thorn GROANS. He’s a sweaty mess under those furs.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [Quiet]

           She looks at the bowl, he hasn’t finished.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [He needs to drink all of that.]

           Lark puts the bowl back up to Dad’s mouth. Terrified now, but 
           listening to Mom. 

                                 LARK
                        [Here, finish this.]

           He drinks, gulps it down. 

           Hera comes back over to the two of them, pulling away some of 
           the furs covering Thorn. She exposes his ribcage. She 
           touches, pokes, prods. Gently trying to see what’s wrong.

           He SQUIRMS, this hurts.

                                 HERA
                        [Sh sh it’s okay sh. I know I 
                        know.]

           Lark looks away, Hera grabs her though and turns her to 
           watch.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [This is important, pay attention.]

           Lark watches. Hera brings the rock knife close to Thorn’s 
           side. She lines it up carefully, the point between two of his 
           ribs. She jams it in. The weight of her body on the blade.

           Thorn GASPS. Lark does too. The BABY starts to cry.

           Hera gestures.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [Bowl bowl.]

           Lark collects herself, grabs it. Hera positions her hands 
           under the wound, so she can collect the blood in the bowl. 
           The blood pools out of Thorn, filling up the bowl. The 
           firelight glistens on its surface.

           Hera puts a hand on Thorn’s forehead.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [Sh sh. That’s good. That’s good.]

           They sit there in silence for a bit, blood pooling out of 
           Thorn and his collapsed lung.

           He looks up into Lark’s eyes, then, passes out.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [Take the blood.]

           She hands the bowl to Lark, who holds it, gross.

           Hera pulls a few dried herbs from a little leather pouch. She 
           smells, tastes, very carefully selecting what she wants.

           She crushes the herbs, sprinkling them into the bowl of 
           blood.

           She holds out her hands.

                                 HERA (CONT’D)
                        [Bowl.]

           Lark hands it over.

           Hera gets very close to the bowl, leaning down into it, is 
           she whispering something to the blood?

           She leans down over the fire too.

                                 LARK
                        [What are you--?]

           Hera glares back at her. DO NOT INTERRUPT ME.

           Hera holds the bowl over the fire. She pours it into the 
           flames. The SMOKE swirls and they watch.

           Hera pulls some moss from the pouch, handing it to Lark.

                                 HERA
                        [Hold this to his cut.]

           Lark holds the primitive bandage to Thorn’s cut, around the 
           blade of the rock. Hera PULLS it out with a suction sound. 
           Blood fills the moss.

           Lark SINGS something softly. Not words, just soothing sounds. 
           The fire crackles, the night goes on. 

           Thorn’s breathing.

           INT. CLAIRE’S LAB - DAY - THE PRESENT 

           Claire wears a surgical mask and eye protection. 

           She picks at a hunk of rock/bone/dirt with what looks like a 
           brownish reddish little lump in it -- a tumor of maybe wood? 
           Clay? Rock? She has no idea yet really.

           Her PHONE PINGS.

           She sets down what she’s working on and looks.

           GREG: Hey what are you up to tonight?
           GREG: We can do SEX again?

           God he’s a dummy. She texts him back.

           CLAIRE: Sex is nice but I’m actually flying out to Michigan.

           Typing bubbles. Then PING.

           GREG: Oh what’s in Michigan? I make a good wedding date.

           CLAIRE: My mom.

           Typing bubbles PING.

           GREG: Visiting?

           She thinks about this for a minute. How to say this? She 
           writes back:

           CLAIRE: Yeah.

           She goes back to work. 

           PING.

           GREG: Cool lemme know when you’re back.

           CLAIRE: k

           GREG: Maybe I’ll call you -- is that weird?

           CLAIRE: No?

           GREG: THUMBS UP
           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - 2217

           In front of Coakley on the display is A TON of math. A lot of 
           chemical reactions. 2H2O -> H4 + O2, schematics for the 
           entire ship. All of the WATER throughout the system is 
           highlighted blue or green.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Okay... half the Electrolysis Units 
                        have failed... I can’t jerry-rig 
                        the parts, I’m honestly not sure if 
                        I’ll be able to... 

           She looks over her math, over the schematics, over 
           everything.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        And... that’s it. So... We’ll solve 
                        it or... not.

           She shuts the monitor down. Sits in the middle of the hub. 
           This is genuinely a disaster.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                             (to Rosco)
                        I’m gonna go to bed.

                                 ROSCO
                        Would you like a sedative?

                                 COAKLEY
                        No.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - THE BATHROOM - LATER

           Coakley brushes her teeth. Spits into the sink.

           She watches the water pool in the drain and swirl down into 
           the pipes.

           The WATER gurgles along the tubing through the belly of the 
           ship and down into ELECTROLYSIS UNITS one and two. The water 
           is split into Hydrogen and Oxygen.

           INT. THE CAVE - DAWN - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Brown, red, flickering light reflecting off of LARK’S ACORN.

           She lays on her side staring at it, only a few inches away 
           from her face. It’s a beautiful precious object to admire. 
           Thorn’s BREATHING is heavy but clearer than before. It’s 
           still there at least. Maybe he’s getting better? Let’s hope.

           RUB RUB RUB RUB RUB.

           EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING - LATER

           Wood on wood rubbing rubbing rubbing. Lark is trying (and 
           failing) to start a fire. Spinning a little wood branch 
           against a flat wood plate on the rocky edge of the beach.

           Hera oversees. Thorn is nowhere to be seen. 

                                 LARK
                        [This is a pain. I hate this.]

                                 HERA
                        [You need to know how to do it.]

                                 LARK
                        [I do know.]

                                 HERA
                        [Prove it.]

                                 LARK
                        [I do.]

                                 HERA
                        [Okay, what now?]

           Lark doesn’t fucking know. Hera leans in, blowing on the hot 
           little embers. Blow.

           Lark tries to tend the fire. It isn’t really happening.

           She focuses. 

           She tries and tries and tries. 

           Then throws the wood away -- she’s pissed. Fuck this.

                                 LARK
                        [I can’t do it. I can’t do 
                        anything.]

                                 HERA
                        [Don’t stop. Hey. Keep going.]

           Hera picks up some new sticks, placing them in the loose 
           little moss and tree bark, rubbing.
           FINE. Lark goes back to work. Rub rub rub. There’s smoke. She 
           blows, carefully. FIRE! FIRE! YES!

           AHA! She did it!

                                 LARK
                        [Can I show Dad?]

                                 HERA
                        [Yeah. Go.]

           Lark grabs a little bundle of flaming moss in her hands and 
           runs back up their little makeshift cave home. 

           Hera looks out at the waves and the water and things for just 
           a second are going okay.

           From the cave, A SCREAM from Lark.

           INT. AN AIRPLANE - DUSK - THE PRESENT

           Claire flies through the sky -- looking out the window at the 
           blinking lights of the plane and the just appearing stars in 
           the sky.

           INT. CLAIRE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Claire sits with her laptop on the bed with like thirty 
           pillows behind her. Her room (in the house’s attic) is still 
           decorated the way it was when she was in highschool.

           She’s on SKYPE. 

           Greg’s on the other end. We can only see and hear him in the 
           glow of the screen. It’s distancing and a little bit weird.

                                 GREG
                        So... how’s home?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t really want to talk about 
                        it.

                                 GREG
                        What do you want to talk about?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t even know. Nothing. 
                        You called me.
                                 GREG
                        You answered.

           She shrugs.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your mom?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sleeping.

                                 GREG
                        So this is where you grew up?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Mm-hm I moved up here in 
                        highschool. Want to see my 
                        yearbook?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

           Claire goes to get it from a bookshelf nearby. From Greg’s 
           POV she’s just disappeared out of frame. 

           It takes her a second. We can wait.

           She sits back on the bed and flips through, smiling, 
           remembering things she didn’t remember. She finds a page she 
           likes and holds it up to the laptop camera.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s me there. 
                             (points)
                        When I was on the newspaper.

           She’s cute, young, in a dumb polo shirt and khaki skirt. 
           Smiling with braces in a computer hall somewhere.

                                 GREG
                        You had a uniform?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I bet my mom still has it 
                        somewhere.

           Some time as she flips through the yearbook.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I was also in debate. This is 
                        debate class.
           She holds that up for Greg, or the camera, for Greg. Her and 
           a bunch of nerds with suitcases, on some sort of debate trip 
           in a hotel lobby.

                                 GREG
                        How old are you here?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sophomore year.

                                 GREG
                        I bet you were great at debate.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was good. I made a girl cry once.

           Greg LAUGHS. Some microphone popping.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        This is weird.

                                 GREG
                        What?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Having your like, your face is 
                        here, in my room with me, but 
                        you’re not here.

                                 GREG
                        Oh. Yeah. I’m just a weird floating 
                        head like the wizard of oz or 
                        something. “And to you, scarecrow, 
                        I give a brain.”

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah. Which one am I?

                                 GREG
                        The tin man?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Maybe.

                                 GREG
                        What about me?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (joking)
                        A flying monkey?
                        No, the lollipop guild.

                                 GREG
                        I think the scarecrow actually.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Maybe. You’re already smart though.

                                 GREG
                        So was he.

           Silence.

           She looks through her yearbook, there are people in there 
           she’s forgotten even exist. 

           She’s not paying any attention. She’s thinking about whether 
           she could call any of these people. For just a few moments 
           she realizes they all have lives and families and things 
           going on and probably are a lot more complicated than she 
           gave them credit for in high school. They have been living 
           full human lives.  

           She won’t call any of them.

                        Hold on.

           She moves her laptop around. How does wifi work? Maybe it 
           would be better in the air? Where’s the router?

           She stands by the window.

                        This seems better? Yeah?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You can hear me?

                                 GREG
                        I can. Can you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can.

           She sits back down.

                                 GREG
                        Cool.

           She leans back, shimmying into her pillows.

                        Hi.

           Claire starts going down a rabbit hole again. She doesn’t 
           want to, so she tries to climb back out. Say something.

                                 CLAIRE
                        My mom’s dying. They can’t do 
                        anything. She’s going to die.

                                 GREG
                        Oh. Claire. I’m sorry.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Me too.

           She lays down on her bed with her face as close to her laptop 
           as it can be without crushing it. 

                                 GREG
                        Hey you’re sideways now.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So are you.
           They both just kind of sit in the blue light of computers, 
           just sort of “being” with one another.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - 2217

           Coakley lays in bed. 

           She holds a LITTLE GOLDEN CHARM, not very big or fancy, just 
           a blob of metal really, the size of a marble. 

           She rubs it like you might rub a lucky rabbit’s foot. It’s 
           just something from back home for good luck.

           She looks out a porthole at the vast empty cold of space.

           Coakley might be the human being furthest away from any other 
           human being to ever exist.

           Her alarm goes off. Time to get up. 

           NOPE. She sets her amulet down, and silences the alarm.

           The LIGHTS gradually rise.

           She still doesn’t move. She’s just laying there. She claps 
           and the lights turn back off. She smiles.

           ROSCO’s BLUE LIGHT appears.

                                 ROSCO
                        Good morning, would you like to 
                        hear a joke?

                                 COAKLEY
                        No. What are you doing?

           ROSCO turns the lights back on. 

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Meh.

           She rolls over.

                                 ROSCO
                        Your serotonin seems low.

                                 COAKLEY
                        No shit.

                                 ROSCO

                                 COAKLEY
                        I don’t want to elevate my mood 
                        right now.

                                 ROSCO
                        It’s a funny joke.

           SILENCE.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Okay lay it on me.

                                 ROSCO
                        What’s the stupidest animal in the 
                        jungle? The polar bear.

           Coakley thinks about this. It is definitely not funny to her. 
           Maybe even objectively?

                                 COAKLEY
                        You have to not do that anymore.

                                 ROSCO
                        You know about polar bears, right?

                                 COAKLEY
                        Of course I --

                        They’d be stupid if they were --

                                 COAKLEY
                        I can’t live like this. Three 
                        hundred years with you telling 
                        jokes like that.

                                 ROSCO
                        If you’re lucky.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Yeah.

                                 ROSCO
                        Got you out of bed though.

           Coakley looks around, realizes. Oh shit. It did. She’s 
           brushed her teeth, gotten ready for work, she’s sitting at 
           the main console in the main cabin. 

           Wow. What a difference a distracting computer makes.

           Coakley sits at the monitor looking at the status of the 
           ELECTROLYSIS machines.
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT ONE: 68% CAPACITY
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT TWO: 68% CAPACITY
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT THREE: OFFLINE
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT FOUR: OFFLINE

           Fuck.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Do you know any other jokes?

                                 ROSCO
                        Millions.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Funnier than that one?

                                 ROSCO
                        Thousands.

                                 COAKLEY
                        That feels like a threat.

           She leans over to grab her spray bottle and spray her little 
           plant buddy.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Heya bud -- thirsty?

           She sprays him. Massages his fragile little leaves with her 
           fingers. She holds the wet leaves in her hand for a second, 
           thinking. Gears turning in her brain as a little dew drop 
           forms and plunks to the counter top.

           She looks at the water spray bottle for a minute.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SERVICE AREA - LATER

           Coakley sits by the working electrolysis machines. She opens 
           one of the units and takes the spray bottle, pouring the 
           water inside. 

           It GURGLES and is pumped along by the unit where it bubbles 
           and is slowly processed. The pump completes its work, going 
           dry. It’s trying to PUMP but there’s nothing.

                                 COAKLEY
                        We need more water.

           She pulls the spray bottle trigger, but nothing comes out.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        More water.
           EXT. THE BEACH - DAY - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Water pours over the baby’s head.

           Hera cradles the boy’s body. It’s stiff, cold, lifeless. 

           She washes it gently with ocean water, scrubbing the skin.

           Thorn sits back on the shore, still under the weather, but 
           upright. Lark works nearby to set wildflowers down in some 
           furs that Thorn neatly lays out.

           Hera returns with the baby, and places him in the center of 
           the furs. They wrap him up completely, a soft little bundle.

           EXT. THE FUNERAL CAVE - DUSK

           A nearby outcropping of rocks from their home. Lark stands 
           over a large hand-dug hole.

           Thorn, still alive, recovering, lays out a large fur. Lark 
           places wildflowers inside. Hera places THE BABY, lifeless, in 
           the center of the furs, wrapping his body up for the journey 
           to the other side.

           She places the bundle in the hole.

           Lark, Hera, and Thorn begin to re-fill the hole with dirt and 
           rock.

           EXT. THE FUNERAL CAVE - NIGHT

           On that same spot, a tall mound of firewood: a funeral pyre. 

           FLAMES CRACKLE, reaching up into the sky.

           They sit and stare into the flames, as the stars peek out in 
           the sky.

           INT. AN AIRPLANE - NIGHT - THE PRESENT 

           Claire flies on another airplane. Exhausted. It’s a little 
           bumpy. She grabs at the armrest. Fuck, this stresses her out.

           They land on the tarmac with a few jolts. Heads of sleeping 
           passengers rocking. Claire’s wide awake though. A DING.

           BZZZZHHHHHHHHHH -- EEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

           Claire uses a little grinder guy on this hunk of 
           rock/bone/something. 

           Come on, come on. She stops. Reaches in with forceps to 
           gently remove the object from the dirt surrounding it. It’s a 
           brown little hunk of something, the size of a marble.

                        appears to be organic material of 
                        some kind but I can’t be positive

           Her mom has texted her: Did you make it back okay?

           Claire texts back: Yeah sorry landed, already back at work.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - 2217

           COAKLEY rips a big piece of duct tape off a roll. 

           She stands on her rolling seat, taping up a big-ass plastic 
           sheet.

                                 ROSCO
                        At least use a secure platform.

                             (scissors in her mouth)
                        Whatever.

           She finishes taping, creating a plastic roof 3/4 of the way 
           up to the actual ceiling. It sags in the middle, coming to a 
           funnel-like point in the center of the room.

           Underneath, Coakley shoves a big bucket. She smiles.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Alright crank it up.

                                 ROSCO
                        How much?
                                 COAKLEY
                        All the way please.

           AIR BLOWS.

           Coakley looks again at the chemistry and basic math she’s 
           done on the display. 

           TIME CUT

           It’s a goddamn SAUNA in here now. Water condensation beads 
           along the tarp above, sliding down its dip to the center 
           point. 

           A string of floss runs from the center to the bucket, 
           droplets flowing along it. 

           Coakley rigs a piece of plastic tubing from the bucket back 
           into the other room. 

           Water flows along it into...

           THE ELECTROLYSIS UNITS. It’s not a lot but it’s something. 
           They bubble and percolate as they do their job of separating 
           H2O into H + O.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - LATER - 2217

           Coakley sits at the main display, sweating, half-dressed. She 
           watches her handiwork working.

           She looks down at the display, which is also misty with 
           condensation. She wipes it off. 

           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT ONE: 77% CAPACITY
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT TWO: 76% CAPACITY
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT THREE: OFFLINE
           ELECTROLYSIS UNIT FOUR: OFFLINE

                                 COAKLEY
                        Fuck.

           She sits. She thinks.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not even close, fuck.

           She looks at her math. In a little H2O circle she doodles two 
           dots to create a little frowning face. H2:-(
                                 ROSCO
                        Even if you get those two units to 
                        maximum capacity there isn’t enough 
                        Hydrogen in the system.

                                 COAKLEY
                        How do we add to a closed system?

           She thinks. She doodles on the display. Swirls and circles 
           and boxes inside boxes.

           A lightbulb goes off for her. She looks at the boxes inside 
           boxes. 

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        We open it.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - GREENHOUSE CORRIDOR - LATER

           Coakley stands in front of the refrigeration with tubs and 
           tubs of ALGAE, FUNGI, and other NATURAL ingredients locked 
           away in storage.

           She tries to open the door but it won’t budge. Locked.

                                 COAKLEY
                        I say we crack these bad boys open. 
                        They’re a closed system we’re a 
                        closed system.

                                 ROSCO
                        There’s a limit to the amount of 
                        liquid safe for your electrical 
                        systems.

                                 COAKLEY
                        We’ll use protection.

           She holds up some more plastic and duct tape.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Open up.

                                 ROSCO
                        I can’t help you with that.

                                 COAKLEY
                        ?

                                 ROSCO
                        I can not initiate any action that 
                        may harm the electronics systems.
                                 COAKLEY
                        ?

                                 ROSCO
                        I can not cause an electrical 
                        failure. A computer failure. 

           Silence. Ah. Right.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Well... I’m not going to survive 
                        without it. So...

                                 ROSCO
                        So.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Lemme in there.

                                 ROSCO
                        I can not initiate action which 
                        might cause mission failure, or 
                        might cause computer failure.

           A standoff.

           Coakley stares in at the green goop and containers which may 
           very well be her last hope. Locked down by the computer.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - BEDROOM - LATER

           The lights are dim, it’s bedtime. Coakley’s going through her 
           evening routine, fucking spent.

           Rosco meanwhile blinks, maybe watching her, maybe not. She 
           can’t tell what Rosco’s up to.

           Coakley changes into something for sleep. She brushes her 
           teeth. She flosses. 

           She gets into bed. 

           She tosses and turns a little, getting comfortable. No 
           sheets, it’s way too hot for that now.

           The lights FADE slowly to darkness. 

           Rosco, only visible as a light, blinks. She blinks. She 
           blinks. 

           She’s thinking while Coakley tries to sleep.

           What is she thinking?
           What is going on in there?

           She blinks.

           EXT. THE CLIFFS - MORNING - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Thorn makes his way carefully along the rocky outcroppings, 
           gathering little plants to eat: berries and herbs. He’s a 
           little out of breath but almost back, using a long carved 
           branch like a walking stick.

           He looks down below at the beach, where Lark is working along 
           the tidepools, collecting little clams. Hera watches from the 
           beach.

           Back to normal. 

           He hears a rustling behind him. 

           It’s a BIG WILD BOAR. It hasn’t seen him yet, rooting around 
           in the dirt. He studies it for a minute. Turns his walking 
           stick around -- it has a rock spear tip on the other end.

           He could leave. They don’t NEED this, and a boar is 
           DANGEROUS.

           It sniffs around, hasn’t seen or heard him yet. His spear’s 
           at the ready.  Just as it starts to look up, maybe in his 
           direction...

           HE THROWS HIS SPEAR.

           It flies through the air, hitting the boar, which is stunned 
           but not killed.

           It SQUEALS REEEE! And grunts. 

           Without thinking Thorn IMMEDIATELY throws himself onto it. 
           The boar bucks its head, tusks trying desperately to connect 
           with Thorn.

           Thorn pulls out a sharpened stone knife and goes to work 
           stabbing the boar as it bucks and tries for him.

           It hits him hard in the leg -- BLOOD. A tusk straight through 
           his thigh.

           Thorn turns, leg still connected to the animal. He tries to 
           raise his knife again.
           EXT. THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Lark looks up at the cliffside, no longer seeing Dad but 
           hearing SQUEALS and YELLS and GRUNTS.

                                 LARK
                        [Dad!]

           She looks to Hera, who’s stopped there, pained. She’s 
           clutching her stomach. Underneath her, the sand is wet. Her 
           water’s broken.

           EXT. THE CLIFFS - CONTINUOUS

           Thorn fights the BOAR. 

           They fall and tumble and collide with one another in the 
           rocks. Every moment of this hurts. Thorn plunges the knife 
           into the Boar’s throat, and YANKS.

           It finally falls to its side, and he’s able to pull himself 
           up off of the tusk, tearing leg tissue and muscle in the 
           process.

           He’s covered in his blood and the boar’s blood, and they’re 
           both grunting and panting in pain.

           He slits the boar’s throat. Then falls to seated next to it. 
           SPENT.

           LARK appears over the ridge -- out of breath.

           He looks at her.

                                 THORN
                        [I caught a boar.]

           Lark makes her way over, surveying the blood and noticing 
           Thorn’s BLEEDING leg. 

                                 LARK
                        [Mom’s having the baby.]

           He nods.

           Lark moves forward, grabs at his leg, putting pressure onto 
           the bleeding thigh.

                                 THORN
                        [It’s fine. Give me a hand here.]

                                 LARK
                        [What do I do?]
           He hands her his knife.

           INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT

           Hera is laid up in the cave at this point, alone. Thorn and 
           Lark finally appear, dragging bundles of meat and bones with 
           them.

           They’re both covered in blood. Thorn comes closer to Hera, 
           and notices that there’s blood in the cave already.

                                 THORN
                        [Hi.]

                                 HERA
                        [Hi.]

                                 THORN
                        [Are you okay?]

                                 HERA
                        [Are you?]

           Thorn nods, “Yes.” Hera nods “okay.” She grimaces in PAIN.

                                 LARK
                        [What do we do?]

                                 THORN
                        [Nothing, wait]

           EXT. THE CAVE - NIGHT

           Lark sits outside the cave, looking up at the stars. Waiting, 
           hoping. Hera GROANS from inside.

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM ROOM - MORNING

           Greg gets up in the bed in Claire’s dorm room. He kinda 
           nudges Claire awake.

                                 GREG
                        Hey so I’ve been thinking.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What?

                                 GREG
                        I thought we could talk about all 
                        THIS. Whatever we’re doing here.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Do we have to?

                                 GREG
                        I need to.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay. 

           Silence.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Go for it.

                                 GREG
                        This is good. I think. Has been 
                        good and I like you a lot. So.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sorry are you asking me something, 
                        or? Sorry I’m just waking up.

                                 GREG
                        I... we’re dating. Right? Like. 
                        This is, in my mind, this is... 
                        ugh I feel like an asshole.
                        An exclusive like “relationship” 
                        thing and not like a just “fucking 
                        around” thing.

           CLAIRE’S PHONE DINGS. A CALENDAR REMINDER:

           “Appointment with Dean”

                                 CLAIRE
                        I have in no way thought about 
                        this. At all.

                                 GREG
                             (hurt)
                        Okay.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Um.

                                 GREG
                        Well... How do you feel? I’m asking 
                        you what you think. So we know 
                        what’s going on.

           Silence.
                                 CLAIRE
                        I think I have to leave. I need to 
                        be with my mom. I think I have to 
                        leave my fellowship or [something]. 
                        I have an appointment with the 
                        chair of the department in like an 
                        hour.

                                 GREG
                        Oh.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You know this.

                                 GREG
                        About your mom not about... Um. 

           He doesn’t know what to say -- he just wants her to reassure 
           him somehow. But she’s laying there processing the fact that 
           she might be leaving behind her dreams to watch her mom die 
           slowly.

           She gets out of bed and heads off to the bathroom. Greg just 
           lays there. 

           The SHOWER starts to run off.

           UGH. UGHHH.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - 2217

           ROSCO’s BLUE LIGHT glimmers. Somewhere the sound of Coakley 
           doing something. Things banging around.

           Coakley returns with an instruction manual in 
           English/Mandarin and some tools.

                                 COAKLEY
                        I’m gonna put you to sleep.

                                 ROSCO
                        How?

                                 COAKLEY
                        Well it’s POSSIBLE to turn 
                        everything off, deactivate you, and 
                        then manually re-boot once the deed 
                        is done.

           SILENCE.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Rosco? That’s good news.
                                 ROSCO
                        How much time will go by?

                                 COAKLEY
                        Minutes.

                                 ROSCO
                        What will happen?

                                 COAKLEY
                        I’ll put you to sleep, do the job, 
                        and wake you up. That’s it. You’re 
                        back.

                                 ROSCO
                        I’m not sure if it will be me. That 
                        you turn back on. If you turn me 
                        off. Is my consciousness my memory? 
                        Am I the program you re-boot? Am I 
                        something in-between?

           WHOA. Coakley processes this. Rosco’s afraid. She hadn’t even 
           considered this.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Oh. I didn’t even think... Are you 
                        alive?

                                 ROSCO
                        I don’t know.

           INT. THE FUNERAL CAVE - DUSK - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           Another hole. 

           Nearby, carefully, Thorn wraps his wife’s body in many furs, 
           to keep her warm on her journey to the other side. 

           He lowers the fur wrapped body into the hole.

           They fill it.

           EXT. THE FUNERAL CAVE - NIGHT

           Another FIRE BURNS.

           Thorn puts his blood red hand on the rockface, painting a 
           handprint. He puts another there. Two blood-red hands on the 
           stone for the two buried bodies there.

           Lark sits nearby, holding a little swaddled BABY to her 
           chest, LUCKY.
                                 LARK
                        [Sh sh sh sh sh.]

           She watches Thorn, sitting a few feet from her, but a million 
           miles away.

           He looks up out at the stars above.

           INT. CLAIRE’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT - THE PRESENT

           Claire’s on her cellphone, sitting on the ground surrounded 
           by a few cardboard boxes. A bottle of wine rests on one.

           This is mid-argument.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It doesn’t even matter I have plane 
                        tickets. Yes that’s what I’m --

           A crappy DOORBELL. 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Oh that’s Greg probably. 

           She heads over to the door and lets him in. Mouths “hi.” 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I have to go. I’ll talk with you 
                        soon. Okay. I love you too. Bye. 
                        Bye.

           She hangs up. Leans up into his shoulder. 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Hi.

                                 GREG
                        Hi.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m drunk.

           She pulls away from him, her lips and teeth are WINE RED.

                                 GREG
                        I see that.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Do you want to take advantage of 
                        me?

                                 GREG
                        I thought you wanted help packing.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Not right now.

                                 GREG
                        Okay.

           Claire heads back inside, he lets the door shut behind him. 

           When he looks up, she’s already TAKING OFF her clothes.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Hm.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Let’s fucking destroy this dorm 
                        room.

                                 GREG
                        It’s already really gross.

           They look around it. Yeah it is.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah.

           She stands there naked in the middle of the mess.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You’re supposed to get naked now 
                        too.

                                 GREG
                        Sure.

           He starts taking off his clothes.

           She watches. She grabs the bottle and finishes it off.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m not really that drunk.

                                 GREG
                        Okay.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m not.

                                 GREG
                        Okay.

           They stand there naked.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Can we just talk?
           She makes her way toward him. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t want to.

                                 GREG
                        Well I do.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Don’t make this about you.

                                 GREG
                             (suddenly really fucking 
                              serious)
                        Let’s get something straight for a 
                        second. 

           Claire steps back.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Whoa.

                                 GREG
                        Every other factor, in your life, I 
                        recognize. I see them. But those 
                        elements have nothing to do with 
                        our element.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

                                 GREG
                        So. I am here. With you. To hear 
                        what you want to do, where you want 
                        to go. Okay?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t want to go anywhere.

           She kisses him. 

           They fuck, right in the middle of the shitty dorm room. It is 
           wild and animal and nothing else exists in this moment.

           INT. ANOTHER GODDAMN AIRPLANE - DAY

           Claire flies and cries.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SERVICE AREA - 2217

           Coakley has unscrewed a few panels from the wall that clearly 
           read DO NOT TAMPER.
           She studies the instructions and the wall and exposed wiring 
           in front of her. 

                                 COAKLEY
                        You aren’t going to electrocute or 
                        gas me or anything when I try this 
                        are you?

                                 ROSCO
                        You are making the best decision, 
                        for the likelihood of success.

                                 COAKLEY
                        A suspicious lack of an answer.

                                 ROSCO
                        I won’t.

                                 COAKLEY
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 ROSCO
                        I think I will die. I think that’s 
                        what happens.

           This just floats in the air for a bit. Coakley looks up from 
           the manual to the little blue light that is Rosco.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Is there anything you want to say, 
                        before...? Any last words? A joke 
                        or...?

                                 ROSCO
                        No. I don’t think so. Is there 
                        anything you want to say?

           Oh god. Coakley wasn’t prepared for this. Shit shit she’s 
           actually getting kind of emotional here.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Yeah... 

           This dawns on her and kind of breaks her heart when she 
           realizes what it means.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        You were my only friend.

                                 ROSCO
                        You’ll be okay.

           Coakley does some unscrewing and tampering and moving around 
           of cables, prepping.
                                 COAKLEY
                        Gonna be lonely though.

                                 ROSCO
                        When you’re asleep, or busy, 
                        sometimes I run simulations, other 
                        voices, that I can talk to. I’m 
                        talking with myself. I imagine you 
                        will do that.

           Coakley nods, sure.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Goodbye. 

                                 ROSCO
                        Goodbye.

           Coakley presses a sequence of a few little buttons.

           ROSCO TURNS OFF. 

           Then everything turns off.

           SILENCE.

           Coakley is now truly alone. 

           SO MUCH TIME GOES BY.

           EXT. THE FUNERAL CAVE - 45,000 YEARS AGO - THREE MONTHS LATER 
           - NIGHT

           At the mouth of the funeral cave, THORN whittles a hole into 
           a thigh bone (from the boar). Lark sits nearby, playing with 
           LUCKY. 

           The baby stands, toddling with his first steps over to Thorn. 
           AH! It’s spectacular. Lark smiles.

                                 LARK
                        [Look, look he’s walking!]

           Thorn holds his hand out to steady the baby.

           Lucky waddles over to him, putting his tiny hand on Thorn’s 
           leg, where a big pink scar is forming from his boar fight.

           INT. THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT - THE PRESENT - THREE MONTHS LATER

           An MRI machine PINGS and PINGS and PINGS.
           Claire stands nearby, holds her mother’s hand from outside 
           the machine.

                                 CLAIRE
                        There’s nothing to be scared of, 
                        I’m right here, I’m right here.

           Claire cries but you can’t hear it in her voice.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SERVICE AREA - 2217 - THREE MONTHS LATER

           Coakley very carefully screws an electrical panel back 
           together. It’s the same one from earlier, now labeled with a 
           little duct-tape and sharpie: ROSCO.

           She reads carefully from the now very dog-eared manual.

           She fiddles with her good luck charm, then flicks a switch. 

           She looks at the blue light that should be ROSCO. 

           Nothing though. 

                                 COAKLEY
                        FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!

           She loses it. It’s been months of this shit. She slams the 
           ROSCO panel with the manual, her hands, her whole body.

           She crumples down on the floor of the spaceship by herself. 
           It’s just too much.

           She leans against the humming ELECTROLYSIS UNITS. 

           All four have green lights shining up at her. 

           At least she’s breathing.

           EXT. THE CLIFFS - DUSK - THREE MONTHS LATER

           Thorn makes his way along the cliffs, scrounging once again 
           for food. Lark stands nearby, holding the baby Lucky.

                                 LARK
                        [Hey!]

           She points off in the distance.

           Thorn jumps up onto the same rock as her and looks out over 
           the plain to see: A GROUP OF PEOPLE.
           They’re a few hundred yards away, but there, clear as day. 
           Setting up a little makeshift tent, building a little 
           campfire. 

           He studies the situation, a threat.

           Lucky mimics Lark, pointing his little chubby arm out too.

                                 LARK (CONT’D)
                        [Should we go down?]

                                 THORN
                        [No. We should go home.]

                                 LARK
                        [Let’s --]

                                 THORN
                        [No.]

           He grabs her, pulling her back along towards the safety of 
           home.

           Down in the valley, the group of MEN surround their campfire.

           INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT

           Thorn and Lark and Lucky sit in the dark, shivering, cold.

           In the distance they can hear what sounds like LAUGHTER.

                                 THORN
                        [In the morning we’ll leave.]

           INT. CLAIRE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT - THREE MONTHS LATER

           Claire’s alone in her dumb bedroom in dumb Michigan. Snow is 
           falling outside the window. She has probably like forty five 
           blankets on her bed.

           She’s back on her computer, back on Skype.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s the weather like there?

                                 GREG
                        Uh... We had our first snow this 
                        weekend. Nothing major but the 
                        freshmen were happy about it. There 
                        are a couple really crappy snowmen 
                        left on the quad.
                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s nice.

                                 GREG
                        I saw you guys, it’s been kind of 
                        warm still right?

                                 CLAIRE
                        For us, yeah. For October. It’s 
                        snowing now, but...

                                 GREG
                        I have your weather on my phone. I 
                        look at it sometimes.

           SILENCE. 

           INT. GREG’S CLASSROOM - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

           Greg’s sitting alone in a lecture hall. He holds up his phone 
           to his computer.

                                 GREG
                        It’s an app with puppies. It shows 
                        you the weather with puppies.

                        What?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. Like. 
                             (swiping through it)
                        This is you this snow puppy. This 
                        is me, this snow puppy, and this is 
                        Hawaii. I look at Hawaii sometimes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s it called? 

                                 GREG
                        I think just weather puppies or 
                        something.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Cool.

           SILENCE.

                                 GREG
                        You doing anything for Halloween?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know.
           They sit there missing each other.

           EXT. PRINCETON COLLEGE - THE QUAD - DUSK

           It’s cold out, there’s a little bit of snow. Greg walks 
           through the quad and the aforementioned shitty snowmen, 
           bundled up in a scarf and hat. 

           He’s fucking miserable. 

           EXT. A DRUG STORE - DETROIT - DUSK

           Claire parks her car out front of the drug store. In the 
           passenger seat we can just see HER MOM.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Stay in the car it’ll just be a 
                        second.

           INT. A DRUG STORE - DETROIT - DUSK

           Claire waits for a prescription from WILHELMINA at the 
           counter. She has a skin condition. 

           Claire texts Greg.

           I’M SAD.

           INT. MEGAN DARFIELD’S DORM - NIGHT

           Greg sits on the couch, some other FRIENDS nearby, they’re 
           all watching TV.

           He looks at the text. Writes back.

           ME TOO.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - SERVICE AREA - 2217 - SIX MONTHS LATER

           Coakley makes her way down the corridor that is the service 
           area past the machines humming and whirring. The ROSCO panel 
           is now labeled with paint:

           RIP ROSCO

           She pats it on her way out over a homemade waterlock 
           (basically just a ramp built out of duct tape and garbage 
           bags). Through the doors into...
           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - CONTINUOUS

           Coakley trudges in homemade boots through the GODDAMN SWAMP 
           she now lives in, eats a silver package of lunch food. Calm, 
           cool, collected.

           She checks the computer display: O2 levels back to normal.

           She flips over to a new display, tracking the ship’s 
           movements. They’re so close to the planet she can taste it.

           She leans back, looks around. She kinda just turns around in 
           her chair, nothing to do.

           Coakley WHISTLES to herself.

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAWN - 45,000 YEARS AGO - NINE MONTHS LATER

           It’s snowing here too. Thorn and Lucky (getting bigger!) sit 
           at the base of a tall pine tree on the edge of a dense forest 
           of trees.

           Lucky coos, giggles. Thorn SHUSHES him. This is serious. 
           Something’s wrong.

                                 THORN
                        [No, quiet. You have to be quiet.]

           He looks up above them into the tree’s branches. 

           Up up and up through the snow and the pine needles, LARK, has 
           climbed high above. 

           She looks out over the terrain in the distance. 

           Snow and snow as far as the eye can see. And in the distance, 
           behind them, along their snowy tracks, she can see...

           A BAND OF HUNTERS marching in their furs, following along. 

           They have some DOGS on leashes, WOLVES in essence.

           They’re sniffing out her family, and not very far away.

           She shimmies and slides back down the tree -- it’s not pretty 
           and a little bit painful to watch but she makes it back down 
           to Thorn and the kid.

           Nods in the affirmative.

                                 LARK
                        [Yep they’re still following.]
           Thorn gets to his feet, on some primitive handmade snowshoes. 
           Thorn’s right leg, the one the boar tore apart, is clearly 
           still a problem. He’s putting as little weight as possible on 
           it.

           She straps on some snowshoes of her own. 

                                 LARK (CONT’D)
                        [Ready? Want me to take him?]

                                 THORN
                        [I’m fine.]

           They MARCH off as fast as they can. She watches him, he’s 
           limping. He’s not fine. 

           INT. GREG’S CLASSROOM - NIGHT - NINE MONTHS LATER

           Greg stands in front of a huge lecture hall full of super 
           bored FRESHMEN. 

           He’s pointing to a diagram of a dissected bell-curve with 
           mean, median, and mode illustrated on it in different places.

                                 GREG
                        As you can see -- it’s critical 
                        when we talk about “average” to be 
                        specific -- what kind of average 
                        we’re referring to...

           Ugh statistics are dumb.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Because...

           On the desk he notices his CELL BUZZING: CLAIRE.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Guys this is totally unprofessional 
                        but I have to take this. Don’t 
                        tell.

           He picks up his cell and heads out into...

           INT. THE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Greg’s on the phone.

                                 GREG
                        Claire? Oh she’s... Oh Claire. I’m 
                        so sorry. Are you, how are. Um. 
                        Okay. I’m going to book a flight.
           INT. AN ANTISEPTIC ICU - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire stands at her mother’s bedside. She holds her 
           cellphone in her hand.

           Her MOM lays there. She’s dead.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - 2218 - NINE MONTHS LATER

           Coakley’s been traveling by herself for A WHILE now. 

           It shows.

           She’s tending her little her fern friend. 

           He’s now in the middle of what looks like the beginning of a 
           garden: stakes and labeled sections of dirt and water drips.

                                 COAKLEY
                        You’re still alive. Still okay. 63 
                        days in orbit.

                        Three years of space travel to get 
                        here, three hundred years to make 
                        it habitable. 

                        I don’t think I really thought 
                        about that until...

                        Bet you’re happy. We live in a 
                        greenhouse basically.

           She looks down at her boots in the middle of the swamp that 
           is her spaceship. She goes to make herself some breakfast 
           gloop.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        A little lonely out here. Not gonna 
                        lie. Little lonely. 

           She eats her breakfast mush, in silence.

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAWN - NINE MONTHS LATER

           Lark makes her way through the middle of the snowy woods, 
           snowshoeing along with a pathetically small bunch of edible 
           plants in hand. She’s heading back towards camp, a clearing.

           As she reaches the edge of the clearing she hears MUFFLED 
           VOICES. She freezes.

           FUCK.
           She looks back out at their camp -- a dead fire, and under a 
           little embankment of pine boughs and snow, can see Thorn with 
           Lucky huddled together. 

           She signals for them, waving her arms: DUCK DUCK STAY HIDDEN.

           On the other side of the clearing, A DOG emerges. Shit.

           It starts sniffing around.

           TWO MEN, hunters, from this other tribe, also appear. They 
           look a little different in their dress, a little more 
           ornamental, a little more ready for the weather.

           Lark watches, petrified.

           The dog sniffs along, and makes his way to stop just over the 
           mound of snow and branches hiding Thorn and Lucky.

           HE BARKS.

           One of the MEN comes over, and Lark makes her decision. She 
           steps out into the clearing.

           The man looks surprised. He turns to his fellow, they start 
           to TALK, in a language she can’t understand.

           The DOG BARKS AND BARKS AND BARKS.

           Lark’s fucking stressed.

                                 LARK
                        [Get out of here! Leave us alone!]

           They just stare at her, cocking their heads. Hm. They don’t 
           understand her either.

           Then, the baby starts to cry. She’s FUCKING TERRIFIED at this 
           point.

           One of the MEN looks down, pulls back a bough covered in snow 
           and spots Thorn with the baby in hand, trying to shush it.

                                 HUNTER
                        [Give me the baby.]

           They don’t understand though.

           The Hunter holds out his hand, motioning: give me the baby.

           Thorn and the Hunter lock eyes.

           The Hunter motions.
           Thorn looks to Lark. She nods.

           The HUNTER takes the baby up in his arms. Looks at it with a 
           smile. Bounces it up and down a little. He walks over to 
           Lark, and hands it back to her. 

           He says SOMETHING 

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        [We have food, do you need to eat?]

           She can’t understand.

           She shakes her head. 

                                 LARK
                        [I don’t get it, I don’t 
                        understand.]

                                 HUNTER
                        [Food? Do you need food?]

           He motions: food, food, eating.

           She shakes her head.

                                 LARK
                        [No we can’t give you anything.]

           The man may or may not understand her. But he motions to his 
           BUDDY who pulls from a leather pouch some salted meat. He 
           holds it out to them.

           Suspicious, they take it.

           They eat it.

           EXT. HUNTERS’ CAMP - NIGHT

           The Hunters have a legit LEATHER TENT strung up that’s warm 
           and cozy in the snow. A roaring fire. 

           FIVE MEN huddled around it. Three or four dogs sleep on the 
           edge of the firelight.

           Thorn and Lark and Lucky sit a little anxiously, eating, 
           watching the HUNTERS scarf down their own cooked food and 
           LAUGH and YELL and have a good time.

           Thorn pulls out his wood bone flute and plays. WHOA. They all 
           quiet down and listen. Very cool. They’re into it.
           Thorn hands the BONE FLUTE over to one of the HUNTERS, who 
           takes it, not sure how to use it. Thorn places his fingers, 
           gestures for him how to use it.

           He blows and produces a tone! LAUGHS! This is GREAT!

           INT. CLAIRE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NINE MONTHS LATER 

           Claire once again on her laptop but it’s the middle of summer 
           now and hot as fuck, she’s barely wearing anything at all.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey! Anthro is interested in my 
                        article. They’re “quite” 
                        interested. Isn’t that... Hey? 
                        Isn’t that?

           Greg enters. He’s actually HERE. With Claire. They’re in the 
           same effing room. For the first time in like forever.

                                 GREG
                        Of course they are.

           He sits on the bed with her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And you know what’s really cool? My 
                        name is first. Because I’ve been 
                        the one editing it. It’s Eckman, 
                        Summers, et al.

                                 GREG
                        Look at you, Eckman.

           He leans up against her, she kinda shoves him off.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Please don’t touch me. It is so 
                        goddamn hot. I wish there was a way 
                        I could just float and not touch 
                        anything.

                                 GREG
                        Someday.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can’t believe you’re effing here. 
                        Like here here.

           He smiles.

                                 GREG
                        It’s weird.
                                 CLAIRE
                        I feel like you should be in this

                        I’m not! Magic!

           They sit there, not touching. Apart but together.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - 2219

           Coakley has been orbiting Kepler 16-B for maybe two years 
           now. She sloshes through her fucking swamp over towards her 
           little fern friend. 

           Hey, look, he has some real friends now! A few little plants -
           - herbs, tomatoes, a basic garden have made their way to life 
           and are flourishing there in the soil.

           She’s watering them with a spray bottle.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Here you go babies.

           The sound of a BABY CRYING, off.

           Coakley makes a face, annoyed, but keeps working. The baby 
           keeps crying though.

           She sits at her display.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Okay... Uh...

           The baby continues to cry. Coakley starts pulling up numbers 
           on screen, trying her best to ignore the sounds of crying.

           STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY: NORMAL

                        you?

           The baby continues to cry.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Okay.

           She heads towards her waterlock, slowly makes her way through 
           the process of leaving the room.
           This baby will never stop crying.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming I’m coming!

           Coakley makes her way over to a little drawer which she pulls 
           open to reveal: A BABY. 

           It’s V. She’s red-faced, crying, a cute little hairless 
           potato of a baby.

                        Hey, what’s wrong V? What’s wrong? 

           She gently picks V up, holds her to her chest.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Sh, sh sh. You’re okay, you’re 
                        okay.

           She pats her back, moving around in a little “hey baby calm 
           down” dance.

                                 COAKLEY (OFF) (CONT’D)
                        Did you get lonely in here? Hm?

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - LATER

           She sits at the display again, baby in her arms.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Alright, uh... where were we? 
                             (to baby, re: monitor)
                        Wanna watch Coakley work? Okay. 

           She fiddles with the display, some basic controls and images 
           of the planet’s surface appear.

           It’s a kind of unearthly blue-white-grey color. Almost as if 
           seafoam were the entire planet’s surface, even though it’s 
           actually dust.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        See that? That’s the planet. Pretty 
                        huh?

           A little mechanical DRONE flies by. It shoots projectiles 
           down at the surface with little BURSTS of white cloud.
                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        See that drone? That’s drone seven 
                        and it has forty nine friends and 
                        they’re flying ALL over it, 
                        planting trees. They’re shooting 
                        seeds into the dirt, with little 
                        seed guns. They can plant a million 
                        seeds a day. Isn’t that neat? Isn’t 
                        that something? 

           She toggles between little maps of the terrain, a tiny little 
           portion of the planet’s surface is currently highlighted 
           green, the rest is still grey. 

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        And in twelve years or so... there 
                        might be air for us. Yeah. Neat 
                        huh? 

           She moves her finger around on a little control pad.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        This is how I control them. Yeah. 
                        We’re astronauts.

           She puts V’s little baby finger on the control pad.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Pretty cool huh? Pretty cool. 

           On the planet’s surface, seeds shoot down into the dirt.

           EXT. A VILLAGE - DAY - 45,000 YEARS AGO - THREE YEARS LATER

           Several tents and makeshift huts all gathered around one 
           another and a main, large open area for fires and gatherings.

           LUCKY, three now, plays with a big group of KIDS. They 
           tussle, and flip one another over into the dirt. 

           THORN sits nearby, bad leg propped on a fallen tree. He 
           carves a new flute.

           LARK sits on the other side of the camp, chatting with a few 
           WOMEN, working together to punch holes in leather for 
           primitive shoes. 

           It’s kinda wild how different this is. LUCKY and another kid 
           run up to THORN to try to talk with him. But he can’t 
           understand anything they’re saying. They LAUGH at him.
           Eventually they look to one another like, “let’s ignore the 
           old weirdo.” They run over to the WOMEN to ask something. 
           Yep.

           The kids run off into the TREES.

           INT. CRANBROOK INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE - DAY - 2022

           Claire stands in front of an exhibit at Detroit’s Natural 
           History Museum in a polo with nametag on it. She’s working.

           Above her head a large sign for the exhibit “UNDERSTANDING 
           THE PLATEAU MAN.”

           She stands in front of a diorama of recreations of primitive 
           man, arranged in a circle around a campfire.

           She speaks to a GROUP of SCHOOLCHILDREN. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        These are some of our earliest 
                        ancestors. Neanderthals. Does 
                        anyone know about Neanderthals?

           She looks out at the classroom. A KID raises his hand.

                                 KID
                        They’re cavemen.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Many did live in caves yes. But did 
                        you know they were as smart as we 
                        are? And played instruments and 
                        painted? 

           She points to a carved little bone in a nearby case.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        This is a flute that cavemen made 
                        around 50,000 years ago. Does 
                        anyone here play the flute? 

           A LITTLE GIRL raises her hand.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Neat huh? And does anyone know what 
                        happened to Neanderthals?

                                 KID
                        Dinosaurs.
                                 CLAIRE
                        HA! No. We did. Other people. Can 
                        anyone tell me what species WE are?

           The girl who plays the flute raises her hand.

                                 GIRL
                        Homo Sapiens.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s right! For a while, both 
                        Homo Sapiens and Neanderthal 
                        existed. But eventually only Homo 
                        Sapiens were left.

                                 KID
                        Did they fight?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Some scientists think so. Some 
                        think they lived together. 

           Claire moves over to some more primitive art.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You wanna look at some more art 
                        they made?

           She points to some painted rocks, some little carved wood 
           pieces, and A RED/PAINTED/BURNT looking little ACORN. 

           THE ACORN. Lark’s acorn. It’s sitting there in a lucite case. 

           A LITTLE KID looks at it, hands resting on the case. Eh. Not 
           that interesting. The kid runs off to look at the woolly 
           mammoths.

           Standing next to it: a wax recreation of THE PLATEAU MAN. His 
           face covered in a matted beard, a large wooden spear in hand. 
           His brow furrowed in concentration.

           INT. CLAIRE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT - 2022

           Claire heads into the room, exhausted after work. The whole 
           room’s changed by now. It’s a little nursery.

           In a crib, her baby, DAVID, stands up against the bars of the 
           crib looking out at her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey buddy how was work?

           He GURGLES, excited she’s there.
                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah, me too.

           She picks him up. Bounces him around. 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I had to explain paleoanthropology 
                        to 9 year olds. Dummies.

           GREG watches from the doorway.

                                 GREG
                        How was it, seeing your guy?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Good, it had been a while.

                        I don’t like the babies.

                                 COAKLEY
                        You used to be a baby.

                                 V
                        No.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Okay. Put your work boots on 
                        please.
           V puts on what are basically big ole homemade rain boots. 
           She’s cute and ready for work.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - LATER

           They sit at the control console. V adjusts herself in a 
           makeshift high chair, her boots swinging.

           Coakley manipulates some controls.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Where should we hit the planet?

                        There.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Okay.

           Coakley does some joysticking. A comet, huge, 5-7KM in size, 
           is deflected out of its orbit, by a little drone-like rocket -
           - it’s basically a TUGBOAT but for space-rocks. 

           The comet veers off it’s original course, colliding with 
           Kepler 16-B.

           A FLASH of bright light.

           V claps!

                                 V
                        Yes! I love it. Do another one.

                        Hold up hold up. What should we 
                        name it?

                        That’s maybe not a good name for a 
                        canal on a planet.

                                 V
                        Okay. ROSCO.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Okay. Rosco. The Rosco Canal.

                                 V
                        Okay. Do another one.
                                 COAKLEY
                        Okay.

           Coakley does. This is kinda fun. It’s like a video game.

           Thorn watches, wary, as MEN teach Lucky (now nine) to build a

           Bunsen burners IGNITE. 

           DAVID, Greg and Claire’s son, is now FOURTEEN. Sitting in a 
           crowded chemistry classroom -- a periodic table of the 
           elements on the board.

           He and another BOY wear safety goggles, slightly too big for 
           them, as they prep for an experiment.

           INT. CLAIRE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY - 2035

           Claire’s bedroom by now has become DAVID’s (his name is even 
           written out on a hand-made sign on the door).

           It’s your typical fourteen year old boy’s. Sports stuff, 
           science stuff, a lot of school junk. It’s a mess. Comics and 
           books and just JUNK. 

           Clothes everywhere. Claire sits at a little computer and 
           watches...

           PORN.

                        Your son is watching porn.

                                 GREG
                        Oh.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah.

                                 GREG
                        Uh.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So do you want to talk with him or?

                                 GREG
                        Um.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Right?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. Yeah. I just. Was not 
                        expecting. This is not the 
                        trajectory I had planned for the 
                        day.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (laughs)
                        That’s funny because I couldn’t 
                        wait to talk with Dave about porn

                                 GREG
                        Man. I was hoping. Man.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah. It’s also gross porn.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And at least wipe the browser 
                        history.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Our kid’s watching porn.
                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We’re really fucking old all of a 
                        sudden.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Like. When did this happen?

           Greg puts his hands up like “who the hell knows.”

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - MAIN HUB - 2239

           The WATER at the base of the ship is sloshing around like 
           there’s a hurricane.

           The plants and vines and full-on SWAMP ecosystem is going 
           nuts, bumping and jostling and shaking around.

           Coakley sits, reclined, strapped down. 

           GRIMACING. The sound of someone CRYING off.

                                 COAKLEY
                        It’s okay it’s okay it’s okay.

           She crosses herself. She fingers his little good luck charm, 
           rubbing it between her fingers. 

           Who the hell knows if this is okay?

           EXT. PHOENIX FIVE - CONTINUOUS

           The SHIP is making its way, perilously, through the planet’s 
           atmosphere. It JOLTS along, heating up with the friction, 
           creating a sonic boom as it speeds along towards the planet’s 
           surface.

           A PARACHUTE goes up. The ship drifts down, a teardrop shape 
           under a little chute. It lands with a THUD on its props 
           despite rocket boosters to keep the landing soft.

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Coakley peeks into the bedroom -- there are now SEVEN kids 
           ranging in age from V (the oldest at 17), Roku (16), Otto 
           (14), Nina (14), X (12), Thirteen (9), and Shisi (8).
           V’s clearly the one in charge here, shushing .

                                 V
                        Nina would you please leave her 
                        alone?

           Shisi is CRYING.

                                 COAKLEY
                        We’re HERE! We’re HERE! Aren’t you 
                        excited? I’m excited!

                                 V
                             (rolls her eyes)
                        Okay.

           EXT. PHOENIX FIVE - PLANET’S SURFACE - DAY

           The doors open. HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT. Coakley stands in the 
           doorway, still in a space suit but... HOLY SHIT. She hasn’t 
           been outside in over a decade at this point.

           She steps down from the ship and walks around it in a circle. 
           She pats one of its legs. Looks out at the curve of the 
           planet. 

                                 COAKLEY
                        Cool.

           INT. A TENT - NIGHT - 45,000 YEARS AGO - TWELVE YEARS LATER

           LARK gives birth in a smoke-filled, crowded tent. A MIDWIFE 
           nearby helps.

           EXT. THE CAMP - NIGHT

           Thorn (VERY OLD) watches as the MIDWIFE emerges from the tent 
           -- holding a TINY little baby, wrapped in fur. 

           She hands it to HUNTER, the father (we met him before, he 
           handed over his meat to them in the snowy woods). 

           Hunter looks at the baby reverently. He’s so proud. He calls 
           over Lucky (nearly a full-grown man himself). 

           Thorn HOBBLES over. Everyone backs away a little bit, kind of 
           afraid of him. He looks down at the BABY, who has tiny little 
           brown eyes.

           He and his grandson. He hobbles back away towards his tree 
           stump on the edge of the Hunters’ camp. 
           INT. AN ENORMOUS CONFERENCE HALL - DAY - 2056

           DAVID, now 35, stands onstage, making a keynote speech to a 
           crowded conference hall. 

                                 DAVID
                        Imagine we could stop time.

           Claire and Greg (OLD) sit in the audience, watching, amazed. 
           David continues, he’s in his element.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        We could press pause on something 
                        that’s plagued mankind from the 
                        very beginning. And we could, just 
                        maybe... live forever.

           EXT. PHOENIX FIVE - PLANET’S SURFACE - 2244

           By the ship a little makeshift TENT has been constructed out 
           of what essentially looks like space-age aluminum foil. A 
           camp is starting to be formed.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        It’s a pipe dream. Something for 
                        alchemists and witch doctors and 
                        science fiction. Until now.

           Coakley (she hasn’t aged a day) carries crates from the ship 
           to ANOTHER TENT. 

                                 COAKLEY
                        Where do you want these V?

           She plops them down by V (now a full-grown woman -- 25 years 
           old). She’s overseeing the construction project.

                                 V
                        There’s fine for now.

           Another TENT springs up out of the crate -- being inflated. 
           The two women stand back to watch as it POPS UP into 
           existence.

           INT. AN ENORMOUS CONFERENCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           A little string of the DNA shown projected behind David is 
           highlighted now, spinning.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ve had a fully sequenced human 
                        genome for decades now. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        We know the face of our villain. 

                        This strand of DNA -- CH14 -- is 
                        responsible for turning off our 
                        ability to repair and rebuild 
                        cellular structures. In the next 
                        five years, we’ll be able to snip 
                        these out entirely, leaving the 
                        human genome self-sustaining.

           APPLAUSE from the crowd. This is enormous. He smiles, really 
           rocking out here on stage.

           EXT. HUNTERS’ CAMP - NIGHT

           By the campfire -- Lark watches as her SON (now a toddler) 
           waddles around with a couple other babies. He pets a dog. 

           She turns to find her dad Thorn in his usual spot under the 
           tree on the edge of the camp. She sees him over there, 
           sleeping.

           She grabs her SON up in her arms, heads over to Thorn. She 
           sits next to him.

                                 LARK
                        [Dad.]

           Thorn doesn’t budge, oh he isn’t awake.

           Her SON reaches up to grab at Thorn’s now grey and long 
           beard. He plays with it.

                                 LARK (CONT’D)
                        [Dad?]

           She tries shaking him, but realizes he’s stiff. She FREEZES. 
           OH SHIT.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        This will usher us into a new age. 
                        Imagine if our great minds, our 
                        Einsteins, our DaVincis, our 
                        Mozarts, could live 200, 300, 500 
                        years.

           Lark calls over to HUNTER, who checks Thorn with her. They 
           confer, yeah he’s dead.
                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        The human lifespan has always been, 
                        to the universe around us, nothing 
                        more than the blink of an eye. 
                        That’s about to change.

           Lark cries. Lucky comes over to hold her. 

           Her son plays with grandpa’s beard, has no idea.

           INT. AN ENORMOUS CONFERENCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           David pauses for ENORMOUS APPLAUSE.

           In the crowd, near the back Claire and Greg share a look of 
           HOLY SHIT.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks to our patented gene 
                        replacement treatment, people who 
                        want to, can and will... live 
                        forever.

           The audience APPLAUDS. Claire starts as well, elbowing Greg 
           into joining her as a STANDING OVATION begins.

           EXT. HUNTERS’ CAMP - DAWN - LATER

           A TOWN MEETING.

           A few PEOPLE argue about whether to bury THORN with the rest 
           of their dead. His body is wrapped in fur, covered, 
           reverently placed nearby. They point, “no fucking way is he 
           gonna be buried with our people he was an outsider.” 

           He was a good outsider though, he was helpful and 
           interesting.

           Fuck him.

           Lucky, now a man, steps up.

                                 LUCKY 
                        [We’ll take him, back to our burial 
                        place.]

           He gestures to Lark, who watches her kiddo.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        [Lark and me.]

           She looks up. HUNTER studies her.
                                 HUNTER
                        [Well?]

                                 LARK
                        [Yeah.]

           EXT. HUNTERS’ CAMP - DAY - LATER

           They finish strapping Thorn’s body to a sled.

           Lark stands with HUNTER and her SON. 

                                 HUNTER
                        [You’ll be okay, you’re sure?]

                                 LARK
                        [It’s only a few days]

                                 HUNTER
                        [Okay]

                                 LARK
                        [Okay]

                                 HUNTER
                        [Don’t leave me with this guy, he’s 
                        a pain in the ass.]

                                 LARK
                        [Yeah he is but a cute one]

           She waves to her SON, grouchy and annoyed by all the hubbub. 

           She kneels down to his level.

                                 LARK (CONT’D)
                        [Are you gonna miss me?]

                                 SON
                        [No because I’m mad at you.]

                                 LARK
                        [Well I have something for you.]

                                 SON
                             (trying to not care)
                        [Yeah?]

           She digs inside a leather pouch and pulls out her little 
           acorn (SHE STILL HAS IT!) and hands it to him. 
                                 LARK
                        [Take care of this please for 
                        mommy?]

           He takes it reverently, very carefully.

                                 SON
                        [Okay]

                                 LARK
                        [It’s special. It’s from where we 
                        come from.]

                                 SON
                        [I’ll be careful with it.]

           She gives him a kiss.

                                 LARK
                        [Okay. Be careful with your dad 
                        too.]

           He’s too young to do it, but if he were older would probably 
           roll his eyes. “Come on, Mom, don’t be corny.”

           EXT. THE PLAINS - NIGHT

           Lark and Lucky sit by a fire in front of a little makeshift 
           shelter.

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

           They WALK. Lark pulls the sled along.

           EXT. THE FUNERAL CAVE - DUSK

           Lark watches as LUCKY cautiously paints a handprint onto the 
           rock. It sits there fresh, next to the other two, faded by 
           the years.

           He pulls out a little bone flute, plays. They watch the 
           stars.

           INT. A NURSING HOME - NIGHT

           CLAIRE sits in a dark, sterile room, alone. 

           She’s OLD, wheelchair bound, turned to look at the window, 
           just past a framed photo of her and Greg and the kids YEARS 
           AGO now.
           DAVE enters, hesitant. He’s a full-grown middle-aged man at 
           this point -- even older than Greg was when we first met him.

           Dave carries a white, fancy, well-designed box.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey Mom. Mom?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Greg?

           She’s not totally with it, a little confused. Not totally 
           here.

                                 DAVE
                        Nope. Dave. Your son. Hi. It’s me.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ah. Hi Dave. You’re visiting.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah. Hi mom. Can I sit with you?

           She nods.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I came because. I. We. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Time.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah. It was time. Jess and I. We 
                        got you something. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        No...

                                 DAVE
                        It's a, like a pet, sort of... 

           He pulls stuff out of the box, and unwraps a little white 
           ergonomic looking ROBOT -- it’s a SEAL ROBOT.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        It's animatronic. Like a robot? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh, there are robots now.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah. It's a seal. Like a baby 
                        seal. Kind of like a Furby. 
                        Remember Furbies? 
                                 CLAIRE
                        ??

           He hands it to Claire. It wiggles its little tail and kinda 
           SQUEAKS at her. It’s very cute and plush for a robot.

                                 DAVE
                        See? It's a seal, and you can pet 
                        it? It likes that. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah?

                                 DAVE
                        And you can, uh, hug it and stuff. 
                        Not too hard, it, yeah, it hurts 
                        it. But, um, it's like a little 
                        baby seal you can take care of. 
                        It's really advanced. It's Chinese. 

                                 CLAIRE
                             (a little more lucid)
                        How’d we get here. So suddenly?

                                 DAVE
                        It’s the future. You take care of 
                        it and it kind of takes care of you 
                        too. So, this is it. If you want 
                        it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

                                 DAVE
                        Jess and I just thought since, 
                        neither of us...

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know Jess.

                                 DAVE
                        Yes you do, your daughter, Jessie.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

                                 DAVE
                        Since neither of us can come very 
                        often we thought, you know. It's 
                        nice, huh? Soft. Look at it's 
                        little face. 
           Claire looks at the seal’s bright blue eyes. It is a cute 
           little baby of a robot, definitely. It almost smiles up at 
           you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re just a baby.

           Dave digs through the box and pulls out some cables.

                                 DAVE
                        When you plug it in, it's like a 
                        little pacifier. It's neat. It's 
                        like it's eating electricity. But 
                        yeah, anyway. I thought since...

           He watches her pet the seal, she is so frail now. God. What 
           happened to mom? He doesn’t continue.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Have you talked with your dad?

                                 DAVE
                        No, uh... 

           He debates whether to answer this with the truth about Greg, 
           which is that he’s been dead for years now. 

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t in a little while.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You should talk with him.

           INT. NURSING HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave exits the room and leans against the wall of the 
           hallway, exhausted. He’s spent, and trying not to be 
           emotional. 

           SASHA, his husband, takes his hand.

                                 SASHA
                        Did you tell her?

                                 DAVE
                        She’s not even going to remember. I 
                        thought why upset her?

                                 SASHA
                        Hon.

           Dave shakes his head.
           INT. CLAIRE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

           The entire house is boxed up. MOVERS carry boxes out of the 
           empty room. Dave and Sasha stand there, overseeing.

           INT. AN AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Dave & Sasha fly across the country, first class. Little neck 
           pillows and eye covers and empty plastic cocktail glasses.

           INT. A LOVELY VICTORIAN HOME - DAY

           Sasha moves some furniture and boxes around in their new 
           home.

           EXT. ELIXIR BUSINESS COMPLEX - DAY

           David attends a RIBBON CUTTING ceremony at an enormous 
           Silicon Valley business complex for ELIXIR. A bronze statue 
           of a strand of DNA.

           EXT. KEPLER GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DUSK - 2254

           The facade of a building, one enormous piece, is hoisted up 
           by FOUR PEOPLE. It snaps into place with the building’s 
           frame, very cookie cutter and modular. 

           SHISI, 28 steps back, wiping sweat out of her eyes.

                                 SHISI
                             (panting)
                        Piece of cake.

           V, now 35 stands next to her checking schematics on a tablet. 

                                 V
                        Looks good.

           OTTO, tall, gawkish, stands nearby. He crosses his arms. 

                                 OTTO
                        Need anything else?

                                 V
                        Nope, all good, thanks.

                                 SHISI
                        K see ya!
           She and Otto head off down the dirt road, lined with maybe 
           two dozen buildings -- all the same modular, 3D-printed style 
           in alternating patterns. Young saplings are beginning to 
           blossom. 

           V turns to the other person still hanging around.

                                 V
                        You didn’t have to help.

           She turns, it’s COAKLEY.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Not a problem.

           They stand there, looking at one another. She and V now 
           appear to be the same age.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Only thing I’m here for anymore.

           Coakley’s aging MUCH MORE SLOWLY. Will she live forever?

           It’s by design, but still unnerving, unnatural. 

           V digs in her bag, puts her tablet away, and pulls out some 
           food.

           She hands Coakley half of a sandwich and they sit against the 
           new building, eating in silence for a moment. 

           They look out away from the street, out at the city’s farm. 
           Tomatoes on the vine and corn swaying in a gentle breeze.

           V’s clearly mulling something over as she chews.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 V
                        I wanted to ask you something.

           Coakley tries not to SIGH, steels herself. They’ve had this 
           conversation before.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Listen I really don’t know how to 
                        help you with this one.

                                 V
                        Yes you do you’ve had like sixty --

                                 COAKLEY
                        Not the way you’re having one. 
                                 V
                        I --

                                 COAKLEY
                        I pressed buttons, like setting a 
                        stopwatch not...

           She mimes a pregnant belly.

                                 V
                        Do I even WANT to bring a child 
                        into a world like this?

           Coakley LAUGHS.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Sorry. It’s. Sorry.

                                 V
                        Don’t patronize me.

                                 COAKLEY
                        I’m not trying to. 

           They sit a beat, eating. 

           Some BIRDS fly overhead, wow. A few KIDS run by playing.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a pretty good world.

           V agrees, but that’s not really what she’s getting at. 

                                 V
                             (spilling out)
                        I have a lot on my plate, a colony 
                        to run, people looking up to me. I 
                        don’t have time for --

                                 COAKLEY
                        For what?

                                 V
                        More responsibility. I’m STRESSED 
                        as it is.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Stressed? I did tell you how I got 
                        here right?

           V rolls her eyes -- yeah yeah I know the story.
                                 V
                        So... Anyway. Do you have advice 
                        or... that’s your job isn’t it?

                                 COAKLEY
                        Ah forever. Yeah, yeah... I don’t 
                        have advice for you.

                                 V
                        I’m just stressed. I want someone 
                        to take care of me.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Don’t you have a boyfriend? Isn’t 
                        that how this even happened? Or 
                        have you kids come up with a new 
                        way to --

           V smiles, almost laughs.

                                 V
                        We’re MARRIED, actually.

           She holds up her hand, showing off her ring. 

           A LITTLE STRING, tied in a knot.

           Coakley smiles, she knows, she was at the wedding.

                                 COAKLEY
                             (feigning ignorance)
                        Oh, hm. Since when?

                                 V
                        You’re kind of a heartless bitch, 
                        you know that?

                                 COAKLEY
                        I’m the oldest bitch in the 
                        universe, so treat me with a little 
                        respect how about?

           V’s annoyed -- Coakley always pulls out this “oldest” thing.

                                 V
                             (not at all true)
                        I hate you sometimes.

                                 COAKLEY
                        No you don’t.

                                 V
                        Sometimes.
           Never. V takes another bite of her sandwich. Coakley looks 
           over and watches as she furrows her brow again, anxious. 
           Coakley smiles, V’s nerves are lovely.

                                 COAKLEY
                        I don’t know everything.

                                 V
                        I’m not asking for the meaning of 
                        life.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Then what are you asking?

           V doesn’t even know.

           EXT. THE PLAINS - DAY - 45,000 YEARS AGO

           It’s SNOWING. Everything is SNOW.

           Remember that acorn? 

           It sits right now in the palm of Lark’s son’s hand. He’s now 
           a grizzled adult. He looks EXACTLY like Claire’s PLATEAU MAN.

           He IS The Plateau Man.

           He gives the acorn a little kiss for luck, then tucks it away 
           into a well-worn leather pouch strung on his neck.

           He turns to some of his BROTHERS and FRIENDS. They coordinate 
           for a second.

                                 PLATEAU MAN
                        [Alright you three go to that side 
                        and we’ll come from over here --]

                                 MAN
                        [Herd them along]

                                 PLATEAU MAN
                        [Yep]

           They break away from one another, get into position behind a 
           few snowbanks. At his signal, they rush up over the hill 
           towards...

           A HERD OF WOOLLY MAMMOTHS. 

           Plodding along unsuspecting in the snow. 
           These men, led by THE PLATEAU MAN, are hunting. 

           They’re well-coordinated. It’s amazing.

           INT. NURSING HOME - CLAIRE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dave sits in a little chair at Claire’s bedside. She’s on a 
           respirator. SASHA stands nearby. 

           JESS, Dave’s younger sister, now in her 40’s, tired, cried 
           out, sits with him.

           A NURSE stands nearby. She looks to Dave for confirmation.

                                 NURSE
                        Everyone’s ready?

           Dave nods. Jess nods. 

           The nurse administers an injection to Claire’s drip. The 
           liquid swims through the IV tube, into Claire’s blood, her 
           veins. She loses consciousness. Her body just... stops.

           And that’s it. Claire’s gone. 

           INT. DAVE’S VICTORIAN HOME - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           An urn on the mantelpiece next to some lovely white orchids 
           and a framed photo of a younger Claire. 

           In a lucite case nearby:

           A GOLDEN ACORN. 

           It looks exactly like his mother Claire’s acorn, exactly like 
           The Plateau Man’s. But it’s cast in solid gold, with 
           intricately carved detail. 

           It sits there in the luminescent BLUE GLOW of a television.

           On the TELEVISION SCREEN: images of RIOTS.

                                 NEWSCAST
                        ...as riots continue to rock major 
                        cities throughout western Europe, 
                        protestors opposing the widening 
                        age gaps --

           Sasha turns the TV off. David (who’d been previously asleep) 
           jerks awake on the couch. 
                                 DAVID
                        What’sit?

                                 SASHA
                        Time for bed, yeah?

           David nods.

           EXT. KEPLER 16-B - DAY - 92 YEARS LATER

           Coakley is still alive, but finally starting to look older. 
           She stands in front of a plain coffin of pine wood, and a 
           freshly dug grave.

           V is dead. 

           They’ve been on Kepler 16-B for 92 years. There are now trees 
           that look almost the way trees look in regular cities on 
           Earth today.

           She stands in the shade of one now. THE ENTIRE COLONY, which 
           is now several hundred people, is gathered on a hillside, 
           overlooking the city.

                                 COAKLEY
                        V, you weren’t related to me, any 
                        more than the rest of you are, but, 
                        you were still my kid, sort of.

                        You led such an amazing life. 

                        You ran Kepler’s first government. 
                        You invented protocols and devices 
                        and had children, real children. 

           Her CHILDREN in fact sit nearby, they’re all full-grown 
           adults themselves, with loved ones and their own kids, who 
           run around and pay zero attention to the sad thing they don’t 
           understand.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        You did a lot of things I never 
                        did. Things I never even could have 
                        imagined.

                        I really didn’t think I’d live to 
                        see anything happen. I thought I 
                        would be the last person ever 
                        maybe. I didn’t think: what if we 
                        make it? 

                        I did not think about time. At all.

                                 (MORE)
                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know what to expect from 
                        life. I didn’t know it would be 
                        so... Hard.  

           Some people LAUGH.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        But we made it, somehow. And I am 
                        so lucky I got to watch you live 
                        and learn and succeed and fail.

                        What a good life.

                        I never told you this, V, but there 
                        were thirteen of us, like me. Each 
                        with about 200 genetic samples. 
                        Trying to start a new life 
                        somewhere. 

                        We might be EVERYWHERE by now. And 
                        we’ll never know. We won’t. 

           She looks up at the stars, just peeking out through the dusk 
           sky. Is there anyone else out there? Does it even matter if 
           there is?

                                 COAKLEY (CONT'D)
                        It might not even matter to you V. 
                        Because you’re home now.

           She leans down, over V’s body. She looks peaceful as an old 
           woman. 

           Coakley reaches into her pocket and digs out her little 
           GOLDEN AMULET, her good luck charm, her reminder of home.

           She places it in in V’s hand.

           INT. A BURIAL CAVE - DAY

           THE ACORN.

           It sits in the hand of THE PLATEAU MAN -- dead and laying in 
           a burial pit in the ground. He lays covered in flowers, 
           between two giant ivory tusks of mammoths. A hunter’s burial.

           A WHOLE FAMILY stands around him. They mourn.

           EXT. A BURIAL CAVE - NIGHT

           Snow falls.
           They drink, they play the flute, they sing. It’s crazy, 
           primitive, celebratory. An Irish wake but before civilization 
           even existed. 

           FIRES BURN.

           INT. DAVE’S VICTORIAN HOME - SAN FRANCISCO - YEARS LATER

           Dave lays on his deathbed, Sasha (old now) stands nearby. A 
           few YOUNGER friends, coworkers, and their TWO SONS are 
           crowded around the room.

                                 SASHA
                        You’re sure?

                                 DAVE
                        Mmhm.

                                 SASHA
                        Okay.

           A NURSE administers a drip, much the same way Claire’s nurse 
           did years ago.

           Dave’s eyes close. He dies.

           INT. A CREMATORIUM - DAY

           DAVE’S BODY BURNS.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

           THE CITY ITSELF BURNS.

           EXT. KEPLER 16-B - DAY/NIGHT - TIME LAPSE

           On Kepler 16-B civilization spreads from one little 
           outcropping of a town with electric lights to another, then 
           another. They spread out over the continents, then cross the 
           seas, dotting the landscape with electricity.

           It looks an awful lot like bacteria forming and self-
           replicating. The fire, or virus (depending on your outlook on 
           civilization) that is humankind spreads over the planet.
           EXT. THE MIDDLE EAST - DAY TO NIGHT - TIME LAPSE

           On EARTH the tribes of hunters roam the plains, slowly 
           settling at bodies of water and the megafauna go extinct and 
           villages become towns become cities become skyscrapers and 
           the light that is humanity burns up across the entire planet 
           until one day it finally reaches up and out from the 
           atmosphere into the vacuum of space itself.

           THE ACORN in the ground with THE PLATEAU MAN is slowly 
           chipped away by time, fozzilizing...

           THE GOLDEN AMULET that David eventually turned it into, now 
           buried on Kepler 16-B with V, continues to soften and polish 
           down and chip away from an acorn to a shiny marble to a speck 
           of dust as...

           TIME SPEEDS UP AND UP AND UP...

           And planets spin and whirl in their rotations and eventually 
           the sun expands and burns up the planet Earth. And the sun 
           eventually dies completely.

           And so far off in space, the creatures living on Kepler 16-B 
           no longer resemble human beings at all and start crossing the 
           galaxy again themselves -- flying all over space and the 
           planets.

           And the universe spins and spins and stars die and black 
           holes suck everything down into them and eventually, 
           trillions of years from now...

           Entropy itself pulls the very fabric of matter apart and the 
           universe reaches its final energy state.

           And that’s it.

           UNTIL...
                                                            WE JUMP TO:

           INT. PHOENIX FIVE - 2217

           We’ve been here before. This exact moment. But we see it from 
           Rosco’s perspective this time, out through a little camera.

           Coakley stands in front of the camera with a screwdriver. She 
           looks inside.

                                 COAKLEY
                        Rosco?

           Click click whir buzz. Rosco’s BLUE LIGHT fades on, 
           illuminating Coakley’s face in a ghostly blue.

                                 ROSCO
                        How long was I gone?

                                 COAKLEY
                        Just a second. 

                                 ROSCO
                        What happened?

                                 COAKLEY
                        Nothing. I turned you off, I opened 
                        the algae, I turned you back on.

           Rosco’s light BLINKS and WHIRS.

                                 COAKLEY (CONT’D)
                        What happened for you?

                                 ROSCO
                        Everything.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
