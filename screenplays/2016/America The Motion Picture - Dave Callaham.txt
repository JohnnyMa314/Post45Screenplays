           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           A FULL MOON hangs over the city that we know now as our 
           Capitol.  But on this night, 500 years ago, it is but a 
           sapling dreaming of growing to mighty heights: 

           A humble series of cobblestone streets winding through single-
           storey buildings.  ROPE BRIDGES connecting the numerous tree-
           top huts.  

           In the distance, the KING JAMES OBELISK glistens in the 
           moonlight.

           Off this peaceful snapshot of our country’s humble 
           beginnings, A SOARING ARIA carries us...

           INT. FORD’S THEATER - NIGHT

           An exquisite building, fit for a king.  Which, tonight, it 
           is: KING JAMES (60’s, bearded, horrible teeth, the King of 
           England) sits in the theater’s most ornate private box, 
           enjoying an evening at the opera.

           But our story does not begin with King James.  Rather, it 
           begins with the THREE YOUNG MEN sitting in a box nearby: 

           GEORGE WASHINGTON.  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.  JOHN ADAMS.  

           Washington (Early 20’s, heart-stopping good looks, muscles 
           forged of iron) leans over to Lincoln (same with a chinstrap 
           beard and a big hat), whispers:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I should say, that Martha Dandridge 
                        has the voice of an angel!

                                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN
                            (breathless)
                        And juggalos to match!

           Washington laughs heartily, leans backward to address Adams 
           (unemotive, bleeding from the hairline, shifty eyes).

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Adams.  How much do I owe you for 
                        the tickets?

           Adams stares straight ahead, blood trickling down the side of 
           his palid face.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Adams! 
           Slowly, Adams turns toward Washington.  His features remain 
           static.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        I say.  How much for the boffo 
                        tickets?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN ADAMS
                            (lips not moving, muffled)
                        Um.  About... fifty... quid.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Quid?  What’s a quid?

                                 JOHN ADAMS
                        Did I say quid?  I meant dollars.  

           Washington regards Adams with confusion for a moment.  He’s 
           about to respond, when, unexpectedly, ADAMS LEAPS TO HIS 
           FEET, TEARS HIS OWN FACE OFF.

                                 JOHN ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        Have at you!!!!!!

           Adams lunges toward Lincoln, biting the bearded man in the 
           jugular.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        My God, Adams!  What are you 
                        doing?!

           The assembled crowd turns toward the commotion as Adams 
           shakes Lincoln violently, finally tearing his victim’s throat 
           out.  Lincoln collapses to the floor, a FOUNTAIN OF BLOOD 
           jetting from his neck.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        John!  Why did you do that?!

           Adams grins, wipes the gore from his face.  Washington gasps 
           as he finds himself not looking at John Adams at all, but 
           BENEDICT FUCKING ARNOLD!

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Benedict Fucking Arnold!

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        Someday, Washington, you’ll have to 
                        draft a document that specifically 
                        outlines the punishment for what I 
                        just did!  But for now... I bid you 
                        adieu! 
           With that, Arnold JUMPS out of the box, landing on the stage 
           below before disappearing into the panicked crowd.  
           Washington watches him go, then looks down to his fallen 
           friend.  He drops to his knees, takes Lincoln’s bloodied face 
           in his hands.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Abe.  Can you hear me?  You’re 
                        going to be OK.  Clara Barton lives 
                        in my condo, she can fix you right 
                        up.  You hold on.

                                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN
                            (soft, pained)
                        George.  You must.  Free the 
                        colonies.    

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        We’ll do it together, Abe.

                                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN
                        No.  George.  Listen.  Free the 
                        colonies.  Found a new country.  
                        Name her...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Name her what, Abe?

                                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN
                            (whisper soft)
                        Name her... America.

           Lincoln’s eyes roll back, his head falling to the side.  
           Dead.  Washington hangs his head for a moment, given over to 
           the heart-wracking pain that envelops him... then he leans 
           his head back, calls to the Heavens:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        ABE!!!!!!!

           Slowly, galvanized, Washington stands.  He’s about to exit 
           the box when he catches sight of King James, watching and 
           grinning from his royal perch.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Was this your doing, James?!

                                 KING JAMES
                        You haven’t the manpower or the 
                        funds to overtake the British 
                        Empire, Washington.  Your twilight 
                        is upon you.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It’s always darkest before the 
                        dawn, James. 

                                 KING JAMES
                        That’s stupid.

           James motions for his head of security, JOSEPH STALIN, to 
           lead the way to the exit.  Washington can only watch him go.  

           INT. FORD’S THEATER - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Washington hurries into the hallway, pushes through the 
           throngs of rioting opera-goers.  Finds a pimple-faced usher 
           cowering against the wall.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You!  Usher!  Benedict Arnold!  
                        Which way did he go??

                                 USHER
                        He... he said that he’d kill me.  
                        If I revealed his escape.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Listen to me, son...

                                 USHER
                        Ulysses, sir.  Ulysses Grant.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        This is a crucial moment in your 
                        life, Ulysses Grant.  You are 
                        standing on the precipice of a new 
                        tomorrow.  A tomorrow that will see 
                        the birth of a new nation.  And you 
                        can be a part of that new nation, 
                        that new... America.  Or you can be 
                        left behind, relegated to the 
                        dustbin of history.  You decide.

           Grant considers long and hard, sweat pouring from his 
           teenaged face.

                                 ULYSSES GRANT
                        He took the back exit.  Onto James 
                        Street.

           Washington nods, clasps Grant by the shoulder.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I’ll see you in the history books, 
                        Ulysses Grant.
           Washington dashes away.  Grant remains, a new fire burning in 
           his eyes...

           EXT. FORD’S THEATER - NIGHT

           Washington exits the theater onto a sidestreet, away from the 
           crowds.  At the end of the street, Benedict Arnold can be 
           seen climbing into a HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Arnold!

           Arnold turns, gestures for four of his REDCOAT ACCOMPLICES to 
           stop Washington’s advance.

           The first two run directly at Washington, who sidesteps them 
           both easily.  Their knuckle-forward boxing stances are no 
           match for Washington’s highly polished JEET KUN-DO; he 
           dispatches them in seconds with a blinding series of kicks.

           The second pair of redcoats, having watched this martial 
           display, brandish SABRES.  They hurry towards their target...

           ... who activates the SLEEVE-CONCEALED MINI CHAINSAWS hidden 
           in his coat.  The tiny razor-sharp chains WHIR TO LIFE as 
           Washington runs BETWEEN the redcoats, chopping both of them 
           in half.  They fall to the ground in pieces, damned to a long 
           moment to comprehend their fates.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        The cherry tree didn’t chop itself 
                        down.

           The unmistakable sound of a CARRIAGE IN MOTION jars 
           Washington from his moment of self-satisfaction.  He turns...

           ... just as Arnold’s carriage rolls past, its diabolical 
           owner leaning out of the window and SLOW-CLAPPING.

           Infuriated, Washington takes up a BRISK JOG, just keeping 
           pace with the carriage as it winds through the city.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        An impressive display, Washington.  
                        But I’m afraid it will prove 
                        meaningless.  Your people will be 
                        crushed, once and for all.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (already winded)
                        They were your people too, Ben.
                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        I made an educated decision, 
                        George.  The writing’s on the wall.  
                        It’s not too late to join us.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (really winded)
                        I’ll never... 
                            (deep breath)
                        ... join the Brits.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        Suit yourself.  I just hope that 
                        you’re ready to die for this cause 
                        of yours.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (clutching side, wincing)
                        I... hey.  Can you... slow down...

           Arnold calls out to his driver.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        Juan Carlos!  Más despacio. I want 
                        to hear what this fool has to say.

           The carriage slows, allowing Washington to pace it at a brisk 
           walk.  He puts both hands behind his head, sucking wind.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD (CONT’D)
                        You were saying?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I was saying: I am.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        You are what.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I am ready to die for this cause of 
                        mine.
                            (off Arnold’s confusion)
                        You asked me if I was ready to die 
                        for this cause of mine.  
                            (more confusion)
                        Before I gassed out?

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        Oh, right.  OK.
                            (a beat as Arnold plays 
                             the conversation back in 
                             his head, catching up)
                        Good.  Because you’re going to.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I’m going to gas out?

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        What?  No.  You’re going to die for 
                        this cause of yours.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Oh.
                            (then)
                        No I’m not.  

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        I think you might.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I think I might not.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        You might not?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I will not.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        You said ‘might.’

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You said ‘might.’

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        I meant might.  Then you parroted 
                        me without considering the 
                        consequences, and now you’re paying 
                        the price.
                            (beat)
                        Just as you will if you continue to 
                        pursue this ‘revolution’ of yours.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I’ll never quit.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        Then you will die.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I doubt it.

                                 BENEDICT ARNOLD
                        I guess we’ll see.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I guess we will.
           Arnold gestures to his driver, who cracks the reins.  The 
           carriage disappears into the night, finally allowing 
           Washington a moment to double over, catch his breath...  

           ... and in doing so, he notices that Arnold has dropped 
           something in his haste: a HERRINGBONE SCARF.  Washington 
           retrieves it, clutches it in a tight fist, and looks up at 
           the King James Obelisk, the all-seeing monolith that casts a 
           shadow over the city.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                            (sotto)
                        I guess we will.

                        Close your eyes, give me your hand,

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - AFTERNOON

           MARTHA DANDRIDGE (Scarlett Johansson) stands beside a simple 
           wooden coffin, her heavenly voice soaring through the  
           TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR that soaks her heaving bosom.

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE
                            (singing)
                        Do you feel my heart beating -- do 
                        you understand?

           REVERSE ANGLE: Hundreds of gathered mourners bow their heads 
           as Abraham Lincoln’s widow, TRISHELLE, steps forward, drapes 
           a heavy quilt over her husband’s casket.  Rendered in faded 
           reds, whites and blues, the fabric bears a now familiar 
           motif: Thirteen STRIPES... an ass-ton of STARS...

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        Do you feel the same, or am I only 
                        dreaming?
           As Trishelle collapses to her knees in the foreground, we 
           RACK FOCUS to Washington, who stands front and center among 
           the mourners in the BG.  Off his granite countenance...

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        Is this burning an eternal flame?

                                                        MATCH FADE TO:

           LATER

           Washington stands beside the coffin, alone now.  The mourners 
           have retired, as has the sun.  But the storms -- in the air, 
           in his heart -- have not.  Will not.  Will never. 

           Washington reaches out, runs a hand along the faded quilt 
           that covers his friend’s pine box.  Martha appears at his 
           side.  He doesn’t look up.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        He sewed it by hand when Trishelle 
                        came down with Dengue Fever last 
                        May Day.  He laid it upon her, and 
                        she healed.  Now, she lays it upon 
                        him... but we will never heal.
                            (then, still not looking 
                             up)
                        You’re Martha Dandridge.  Your 
                        voice is the last thing that Abe 
                        ever heard.  If I’m to find solace 
                        in any of this madness, it is that.

           Martha nods slightly, moved.

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE
                        And you are George Washington.  
                        Inventor of peanut butter.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        The same.

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE
                        Abraham Lincoln’s best friend.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Forever.

           Martha lays a gentle hand upon Washington’s muscular 
           shoulder.
                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE
                        You’ve suffered a tremendous loss. 
                            (then, testing)
                        You should not be alone tonight.

           Finally, Washington looks up.  Locks eyes with Martha.  And 
           off the smouldering look shared between them...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO 
                                                             FUCKING.

           INT. WASHINGTON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Martha writhes atop Washington, naked and glistening.  After 
           a long, orgasmic moment, she sits upright, makes a funny face 
           like maybe she ate too many eggs at the funeral.  She puts a 
           hand to her belly...

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE
                        George.  We’ve conceived.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        What?  Just now?

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE
                            (nodding, moved)
                        Just now.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        But how can you --

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE
                        A woman knows, George.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Very well.  Then we must marry.  To 
                        make it right.

           Martha nods, and so George reaches over to the bedside table, 
           takes hold of a large CORNUCOPIA bearing corn, baby pumpkins, 
           and a bunch of loose cigarettes.  He holds it out to Martha 
           with two hands: an offering.  Martha bows her head, and again 
           with two hands, accepts the gift.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        It is done.

           EXT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - NIGHT

           Washington, swaddled in a bathrobe, sits out on his balcony, 
           lost in tobacco-fueled thought.  After a serene moment, 
           Martha joins him.  She is now VISIBLY PREGNANT.  George 
           courteously offers his new wife a cigarette, and together, 
           they smoke in comfortable silence.  Finally:
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Our child cannot grow up under 
                        British Rule, Martha.  Must not.  

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        Is there any other way?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Yes.  The American Way.

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        The people will support your 
                        revolution, George.  James is at 
                        his most unpopular.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        And yet his most powerful.
                            (then, thoughtful)
                        Abe and John were my best friends, 
                        yes... but they were also my 
                        partners in rebellion.  The other 
                        two legs, if you will, of a three-
                        legged table.  Remove two legs from 
                        such a table... 

           Washington trails off, overwhelmed.

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        Thomas Jefferson plays in my adult 
                        kickball league.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (suddenly inspired)
                        Thomas Jefferson the martial arts’ 
                        expert?

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        No, that’s Thomas Jeffersen with an 
                        ‘e.’  This is Thomas Jefferson with 
                        an ‘o.’  
                            (beat)
                        The demolitions expert.

           Better yet!  Washington stands, the fire in his belly 
           reignited.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Arrange a meeting.  Tell him George 
                        Washington is putting together a 
                        team.

           Martha nods.  George heads back inside, but stops just short 
           of the door.  Turns back to his wife.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        No.  Tell him George Washington is 
                        putting together an army.

                                                              CUT TO:

           We are

           EXT. MONTICELLO GROUNDS - DAY

           Where THOMAS JEFFERSON (20’s, white, a bit of a dandy) raises 
           his welding goggles to his forehead, makes several notations 
           in a MASSIVE LEATHER-BOUND NOTEBOOK (the earth-rattling 
           detonations continue throughout the scene).

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (O.S.)
                        Boffo fireworks, Mr. Jefferson.  
                        Very boffo.

           Jefferson turns to find Washington approaching, hand 
           outstretched.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        And you are?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        George Washington.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        The dinosaur rancher?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        That’s George Washingten with an 
                        ‘e.’  I’m George Washington with an 
                        ‘o.’  The Future King of America.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        ‘America?’ 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Today, the final whispered word of 
                        a dying man.  But a year from 
                        now... the most powerful country in 
                        the world.  A country free of 
                        British Rule.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        I see.  And you come to procure my 
                        explosive services for your 
                        revolution.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Indeed.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Not interested.

           Jefferson spins on his heel, returns to his note-taking.  
           Washington, flummoxed, can only stare at the his back for a 
           long moment, before...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        That’s a rather voluminous tome for 
                        simple alchemical notation, is it 
                        not?

           The pen FREEZES in Jefferson’s hand, but the man does not 
           turn around.  Washington, though, smells blood...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        You are a writer.
                            (off Jefferson’s continued 
                             silence)
                        You throw yourself into the 
                        explosive arts as a means of 
                        disguising your true passion -- the 
                        written word.
                            (still nothing)
                        When America rises from the ashes 
                        of James’ rule, we will announce 
                        her Independence to the world via 
                        written Declaration.  A ‘Statement 
                        of Having Become A Real Country,’ 
                        if you will.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                            (starting to buy in)
                        A ‘Declaration of Independence.’ 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON

                        Revisions by George Washington.

           After a long, placid silence punctuated only by the 
           HELLACIOUS EXPLOSIONS tearing the grounds asunder, Jefferson 
           turns back toward his visitor.

           they speed over the dusty terrain, occasionally leaving terra

           returning to Earth.

           Washington and Jefferson stand in front of a MAGNIFICENT

           see an inch of his skin, but you can tell he’s white by the 
           successful way he carries himself) lifts his helmet’s visor,

           EXT. THE NATIONAL MALL - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           Hidden in the shadow of King James’ mighty obelisk is a 
           small, grassy patch of land.   Already forgotten by the 
           growing city around it, the field is nonetheless buzzing with 
           activity: INDIANS (FEATHER) of all ages and genders tend to 
           their horses, carve their arrowheads, spackle their teepees. 

                                 GERONIMO (PRE-LAP)
                        I don’t know, there’s something 
                        about you guys I just don’t trust.

           INT. GERONIMO’S TEEPEE - DAY

           Washington, Jefferson, Revere and Edison sit on one side of a 
           crackling fire.  Sitting opposite them is the famed KING OF 
           ALL INDIANS, GERONIMO (40’s, not white).  
           All five men are naked and sweating, because that’s how 
           Indians do things.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        We come as friends, Mighty 
                        Geronimo.  Nay.  As brothers.

                                 GERONIMO
                            (shaking his head)
                        Just doesn’t feel right.  Kinda 
                        feels like you’re gonna try to fuck 
                        me.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        We would never.

                                 GERONIMO
                        Yeah, no... I think you might.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Our word is strong.  Like your 
                        mighty Indian tribe, the... um...
                            (testing)
                        Ch...

           Geronimo shakes his head.

                        Ssss... Sqquuaaaa...

           Geronimo shakes his head again, anger rising.  Washington 
           looks to Jefferson for help.  Jefferson shrugs.  Finally:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Our word is strong.  Like oak.

                                 GERONIMO
                        I have to tell you, I just can’t 
                        shake the feeling that you’re gonna 
                        lay the pipe to me down the line.  
                        Just really gonna give it to me.  
                        Probably my descendants too.

           A long, uncomfortable silence permeates the teepee.  The only 
           sounds are that of the fire and of SWEAT DRIPPING into the 
           dust underfoot.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        You know, I’m probably just being 
                        paranoid.  What was it you guys 
                        wanted me to do again?

           Geronimo stands just outside his teepee, Benedict Arnold’s 
           HERRINGBONE SCARF held to his nose.  Washington, Jefferson, 
           Revere and Edison watch as he takes a DEEP WHIFF...

           ... then points to nebulously toward the city.

                        I don’t know.  Something tells me 
                        we shouldn’t go in there.

           Washington turns toward Geronimo.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You’re sure he’s in there.

           In response, Geronimo raises the scarf to his nose, inhales 
           once more.  Satisfied, he NODS.  He’s sure.

           REVERSE ANGLE:

           The five men are standing on a narrow, cobblestone-lined 
           street, eyeballing a seedy watering hole named VIETNAM.  
           Washington takes a single step toward the building, ready to 
           rock...

           ... but Jefferson holds him back.  Pleading:

                        George.  I beg you reconsider.

                        quagmire. !We could be here for 
                        years and accomplish nothing.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Perhaps.  But we’d be accomplishing 
                        nothing for America.

           This lands.  Jefferson bows his head, humbled.

           The table closest to the door turns toward the source of 
           Washington’s voice, just in time to see...

           ... NOTHING.  Nothing happens.  At all.  After an 
           interminable five seconds:

                        So, should we just... OK cool.

           BLAM!!!!!!!!  The front door FLIES INWARD OFF ITS HINGES, 
           landing at the feet of a stunned BENEDICT ARNOLD.  His 
           surprise quickly evolves into AMUSEMENT, though, when he lays 
           eyes on the five men that have sauntered into the bar.

                        Ex.  Best.  Friend.

           Washington BRISTLES.  He prepares to launch a retort...

           ON EDISON 

           Using his X-RAY VISION to look through a nearby table, where 
           he sees a BLUNDERBUSS being levelled at Washington.  The 
           Redcoat surreptitiously wielding the weapon pulls back its 
           hammer --

           awesome!!!  Also: BAR FIGHT!!!!!

           The assembled Redcoats spring to action, drawing pistols and 
           sabres.  Washington and Crew set upon them without 
           hesitation, happy to slice, bludgeon and burn their way to 
           Arnold:

           Revere draws a heavy LONGSWORD from out of nowhere, cleaves 
           an oncoming wave of Redcoats in half.  Flanking him on each 
           side are Edison, who launches CRACKLING LIGHTNING BALLS 
           across the room...

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Science!!!  Science!!!

           ... and Geronimo, who wields a ferocious oak-hewn BOW that 
           fires TOMAHAWKS.  

           All the while, Jefferson hurls handheld explosives into the 
           corners of the tavern, driving any surviving Redcoats into 
           the center of establishment, where George Washington 
           dispatches them with a series of VICIOUS KICKS AND CHOPS!

           It’s a wholly one-sided bloodbath, and Arnold knows it: he 
           SCRAMBLES over the growing mounds of cadavers, makes for the 
           rear exit.  He’s just about there...
           ... when a CALLOUSED HAND GRABS HIM BY THE SHOULDER.

                                 GERONIMO
                        Going somewhere, Bene-dickhead?

           Arnold responds by rearing back and, with MONSTROUS FANGS 
           we’re only just now noticing, BITING GERONIMO’S ARM CLEAN 
           OFF.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        Owwwwww!!!!!!!!  Sweet Wolf and 
                        Coyote!

           Geronimo collapses to the floor, pawing at his gaping wound, 
           as Arnold makes his escape.  Washington pursues...

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        George.  We must tend to our Indian 
                        brother.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Just leave him!  He’s not 
                        important!

           Washington bounds after Arnold, chasing him through an open 
           doorway into

           A SECOND ROOM, IDENTICAL TO THE FIRST.  If not for the lack 
           of fresh cadavers, you’d think it was the first.  Arnold is 
           nowhere to be seen.  Frustrated, Washington hurries through 
           another doorway into

           A THIRD IDENTICAL ROOM.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        What the shit.

           Jefferson bounds into the room. 

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Tarnation!  I knew we shouldn’t 
                        have come in here.  This place is a 
                        maze.  We’ll never get out.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        That’s the Old World in you 
                        talking, Jefferson.  It’s time that 
                        you learn to think like an 
                        American. 
                            (beat)
                        Let’s carpet-bomb the place with 
                        incendiaries and hope for the best.

                                                              CUT TO:
           EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT

           Our five heroes (Geronimo included) brush themselves of in 
           the foreground as, behind them, VIETNAM BURNS TO THE GROUND.  
           Several surrounding buildings also burn, roasting alive the 
           panicked damsels calling for help from their windows.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I assume we’re all in agreement?  
                        Pretend we were never here?

           Washington’s men nod in accordance... except for Geronimo, 
           who eyeballs his leader with disdain.

                                 GERONIMO
                        You tried to leave me in --

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Arnold!

           The team follows Jefferson’s gaze to the end of the street, 
           where a familiar HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE spirits into the night.  
           No time to spare, Revere WHISTLES, calls out into the night:

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Clyde!!!!

           Almost instantaneously, Revere’s Clydesdale emerges from a 
           nearby pub.  The team piles on, except for Geronimo, who’s 
           having trouble mounting the enormous steed with one arm.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Leave the Indian!

           As the horse accelerates, Geronimo runs alongside it, 
           grasping desperately at its tail with his good arm, before 
           finally grasping the tails of Revere’s reins with HIS TEETH.  
           He uses the momentary purchase to hoist himself up just as...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Faster, Paul!

           ... Revere CRACKS THE REINS, sending GERONIMO’S ENTIRE 
           MOUTHFUL OF TEETH flying into the night.

                                 GERONIMO
                        Ohhhhh Son of the Great Turtle!

           Geronimo wails in agony, but his comrades barely notice, 
           because...

           THE CHASE IS ON!
           Narrow streets.  Uneven terrain.  A RICKETY CARRIAGE in the 
           lead and a CLYDESDALE CARRYING FIVE RIDERS in pursuit.

           Tight turns.  Low light.  The carriage RICOCHETS off stone 
           buildings, street lamps.  Extending its lead on the horse, 
           whose riders struggle to stay mounted as the beast SKIDS 
           around corners, TRAMPLES children at play.  Soon Arnold will 
           be lost to the darkness...

           ... if not for the city mercifully giving way to OPEN 
           TERRAIN.  And just in the nick of time: Arnold’s carriage 
           races toward the horizon; another five seconds and she would 
           have been GONE.  But now Clyde is in HIS world.  He BARRELS 
           across the open land at full gallop, gaining on the carriage 
           rapidly.  So rapidly, in fact, that it takes his riders a 
           moment to process...

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        The carriage is stopped.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        But why would -- THE DELAWARE!

           Just as the words escape Washington’s mouth, the front end of 
           the carriage EXPLODES, and a bitchin’ SEA-DOO launches OVER 
           the coach’s horses and clear into THE DELAWARE RIVER.  
           Onboard, Arnold takes the briefest of moments to look back at 
           his hunters before THROTTLING UP and TEARING TOWARDS THE 
           OPPOSITE BANK. 

           ON WASHINGTON’S TEAM

           Watching, still at full gallop, as Arnold makes his escape.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                            (yelling, over wind)
                        Can he clear the river?!

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (yelling, over wind)
                        Who, Clyde?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (yelling, over wind)
                        No, Thomas Paine.
                            (beat)
                        Yes, fucking Clyde, who the fuck 
                        else would I be talking about?

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (yelling, over wind)
                        The river is two hundred feet wide.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (yelling, over wind)
                        I didn’t ask how wide the river 
                        was, I asked if your sizable steed 
                        could clear it.

           Revere considers for a moment, then:

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (yelling, over wind)
                        With a slightly lighter load, yes, 
                        I believe he could.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (instant)
                        Dump the Indian.

                                 GERONIMO
                            (yelling, over wind)
                        What?  It sounded like he said --

           Edison HURLS Geronimo from the horse.  The Indian lands on a 
           partially exposed boulder with a wet SMACK; the horse picks 
           up speed.

           Only ten feet from river’s edge now.  In the distance, Arnold 
           can be seen dumping his Sea-doo on the opposite bank.

           Three feet.  Two.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (sotto)
                        In God I trust.

           ONE.

           Clyde HURLS HIMSELF INTO THE NIGHT SKY, gargantuan muscles 
           rippling in the moonlight.  His riders hold on for dear life, 
           clinging to the majestic beast for the entirety of the 
           historical flight:

           One and a half seconds.  

           Clyde SPLASHES down into the Delaware about four feet from 
           the spot he jumped from.  His riders, separated from him and 
           from each other by the watery impact, splash about 
           spastically.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        He shorted it, Paul.  Paul.  He 
                        shorted it.
           Washington just gets these words out before dipping under the 
           surface momentarily -- HE CAN’T SWIM -- and he’s not the only 
           one.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        The horse!  Use the horse as a 
                        raft!

           Newly emboldened by Edison’s bright idea, the four men dog-
           paddle toward the Clydesdale.  But the horse isn’t keen on 
           waiting for them; it swims for the other side at roughly the 
           same speed as the Sea-doo.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (nearly drowning)
                        Jumping Jehosaphat, Revere!  Did 
                        you... (drowning) know the horse... 
                        (drowning) could swim that fast?!

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Yeah, Clyde’s a great swimmer.

           A SPLASHING nearby draws the men’s attention: Geronimo has 
           caught up once again, and he’s now traversing the river with 
           ease thanks to a graceful one-armed backstroke.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        The Indian!  Use the Indian as a 
                        raft!

                                 GERONIMO
                        What?!  No!  I can’t possibly carry 
                        --

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. DELAWARE RIVER BANK - DAWN

           Soaking and hypothermic, Geronimo single-handedly hauls all 
           four of his bedraggled teammates onto the far shore of the 
           Delaware River.  Clyde the horse grazes nearby.  He’s been 
           here for hours.  Arnold is long gone.

           Washington, lying stomach-down in the muck, raises his weary 
           head just high enough to watch the first rays of sunlight 
           crest the horizon.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (delirious)
                        Oh, say, can you see?  By the 
                        dawn’s early light... I had a 
                        dream... the rocket’s red glare.  
                        One nation, indivisible... rock me 
                        Amadeus.
           Washington’s head drops back to the ground.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                            (sotto)
                        Rock me Amadeus.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        George... that was beautiful.  You 
                        should write it down.

           His face still buried in the mud...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I’ll remember it.

           As he says it, Washington’s hand slips slightly to the side, 
           brushing against a BRIGHT YELLOW FLYER.  A BEAT as he feels 
           at the paper with his hand, verifying its reality, before 
           lifting his head once more, studying the paper.

           Slowly, his eyes WIDEN.  A SMILE crests his haggard face.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Et tu, Brute?

           Portions of the flyer’s text have been SMUDGED INTO

           Now lying atop a wooden table beside a GIANT MAP OF

           A large, open courtyard surrounded by a bevy of family-owned 
           food stands: The Sbarro Family, The Del Taco Family, The 
           Panda Family, The Orange Julius Family, etc.

           Washington, Jefferson, Edison and Geronimo sit at one of the 
           many picnic tables that crowd the courtyard, studying the map 
           and flyer.

                        I did.  Just now.  That sentence I 
                        just said was the origin of the 
                        phrase.

           Revere approaches, a large plastic tray in hand.  As he joins 
           his comrades, digs in to his meal... 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Say, Paul... what manner of 
                        foodstuff is that?

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        It’s quite amazing, actually: it’s 
                        a traditional Italian sandwich 
                        that’s been toasted in an oven.  
                        Mr. Sbarro’s boy made it for me.
                                 MR. SBARRO (O.S.)
                        Mamma Mia!  What’sa this?!  My boy 
                        made this for you!?  

           The men look up to see an incensed MR. SBARRO (40’s, hairy 
           chest, wearing a gold chain and matching watch and pinky 
           ring) hurrying toward them.  He calls out to his son...

                                 MR. SBARRO (CONT’D)
                        Son!  

           ... who scampers over.  The boy is ten.

                                 MR. SBARRO (CONT’D)
                        Son!  What’sa this?  

                                 MR. SBARRO’S SON
                        It’sa my new invention, Papa!  

                                 MR. SBARRO
                        This isn’t traditional Italiano 
                        cuisine!  I forbid you from ever 
                        making it again!

                                 MR. SBARRO’S SON
                        But papa!  It’sa my dream!

                                 MR. SBARRO
                            (horrified)
                        Your dream is to make-a sandwiches?

                                 MR. SBARRO’S SON
                        Toasted sandwiches, Papa!  

                                 MR. SBARRO
                        Nonsense!  Your dream is to follow 
                        in your Papa’s footsteps... and 
                        your Papa, he make-a delicious 
                        stuffed pizzas by the slice!  No 
                        sandwiches!

                                 MR. SBARRO’S SON
                        But I want to have my own stand 
                        someday, Papa.

                                 MR. SBARRO
                        Your own stand?!  You think this is 
                        a free country, where you can just 
                        do whatever you dream?!  This isn’t 
                        a free country!!!  

                                 MR. SBARRO’S SON
                        But Papa...
                                 MR. SBARRO
                        Enough, Quizno!!!!  Until this is a 
                        free country, your job is to listen 
                        to your Papa!  Not to dream!

           Sufficiently chastised, poor Quizno Sbarro sulks off.  
           Horrified by the interaction, Washington leans in to his

                        We must find that address.  Not 
                        only for our own children.  But for 
                        all the children of the Colonies 
                        who dare to dream.

                        Perhaps I’m missing something, 
                        but... what difficulty does an 
                        unknown address pose when we have 
                        in our number the greatest Tracker 
                        in the Colonies?

                        My tracking is useless without my

                        Don’t question me, scientist!  Your

                        the Old Ways.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Fine.  Let us re-focus on the task 
                        at hand.  Even if we do discover 
                        the precise address, there’s 
                        something else we’ll need to attend 
                        to before we strike.  Something I 
                        know you had already suspected to 
                        be an issue... well as a scientist, 
                        I can now confirm your fears.

                        He’s a werewolf.
           A massive, dumbfounded GASP from the collective.

                        As I’m sure you’ve realized, this 
                        means that one thing and one thing 
                        only can stop him: A silver bullet. 

           The collected men hang their heads, overwhelmed: the road 
           ahead is fraught with even more peril than they could have 
           dreamed.  But hope springs eternal:

                            (low)
                        I know a man.  An expert with 
                        metals; a smith.  If there is a man 
                        alive who can forge silver into 
                        ammunition -- and there may not be -
                        - it is he.

           Washington nods -- slowly at first -- but then faster, and 
           FASTER, until he’s worked himself into a lather of blind 
           optimism and false confidence.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Then we will visit this smith.  And 
                        he will discover the secret of the 
                        impossible weapon we require, 
                        because God himself will reveal it 
                        to him.  Because our cause is just.  
                        It is righteous.

           work: A GARGANTUAN, PERFECTLY PROPORTIONED COPPER BELL.

           The outburst JARS Smith, and, in turn, his HAMMER.  Which 
           BLUDGEONS THE BELL, cracking it instantly.  The resulting 
           fissure runs front and center down the ENTIRE HEIGHT of the 
           piece.  The bell is ruined.

           Smith, nonplussed, sits at a picnic table outside his 
           workshop, joined by our five intrepid heroes.

                                 BLACK SMITH
                        Do I want to know why you would 
                        require a silver bullet?

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Best that you not, Smitty.  It will 
                        be used to free the Colonies; let’s 
                        leave it at that.
                                 BLACK SMITH
                        If freeing the colonies is your 
                        aim, why not just collaborate with 
                        Alexander Hamilton and save 
                        yourselves the silver?  He shares 
                        your cause.

                        Alexander Hamilton the professional

                                 BLACK SMITH
                        No that’s Alexander Hamilten with 
                        an ‘e.’  This is Alexander 
                        Hamilton, with an ‘o.’  The amateur 
                        wrestler.

           Washington nods, intrigued.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Confer with him we will... but 
                        we’ll still need that bullet.

                                 BLACK SMITH
                        Fair enough.  I’ll need a bar of 
                        silver of no less than one thousand 
                        troy ounces.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        One thousand troy ounces?!  But 
                        surely a bullet should require no 
                        more than one!

                                 BLACK SMITH
                        Correct.  The rest is my fee for 
                        delivering such a unique 
                        commission.  If you don’t like it, 
                        I’m sure there are many other 
                        smiths in the colonies capable of 
                        the job.

                        of seconds.

                                 WAL-MART EMPLOYEE
                        Well I don’t know what ‘hamburger’ 
                        means but I can definitely help you 
                        with that.  Now... we do have a 
                        waiting period, so...

           The employee pulls out a POCKETWATCH, stares intently at the 
           face for TEN PERFECTLY SILENT SECONDS...

                                 WAL-MART EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
                        ... aaaannnd great.  We’re all set.  
                        Let’s get you heavily armed!

                                                              CUT TO:
           CLOSE ON: A GARGANTUAN, TWENTY-BARRELLED REVOLVER

           Spinning atop a highly polished WOOD SURFACE.  PULL BACK to 
           reveal that surface to be A BAR, then further still to show 
           the facility in its entirety:

           A GRIMY, OLD-TIMEY SALOON

           Populated in equal number by nondescript townspeople and 
           REDCOATS.  The revolver’s OWNER leans over the bar, face 
           obscured.  He wears a blue WRESTLING SINGLET with a large 
           HOLSTER over it.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (O.S.)
                        Alexander Hamilton.

           PAN TO FIND Washington and Jefferson standing in the center 
           of the saloon, scanning the patrons.  Off the silence that 
           greets them...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        I say.  We’re looking for Alexander 
                        Hamilton.

           A HOARSE CROAK crawls from the throat of the man at the bar:

                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
                        Who’s looking.

           Washington and Jefferson approach the man, ALEXANDER HAMILTON 
           (30’s, white, looks like the kind of guy who might die in a 
           duel gone wrong).  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Friends.  We come to discuss... 
                        common interests, shall we say.
                            (then, taking in the 
                             surrounding Redcoats)
                        But not here.  Join us for a walk?

           Hamilton considers the offer, then SLAMS what remains of his 
           whiskey, stands.  

                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
                        Should I bring my gun?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I can think of no reason whatsoever 
                        that you would need to be carrying 
                        a gun in a public outdoor area in 
                        the middle of the day.

           Hamilton nods in assent, follows the men.  His massive 
           revolver, conspicuously, REMAINS ON THE BAR.
           SFX OVER: the unmistakable cadence OF GALLOPING HORSES 
           carries us into...

           EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

           ... where Edison and Revere stand in the center of the well-
           worn DIRT ROAD that cuts through these dense and darkened 
           woods.  The horses, by the sounds of things, are approaching 
           rapidly.  Edison drops into a wide-legged SQUAT.  

                                 PAUL REVERE 
                        Now what is that you’re doing 
                        there?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Scientific method.  This part is 
                        called the ‘Hypothesis.’

           Edison balls his hands into tight fists, tucks them into his 
           (no doubt rippling) abs.  

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        This here is the ‘Procedure.’

           For a long moment following, the only sound is the 
           approaching horses...

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        And this... is...

           ... an EXPLOSION OF MOTION: The horses, a team of four, round 
           the bend, pulling behind them a robust CONCORD STAGECOACH.  
           At the sight of it, Edison PUNCHES HIS ARMS OUTWARD, 
           manifesting A SIZZLING ORB OF BRIGHT BLUE PLASMA...

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Science!!!!

           ... that ENVELOPS the entire procession and then LEVITATES IT 
           FOUR FEET OFF THE GROUND.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        ‘Results.’

           The horses, baffled, simply stare down at their dangling 
           legs.  The coach’s human passengers, though, are less passive 
           about their predicament:

           The SHOTGUN MESSENGER (coach security [read a book]) levels 
           his namesake firearm at Edison...

           ... only to have both of his arms BLUDGEONED CLEAN OFF by the 
           brutish BALL-AND-CHAIN FLAIL wielded by Revere. 
                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Farewell to arms.

           The outraged STAGE DRIVER stands in his driver’s basket...

                                 STAGE DRIVER
                        What is the meaning of this 
                        madness?!

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        This is a robbery.  Hand over the 
                        silver you’re transporting in the 
                        coach and no one else needs be 
                        hurt.

                                 STAGE DRIVER
                        You are suicidal.  Do you know 
                        whose silver this is??

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Don’t care.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN (O.S.)
                        Are you sure about that? 

           The coach’s side door swings open.  King James’ personal 
           bodyguard, JOSEPH STALIN (30’s, muscles like steel cable, 
           bizarre accent), leans out, a STEEL HALLIBURTON CASE dangling 
           from his outstretched hand.  

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (to Revere, whispering)
                        Joseph Stalin.  James’ personal 
                        bodyguard.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (whispering)
                        Yeah thanks I know who he is.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (whispering)
                        The most dangerous man in the New 
                        World.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (whispering)
                        I’m aware.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (whispering)
                        Slayer of the nine-headed Lernaean 
                        Hydra and captor of Cerberus, the 
                        three-headed Hound of H--
                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (whispering)
                        I’m caught up.

           Stalin gestures toward the Halliburton.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        Take it.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (pleasantly surprised)
                        Oh.  Great.

           Revere strides up to Stalin, takes hold of the case’s handle, 
           and pulls...

           ... but Stalin’s NOT LETTING GO.  Instead, he uses their 
           shared grip on the case to pull the knight CLOSER.  Their 
           faces a mere INCHES apart:

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        The silver is yours to take... but 
                        know that it comes with a price.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        That’s the whole reason I’m robbing 
                        you; I don’t want to pay for --

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        The price is your life.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Oh.
                            (then)
                        OK.

           Stalin pulls Revere EVEN CLOSER.  Maybe he’s not making 
           himself clear...

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        If you take this silver, I will 
                        hunt you down.  And kill you.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        No, you don’t have to explain, I 
                        got it.  I accept.

           Revere tries to TUG the case away from Stalin.  Stalin tugs 
           back.
                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        By accepting this case full of 
                        silver, you are entering into a 
                        legally binding verbal contract 
                        with me, “LENDER,” which provisions 
                        that in exchange --

           Revere YANKS THE CASE FREE.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        I got it, bro.  Fuck.

           A TENSE BEAT as the two men stare each other down.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        I would kill you right now but I’m 
                        late for a tea party.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Well I’m easy to find.  Just ask 
                        around for the guy who’s totally 
                        not scared of you at all.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        Maybe instead I should ask for the 
                        biggest pussy in the Colonies.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        I don’t know why you’d want to 
                        bring your mother into this.

           Stalin SEETHES.  

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        This isn’t over.

           Stalin nods to the driver, who SNAPS the reins.  Edison, in 
           turn, releases his scientific hold on the coach, allowing it 
           to CRASH BACK TO EARTH and, moments later, ESCAPE INTO THE 
           WOODS.  

           As the coach vanishes around a bend, Stalin leans out one 
           final time, makes a ‘throat cutting’ gesture at Revere.  
           Revere counters with ‘I am giving a blowjob and the top part 
           of the penis head is making my cheek bulge out.’

           And then the stagecoach is gone.  A lengthy BEAT, then...

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        He said he was going to a tea 
                        party... what kind of tea party 
                        requires a coach full of silver?
                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (realizing)
                        A royal one.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Exactly.
                            (then, in an awful 
                             satirical British accent)
                        Care to join me for tea?

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (equally terrible play 
                             accent)
                        It would be my pleasure, Guv’ner.

           EXT. IDYLLIC COBBLESTONE STREET - MAGIC HOUR

           Washington, Jefferson and Hamilton walk the completely empty 
           street, free to openly discuss their revolutionary plans. 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        ... and so you see, Hamilton: if 
                        only we knew the Gettysburg 
                        Address, we believe we could deal a 
                        devastating -- perhaps lethal --
                        blow to the Empire.

           Hamilton freezes in his tracks.

                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
                        I have it.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You have...

                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
                        The address you seek.  The 
                        Gettysburg Address.  It was passed 
                        on to me by a source I thought to 
                        be corrupted, and so I didn’t act 
                        on it.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Well good God, man, where is it?

           Hamilton points to his own noggin.

                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
                        Right here and right here only.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Brilliant.  No one can know the 
                        Address without you being alive to 
                        recount it to them.
                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
                        Exactly.  It is completely and 
                        utterly irretrievable should I 
                        befall a sudden and unforeseen end.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        The ultimate lock and key.

                                 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
                            (nodding)
                        For the ultimate secret.  Which I 
                        will now reveal to you, thus 
                        loosing information that would 
                        otherwise follow me to my grave.

                                 DUELIST (O.S.)
                        Hey Hamilton!

           Hamilton SPINS to see a TALL MAN standing in the center of 
           the street twenty feet behind him.  The man’s hand creeps 
           toward his holstered PISTOL... 

                                 DUELIST (CONT’D)
                        Draw!!!

           Hamilton’s eyes drop to his EMPTY HOLSTER.  SHIT.

           BLAM!  The Duelist puts a single shot through his opponent’s 
           heart, then disappears down a sidestreet before Hamilton’s 
           body has even hit the ground.

           Washington and Jefferson stand rooted in place for a long, 
           dumbfounded beat, before, finally... 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Was that Aaron fucking Burr?

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        I believe so.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Guy is such a dick!

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        And a known British sympathizer to 
                        boot.

           A shared look: are you thinking what I’m thinking?

                    GEORGE WASHINGTON
                                                   THOMAS JEFFERSON
           After him!
                                             After him!
           INT. WAL-MART  

           Geronimo pushes a SHOPPING CART FULL OF GUNS down an aisle, 
           headed for checkout.  He’s almost there...

                                 VENDOR
                        Hey man.  Wanna try a free sample?  

           Geronimo turns, takes in the nearby VENDOR (30’s, cowboy hat, 
           gangrenous muttonchops) standing behind a table loaded with 
           BLACK-LABELLED BOTTLES.

                                 GERONIMO
                        Sample of what?

           The vendor holds out a small cup, offers a WIDE SMILE.

                                 VENDOR
                        It’s called whiskey.

           EXT. BOSTON HARBOR - NIGHT

           Revere and Edison crouch behind a STACK OF BARRELS eyeballing 
           Stalin’s stagecoach, which, now empty, is parked nearby.

           Looming over the scene and filling the entire harbor in the 
           BG is a GARGANTUAN THREE-MASTED BRITISH CARGO SHIP, THE 
           TITANIC.  Party-goers in their finest threads (mostly women 
           and children) crowd onto the ship for what is surely the Tea 
           Party of the year.

           Revere and Edison study the scene, planning their next 
           move...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (O.S.)
                        Revere?  Edison?

           The crouching men turn to find Washington and Jefferson 
           sneaking through the darkness to meet them.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        George.  Thomas.  What are you 
                        doing here?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        We followed Aaron Burr here after 
                        he shot Hamilton dead in the 
                        street.  

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Aaron Burr is mixed up in all 
                        this?!  Guy’s such a dick!
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Quite.  And you?

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        The coach we robbed?

           Revere points to the nearby stagecoach.

                                 PAUL REVERE (CONT’D)
                        Property of one Joseph Stalin.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        With both Stalin and Burr in 
                        attendance, I think we can assume 
                        that this is no ordinary Tea Party.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Our thought exactly.  This is an 
                        event of Royal magnitude... if 
                        James himself is not aboard that 
                        ship, certainly his most trusted 
                        advisors are.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (inspired)
                        A fortuitous opportunity to cripple 
                        our enemy, granted by God Himself.  
                        It mustn’t go to waste.
                            (then, to Jefferson)
                        Have you anything in your explosive 
                        repertoire that can sink a ship of 
                        that stature?

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON 
                        I have.

           Washington nods, his resolve steeled.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Then by the Grace of God... let’s 
                        get ready to rumble®!!

           The four men abandon their cover and run, crouched, toward 
           the monolithic ship.  As they do...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Hey, any news of Geronimo?

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. WAL-MART - NIGHT

           Geronimo and the whisky vendor stumble across the expansive 
           parking lot, arms draped heavily around one another.
                                 GERONIMO
                            (loud, slurring)
                        This guy here... this is the guy!  
                        Jack fucking Daniels!  This is 
                        where the guy is, right here, is 
                        where it’s at.  Where.  It’s.  At!

                                  VENDOR/JACK DANIELS
                            (louder, slurring)
                        Geronimo, motherfuckers!  Who wants 
                        some?!  Who wants some?!

                                                             BACK TO:

           CLOSE ON THE HULL OF THE TITANIC

           Moonlit and silent, save for the rhythmic SLOSHING of bay 
           waters against weathered wood.  For a long moment, this is 
           the only movement...

           ... until a FLOTILLA OF SMALL BUBBLES breeches the surface, 
           preceding by several seconds THOMAS JEFFERSON’S HEAD.

           Jefferson hugs the hull of the mighty ship, silently affixes 
           an amorphous lump of C4 EXPLOSIVE to the battered wood.  
           Satisfied, he withdraws a TIN CAN from somewhere beneath the 
           surface, whispers into its open end:

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Seagull One has landed.

           As Jefferson’s voice rattles around inside the can, we dip

           BELOW THE SURFACE

           First FINDING and then FOLLOWING the thin LENGTH OF TWINE 
           that emerges from the can’s bottom lid: 

           Initially, the twine traces the ship’s port side, slicing 
           SIDEWAYS past barnacles and remoras and a small, humanoid 
           GREMLIN eating a hole in the boat...

           ... then DOWNWARD, into the depths, winding through kelps, a 
           bunch of hot lesbo mermaids, and an underwater graveyard of 
           murdered Indians...

           ... and then BACK TOWARD THE SURFACE, and, finally, INTO THE 
           COLD NIGHT AIR, where it leads into the business end of 
           ANOTHER CAN, this one held to the ear of one PAUL REVERE.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON (CONT’D)
                            (in can)
                        Seagull One has landed.
           Revere nods to himself, places his own lump of C4.  Whispers 
           into a DIFFERENT CAN... 

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Seagull Two has landed.

           ... which also births a length of twine, this one dipping 

           CLEAR UNDER THE SHIP 

           and emerging on the other side, in the waiting hand of THOMAS 
           EDISON.

                                 PAUL REVERE (CONT’D)
                            (in can)
                        Seagull Two has landed.

           Edison has already placed his charge, so he immediately 
           coughs into his second line:

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Seagull Three has landed.

           EXT. THE TITANIC - STARBOARD SIDE - NIGHT

           George Washington, his whigged head just cresting the inky 
           surface, listens as Edison’s call echoes out from the can 
           held to his ear:

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (in can)
                        Seagull Three has landed.

           Immediately, Washington barks BACK into the incoming line:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It’s ‘Eagle.’  ‘Eagle’ Three has 
                        landed.  Not ‘Seagull.’

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (in can)
                        I thought it was ‘Seagull.’

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It’s not, it’s ‘Eagle.’  Why would 
                        it be ‘Seagull?’  What’s cool about 
                        seagulls?  

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (in can)
                        They change color with the seasons.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        That’s not cool.
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (in can)
                        I think it’s cool.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It’s not.  You know what’s cool?  
                        Eagles.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (in can)
                        What’s cool about eagles?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Oh, I don’t know, fucking 
                        everything?!

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (in can)
                        With all due respect, George, 
                        that’s a bit tenuous.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Shut up, geek!  Call waiting.

           Washington drops the that can, brings his second line up just 
           in time to hear:

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                            (in can)
                        ... landed?  I repeat, has Seagull 
                        Four landed?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        ‘Eagle.’  Yes, Eagle Four has 
                        landed.  Christ.

           EXT. BOSTON HARBOR - LATER

           Having completed their task, the four men once again crouch 
           behind their shelter of barrels.   In the BG, the Tea Party 
           of the Century rages on.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Eagles are awesome.  They have 
                        claws and boffo white hair like me 
                        and they eat Chinamen.

           To the side, Revere silently implores Jefferson to detonate 
           the charges: End this buffoonery! 
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        I’m not saying that eagles aren’t 
                        awesome, I’m just trying to explore 
                        the possibility that seagulls, too, 
                        are awesome.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        False.  Seagulls are pussies.  
                        Eagles are totally burly.  And 
                        historically speaking --

           Jefferson’s heard enough.  He presses a GAUNTLET-MOUNTED 
           BUTTON...

           KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
           BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
           LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
           AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
           MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

           The harbor trembles as the Titanic EXPLODES INTO A BAJILLION 
           PIECES.  Flaming wreckage rains down all around the Founding 
           Fathers, who watch in awed reverence as a FOUR HUNDRED FOOT 
           MUSHROOM CLOUD billows up toward the darkened Firmament.

           After a long moment, the party-goers who managed to survive 
           the blast crawl from the wreckage.  Comprised solely of women 
           and children, they burn and bleed and wail in despair... 
           until, like diseased vermin, they fling themselves into the 
           Bay, where they will surely drown, die from their injuries, 
           or catch their eventual death in the form of hypothermia or 
           pneumonia.  It’s horrific.  After a long moment:

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON 
                            (not even remotely buying 
                             it)
                        I’m, uh... I’m sure all the men 
                        were below deck.  Plotting a 
                        horrific strike of their own.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (trying to con himself)
                        Undoubtedly.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Speaking of ‘plodding,’ where in 
                        damnation is that Indian?

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        What?
                            (then, realizing)
                        No, I said ‘plotting,’ with a --

           MUSIC CUE: ‘TUBTHUMPING’ BY CHUMBAWUMBA...
           ... but ONLY THE CHORUS (I get knocked down/but I get up 
           again/You’re never gonna keep me down -- don’t pretend you

           LIGHTNING-FAST MONTAGE: GERONIMO GETS WASTED

           - Geronimo and Jack Daniels sit in the VIP section of a night 
           club, blazing through their bottle service.  Like a G6!

           - Geronimo hurls a pair of dice down the length of a CRAPS 
           TABLE.  The assembled crowd ERUPTS IN CELEBRATION.

           - Blow!!

           - Geronimo gets a tattoo on his abdomen.  It features one 
           arrow, labelled ‘The Man,’ pointing up toward his head, and a 
           second arrow, ‘The Legend,’ pointing down toward his 
           (partially exposed) dong.

           - Geronimo wrestles a bear.  It’s unclear whether this is 
           part of a travelling exhibition or just a spontaneous 
           man/bear fisticuffs.  Who cares?!  SHOTS!!!!

           - Geronimo SCALPS A SCREAMING BUSINESSMAN, and with the man’s 
           frantic screams we 

                                                             FADE TO:

           EXT. BOSTON HARBOR - LATE NIGHT

           The businessman’s screams fade into those of a frail woman 
           shuddering out her final death throes on the shoreline.  
           Small bits of wreckage burn on the surface of the Bay behind 
           her; the bulk of The Titanic is long since sunk.

           The woman gives one final groan, then dies.  A BEAT OF PURE, 
           TRAGIC STILLNESS follows...

           ... but ends SUDDENLY, when a WATER-LOGGED HAND explodes from 
           the water, paws at the sand.  Inch by agonizing inch, the 
           man, half-dead, drags himself from the Bay.  Finally safe, he 
           rests for a long moment... 

           ... then looks up, into the distance.  Eyes burning.

           The man is Joseph Stalin.

           AND HE.  IS.  PISSED.

                                                       SMASH TO BLACK.

                        Geronimo.  Wake up.  Wake up, man.

                                                               UP ON:

           GERONIMO’S BLOATED FACE

           Eyes creaking open to find Jefferson, Edison, Revere and 
           Washington standing above him.  We are

           EXT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - LATE NIGHT

           And Geronimo is lying across the front steps beside a massive 
           CACHE OF MACHINE GUNS.

                                 GERONIMO
                        Where... where am I?

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        You managed to find your way back 
                        to George’s condo somehow.  
                            (as he helps Geronimo up)
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 GERONIMO
                        What’s wrong with you?!

           Washington leads the other men into the building.  Jefferson, 
           supporting the bulk of Geronimo’s weight, struggles to guide 
           the Indian through the doorway.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  TJ.  TJ.  We should start a 
                        casino.

           INT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Washington welcomes the other men into his home, gestures 
           widely to the numerous COUCHES and DAYBEDS that occupy the 
           space.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It’s been an eventful night, gents;  
                        your rest is well-deserved.  Help 
                        yourself to whatever luxuries you 
                        require to salve the body and 
                        mind... the revolution continues at 
                        daybreak.

           With that, Washington excuses himself to his bedroom.  The 
           remaining four men claim makeshift beds, before Edison 
           realizes...
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Perhaps we should post a sentry 
                        outside?  For safety’s sake?

                                 PAUL REVERE 
                        Good idea.

           A quick look around the room: Revere and Edison stand tall.  
           Jefferson sits bolt upright on a nearby armchair, ready to 
           accept the challenge.  Geronimo sleeps face-down on the 
           coffee table.

           INT. WASHINGTON’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Washington stands above a WOODEN CRIB, gazing down at his 
           infant son, CalebTron (who actually looks more like a toddler 
           at this point.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        He’s grown.

           Martha appears behind him, massages his weary shoulders...

           ... his mountainous traps...

           ... his bulbous, vein-rippled delts...

           ... his granite pectorals, thickly cabled with muscle like so 
           many thick cables and nearly BURSTING through his shirt with 
           every throaty breath...

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        You’ve grown.

           As her hands roam his hardened body, her hunger grows -- as 
           does his -- until finally, they can take no more...

           Martha SPINS George violently, kisses him with the passion of 
           a thousand lost loves.  Their lips smack together noisily, 
           their tongues dance like horny Latin Americans.

           Passion like this bridges oceans... heals wounds... BIRTHS 
           NEW COUNTRIES.

           Finally, their desire momentarily sated:

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                            (breathy)

                        but without the Gettysburg Address, 
                        all our victories are merely oases 
                        on the road to defeat.
                            (thoughtful beat)
                        I begin to fear that we will never 
                        find what we seek.

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        Fatigue makes cowards of us all: 
                        the tirelessness with which you’ve 
                        pursued your quest has betrayed 
                        your confidence in it.

           Martha reaches up, touches her beau’s weathered face.

           BACK TO REVEAL...

           six, maybe seven, wearing a traditional PILGRIM’S COSTUME and 
           focusing intently on the OPEN BIBLE before him.

                        Good George.

           George looks up over his shoulder to his proud FATHER, who 
           incidentally is A CAVEMAN: He wears an ANIMAL PELT TOGA, has 
           wild, unruly FACIAL, HEAD AND CHEST HAIR, and carries A LARGE 
           WOODEN CLUB.

                                 MR. WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Now.  What lesson.

           George turns back toward the Book, refocuses.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (BOY)
                        The lesson is... you shouldn’t 
                        steal.

                                 MR. WASHINGTON
                        No.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        The lesson is... thou shouldn’t 
                        steal?

                                 MR. WASHINGTON
                        No.  Lesson is: Hate blacks, jews, 
                        muslims, homos, womenfolk.

           George PEERS at the text, confused.

                        And retards.

           George looks back to his father.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (BOY)
                        But Papa...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (BOY)
                        I don’t understand.  It says 
                        ‘though shalt not steal.’
                                 MR. WASHINGTON

           Washington enters the living room to find his compatriots

           steps forward to engage the Brits...

                        thorn in the Empire’s side.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSEPH STALIN (CONT'D)
                        So I’m here now to send a message: 
                        the games are over.

           SFX OS: A BABY’S WAIL.

           Washington turns in horror just in time to see a redcoat 
           emerge from the bedroom, CalebTron cradled in his arms.  
           Martha follows, hammering frantically on the man’s back and 
           shoulders, but she is quickly subdued by Stalin’s forces.

           Washington turns back toward Stalin, SEETHING.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You invade my house -- my home.  
                        You lay hands not only on my 
                        friends, not only on my family... 
                        but on my child?!  AN INFANT?!  

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        Infant?!  Surely, he’s a toddler at 
                        the very least.  Like a 3T?  4T?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        He was born three nights ago.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        No!

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        He’s in the ninety-fifth percentile 
                        for both length and weight.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        What do you feed him?

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        During the day, a homemade formula 
                        of root vegetables and dairy 
                        proteins...

           As Martha continues, Stalin whips out a small MOLESKINE, 
           takes notes.

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        ... and at night a slurry of egg 
                        whites, ambergris, and Triscuit.

           Stalin nods, gestures to his notepad.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        Me and Svetlana are probably going 
                        to start trying next month, so...
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Enough!!!!!  What manner of monster 
                        are you?!

           Stalin casually tucks away his Moleskine.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        The manner that is willing to go to 
                        any lengths to ensure the victory 
                        of his cause.  Something that I’m 
                        quite sure you would never 
                        understand.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (through clenched jaw)
                        I’ll show you just how far I’m 
                        willing to go...

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        No, I’m afraid you won’t.  Because 
                        if you do -- if, from this moment 
                        on, you make a single move against 
                        James or the Empire in general -- 
                        you will never see your son again.  

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        No!!!!

           Stalin continues, unmoved by Martha’s maternal agony.

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        He will be kept in a secret 
                        location, supervised by my best 
                        men.  He will be safe... unless you 
                        choose to act.  In which case...

           Stalin makes his now signature ‘throat-slitting’ gesture.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        And if I choose not to act?  If I 
                        kowtow to your imperialist demands?

                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                        In a year’s time, your revolution 
                        will have lost all momentum, and 
                        James’ power will be absolute.  If 
                        at that point you have adhered to 
                        our demands... your son will be 
                        returned to you.  Safe.  Do we 
                        understand one another?

           Washington nods, humiliated.
                                 JOSEPH STALIN (CONT’D)
                        Good.  Oh, and one more thing 
                        before I bid you adieu.
                            (to Revere)
                        I told you if you took that silver 
                        I would kill you.

           Without so much as a pause, Stalin pulls a sidearm from his 
           coat, SHOOTS REVERE IN THE CHEST.  Revere flies back into a 
           china cabinet, SHATTERING its contents and collapsing in a 
           BLOODY MESS.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Paul!  No!

           As Edison and Jefferson rush to their friend’s aid, Stalin 
           herds his men through the front door.  George and Martha, 
           clutching each other for support, can only watch as their 
           crying son disappears with them.  

           The Redcoats vanish as fast as they appeared, with one 
           exception: Stalin, the last in line, lingers momentarily at 
           the door.  Turns back to the heartbroken couple. 

           And throws a farewell CROTCH CHOP.  SUCK IT!

           Then he’s gone.

           For a long, heavy moment, the room simply wallows in pain: a 
           revolution derailed.  A child kidnapped.  A friend mortally 
           wounded.

           There is no measure for heartache of this magnitude.  It is 
           breath-constricting, soul-crushing, WORLD ENDING.

                                 GERONIMO (O.S.)
                        Hey guys, I picked up breakfast!

           ON GERONIMO, still drunk and standing just inside the front 
           door.  He holds two paper bags aloft in his one hand, shakes 
           them for effect.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        I got sesame and...

           He trails off as he finally processes the scene before him.  
           He lowers the bags to his side.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        ... poppy dipped pumpernickel.

                                                              CUT TO:
           EXT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - LATE NIGHT

           Jefferson and Edison HURL Geronimo to the street.

                                 GERONIMO
                        What am I supposed to do now?!

           As they disappear back into the building...

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Jump out of an airplane, for all I 
                        care.

           SLAM!  Geronimo stands alone in the street, the door (to the 
           condo, to friendship, to revolution) closed to him forever.

                                 GERONIMO
                            (yelling)
                        What the fuck is an airplane?!!!

           INT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Washington, Jefferson and Edison crowd around the 
           bloodstained daybed where CLARA BARTON (Natalie Portman) 
           tends to Revere.  Martha, still in tears, clings to her 
           husband for support.

                                 CLARA BARTON
                        I can save him.  But it will 
                        require the full breadth of my 
                        cybernetic research to do so.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Meaning?

                                 CLARA BARTON
                        Meaning when I’m done...

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                            (understanding)
                        ... he’ll be more machine than man.

                                 CLARA BARTON
                        Exactly.  And there’s also a chance 
                        that at some point in the distant 
                        future, he’ll rise up against us 
                        and enslave humanity for all of 
                        eternity.  Can you live with that 
                        on your consciences?

           Washington, Jefferson and Edison look to one another...

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        He owes me three bucks, so...
           Washington shrugs, turns back to Barton.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Do what you must.

           Barton nods, returns her attention to the patient.  
           Jefferson, Edison and the two Washingtons retreat into a 
           corner of the room...

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        So.  Our journey has come to an 
                        end. 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        No.  

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        George.  We’ve lost two of our 
                        team.  And what’s worse...

                                 MARTHA DANDRIDGE WASHINGTON
                        They have our son.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Yes.  They have your son.  And 
                        they’re keeping him, no doubt, at 
                        the Gettysburg Address... the same 
                        address, you will recall, that has 
                        eluded our every effort at 
                        detection thus far.  
                            (then)
                        Face it, George.  Our twilight is 
                        upon us.

           Washington nods...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (sotto)
                        But it’s always darkest before 
                        dawn.
                            (then, to group)
                        It’s true.  Without that address, 
                        our revolution is dead.  Without 
                        that address, my son is but a 
                        memory.  Without that address... 
                        all hope is lost.
                            (dramatic beat)
                        But we are not without that 
                        address.

           Edison and Jefferson react with appropriate shock.
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        What?!  You... you have the 
                        address?!

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        No.  But it is within our grasp.  
                        Closer than ever before.   
                            (then, off his comrades’ 
                             confusion)
                        There is a hidden meaning in 
                        everything -- including Abe’s dying 
                        words to me.  Many people don’t 
                        know this, but Abe wasn’t just the 
                        greatest celebrity chef of our 
                        generation... he was also its most 
                        capable cryptographer.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Crypto-huh???

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Cryptographer.  Someone who crafts 
                        and solves codes and ciphers.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Thank you for the definition.  It 
                        will enable me to fully understand 
                        the conversation to follow.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I’ve come to realize that Abe’s 
                        final edict -- that I name our 
                        freed country ‘America’ -- was more 
                        than a request: it was a cipher.  
                        ‘America’ is not just the name of 
                        the soon-to-be greatest country in 
                        the world, it is itself a code... 
                        and hidden within that code, my 
                        friends, is the Gettysburg Address.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                            (stunned)
                        Amazing... but how can you be sure?

           A dramatic BEAT as Washington makes penetrating eye contact 
           first with Jefferson, then Edison.  Granting them access to 
           the window to his soul.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Because.

           Edison and Jefferson share an impressed look: they’re sold.  
           Edison looks to his watch.
                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        James’ secret meeting is three days 
                        from now.  Will you be able to 
                        crack the code in time?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I will... because I must.  

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                            (nodding)
                        We’ll bring the silver to Black 
                        Smith.  If and when you crack the 
                        code... your army will be ready to 
                        strike.  The army... of the United 
                        States of America.

           Washington smiles, nods.  He likes it.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (slow at first)
                        U.S.A.  U.S.A.
                            (then faster)
                        U.S.A.  U.S.A.

           Jefferson joins in, then Edison.  Soon they’re chanting at 
           the top of their lungs, hearts aflame with newly reignited 
           flames of rebellion!

                                 ALL THREE
                        U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!

                                                             FADE TO:

           INT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - STUDY - EARLY MORNING

           The chant fades into the staccato opening riffs of 
           “Battleflag” by the Lo-Fidelity All-Stars.  The riffs are 
           joined by the track’s techno percussion as Washington enters 
           the room, takes it in: The massive OAK DESK.  The multiple 
           large, ‘flip-over’- style CHALKBOARDS.  The HUNDREDS OF 
           CANDLES lining every flat surface.  He nods to himself, 
           invigorated.  Let’s do this.

           The song kicks into full gear (”I SAID HALLELUJAH!”) as our 
           ‘CRACKING THE CODE’ MONTAGE begins: Washington...

           - LIGHTS EVERY CANDLE IN THE ROOM (these will serve as a 
           gauge for the passage of time over the course of the 
           montage)...

           - CONSULTS HUNDREDS OF BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS pulled from his 
           shelves...

           - WORKS AN ANCIENT CHINESE ABACUS mounted to the wall...
           - SCRIBBLES NOTES AND NOTATIONS ON EVERY POSSIBLE SURFACE: 
           his books, his windows, his hands...

           - BLOW!

           - STARES AT A FRAMED PORTRAIT OF ABE he keeps on his desk.  
           Share with me your secrets, old friend...

           But primarily, MOSTLY, he:

           - WORKS THROUGH INSANELY COMPLICATED EQUATIONS AND FORMULAS 
           ON HIS CHALKBOARDS.  Once he fills one, he FLIPS IT OVER, 
           continues on its opposite side.  When that side is full, he 
           moves on to the next board.  Over the course of the montage, 
           he fills A HALF DOZEN DOUBLE-SIDED CHALKBOARDS with 
           cryptographic calculations of dizzying complexity...

           ... until, finally: One final notation (which we don’t see) 
           causes Washington to STUMBLE BACKWARD.  He covers his mouth 
           with one hand, AWED.  His other hand FALLS TO HIS SIDE, and 
           from it, in slo-mo, HIS WELL-WORN CHALK FALLS TO THE FLOOR.

           INT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jefferson and Edison look up from their Jenga game as 
           Washington finally emerges from his study.  His clothes are 
           rumpled and stained, his beard bushy and full.  But his eyes 
           tell the true story: They SPARKLE with the inextinguishable 
           EUPHORIA OF DISCOVERY.

           INT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - STUDY - LATER

           Every candle in the room is melted to a nub.  Washington 
           moves to the final chalkboard, having already walked 
           Jefferson and Edison through the calculations that brought 
           him here:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        ... at which point I was reminded 
                        of one of Abe’s favorite 
                        algorithms, a variant of Dijkstra's 
                        formula but without a min-priority 
                        queue or unbounded nonnegative 
                        weights.  That algorithm, combined 
                        at its single destination vertex 
                        with a heap data structure rooted 
                        in the Fibonacci sequence indicated 
                        that the answer lie not in a 
                        tridigital cipher, as I initially 
                        suspected, or even in the 
                        fractionated morse cipher that 
                        later became Abe’s signature, but 
                        an alphanumeric cipher unlike any 
                        previously recorded.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                        When extrapolated through a dual-
                        node minimum spanning tree, that 
                        cipher’s definition revealed 
                        itself:

           Washington points to a large, double-underlined line in the 
           center of the chalk board:

                                        A = 1

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        A is the first letter of the 
                        alphabet.  Which means it is letter 
                        ‘number one.’  Therefore, A equals 
                        One.

           Jefferson gasps in appreciation.  Edison claps softly.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        And if ‘A equals One,’ then...

           Washington shifts to the next line on the board, also double-
           underlined:

                         AMERICA = 1MERICA = 1 MERICA

           Jefferson slaps his forehead with an open palm.  Edison 
           nearly loses his balance; he has to lean on Jefferson for 
           support.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        ‘America’ equals ‘One Merica.’  
                        Now.  Does that word ‘Merica’ ring 
                        a bell with either of you?

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Yes, but... but... hellions!  I 
                        just can’t place it!

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Maybe this will jog your memory:

           Washington unfurls a LARGE MAP.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        I zoomed in on our map of 
                        Gettysburg.  This is ten times 
                        magnification.
           Sure enough, right there on the map, a SINGLE STREET is now 
           visible running through the center of Gettysburg.  That 
           street’s name?  You fucking guessed it.  MERICA. 

           Washington FLIPS THE CHALKBOARD, revealing a SINGLE LINE OF 
           WRITING that traverses the entire board:

                            1 MERICA ST.

           Jefferson emits a high SQUEAK then audibly shits himself.  
           Edison feints.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen.  I give you the 
                        Gettysburg Address.

           EXT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - NIGHT

           Washington, Jefferson and Edison load up Clyde, Revere’s 
           horse.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        How much time do we have until the 
                        top secret meeting?

           Edison checks the rudimentary watch strapped to his wrist.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        An hour.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Just how accurate is that 
                        contraption, Edison?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        It’s an atomic clock, asshole.  
                            (beat)
                        Pretty accurate.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Then we haven’t the time to bicker.  

           All three men mount the horse, then all three men start heel-
           kicking the horse simultaneously.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Clyde.  To Gettysburg!

                                                              CUT TO:
           CLOSE ON THE THREE MEN

           Staring just past the camera, dumbfounded to the man.  After 
           a long silence:

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        I guess we, uh.  I guess we should 
                        have scouted the area.

           REVERSE ANGLE:

           The men still sit atop Clyde, who has come to a rest just 
           beside a large roadside sign:

                             WELCOME TO GETTYSBURG

                          If You Lived Here You’d Be Home By Now

           Beyond the sign, a single DIRT ROAD (MERICA ST) comprises the 
           entirety of the city.  There is only one building on the 
           road, and therefore in the city: An ENORMOUS, GAUDY MANSION 
           that is currently BUZZING WITH REDCOATS.

           1 MERICA ST.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Yeah, well, you know.  Hindsight, 
                        or whatever.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        How on Earth are we going to gain 
                        entry?

           Washington turns his attention to the THREE REDCOATS loading 
           a cannon into a nearby stagecoach.  All three are dark-
           complected INDIANS(DOT).  Two of them, who are happen to 
           match Washington and Jefferson’s respective body types 
           perfectly, wear traditional redcoat garb (whatever that is).  
           The third wears a near perfect replica of Edison’s robe and 
           pointy hat -- only the Indian’s is RED.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I think I have an idea...

                                                              CUT TO:

           WASHINGTON, JEFFERSON AND EDISON

           Dressed in the Redcoats’ garb and using the butt end of the 
           cannon as a BATTERING RAM on the Secret Headquarters’ heavy 
           front door.  
           Several Redcoats lounge on the porch nearby, baffled (it 
           should be noted that our heroes look absolutely nothing like 
           the Indians whose clothes they now wear, for obvious 
           reasons).

                                 LOUNGING REDCOAT 1
                        What do you suppose Jinder, Dalip 
                        and Ranjin are up to over there?

                                 LOUNGING REDCOAT 2
                        Must have forgot their keys.

           INT. 1 MERICA ST - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A small group of Redcoats play an early version of TABOO.

                                 REDCOAT 1
                            (reading clue)
                        Oh!  OK.  Stone... 

                                 REDCOAT 2
                        Henge?

                                 REDCOAT 1
                        Yes!

           BZZZZT!!  Another Redcoat stands behind the clue-giver, 
           buzzer in hand.  He points at the clue.
                                 REDCOAT 3
                        Dude, you said ‘stone.’

                                 REDCOAT 1
                        Oh, shit.

           BING-BONG!  A sing-songy DOORBELL echoes out through the 
           house.

                                 REDCOAT 1 (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get it.

           The Redcoat stands, walks into

           THE VESTIBULE

           Where he leans in close to the front door.

                                 REDCOAT 1 (CONT’D)
                        Who is it.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (O.S.)
                            (muffled, through door)
                        Yeah hi I have a delivery here?

                                 REDCOAT 1
                            (suspicious)
                        A delivery for who?

           Beat.  Whispers can be heard through the door.  Finally:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (O.S.)
                            (muffled, through door)
                        Uh... Nigel?

                                 REDCOAT 1
                        Oh, great.  That must be my cricket 
                        bat thing I ordered.

           The Redcoat opens the door...

           ... and Jefferson instantaneously leaps in, slaps a STICKY 
           LANDMINE to the Brit’s face.

                                 REDCOAT 1 (CONT’D)
                            (muffled)
                        Shit!

                                 REDCOAT 2 (O.S.)
                        Swear jar, Nigel!

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Down!!!!
           Jefferson ducks, as do Washington and Edison behind him, just 
           as Nigel’s HEAD EXPLODES ALL OVER THE FOYER.  The entire 
           house TREMBLES with the explosion.

           Using hand signals, Washington gestures to different parts of 
           the house, commanding his soldiers in perfect silence.  They 
           split up: Jefferson upstairs, Edison right, Washington left.

           THE ASSAULT IS ON.

           And man alive, is it violent (but it’s in the ‘style of 300,’ 
           obviously, so it doesn’t really count):

           EDISON

           Races through first the DINING ROOM and then THE KITCHEN, 
           flinging lightning bolts haphazardly as he goes.  Some of his 
           blasts catch unexpecting Redcoats center mass; those men 
           EXPLODE in a RAIN OF INNARDS.  Others miss their mark 
           completely, BLASTING GIANT HOLES THROUGH WALLS, CEILINGS AND 
           FLOORS.  And through it all...

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Science!  Science!  Science!

           JEFFERSON

           Clears a tangle of bedrooms upstairs, clearing out each with 
           some sort of unnecessarily large explosive: A BUNDLE OF 
           DYNAMITE here, a POTATO SACK FULL OF LIVE GRENADES there.  
           When he encounters individuals...

                                 RANDOM REDCOAT 1
                        Dalip, did you hear that?!  I think 
                        the water heater’s --

           ... he dispatches them with either a GLOB OF C4 or an RPG 
           launched from his BAZOOKA PISTOL.

           WASHINGTON

           Marches through the LIVING ROOM and several DENS, wreaking 
           havoc with his MINI-CHAINSAWS.  Most Redcoats FREEZE at the 
           sight of his blood-soaked form:

                        Jinder... you’ve got something on 
                        your jacke--

           Washington springs forward and SUCKER-CHOPS THEM IN HALF.  
           Others, witness to the carnage, actually rush toward him...
                                 RANDOM REDCOAT 3
                        Stop!!!  Jinder!  Your mini 
                        chainsaws are on and you’re killing 
                        all of our friends!!!

           ... and meet even bloodier ends as Washington HACKS THEM LIMB 
           FROM LIMB before PARTIALLY DECAPITATING THEM AT THE MOUSTACHE 
           LINE.

           After a marathon of blood-letting, a crimson-coated 
           Washington finds himself back in 

           THE VESTIBULE

           Where Edison and Jefferson wait for him.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Oh.  Hey.  You guys are done 
                        already?

           The other two nod.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, me too.  And you didn’t find 
                        James, Arnold or Stalin?

           The other two shake their heads.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, me neither.  I guess we 
                        missed the meeting.
                            (beat)
                        Hey did you guys kill everybody?

           The other two nod.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, me too.  
                            (beat)
                        Shit.  Does this mean there’s no 
                        one left in this house who can tell 
                        us what James’ secret plan was?

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON (O.S.)
                        Papa?

           Washington turns to see his now 5 year-old son, CALEBTRON (5, 
           maybe played by a monkey) standing in the doorway.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        CalebTron?  Is... is that you?

           The boy nods, frightened.  Washington drops to a knee, opens 
           his arms wide.  
           CalebTron runs to him, and Washington holds him tight.  Tears 
           stream down both of their faces.  Edison’s and Jefferson’s, 
           too.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        You’ve grown so much.

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        They fed me well, Papa.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You speak so well.  Such a smart, 
                        smart boy.

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        They home schooled me.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Oh.  That’s... uh.  Nice of them.  
                        I guess.  Why would they do that?

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        They started a trust to pay for my 
                        college education.  So they 
                        probably wanted me to be as 
                        prepared as possible when I got to 
                        campus... 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Well, I mean... sure.  But.  Life 
                        isn’t all about ‘book smarts,’ Son.

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        I know.  That’s why they also 
                        taught me basic self-defense, egg 
                        poaching, and how to incorporate my 
                        non-profit.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Your non-profit.

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        We started a charity to end polio, 
                        Papa.  All of us, together!  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Oh.  That’s --

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        Say, Papa.  Whose blood is this all 
                        over you and your friends?

           BEAT.  Washington looks to Edison and Jefferson who, also 
           covered in gore, look to the floor lamely.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Um.  Well...

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        You’re not going to let my friends 
                        sneak attack you tomorrow, are you 
                        Papa?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Say what?

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        They’re my friends, but you’re 
                        still my Papa, and --

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        No, shut up, skip that.  What about 
                        a ‘sneak attack?’

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        You know, the big sneak attack 
                        they’re planning for tomorrow.  
                        Every British soldier in the 
                        colonies is meeting at 9:00AM 
                        tomorrow in Attrition, which is the 
                        next town over.  Then they’re all 
                        going to sweep through DC together, 
                        rounding up and killing every last 
                        rebel.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You’re sure about this?

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                            (nodding)
                        Uncle King James was here earlier, 
                        finalizing the plans.

           Washington takes a deep breath, shares a look with Edison and 
           Jefferson.  So this is it.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Where in Attrition are they 
                        meeting, Son?

                                 CALEBTRON WASHINGTON
                        Soldier Field.

           Washington nods to himself.  Of course.  After a lengthy 
           moment, Washington looks to his colleagues.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Revolution, it seems, has sounded 
                        her call earlier than we had 
                        anticipated.

           EXT. 1 MERICA ST - NIGHT

           Washington, Calebtron, Jefferson and Edison walk away from 
           the Secret Headquarters in SUPER SLO-MO as it EXPLODES BEHIND 
           THEM.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        But no fight of import has ever 
                        been scheduled in advance.

                                                             FADE TO:

           INT. MONTICELLO - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

           Jefferson, exhausted, walks up the iconic front steps of his 
           legendary home.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        So go home.

                                                             FADE TO:

           INT. EDISON’S LAB - NIGHT

           Edison, his face wrought with concern, gently strokes each of 
           his SEVERAL HUNDRED WHITE RABBITS.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        To your friends.  

                                                             FADE TO:

           INT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Washington enters with a tired CalebTron slung over his 
           shoulder.  Martha, weakened and broken by the experience, 
           rushes to them, embraces them.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        To your families.

           As Martha fawns over the safely returned CalebTron, 
           Washington looks out over his domain, pensive...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        Maybe for the last time.

                                                             FADE TO:
           INT. JEFFERSON’S EXPLOSIVES ARMORY - NIGHT

           Jefferson stands to the side of a large, futuristic room, 
           watching as a MASSIVE STEEL CASE RISES FROM THE FLOOR.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        And then...

           The case rises all the way to Jefferson’s waist height before 
           its top retracts, revealing a COLLECTION OF EXPLOSIVES UNLIKE 
           THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.  As Jefferson peruses its 
           contents... 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        ... ready your arsenals. 

           INT. EDISON’S LAB - NIGHT

           Edison stands beside a large wooden table.  He has a variety 
           of MAGIC WANDS spread out before him, but he looks 
           unsatisfied.  

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        Bring not the weapons you would use 
                        to topple men...

           Slowly, Edison turns his head to regard the FRAMED GLASS CASE 
           mounted in the center of the far wall.  It contains only a 
           single wand... but that wand is twice the size of the 
           others... AND RED.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        ... but the weapons you would use 
                        to topple armies.

           INT. WASHINGTON’S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Washington reaches under his bed, withdraws a LARGE, TRI-
           FOLDED POSTERBOARD.  He sets the display up atop the bed, 
           regards it gravely.

           It’s his 7th grade science project.  And its title:

               THE WORLD’S FIRST ATOMIC BOMB

                            BY GEORGIE WASHINGTON

           Is only slightly less eye-opening than the LARGE ATOMIC BOMB 
           STRAPPED TO THE CENTER OF THE POSTERBOARD.  As Washington 
           reaches for the bomb...
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        The weapons you would use to topple 
                        nations.

                                                             FADE TO:

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - NIGHT

           Pelted by a torrential rain, Washington stands before Abe’s 
           tombstone, head bowed.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        For tomorrow, our revolution 
                        dies...

           THE FIRST RAYS OF THE MORNING SUN shatter the darkness, peek 
           over the inky horizon...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (V.O.)
                        ... and America is born.

                                                         MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. SOLDIER FIELD - MORNING

           Where Washington sits astride Clyde, watching the sunrise 
           from atop a LARGE HILL that overlooks the vast field.

           He turns slightly at the sounds of advancing horses: Edison 
           and Jefferson approach, now riding steeds of their own.  
           Edison holds out a STARBUCKS CUP to Washington.  Jefferson 
           already has one.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Nonfat latte.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Thanks.

           Washington takes a sip.  Eyeballs the cup suspiciously.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        This is nonfat?

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        She said it was nonfat.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I don’t think...
                            (takes another sip)
                        ... no, this is definitely not... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                            (smacking lips together)
                        ... this might even be two percent.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Oh man, George, I’m sorry.
                            (to Jefferson)
                        I told you she was new.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Yeah, fuck.  
                            (to Washington)
                        Mine was supposed to have mocha 
                        chips but she put in chocolate 
                        covered espresso beans.  

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Maybe I should go back and have her 
                        fix them.
                            (beat)
                        I should go back, yeah.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Yeah, if you don’t mind.  It’s 
                        just, you know.  We’ve been pretty 
                        busy with this revolution and so I 
                        haven’t really been eating that 
                        well.  Or not as well as I’d like, 
                        at least, right?  So.  Things like 
                        two percent, if I can avoid it...

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Of course, no, totally understood.  
                        Lemme just run back there and...

           Edison trails off as he becomes aware of the HEAVY RUMBLE 
           echoing out across the field below.  He turns toward the 
           sound...

           ... and DROPS HIS COFFEE.  Washington and Jefferson do the 
           same.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Fuuuuccckkkkkkkkk me.

           BELOW, Soldier Field is being swallowed whole by a TEN 
           THOUSAND MAN ARMY OF REDCOATS.  As far as the eye can see, 
           from the base of the hill clean to the horizon -- RED.  

           NOTHING BUT RED.

           Redcoats with spears.  Redcoats with guns.  Redcoats riding 
           horses.  Redcoats on stilts.  
           Elephants draped in red, carrying huge howdahs (giant people-
           carrying baskets [read a book]) on their hulking backs.  Red, 
           red, red.  Everything is RED.

           Everything, that is, but the GLITTERING GOLD HOVERCRAFT in 
           the center of the swell.  King James stands alone in the 
           unit, looking out over his army, but he’s flanked on one side 
           by Stalin and on the other by Arnold.  Each of these two 
           rides a BENGAL TIGER.

           Needless to say, the overall visual effect of this procession 
           is JAW-DROPPING...

           ... and that’s precisely the effect it’s had on our heroes.  
           They watch from their perch, hope deflating, as the army 
           marches across Soldier Field below.  They clearly were not 
           expecting a showing this impressive.   

           Finally, Washington turns back to the other two.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I’m not going to sugar-coat this.  
                        Three against ten thousand... 
                        that’s pretty bad odds for us.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                            (trying to be positive)
                        We have the high ground.

           Washington ignores Jefferson’s comment, reaches into his 
           saddlebags...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I made these last night.  I hoped 
                        that they might inspire us on the 
                        field of battle today.
                            (a downcast beat)
                        Now I pray that they do.

           ... and withdraws three AMERICAN FLAG BASEBALL JERSEYS.  
           Jefferson GASPS as Washington hands them out.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        George.  They’re... they’re 
                        majestic.  This design...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Abe’s own.  

           George turns his own jersey over in his hands for a long 
           moment, thoughtful.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        My dream -- as silly as it seems 
                        now -- was that after God led us to 
                        victory today, this design would 
                        become a national symbol: The first 
                        ever American Flag.

           Jefferson and Edison don the jerseys, inspired.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        Yes!  A symbol of our indomitable 
                        spirit!

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Of our tireless quest for 
                        righteousness!

           Washington looks up at his compatriots, both surprised and 
           THRILLED at their ceaseless patriotism. 

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Yes!  Yes, exactly!

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        A symbol of everything that is... 
                        AMERICA.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (feeling the flow)
                        And, and... this style of blouse, 
                        which I invented last night, will 
                        become the uniform of the first 
                        ever American National Pastime.  It 
                        will be like cricket, but much less 
                        faggy... and you won’t even have to 
                        be athletic to participate!

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Dynamite!

           A loud CAW overhead.  The three men look up to see a BALD 
           EAGLE circling overhead.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        The National Bird!!!

                     THOMAS JEFFERSON
                                                    THOMAS EDISON
           Boffo!
                                             Huzzah!

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        All we require now is a National 
                        Anthem...
           As if on cue, the first epic riff of “Free Bird” sings out 
           across the hilltop.  The three AMERICANS turn, stunned, to 
           see...

           ... PAUL REVERE, who is now a BIOMECHANICAL CENTAUR, 
           shredding on a DUAL-NECKED ELECTRICAL GUITAR.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                            (singing)
                        If I leave here tomorrow/
                        Would you still remember me?
                        For I must be traveling on, now/
                        'Cause there's too many places I've 
                        got to see.
                        But, if I stayed here with you, 
                        girl/
                        Things just couldn't be the same.
                        'Cause I'm as free as a bird now/
                        And this bird, you can not change!
                        Oh ooo oh ooo oh ooo oh ooo oh/
                        And this bird you cannot change!
                        And this bird you cannot change!
                        Lord knows, I can’t change!!!!
                            (stops playing)
                        I wrote it last night.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (awed)
                        The National Anthem.

           Revere nods.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        If you’ll have it.  If you’ll 
                        have...
                            (gestures to his new form)
                        ... me.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Always, brother.

           Revere bro-hugs each of his old friends.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        I should warn you though, Paul.  
                        The odds are stacked against us 
                        today.  Our numbers, even with your 
                        addition, pale in comparison to 
                        those of our enemy.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        I thought that might be the case.  
                        So I brought some friends.
           Revere gestures for his ‘friends’ to crest the hill, 
           revealing themselves to Washington and company one at a time:

           The first man (30’s, white) wears only GI PANTS, a BLACK 
           BELT, and a WHITE HEADBAND.  He executes a dazzling array of 
           kung-fu maneuvers.

                                 PAUL REVERE (CONT’D)
                        Thomas Jeffersen.  Martial Arts’ 
                        expert.

           The second man (30’s, white) is relatively un-noteworthy, 
           outside of the fact that he’s riding a fully grown 
           TYRANNOSAURUS REX.

                                 PAUL REVERE (CONT’D)
                        George Washingten.  Dinosaur 
                        rancher.

           The third and final man (30’s, white) is enormous, with a 
           BARREL CHEST and MASSIVE HANDS.  He wears spandex tights, 
           rubber boots, and a LUCHADORE MASK.

                                 PAUL REVERE (CONT’D)
                        Alexander Hamilten.  Professional 
                        wrestler.

           Pleasantries are exchanged, and then Washington looks out 
           over his army, which is now seven strong.  He then glances 
           over his shoulder, at the EARTH-QUAKING SEA OF REDCOATS 
           marching across the field below.

           When he looks back at his team, he’s SMILING.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Let’s go start a fucking 
                        revolution.

           EXT. SOLDIER FIELD - DAY

           The British Army marches on, completely oblivious to the fact 
           that they’ve been made...

           ... until it’s way, way too late: 

           OUR SEVEN HEROES STORM DOWN FROM THEIR PERCH, fire in their 
           eyes.  In their hearts.  We momentarily FREEZE-FRAME their 
           approach, just long enough for a title to slam into place:

                      The War of Attrition

           ... and then we’re moving again, and the ASSAULT IS ON:
           The first line of Brits never even see it coming.  

           One moment they’re marching along, picturing the tea and 
           crumpets that await them at home... the next, they’re being 
           torn asunder by MORTAR FIRE, by MINI-CHAINSAWS, by a RAVENOUS 
           DINOSAUR WITH A DUDE RIDING IT LIKE A HORSE.

           Redcoats are SLICED BY REVERE’S BROADSWORD, ELECTROCUTED BY 
           EDISON’S SCIENCE.  They’re KARATE-CHOPPED BY JEFFERSEN and 
           BODYSLAMMED BY HAMILTEN.  

           It’s a BLOODBATH.

           It takes several minutes of unadulterated PANDEMONIUM before 
           James’ men even realize what’s happening, but once they do, 
           their organization is impressive: They charge the Americans 
           as a unit, A TWO-HUNDRED MAN CRIMSON WALL.

           The Americans give pause, unsure of how best to address this 
           overwhelming challenge.  Ultimately, they decide simply to 
           meet it HEAD-ON; they form a SEVEN-MAN WALL, prepare to 
           charge...

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Hold.

           The Americans look to Edison, who has withdrawn his SPECIAL 
           RED WAND from his robe.  He points it at the fast-approaching 
           Redcoat mob...

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        HOLD!

           The Brits are almost on top of them now.  The Earth TREMBLES 
           with their footsteps...

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        HOLD!!!!

           A SINGLE REDCOAT breaks free from the pack, rushes at 
           Washington with a BUTTERFLY KNIFE OUTSTRETCHED...

                                 THOMAS EDISON (CONT’D)
                        SCIIIEEEEENNNCCCEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           ZZZAAPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           ... and is INSTANTLY EVAPORATED by the blinding red DEATH RAY 
           that EXPLODES from Edison’s wand.  Edison grips the device 
           with both hands, struggling to contain the wild power of the 
           sustained beam, but it’s a near-impossible task: The death 
           ray sweeps right and left, reducing everything it touches to 
           ash. 
           In a manner of several retina-burning seconds, the entire 
           Redcoat wall is INCINERATED.

           ON KING JAMES

           Standing atop his hovercraft, steam pouring from his ears 
           (metaphorically).

                                 KING JAMES
                        Washington.

           He turns to his trusted henchmen, Stalin and Arnold.  Growls:

                                 KING JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Bring me his head.

           The men nod in assent, charge into the fray.

           AND THE BATTLE CONTINUES.

           Washington and his men HACK, BURN and BLAST their way through 
           the British contingent: Revere, now an unstoppable cibernetic 
           force, slashes through the British archers, their arrows 
           bouncing harmlessly off his steel exoskeleton.  Washingten’s 
           T-Rex goes first for the horses and then for the elephants, 
           tearing the smaller animals apart with its mighty jaws.  And 
           Hamilten picks up the pieces, SUPLEXING AND PILEDRIVING 
           stragglers to their deaths.

           It’s an unimpeded march toward James... until the Americans 
           encounter the King’s diabolical lackeys.

           Stalin makes his presence known first, SLITTING JEFFERSEN’S 
           THROAT with a BROKEN VODKA BOTTLE.  The karate master doesn’t 
           have time to so much as gurgle before he falls into the mud 
           underfoot, DEAD.

           Then it’s Arnold’s turn: In a shocking display of 
           fearlessness, he goes right for the T-Rex, engaging the 
           monster in a SNARLING, ROARING SHOWDOWN.  The battle is 
           fierce, but it’s Arnold who lands the killing blow, TEARING 
           OUT THE DINOSAUR’S JUGULAR with his teeth before dispatching 
           its rider, Washingten, with a similar attack.

           Stalin, in the meantime, has honed in on Hamilten; he stalks 
           the wrestler, about to chalk up another kill...

           ... when a MASSIVE BROADSWORD EXPLODES THROUGH HIS CHEST.  He 
           falls to his knees, blood pouring from his mouth, and in 
           doing so reveals PAUL REVERE standing behind him.  Finally, 
           their epic rivalry has met a conclusive end.  Stalin can’t 
           help but smile as the life drains from him.
                                 JOSEPH STALIN
                            (weak)
                        Dasvidaniya, Paul.  Dasvidaniya.

                                 PAUL REVERE
                        Eat a dick, Stalin.

           Revere KICKS Stalin in the back, planting the Russian face-
           first in the mud... for good.  Revere’s still staring at his 
           opponent’s vanquished body...

           ... when a furious Benedict Arnold leaps onto his horse part, 
           starts biting wildly at his neck.  Revere’s exoskeleton 
           protects him from the attack, but Arnold is powerful... 
           eventually he’ll bite through.

                                 PAUL REVERE (CONT’D)
                        The silver bullet!  Use the silver 
                        bullet!!!

           Nearby, Jefferson nods to Washington, who in turn pulls the 
           HALLOWED SILVER BULLET from his coat pocket.  He hands it to 
           Jefferson, who loads it into a long-barrelled pistol...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It’s the only one we have, so make 
                        it count.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        You don’t have to tell m--

           BLAM!  Jefferson accidentally discharges the gun into the 
           crowd.  After a long, stunned BEAT, he turns back to 
           Washington, makes the lamest ‘did I do that’ face in history.

                                 KING JAMES (O.S.)
                        Face it, Washington.  

           Washington turns to find King James hovering nearby, a wry 
           smile on his face.

                                 KING JAMES (CONT’D)
                        The day is mine.

           Washington looks around: indeed, the battle seems to have 
           swung back in the favor of the Redcoats.  A relentless 
           scarlet storm, they close in on the Americans’ diminished 
           numbers, using sheer numbers to overwhelm their opponents.

           Washington turns back to James.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        If it’s my destiny to die on this 
                        field today in the name of 
                        freedom... then so be it.

                                 KING JAMES
                        That’s a retarded destiny.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You’re a retarded destiny.

                                 KING JAMES
                        All the witty comebacks in the 
                        world won’t save you this time, 
                        George.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Then what will save me, James?

                                 KING JAMES
                        My first name is Scott, not James.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Oh.  I thought it was James.

                                 KING JAMES
                        It’s not.  It’s Scott.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I always thought the name after 
                        ‘King’ was your first name.

                                 KING JAMES
                        Sometimes.  It’s convoluted.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You’re convoluted.

                                 KING JAMES
                        OK, that’s it...

           James points an UZI at Washington...

           ... then lowers it as he becomes aware of a DEEP RUMBLING  
           echoing out across the field.  And he’s not the only one: the 
           entire battle has momentarily CEASED as the rumbling 
           intensifies, builds to a BONE-RATTLING CRESCENDO.

           And then, seemingly from everywhere at once, the source of 
           the sound is revealed:
           INDIANS.  THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF INDIANS.  Charging into 
           the battle from every conceivable direction, they lay waste 
           to the surprised Redcoats, turning the tide of the battle 
           instantaneously.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        How in the Hell...

           As if in answer, ANOTHER RUMBLE echoes out... this one from 
           the SKY.  The mystified combatants all look up, awed, at the 
           BIPLANE zooming overhead...

           INT. BIPLANE - DAY

           ... where GERONIMO stands on the wing, nods to the plane’s 
           TWO PILOTS.

                                 GERONIMO
                            (yelling over wind)
                        Orville.  Wilbur.  I owe you one.

           Geronimo then takes a MASSIVE PULL OF JACK DANIELS before 
           LEAPING FROM THE PLANE.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                            (screaming)
                        GERONIMOOOOOOOOOOOOO...

           EXT. SOLDIER FIELD - DAY 

           The entire field watches, rapt with attention, as the drunk 
           Indian falls to the Earth.  

                                 GERONIMO
                            (yelling, a speck in the 
                             sky)
                        ... OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

           Keep in mind they’ve never seen an airplane, let alone...

           FWUMP!  Geronimo’s parachute engages, easing him gently to 
           terra firma.

                                 ENTIRE FIELD
                        Ooooohhhhh!

           A round of applause from everyone -- Americans, Indians and 
           Brits alike.  Then... BACK TO WAR!

           When Geronimo lands, Washington, Jefferson, Edison and Revere 
           are there to greet him.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Geraldo.  Why did you --
                                 GERONIMO
                        It’s Geronimo, you pale-faced dick.  
                        And why?  Because I realized 
                        something: This is my land, and I 
                        don’t need your fucking permission 
                        to defend it.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        OK, that seems fair.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        James!  Arnold!  They’re getting 
                        away!

           And so they are.  Realizing that they’ve no hope of victory, 
           James and Arnold have beat a hasty retreat, shoving aside 
           their compatriots in an attempt to flee the battlefield.  
           Edison takes aim at the retreating Arnold...

           ... but Geronimo steps in front of the scientist.

                                 GERONIMO
                        This is personal.

           Edison nods, steps down.  Geronimo then SNIFFS AT THE AIR, 
           quickly picking up a scent and following it to a nearby 
           REDCOAT CORPSE.  The King of All Indians then drops to a 
           knee, roots around violently inside the dead man’s innards 
           for a moment before finding distraction in the Brit’s COAT 
           POCKET: A FLASK.  

           Geronimo downs the contents of the flask in a single, stomach-
           churning pull, then returns to the man’s guts.  He spends 
           another few seconds disembowling the man before 
           withdrawing...

           ... THE SILVER BULLET.

                                 THOMAS EDISON
                        Your tracking powers... but how...

           Geronimo proudly displays his RECENTLY RE-ATTACHED ARM.  He 
           is, once again, whole.

                                 GERONIMO
                        I went to my plastic shaman, Shlomo 
                        Who Fixes Noses.  He patched me 
                        right up.

           Wasting no more time, Geronimo strings the silver bullet up 
           in his bow, using it in the place of an arrow.  He aims...
                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        I am become Death, Destroyer of 
                        Worlds.

           ... and FIRES.

           SILVER BULLET POV: 

           WE ARE THE BULLET.  We TEAR ACROSS THE BATTLEFIELD, our 
           singular mission as clear as the sky above.  The sun, arcing 
           ever higher across that sky, radiates downward, reflects 
           brilliantly off our PURE SILVER FORM, our FLAWLESS PEWTER 
           HEAD... flawless, that is, until we PUNCH A GORE-SPATTERING 
           HOLE IN THE BACK OF A RANDOM REDCOAT’S HEAD.  Our tour of the 
           cerebellum is short-lived, though; we emerge back into the 
           open in a FINE MIST OF BRAIN MATTER, continuing on our divine 
           course.  We tunnel CLEAN THROUGH THE CHEST CAVITIES OF 
           SEVERAL MORE REDCOATS before finally finding our target: 
           BENEDICT ARNOLD.

           Running as fast as he can, Arnold looks over his shoulder... 
           and in that split second, he recognizes not only our pursuit, 
           but our composition: the unmistakable GLINT of the sun 
           reflecting off PURE SILVER.  He knows, in other words, that 
           we are his death.

           And so he turns back to his course, redoubles his efforts...

           ... but they are in vain.  He is just a man, and WE ARE A 
           SILVER BULLET.  We catch him in seconds, entering his 
           wretched body at the base of his skull, severing his spinal 
           cord, and exiting through his silenced throat.

           And now, our task complete, we speed on.  Only God Himself 
           knows what next lies in store for us and our --

           END SILVER BULLET POV.

           Geronimo watches as Arnold falls to the ground, transforming 
           in his final death throes into his WOLF FORM.  With its last 
           breath, the traitorous wolf emits one final, pathetic HOWL... 
           and then dies.  Silenced forever.

           Geronimo lowers his bow, sated.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        Ich bin ein Berliner.

           Geronimo then turns to Washington.

                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        Only James still escapes.  Go.  
                        Fulfill your destiny.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GERONIMO (CONT’D)
                        Fulfill Abe’s final wish.  We’ll 
                        finish up here.

           Washington turns, watches James’ hovercraft zoom into the 
           distance.  Then, emboldened, he turns back toward Geronimo, 
           places a hand upon the Indian’s broad shoulder.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Thank you, whoever you are.

                                 GERONIMO
                        What?  Really?!

           But Geronimo’s disappointment falls on deaf ears...

           ... because WASHINGTON IS ALREADY GONE.

           ON WASHINGTON

           Riding Clyde at FULL SPEED across the battlefield.  James’ 
           hovercraft is but a GLITTERING SPECK on the horizon, but 
           Washington is determined: he pushes Clyde to his breaking 
           point.  And as he gives chase, Washington reflects back on 
           the journey that brought him here...

                                 DOCTOR (PRE-LAP)
                        This is a very special boy, Mr. and 
                        Mrs. Washington.  

                                                             FADE TO:

           A NEWBORN BABY BOY

           Still attached at the umbilical, held out to his EXHAUSTED 
           AND DEPLETED MOTHER by an UNSEEN DOCTOR.  Washington’s 
           CAVEMAN FATHER stands nearby, emotional.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        He will accomplish great things.

           As she cradles baby George...

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        How can you be sure?

           REVERSE ANGLE: The doctor, JESUS CHRIST (30’s, white), smiles 
           knowingly.

                                 JESUS CHRIST
                        I just have a good sense for these 
                        things.

           Christ then cups his hands together in benediction, bends 
           slightly at the waist...
                                 JESUS CHRIST (CONT’D)
                        Namaste.

           ... and exits.  A BEAT, then Mr. Washington looks to his 
           wife.

                                 MR. WASHINGTON 
                        That’s the last time we save money 
                        by letting the carpenter deliver 
                        our baby.

           BACK TO THE CHASE:

           Invigorated by his flashback, Washington leans forward, 
           improving Clyde’s aerodynamics.  He’s closer to James now, 
           but the chase has led them back into Washington DC at this 
           point, greatly amplifying the degree of difficulty of the 
           pursuit:

           They now must dodge PEDESTRIANS, HORSES, FRUIT CARTS.  

           James takes advantage of the superior maneuverability of his 
           hovercraft, blazing in and out of SIDESTREETS, ALLEYS.  UP 
           AND OVER PARKED CARRIAGES, CONSTRUCTION SITES.  It takes a 
           perfect mental union of horse and man for Washington and 
           Clyde to keep up.

           But keep up they do.  And, impossibly, they don’t just keep 
           up... they catch up:  

           Clyde’s thunderous hooves RATTLE the city, STEAM bellowing 
           from his mighty nostrils, and James’ hovercraft grows from a 
           SPECK to a BLUR to a HOVERCRAFT.

           James, suddenly nervous, engages a number of evasive options 
           built into his royal craft: 

           OIL SLICK!

           Clyde PLANTS ALL FOUR LEGS, rides across the slick like a 
           surfer.

           SMOKESCREEN!!

           Clyde closes his eyes, uses his finely tuned HORSE SENSE to 
           follow James through the fog.

           LOOSE JACKS!!!

           Clyde PICKS UP SPEED, using his momentum to run SIDEWAYS UP 
           AND ALONG A NEARBY WALL, thereby bypassing the deadly jacks.

           ON JAMES
           Watching Washington’s unflinching pursuit in his rear-view.

                                 KING JAMES
                        Curses!  What will it take to stop 
                        you, Washington?!

           Frustrated, James returns his gaze to the road ahead... 

           ... and a WIDE, RICTUS SMILE crests his wrinkled visage.  For 
           his prayers have been answered in the form of a MASSIVE BLACK 
           MONOLITH transecting the path up ahead.

           THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL.

           James activates one of the many LARGE SWITCHES on his 
           instrument cluster...

           ON WASHINGTON

           Watching, heart sinking, as James’ hovercraft LEVITATES 
           VERTICALLY, clearing the fifty foot wall with ease.  With 
           Clyde still galloping at full speed, Washington SWALLOWS 
           HARD.  There’s no way he’s getting over that thing...

                                 MR. WASHINGTON (PRE-LAP)
                        True hunter, Son, overcome any 
                        obstacle.

                                                             FADE TO:

           A PRAIRIE DOG

           Glancing around nervously before vanishing into the 
           protective confines of its BURROW.

           Mr. Washington and an EIGHT YEAR-OLD GEORGE, standing in the 
           center of this open field, turn their attention to the BALD 
           EAGLE watching from a nearby tree.  

                                 MR. WASHINGTON
                        No prey impossible for true hunter.

           After a long moment of careful thought, the eagle takes 
           flight, TEARING FREE ITS PERCH in the process.  The mighty 
           bird then SWOOPS DOWNWARD, plunging the emancipated branch 
           into the rodent’s burrow like a spear.

           When the eagle returns to the sky, the prairie dog hangs limp 
           from its improvised lance.

           Young George can only stare, marvelling at the true wonders 
           of nature...
           ... when his dad HURLS HIS CAVEMAN CLUB into the air, 
           bludgeoning the eagle clean out of the sky.  The club then 
           returns to its owner like a boomerang.  As Mr. Washington 
           collects his kill...

                                 MR. WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        No prey impossible.

           BACK TO THE CHASE:

           Washington nods to himself, emboldened.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (sotto)
                        No prey impossible.
                            (then, to Clyde)
                        You can do it, Clyde.
                            (then)
                        We can do it.  Hah!!!

           Clyde PICKS UP SPEED, RACES TOWARD THE WALL.  Washington 
           hangs on tight, SQUEEZES HIS EYES SHUT.  

           CLOSE ON CLYDE

           Bearing down on the wall, fear in his eyes...

                                 DOCTOR (PRE-LAP)
                        This is a very special foal, Mrs. 
                        Dale.  

                                                             FADE TO:

           A SLIMY, NEWBORN HORSE

           Flailing around in the hay.  An EXHAUSTED AND DEPLETED MARE, 
           the foal’s mother, lounges nearby.   The delivering doctor’s 
           voice booms from O.S.

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        He will accomplish great things.

                                 MRS. DALE
                            (yes, the horse)
                        How can you be sure?

           REVERSE ANGLE: The doctor, SECRETARIAT, smiles knowingly.

                                 SECRETARIAT
                        I just have a good sense for these 
                        things.

           BACK TO THE CHASE:
           Clyde, inspired by the memory of his blessed birth, SQUEEZES 
           HIS OWN EYES SHUT, gives himself over to providence.  The 
           wall rushes forward...

           ... just as a GLORIOUS GOLD HORN GROWS FROM CLYDE’S FOREHEAD.  
           It catches the sun instantly, refracting the solar 
           illumination into a BLINDING BEAM OF LIGHT that blasts a HUGE 
           HOLE in the oncoming wall.  

           Clyde races it through it, none the wiser, only opening his 
           eyes

           ON THE OTHER SIDE

           At which point Washington, too, finally dares look.  He takes 
           in the GAPING HOLE in the Memorial, the glimmering horn atop 
           Clyde’s head...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Holy shit, Clyde!  You’re a very 
                        special horse!

           Clyde beams with pride.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        I gotta call the glue factory and 
                        tell them our deal is off!

           Then, as he dismounts...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Magic like that belongs in dog 
                        food, not glue!!!

           Clyde’s smile fades.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, come on, Clyde.  Why the long 
                        face.
                            (beat)
                        HA HA HA!!!!!  Get it?  Because 
                        you’re a horse?!
                            (then, immediate)
                        OK I gotta run.

           Washington turns back toward the chase, only in this moment 
           realizing that he’s standing...

           AT THE BASE OF THE KING JAMES OBELISK.

           James’ hovercraft is parked nearby, and James himself can be 
           seen SHIMMYING UP THE SIDE OF THE MONUMENT.  
           Washington takes a deep breath, stares up at the top of the 
           obelisk: it’s a seemingly infinite climb.  An insurmountable 
           obstacle.  Yet...

                                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN (PRE-LAP)
                            (soft, pained)
                        George.  You must.  Free the 
                        colonies.    

                                                             FADE TO:

           OUR OPENING SCENE.

           Washington cradles a dying Lincoln in his muscular arms.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        We’ll do it together, Abe.

                                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN
                        No.  George.  Listen.  Free the 
                        colonies.  Found a new country.  
                        Name her...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Name her what, Abe?

                                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN
                            (whisper soft)
                        Name her... America.

           Lincoln’s eyes roll back, his head falling to the side.  
           Dead.  Washington hangs his head for a moment, given over to 
           the heart-wracking pain that envelops him... then he leans 
           his head back, calls to the Heavens:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        ABE!!!!!!!

           BACK TO THE CHASE:

           That’s all the motivation Washington needs.  He runs to the 
           base of the obelisk, wraps his arms and legs around it, and 
           STARTS CLIMBING.

           EXT. THE KING JAMES OBELISK - DAY

           Drenched in sweat, an exhausted Washington pulls himself to 
           the pyramid-tipped top of the obelisk.  James is already 
           there, gazing out wistfully over the city.

                                 KING JAMES
                        It’s a hell of a land, isn’t it?  
                        This ‘New World?’
           Washington stands several feet behind James, wary.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It is.  A land of the free.  Home 
                        of the brave.

                                 KING JAMES
                        That’s stupid.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        No, James.  It’s Democracy.

                                 KING JAMES
                        Men aren’t meant to be free, 
                        Washington!  Don’t you see that!?  
                        They’re meant to work in coal mines 
                        and eat vulgar meat-filled pies and 
                        watch soccer all the time!  That is 
                        the natural order of things.  That 
                        is how human society is meant to 
                        function!

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Maybe.  But not in this country.  
                        Not in... America.

           James turns toward Washington.

                                 KING JAMES
                        So that’s it, then, eh?  Just like 
                        that, this is your country?  

           Washington gestures to the GROWING CROWDS two hundred feet 
           below.  Jefferson, Edison, Revere and Geronimo are clearly 
           visible among the mob.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        It’s over, James.  Your army is 
                        routed.  Your power evaporated.  
                        The only rule you retain is over 
                        your own free will.
                            (beat)
                        Give it up.

                                 KING JAMES
                        Hm.  Let me think about it.

           Washington nods, allowing James a moment to lower his head 
           and think about it.  And he’s not fucking around -- think 
           about it he does, REALLY FUCKING HARD: He furrows his brow.  
           Kneads his hands.  Works on his breathing.  Gazes off into 
           the middle distance.  For SEVERAL COMPLETELY STATIC MINUTES, 
           he thinks.  It’s nigh interminable.  Finally, at a loss...
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Sooooo...   

                                 KING JAMES
                        Fuck off!  I said let me think 
                        about it!  Christ!  This is a big 
                        decision, man!  Really, I should go 
                        home and sleep on it.  Maybe do 
                        like a pros and cons, you know?  I 
                        mean fuck, it’s only out of respect 
                        for you and your time that I’m even 
                        doing this all right here in the 
                        moment, so the least you could do 
                        is show me the same respect and 
                        give me a goddamn second to my 
                        thoughts!

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (chastised)
                        I’m sorry, of course.  Of course.

           James nods, annoyed, then exhales deeply.  Finds his 
           center...

           ... and thinks about it for another several minutes.  Just 
           really turns it over in his head.  It’s maddening.

                                 THOMAS EDISON (O.S.)
                        George!

           Washington looks down to ground level, sees Edison tapping on 
           his atomic watch.  Washington nods: I know, I know.  He turns 
           back to James.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Um.  Your majesty?  I’m sorry to 
                        interrupt, I was just wondering if 
                        you’ve made any headway on the 
                        ‘whether or not to cede control of 
                        the country’ thing.  No big deal if 
                        not, you know, I just wanted to --

                                 KING JAMES
                        Actually.  I have made a decision.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (pleasantly surprised)
                        Oh.  Super.

           As he SLOOWWLLY reaches for the sword looped into his belt...

                                 KING JAMES
                        And I have decided --
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        To fight me?

           Beat.

                                 KING JAMES
                        How did you know that?

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You’ve been reaching for your sword 
                        for the last ninety seconds.  Sort 
                        of telegraphed it.

           James smiles, UNSHEATHS HIS ORNATELY INSCRIBED SWORD.

                                 KING JAMES
                        You’re not as dumb as you look, 
                        Washington.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                            (disappointed)
                        So this is how it’s gonna be.  OK. 
                            (then, unsheathing his own 
                             sword)
                        Let’s get down with the sickness.
           OOH WAH AH AH AH!!

           And so as the musical stylings of Disturbed serenade our ear 
           canals...

           ... THE FIGHT FOR AMERICA BEGINS.

           It’s an epic battle between two world-class...

           ... just kidding.  King James is a monarch.  A fat idiot who 
           has never actually used a sword in his life.  He takes one 
           WILD SWING, throws himself off balance, and FALLS OFF THE 
           EDGE OF THE OBELISK.

           Washington sheaths his sword, walks to the edge, and peers 
           over: Predictably, James has somehow managed to catch the lip 
           with one hand; he now dangles freely two hundred feet above 
           the astonished crowd.  When Washington makes no move to help 
           him:
                                 KING JAMES
                        You would let me fall to my death, 
                        George?  In front of all these 
                        people??  Is that the American Way?

           Washington considers briefly, then...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        You’re right.  That’s not the 
                        American Way.  Give me your hand.

           James smiles, relieved, and stretches his free hand toward 
           Washington.  Washington, in turn, reaches out...

           ... and hands James his SCIENCE PROJECT ATOMIC BOMB.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        This is the American Way.

           Washington then BOOTS JAMES IN THE FACE, sending the King 
           PLUMMETING TOWARD EARTH.  

           He never makes it.  

           Halfway down THE NUKE GOES OFF, EXPLODING IN A BREATH-TAKING 
           DISPLAY OF RED, WHITE AND BLUE FIREWORKS.  The crowd below 
           ERUPTS IN CELEBRATION.

           Feeding off the energy of the people, Washington TEARS OFF 
           HIS AMERICAN FLAG BASEBALL JERSEY, WAVES IT ABOVE HIS HEAD 
           like a makeshift flag.  And, with the people cheering below 
           and the fireworks dazzling above, the First President of the 
           United States of America calls out to all who would hear him:

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        WELCOME.  TO.  AMERICA!!!!!!

                                                        MATCH FADE TO:

           AN ACTUAL AMERICAN FLAG

           Waving in the place of Washington’s jersey.  We are

           EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - DAY

           Where a crowd of MILLIONS has gathered to watch as the King 
           James Obelisk is toppled, to be replaced by an EXACT REPLICA: 
           THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.

           SUPER: 6 MONTHS LATER

           As his glorious monument blots out the sun, PRESIDENT GEORGE 
           WASHINGTON turns to his architect, I.M. PEI.
                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        I think it would be nice to make a 
                        monument for Abe, too.

                                 I.M. PEI
                        No problem.  Same as yours?

           A thoughtful BEAT, then...

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        No.  His should be a statue of him, 
                        sitting there... staring at my 
                        monument.

           Pei nods, scurries off.  George then turns, ascends the back 
           steps of the GARGANTUAN STAGE set up in front of his 
           monument.  

           Jefferson, Edison, Revere and Geronimo await him there, along 
           with a PODIUM, several CLUSTERS OF BALLOONS and a BRIGHT RED 
           CEREMONIAL RIBBON that traverses the entire platform.  A HUGE 
           BANNER hangs overhead:

                                AMERICA - GRAND OPENING!

           Jefferson steps forward, hands Washington a pair of OVERSIZED 
           SCISSORS.  He then starts to retreat, but Washington clasps a 
           meaty hand atop his shoulder, leans in to his ear.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        After the ceremony, let’s kill all 
                        of the Indians.

                                 THOMAS JEFFERSON
                        You got it.

           Washington nods, pleased, then marches to the front of the 
           stage.  He CUTS THE CEREMONIAL RIBBON, to great fanfare, then 
           takes his place behind the podium.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON
                        Happy fucking Fourth of July!!!!

           The crowd EXPLODES IN CHEERS.

                                 GEORGE WASHINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Four score and seven days ago...

           And as Washington delivers the GREATEST SPEECH IN THE HISTORY 
           OF PUBLIC ORATION, we PAN PAST HIM...

           ... past the balloons, the amplifier stacks.  Past Jefferson, 
           Edison, Geronimo...
           ... closing in finally on PAUL REVERE.  Our stoic cyborg 
           centaur.  Whose one robotic eye...

           ... GLOWS BRIGHT RED.

                                                       SMASH TO BLACK.
                   Coming Labor Day…
