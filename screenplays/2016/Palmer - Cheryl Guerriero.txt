           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - MOVING - LATE DAY                   

           Once handsome, PALMER, pushing 40, and spent beyond his 
           years, stares vacantly out the grimy window...  Outside, a 
           HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM practices in an open field...  

           EXT. ROAD - MINUTES LATER

           A desolate stretch of land, a few small homes scattered 
           about... 

           The bus drives off, leaving Palmer behind, duffle bag in 
           hand. He sparks a cigarette and focuses on a small, neglected 
           ranch house. In the driveway is a beat up Chevy. Next door, 
           is a run-down house, in desperate need of repairs.

           Palmer stares at the ranch house, emotional for a beat. 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - PORCH - EARLY EVENING

           A loud KNOCK. Inside, a COUGH is heard. Relentless. Hacking.

                                 VIVIAN (O.S.)
                        I’m coming. Hold ya horses.

           Palmer stands waiting, uncomfortable, until finally --

           VIVIAN PALMER, 70s, appears through the screen door, in worn 
           slippers and black sweatpants. An old navy cardigan clings to 
           her unhealthy frame. She stares at her grandson for what 
           seems like forever. Not thrilled.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                        Well, ain’t this a surprise...You 
                        finally got out.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           The room is old. Yet tidy. The few pieces of furniture, 
           relics. A gigantic television plays to no one. Framed 
           photographs collect dust. A much younger Vivian. A YOUNG BOY 
           in her grasp. A MAN, looking strikingly similar to Palmer... 

           Palmer enters, taking it in. 

           He watches Vivian in the adjoining kitchen as her arthritic 
           fingers bring a nub of a cigarette to her angry lips. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        ...supposin’ you need a place to 
                        stay.
           Her other hand rolls a chicken liver in flour. 

                                 PALMER
                        Just ‘til I get myself straight. 

           Vivian drops the floured liver into boiling oil, weighing the 
           decision. It’s not an easy one.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        I plan on lookin’ for work. 

           Vivian is quiet, eyeing him. Then: 

                                 VIVIAN 
                        I go to church every Sunday. If 
                        you’re livin’ here, that’s where 
                        you’ll be on the Lord’s day.

           OFF Palmer...

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - PALMER’S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

           The floorboards creak under Palmer’s foot. He drops his bag 
           on the bed. 

           The room is lonely, stale looking. A faded HORNETS HIGH 
           SCHOOL FOOTBALL pennant is tacked to the wood paneling. In 
           the corner, is a TV and VCR player. A BOOM BOX sits on a 
           chest of drawers.

           Palmer examines the BOOM BOX, notices a tape inside. Curious, 
           he pops it open as... 

           A VOICE is heard outside. Palmer looks out the window and 
           sees --

           SHELLY, barely 30, long wet blond hair, rail thin, sitting on 
           the front step of her house, in a bath towel. She takes a 
           drag off her cigarette, points with her bare foot...  

                                 SHELLY
                        That one right there, she’s my 
                        favorite, ‘cause I like her pretty 
                        hair...

           Palmer can partially see a CHILD... and a collection of 
           BARBIE DOLLS. 

           Seconds later the screen door bangs open, and JERRY, 50s, 
           plows out, practically knocking Shelly right over.  

                                 JERRY
                        Where the fuck’s my wallet? 
           EXT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - SAME

           Shelly, keeping from falling off the stoop, looks up at him.

                                 SHELLY
                        I don’t know. Look around with your 
                        eyeballs. I didn’t take it. 

                                 JERRY
                        Bullshit you didn’t take it.

           Jerry shoots her a hostile stare, then disappears back inside 
           the house, cursing loudly.

                                 SHELLY
                        Real nice, Jerry. 

           Shelly takes another drag off her cigarette, flicks it away.

           It turns quiet. Finally the door flies open, and Jerry storms 
           past Shelly, walking toward a red truck.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Ya find what you were lookin’ for?

           He flips her the middle finger.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, thanks.

           He gets into his truck. Shelly, now angered, picks up a rock 
           and heaves it at his truck, her towel nearly falling off. 
           Dust kicks onto her body...

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Asshole.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - PALMER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer watches Shelly head back into her house, brushing past 
           her son, SAM, 7, a small boy with kind eyes, holding a BARBIE 
           DOLL.

           Palmer stares at the boy, closely. Beat. Sam returns to 
           playing with his dolls.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vivian sits at the table, eating. Palmer enters. 
           A plate has been set for him on the table. Palmer sits down 
           next to Vivian. It’s awkward. He grabs a pitcher of sweet tea 
           and re-fills Vivian’s glass, then his.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Thank you.

           Beat. Palmer takes a thirsty sip. 

                                 VIVIAN (CONT’D)
                        Your things are in the closet. I 
                        thought about throwin’ it all out 
                        in the trash... But it’s still in 
                        there, if you want ‘em.

           Palmer nods. Eats slowly. Vivian takes one last bite, washes 
           it down with tea, then she abruptly stands. A bit unsteady. 
           Palmer reaches to help, she waves him off.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT’D)
                        I’d appreciate you doin’ the 
                        dishes.

           She drops her napkin and walks out. Palmer sits by himself, 
           unable to eat. 

           After a moment, Palmer rises, moves to a pantry closet. It’s 
           stocked with cans of CAMPBELL’S SOUP and BOXED ITEMS. He 
           finds what he’s looking for and sits back down at the table.

           Palmer pours Tabasco all over the liver, eats hungrily.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Palmer finishes brushing his teeth, cleans his toothbrush 
           thoroughly, opens the medicine cabinet to store it. His eyes 
           land on prescription bottles lining the bottom shelf. 

           Palmer places the toothbrush on the top self. Shuts the 
           medicine cabinet. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer exits the bathroom and hears music. He walks out to 
           the living room, watches Vivian through the screen door, 
           sitting on the porch listening to the radio... He lingers, 
           debating... Finally, he walks to his bedroom.

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           The sun is strong. We hear movement inside the house...
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME

           Palmer enters the kitchen. He helps himself to a glass of 
           faucet water. Vivian stares inside the open pantry closet --

                                 VIVIAN
                        Things just walk away in this 
                        house. I swear I had a can of 
                        tomato soup in here. You take it? 

                                 PALMER
                        No, ma’am.

           Vivian moves to a cupboard, searches through it.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        That old Chevy work?  

                                 VIVIAN
                        It works. Not much gas in it.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Palmer scoops up the keys. Nearby is Vivian’s purse. Her 
           WALLET, in plain view. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           The front door SLAMS. Vivian looks back and notices her 
           wallet. Her face tells us money may be missing. Unwilling to 
           find out, she returns her attention to the stove. 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Palmer walks to the Chevy, sparks a cigarette. His eyes 
           momentarily land on the house next door. No sign of the woman 
           or the kid. He gets behind the wheel of the car, drives off.

           INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY

           Palmer sits opposite a PAROLE OFFICER, 50s, who writes in a 
           file. On the wall is an ALABAMA state emblem.

                                 PAROLE OFFICER
                        Where you livin’?

                                 PALMER
                        One twenty-one Twin Road.
                                 PAROLE OFFICER
                        Whose address is that?

                                 PALMER
                        Grandmother. Vivian Palmer.

           The Parole Officer writes it down.

                                 PAROLE OFFICER 
                        You got a job?

                                 PALMER
                        No, sir. 

           The Parole Officer makes another mark and closes the folder.

                                 PAROLE OFFICER
                        Find one. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Palmer pees into a plastic cup. Finished, he hands it to a 
           MAN behind him, walks out.

           EXT./INT. TOWN/CHEVY - LATER 

           The Chevy pulls into town. Passing a BANK on its way in.

           Palmer’s eyes linger longer than they should.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           The Chevy pulls into a parking spot. Palmer exits and steps 
           onto the sidewalk. Taped to store front windows are POSTERS 
           of HORNETS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. 

           Palmer walks past a few shops with little interest, then sees 
           a PAWN SHOP. He stares at the window. Closely eyeing a FENDER 
           TIM ARMSTRONG HELLCAT, in mind condition.  

           He moves on, stops to glance at a community board hanging 
           outside the post office. Flyers are stuck to the worn cork. 
           EGGS FOR SALE. BIBLE LESSONS. GARAGE SALE.

           SIBS, black, small in stature, somewhere in his 50s, appears. 
           He tacks a new card to the cork. 

                                 SIBS 
                        You lookin’ for work?

           Palmer notices the card: JANITORIAL ASSISTANT NEEDED. 
           Then he notices Sibs. Mostly his dark skin.

                                 PALMER
                        No.

           Sibs holds his look and smiles knowingly. 

                                 SIBS
                        You take care.

           Palmer walks off. Sibs watches him go. 

           INT. BAR - DAY

           Air conditioning blows from a dirty window unit. Country 
           music plays from a Juke Box. Palmer takes a seat at the bar. 
           A few DRUNKS occupy other stools. The BARTENDER, late 50s, 
           veteran of the place, approaches. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I get you?

           Then at closer inspection...

                                 BARTENDER (CONT'D)
                        Eddie?

           Palmer nods. The Bartender stares at him. It’s been awhile 
           and the last time he saw him...

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Well...you’re finally legal. 

           He puts a glass in front of Palmer and fills it with Bourbon.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        It’s on the house. 

           INT. BAR - BATHROOM - HOURS LATER

           Palmer, drunk, pees into the urinal. He catches his 
           reflection in the mirror. A long reflective beat. 

           INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

           Palmer exits the bathroom. A MAN, Palmer’s age, grease 
           stained clothes, occupies his stool. Another MAN, shorter, 
           hyper, stands at his side. Palmer watches them for a beat. 
           Walks over.
                                 PALMER 
                        You mind, pal. I was sitting there. 

           The man, DARYL REED, turns, ready for a fight.

                                 DARYL
                        What’d you say?

           His friend, NED, instantly recognizes Palmer.

                                 NED
                        Holy shit. Fuckin’ Palmer. 

           Daryl looks at Palmer --

           TIME CUT -- LATER 

           Empties are lined up on the bar. 

                                 DARYL 
                        ...shit, remember that game in 
                        Rocport. That son of a’bitch kept 
                        pullin’ my face mask...he rushes 
                        the line and boom!
                             (to Ned, off Palmer)
                        Palmer threw that ball so hard into 
                        his balls -- his face turned blue! 

           Daryl and Ned crack up. Palmer takes a swig of beer, manages 
           a smile. 

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        You know your record was only broke 
                        a few years ago. 

           Palmer looks at him. Quiet. Then curious...

                                 PALMER
                        How many he throw?

                                 DARYL
                        A hundred...a hundred and fifteen.

           Palmer nods. Disappointed. It was the only thing he had.

           COLES, 30s, protruding belly over his regulation police 
           uniform, walks in. He stops at the sight of Palmer. Both 
           happy and nervous. 

                                 COLES
                        Shit, when’d you get out?
                                 PALMER
                        A few days back.

           They stand, uncomfortable. More so for Coles.

                                  COLES 
                        You need anything, you let me know. 

           Daryl rises and heads to the bathroom.

                                 DARYL
                        I need somethin’. I need your old 
                        man to stop giving me goddamn 
                        parking tickets!

                                 COLES
                        I don’t wanna hear it! C’mon, Ned. 
                        Let’s get a game in before the wife 
                        calls.

           Ned follows Coles to the pool table. Palmer finishes his 
           beer. He sits there alone and feels every bit of it.

           The door opens, and Shelly enters the bar. Her hair, make-up 
           and clothes looking pretty.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What do you want?

                                 SHELLY
                        I want my nails done and my ass 
                        waxed, what do you think I want? 
                        Gimme a Jim and coke.

           The Bartender walks off, annoyed. Shelly notices Palmer.

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        You’re Vivian’s grandson, ain’t ya? 
                             (off Palmer’s silent 
                              stare)
                        What’s the matter, handsome, you 
                        don’t talk?

           INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Sun streams through dirty plastic blinds. Palmer wakes. Hung 
           over. No idea where he is. Until he sees Shelly’s naked body 
           next to him. He grabs his smokes off a cluttered dresser and 
           pops one into his mouth. Palmer lights it, steps out of bed, 
           naked. He slips into his jeans.  

           Shelly stirs, rolling over, as...  Palmer leaves the room.
           INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer walks past a couch and coffee table. His eyes land on 
           a can of CAMPBELL’S TOMATO SOUP, spoon in it, on the floor. 

           EXT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The screen door slams behind Palmer. He stares at the Chevy, 
           parked haphazardly in Vivian’s front yard. He stops to zip up 
           his fly. The cigarette dangling from his lips.

           He looks up and sees... 

           Vivian and Sam staring right at him. They hang clothes on a 
           backyard line. 

           Palmer locks eyes with Vivian. He takes a pull off the 
           cigarette and keeps walking. Vivian watches him disappear 
           inside the house. Her narrowed eyes stay on him --

                                 VIVIAN
                        Sam, hand me that shirt.

           Sam grabs a shirt from a basket. They continue hanging 
           clothes. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Vivian, dressed in church clothes, fills a container with 
           cooked food. She checks the time. Grows angry.

           She leaves the kitchen, heads down the hall... 

           Vivian barges into Palmer’s darkened bedroom. Paying no 
           attention to Palmer who is passed out under the sheets. 
           Vivian roughly pulls open the shades -- shedding light into 
           the room. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        We’re leaving in fifteen minutes. 

           INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Sam emerges. A gentle looking, young boy.

           He wears a clean shirt, tiny tan shorts and white sneakers. 

           He moves to his mother who sits slumped on the couch, 
           smoking. He hands her a Barbie doll with a missing foot. 
                                 SAM
                        Don’t forget?

                                 SHELLY
                        No, I won’t. Nap time at noon.

           Sam eyes his mother, closely. Something tells us he’s afraid 
           to leave her alone. Shelly picks up on this. She takes a drag 
           off her cigarette. Examines the doll.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        You know who your dolly looks like?

           Shelly sits up, straightens the doll’s bright pink dress, 
           fixes its blond hair, then looks at Sam who doesn’t seem to 
           have a clue. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Miss Teen Honey Bee?

           Sam smiles, wide.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        That’s right... And I wore a dress 
                        just as pretty and pink as this. 
                        And my hair was done up jus’ as 
                        gorgeous as hers. And I was wearing 
                        the most beautiful pair of shoes. 
                        Although, I had both my feet.

           Sam giggles.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        And I walked onto that stage, 
                        lookin’ so smart and special. And 
                        whose name did them judges call?

           Sam loves this story.

                                 SAM
                        Yours!

                                 SHELLY
                        Tha’s right. 

           Shelly smiles. Sam stares at his mother, proud. Shelly puts 
           the doll down, fixes Sam’s collar. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        A’right. Miss future Teen Honey 
                        Bee’s gonna stay here with me. And 
                        you go get your church on... 
           Sam gives his mother a big hug and runs out the door, happy. 
           Beat. Shelly picks up the doll, eyeing it as she takes a drag 
           off her cigarette. 

           Tucked in the corner of a shelf, we see a trophy collecting 
           dust. It wasn’t a lie.

           INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS

           Sam hops in the back seat, slams the door. Vivian is in the 
           passenger seat.

                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian, why are you sitting 
                        there?

           Vivian doesn’t answer. Through the windshield we see Palmer 
           emerge from the house. 

           Finally, Palmer slides behind the wheel. He starts the car. 
           Turns ON the radio. Vivian watches Palmer as he switches the 
           radio from AM to FM, awkwardly searches for a song --

                                 VIVIAN 
                        Sam, this is my grandson, Eddie. 
                        Although I’m sure he prefer you 
                        call him Palmer. Even if Eddie’s a 
                        much nicer name.

                                 SAM
                        I like Palmer. 

           Palmer dials past a Latino station, a LADY GAGA song, lands 
           on Rush’s “Tom Sawyer.” He decides to leave it there.

           They drive off.

                                 VIVIAN
                             (more to herself)
                        A last name should be used as a 
                        last name, not a first. 

                                 SAM
                        Maybe he doesn’t like his first 
                        name. And that’s why he uses his 
                        last name. Do you like your first 
                        name?

                                 PALMER
                        No.
                                 SAM 
                        See! I told you, Miss Vivian, he 
                        don’t like it.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I ain’t into arguing, Sam. Now roll 
                        that window up. It took me two 
                        hours to do my hair. 

           Sam giggles and rolls it up.

                                 SAM
                        You got your hair up high today.

                                 VIVIAN
                        What hair I got left.

           Sam rises off his seat. Looks down at her hair. And gently 
           pats it.

                                 SAM
                        Don’t worry - I can’t hardly see 
                        the bald spot. It looks real 
                        pretty.

           He sits back down. Vivian looks pleased. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        Thank you, Sam.

           Sam smiles up at Palmer in the rear view mirror. He looks 
           happy. Palmer, silent, turns back to the road. 

           INT. CHURCH - MORNING

           Sam leads Vivian and Palmer to their usual pew seats. A few 
           whispers and curious eyes follow Palmer. Vivian pridefully 
           says her hellos. She forces a few to acknowledge Palmer, who 
           offers an uncomfortable nod in return to their now welcoming 
           gestures.

           We see Daryl with his YOUNGER WIFE, 10 month-old BABY, 
           another young CHILD, and 8 year-old boy TOBY. 

           Coles sits next to his pretty wife, LUCILLE, and daughter 
           EMILY, 7, in a pink dress, who exchanges a smile and wave 
           with Sam.

           Palmer, grateful to be seated, catches a glimpse of Ned, 
           looking miserable, alongside his older MOTHER. 
           EXT. CHURCH - YARD - AFTERNOON

           The congregation is enjoying a picnic. Vivian is amongst 
           those doling out the food. Sam, happy, runs off with Emily. 
           Toby runs around with other BOYS, throwing a football.

           Palmer stands off by himself. Smoking. 

           Coles makes his way to Palmer. He hesitates, then --

                                 COLES
                        Look, I just wanted to say I 
                        should’a visited. Or at least sent 
                        you a letter. 

           Palmer drops his cigarette. Stamps it out.

                                 PALMER
                        Forget it. 

           He gives Coles a look. It’s done. Ned wanders over. 

                                 NED
                        What’s going on, fellas?
                             (stops, off Sam)
                        There is something wrong with that 
                        boy.

           Palmer turns and sees Sam twirl dramatically. Emily claps.

                                 NED (CONT’D)
                             (to Coles)
                        He could be your kid. You had a 
                        piece of his momma, didn’t ya?

           Ned cackles. Coles shoves Ned, hard. He looks to see where 
           his wife is.

                                 COLES
                        Why you gotta be so stupid?!
                             (annoyed)
                        Besides, that was before I was 
                        married.

                                 NED
                        No, it wasn’t.

           A loud voice grabs their attention --  

           Daryl, drunk, aggressively shoves his hulking son, JAKE, 17, 
           who does not fight back. 

                                 DARYL
                        Come on, big man!  
           Daryl’s EX-WIFE, DARLEEN, 30s, attacks him. 

                                 DARLEEN
                        Stay away from him!

           Daryl is about to cold cock her, when Coles and a few men 
           grab him. Daryl breaks free and stares at the gathered crowd.

                                 DARYL 
                        What the hell you’all looking at?!

           Daryl stalks off.

           INT. CHEVY - LATE DAY

           Palmer drives. Sam sits in the back. He waves to Emily, as 
           she disappears into her car. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        Darleen was right to leave him. 
                        Daryl Reed is nothin’ but trouble. 
                        Just got better luck than you.

                                 SAM
                        Toby Reed’s nothin’ but trouble, 
                        too. And he has bad luck, ‘cause 
                        he’s always in the Principal’s 
                        office....He’s kinda stupid.

                                 VIVIAN
                        He’s slow, honey. Not stupid.

                                 SAM
                        What’s slow mean?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Means it ain’t his fault. 

                                 SAM
                             (gives it thought)
                        No. He’s jus’ stupid.

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LATE DAY

           Palmer opens Vivian’s car door and helps her out. She hands 
           Sam a plastic container of food. 

                                 VIVIAN 
                        You give this to your momma. Make 
                        sure she eats it.
                                 SAM
                        Yes, ma’am.

           He takes the container and hugs Vivian.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Sweet boy.

           Sam turns to Palmer and hugs him. Palmer stands frozen in his 
           grip, uncomfortable. 

                                 SAM
                        Night, Palmer.

           Sam runs off into his house.

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Palmer sits on the porch, smoking a cigarette and getting 
           drunk. In his lap is a folded newspaper. He momentarily puts 
           the beer aside and circles a HELP WANTED listing.

           Laughter grabs his attention. He looks up and sees Shelly 
           exit her house. The man from earlier (JERRY), follows after 
           her. They hop in his red truck and drive away.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Vivian sits on the couch, watching her shows. Palmer enters. 
           He grabs the car keys, about to head out the door.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I need some things from the mart. 

           She holds out a grocery list. Palmer is about to walk away.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                        Hold on. Let me give you money. 

           Palmer waits, embarrassed. Vivian fumbles around her purse. 
           It seems to take forever. Finally, she hands Palmer money, 
           and he exits. 

           INT. GROCERY MART - LATER

           Palmer waits, as the female CLERK rings up his groceries. 
           Palmer’s eyes glance to a sign: CASHIER NEEDED.

           The Clerk follows Palmer’s stare.
                                 CLERK
                        You wanna application?

           Palmer looks at her...he shakes his head no. She continues 
           ringing up the groceries.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Palmer enters, carrying two brown bags. Vivian sits facing 
           the TV. Sam stands behind her, brushing her hair. Beside the 
           couch is a small, brown, beat-up SUITCASE. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        His momma run out again. He’ll be 
                        staying with us.

           Sam holds up a mirror to Vivian’s face.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                        I think I need a ‘lil color. 

           Palmer watches Sam grab Vivian’s makeup bag off the floor and 
           hand it to her. Sam once again holds up the mirror as Vivian 
           applies bright red lipstick to her lips. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - PALMER’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Palmer lies on top of the bed. Smoking. There’s a knock on 
           the door. Then it opens. Sam stands in the doorway. He stares 
           at Palmer. Tentative. Then he enters.

           Sam sits down on the bed, holding two Barbie Dolls. 

                                 SAM
                        My friend Emily gave these to me. 
                        Every time she gets a new doll, I 
                        get her old ones. Her dog chewed 
                        this one.

           He holds up the doll with the missing foot. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        It’s still good, though. She jus’ 
                        has to hop a lil’.

           He hops the doll across the bed. A cute laugh escapes him.

                                 PALMER
                        You know you’re a boy, right?

           Sam nods. 
                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Boys don’t play with dolls.

                                 SAM
                        Well, I’m a boy. And I do. So, 
                        you’re wrong.

           Sam shoots him a look.

                                 PALMER
                        Get out.

           Sam moves off the bed. He slowly leaves the room. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Palmer barely touches his food as he drinks a beer. Sam 
           watches him curiously. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        Sam’ll take your room. You can have 
                        the couch. 

                                 SAM
                        I don’t mind the couch, Miss 
                        Vivian. I sleep on it at home.

                                 VIVIAN
                        A boy your age should sleep in a 
                        bed. 

                                 SAM
                        I don’t mind. I can watch the TV. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        No, you will not. 

                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian?

           Vivian looks at him. He motions to his Barbie Doll, with the 
           one missing foot, that is propped in the seat next to him. 
           Vivian places a saucer down.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           Sam places a piece of food on it. Palmer kills his beer.

                                 VIVIAN
                        So when you gonna give me the rest 
                        of the change from the mart? I was 
                        short. Three dollars.
           Palmer holds her look. Anger visible. She says nothing. Waits 
           for her change. Palmer rises and grabs change and a receipt 
           off the counter. He slaps both down in front of her.

                                 PALMER
                        Count it. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        I don’t need to count it. It’s 
                        short!

           Palmer separates the dollar bills.

                                 PALMER 
                        Seven dollars. And thirteen cents. 

           Vivian looks down at the cash. Crisp bills. It’s possible she 
           miscounted. She looks across the table and sees Sam watching.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Sam, eat your dinner.

           Vivian returns to her meal without an apology. Palmer just 
           stares at her -- then exits. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           ESPN plays on the TV. The Bartender collects a tip. Sibs 
           rises from his stool.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Night, Sibs.

           Palmer enters, takes a seat at the end of the bar. Sibs gives 
           Palmer a passing nod as he exits. The Bartender walks over to 
           Palmer and fills his glass with Bourbon. 

                                 PALMER
                        Leave it.

           They exchange a look. The Bartender, against his better 
           judgment, leaves the bottle behind and walks off.

           EXT. TOWN - NIGHT

           Palmer relieves himself against the alley. Finished, he walks 
           towards the Post Office. He stares drunkenly at the message 
           board. One in particular -- Janitor Assistant. 
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Vivian opens a cabinet. Sam stands next to her, perfectly 
           combed hair and dressed nicely for school. On the counter is 
           his open lunch box, inside are just cookies.

                                 VIVIAN  
                        You need something else in there. 
                        You can’t eat cookies for a meal.

                                 SAM
                        Why not? I like cookies.

           Vivian shoots him a look like “nice try,” then takes out a 
           loaf of bread and starts making him a sandwich. 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Palmer sits down on the porch step and sparks a cigarette. A 
           moment later, the screen door opens, and Sam steps out, 
           holding a “LITTLE PRINCESS” lunch box. 

           Palmer eyes the lunch box. Contempt visible. Sam smiles right 
           at him -- then turns, runs fast to the end of the driveway, 
           where a school bus arrives.

           EXT./INT. PARKING LOT/CHEVY - DAY

           The Chevy crawls to a stop. The engine shuts off.

           Palmer, clean shaven, nicely dressed, stares out the window. 
           Through the windshield we see an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. Palmer, 
           building his courage, takes a swig from a bottle. 

           He contemplates leaving, then without further thought, exits.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - DAY

           Palmer makes his way down the empty hallway. He arrives at a 
           door marked “JANITOR” and knocks.

                                 SIBS (O.S.)
                        Door’s open.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - JANITOR’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer enters. Sibs, looking more academic than service 
           worker, sits behind a desk, laboring over paperwork.
                                 PALMER
                        I’m Eddie Palmer. We talked on the 
                        phone.

           Sibs faces him. There’s a moment of recognition, followed by 
           tension. Sibs hands Palmer an application and a pen. 

                                 SIBS 
                        Fill this out.

           Palmer awkwardly takes a seat. 

           Moments later, Palmer, sweating, hands back the paper. Sibs 
           scans over the application. Where it says “convicted of a 
           felony,” it is marked yes. Sibs reads the “please explain.” 

                                 SIBS (CONT'D)
                             (matter of fact)
                        You got plenty of experience. 
                        Laundry, kitchen, yard. 

                                 PALMER
                        They liked to put us to work.

                                 SIBS
                        Free labor, right?

           Palmer doesn’t answer.

           Sibs puts the application down, rubs his jaw. Less concerned 
           with what is on it, and more concerned with Palmer.

                                 SIBS (CONT’D)
                        You sure you want this job? It 
                        barely pays minimum wage. 

                                 PALMER
                        It pays. That’s good enough.

           Sibs glances at the application, and regardless what he 
           feels, he has to consider it. 

                                 SIBS
                        A’right. Let’s go see Principal 
                        Forbes.

           INT. PRINCIPAL FORBES OFFICE - DAY 

           PRINCIPAL FORBES, a serious man in his late 30s, sits behind 
           a mahogany desk, frowning as he reviews Palmer’s application. 

           Palmer and Sibs sit across from him.
                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        Fifteen years. State penitentiary. 
                        Mr. Palmer, I can’t hire you. I’ve 
                        got the safety of the children to 
                        consider.

                                 PALMER
                        I never did nothin’ to no kids.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        That may be. But you have a felony 
                        record...I’m sorry.

           Principal Forbes is about to conclude the meeting...

                                 PALMER
                        I was young. Barely twenty. I’m 
                        just trying to get an honest job. 
                        If I can’t get one sweeping floors, 
                        then you tell me, what do I do?

           He holds Principal Forbes’ stare, causing him to feel guilty.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES 
                        Mr. Sibs? Your thoughts.

                                 SIBS
                        It’s your call.

           Principal Forbes glances down at the paperwork.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        Palmer. You related to Vivian 
                        Palmer?

                                 PALMER 
                        Yes, sir. She’s my grandmother. 

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES 
                        Vivian’s a respectable member of 
                        our congregation.

                                 PALMER
                        Yes, sir. I attended with her last 
                        Sunday...Beautiful sermon. 

           Sibs smirks.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer sits on the couch, watching TV. Sam enters from the 
           kitchen, where Vivian finishes up cooking.
                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian said it’s time for 
                        supper.

                                 PALMER
                        Ain’t hungry.

           Sam runs back to Vivian in the kitchen. 

                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian. He said he ain’t 
                        hungry.

                                 VIVIAN
                        He can suit himself.

           Sam runs back into the living room. Stands in front of 
           Palmer.

                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian said you can suit 
                        yourself.

           Palmer ignores him. Sam runs back into the kitchen.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Vivian and Sam sit down to eat.  

                                 VIVIAN
                        It’s good he got a job. Now he can 
                        pitch in for some bills. Be self 
                        supportin’.

                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian, you never said you 
                        were sorry.

           Vivian looks at Sam. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        From the other day. When you said 
                        he shorted you. But he didn’t.  

                                 VIVIAN 
                        Drink ya milk, Sam. 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Palmer sits on the porch, smoking a cigarette. The door opens 
           behind him. 
                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian said to give this to 
                        you.

           He holds a plate of food. Palmer doesn’t bother to look at 
           it. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Well, I think you should eat it.

           Sam places it next to Palmer and disappears back inside.

                                 SAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I gave it to him, Miss Vivian!

           EXT./INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE/CHEVY - MORNING

           The sun beats down. Palmer walks to the Chevy, while Sam 
           stands at the end of the driveway, swinging his lunch box, 
           waiting for the bus. Palmer drives past Sam and turns onto 
           the empty road.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALLWAYS - MORNING

           Sibs shows Palmer around the halls. They enter a room filled 
           with cleaning supplies and a sink.

                                 SIBS
                        This is where all our supplies are. 

           They walk down an empty hall, past the bathrooms. 

                                 SIBS (CONT’D)
                        Bathrooms and floors get done every

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - JANITOR’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Sibs and Palmer enter. Sibs places a set of keys on the wall.

                                 SIBS
                        ...we’re the first to unlock the

                        Make sure you get here on time.

                                 PALMER
                             (off the keys)
                        Should I get a set?

                                  SIBS
                        Let’s see how it goes first. 
           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - BATHROOM - LATER

           Palmer mops up puke. Part of the job. 

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - JANITOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Palmer sits in a chair, eating a sandwich. Sibs enters, opens 
           a mini-refrigerator and pulls out a container of tea. 

                                 SIBS
                        The air conditioner in room twelve
                        is busted. Need ya to fix it.

           Palmer rises.

                                 SIBS (CONT'D)
                        Not now. After lunch.

           Sibs swallows some tea. He notices Palmer is without a drink.

                                 SIBS (CONT'D)
                        Want some?

           He offers Palmer the container. Palmer stares at it, then 
           shakes his head no. He chucks his sandwich in the garbage, 
           picks up a tool box and exits. Sibs watches him go and drinks 
           more tea...

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - MAGGIE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           MAGGIE HAYES, somewhere in her early 40s, pretty, walks 
           amongst the hyper CHILDREN, trying to get them to concentrate 
           on the task at hand -- painting. Sam sits in one of the rows. 
           Behind him is Toby, Daryl’s 8 year-old boy. 

           Maggie looks up and sees Palmer standing in her doorway. 
           Surprised, she moves to him. 

                                 PALMER
                        Your air conditioner is broken?

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Yes. Right there in the back.

           Palmer nervously eyes the rows of children he’ll have to walk 
           past to get to it. This is a daunting task for him. Finally, 
           averting the kids’ stares, he moves towards the air 
           conditioner. On one girl’s desk is a huge SNOW GLOBE.

                                 SAM
                             (whispers)
                        Palmer.
           Palmer looks up -- Sam gives him a little wave. And a smile. 
           Palmer looks away, keeps walking... 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                             (to another boy, proud)
                        That’s Palmer.

           TIME CUT -- LATER

           The children now have mud-colored pieces of paper on their 
           desk. Palmer has cool air blowing. Maggie makes her way to 
           Palmer who is packing up. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Thank you. I’ve been asking for a 
                        new air conditioner for ages. But 
                        they keep telling me it’s not in 
                        the budget. Meanwhile, this one 
                        jus’ keeps breakin’ down. 

           Maggie examines Palmer closely.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re new to the school? 

                                 PALMER
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m Maggie Hayes.

                                 PALMER
                        Palmer.

           Their eyes hold for a moment, until something steals Maggie’s 
           attention away. Toby dumps paint on Sam’s picture. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Toby!

                                 TOBY
                        I didn’t do nothin’!

           Maggie moves to Sam’s desk.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Principal’s office.

                                 TOBY
                        But...

                                 MAGGIE
                        I said, now!
           Toby rises from his chair. Maggie’s angry stare follows him 
           out the door. 

           Palmer looks down at Sam’s picture. 

           A splotch of black covers TINY PEOPLE and a CHURCH.  

           EXT. CHURCH - YARD - DAY 

           The congregation fellowships and eats food. Sam and Emily run 
           by. Vivian sits talking with a group of gossipy SENIOR WOMEN. 
           Palmer arrives with a plate of food for Vivian.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Thank you, Eddie. 

           The two share their first, kind look. 

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN ONE
                             (off Sam playing)
                        Vivian, you can’t keep that boy.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN TWO
                        It’s jus’ shameful how his momma 
                        behaves.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN ONE
                        I can’t believe the state hasn’t 
                        already taken him away.

           Palmer hands Vivian a knife and fork. She slices into her 
           meat, watches Sam play.

                                 VIVIAN
                        He ain’t no trouble. Now shush.

           INT. CHEVY - DAY

           Palmer slides behind the wheel. Sam snaps his seat belt 
           closed. Through the windshield, Palmer sees Vivian finishing 
           up a conversation with Principal Forbes. 

           Principal Forbes looks directly towards the Chevy, towards 
           Palmer. 

           Moments later, Vivian is inside the car. Her eyes fixed on 
           Principal Forbes, as he helps his very pregnant and unhappy 
           looking wife into their car. 

           They sit in the car, waiting for other cars to move, before 
           they can drive off --
                                 VIVIAN
                        People have too much to say. 

                                 SAM
                        What he say?

                                 VIVIAN 
                        Sam, stop listening to our adult 
                        conversations.

                                 SAM
                        But...Miss Vivian. I’m in the car?  

                                 VIVIAN
                        Don’t mean you have to listen.

           Sam gives her a confused look, then faces the window. 

                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                             (to Palmer)
                        Principal Forbes can’t stop patting 
                        himself on the back for givin’ you 
                        a job. You ought’a jus’ thank your 
                        lucky stars he even hired you. 
                        Mister high and mighty...
                             (beat, more to herself)
                        Pffftt. We’ll see how high and 
                        mighty he is, when he finds out 
                        that bun in his wife’s oven belongs 
                        to some other baker.  

                                 SAM
                        What bun?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Sam, I said stop listening!

                                 SAM
                        I can’t stop listening, Miss 
                        Vivian, if you keep talking!

           Sam settles back in a huff.

           Vivian looks over at Palmer and one thing that is clear -- 
           she loves Palmer. Palmer smiles, then finally drives off.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - BATHROOM - DAY

           Palmer fixes a broken pipe in the bathroom.
           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - LATER

           Palmer stops at Maggie’s classroom, looks in. She’s teaching. 
           He watches her for a moment, then he catches Sam staring at 
           him. Palmer walks away.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           LITTLE PRINCESS SHOW plays on TV. A YOUNG GIRL dressed as a 
           PRINCESS smiles at us.

           Sam watches-- Drinking soda. Eating cookies.

                                 YOUNG PRINCESS VOICE
                        “...go to our Princess Club 
                        website, enter the secret word for 
                        the day and win a Princess Poster!” 

           Palmer wakes from the couch. Annoyed at the loud TV, Sam. He 
           heads to the bathroom. Sam hides the soda and cookies.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Palmer pees in the toilet and flushes.  

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Palmer returns. He looks into the kitchen. It’s quiet. No 
           sign of Vivian. 

                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian’s still sleeping.

           Palmer looks at Sam, strange. He walks past. Sam follows him.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - HALL - MORNING

           Palmer approaches Vivian’s bedroom door...he pushes it open.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Vivian lies motionless in bed. Palmer enters. He stares at 
           her lifeless body, frozen, a mixture of emotions build.

                                 SAM 
                        Miss Vivian? 

           Sam approaches her body. Afraid.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay. She’s just 
                        sleeping...wake up, Miss Vivian.

           He cries. Begging her. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Please, wake up!

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           A small gathering of PEOPLE including Principal Forbes. Daryl 
           is there with his wife and baby. Palmer stands with Sam at 
           his side. The MINISTER reads a passage from the bible.

           Palmer feels something. Sam is holding his hand. Beat. Palmer 
           allows it and returns his gaze to the coffin. 

           TIME CUT -- MOMENTS LATER

           The elderly women from church offer their condolences to 
           Palmer. Then they walk off, leaving Palmer standing alone.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The room is quite. Empty. Palmer exits the kitchen, sees 
           Vivian’s blue cardigan on the arm of her chair. A tray table 
           next to it.

           He escapes into the hall --

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - HALL / VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sam lies on Vivian’s bed, holding Vivian’s makeup bag. He 
           unzips the bag and pulls out her red lipstick.

           Palmer, in the hall, watches as Sam applies it to his lips... 

           INT. CHEVY - DAY

           Palmer drives. Sam sits in the passenger seat. His suitcase 
           is wedged in the back.

                                 SAM
                        Where we goin’?

           Palmer keeps his eyes on the road. Wherever they are going, 
           it’s not good.
           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           The Chevy parks in front of the Sheriff’s station, as COLES 
           SENIOR, an intimidating older gentleman with a big gut, exits 
           the station wearing a Sheriff’s uniform.

           INT. CHEVY - SAME

           Palmer sees Coles Senior. He waits for him to walk off, then 
           opens the door.  

                                 PALMER
                             (to Sam)
                        C’mon.

           INT. SHERIFF’S STATION - OFFICE - DAY

           Coles looks down at Sam who sits outside his closed office 
           door. His suitcase right next to him. 

                                 COLES
                        How long she been gone?

                                 PALMER
                        A couple weeks.

                                 COLES
                        Vivian had him all this time?

                                 PALMER
                        Yeah.

           Coles looks out at Sam. 

                                 COLES
                        Shoot. Well, I can’t take him home. 
                        Emily alone is a handful. 

           Palmer doesn’t say anything. 

                                 COLES (CONT’D)
                        Leave him... I’ll call child 
                        services and have him picked up. 
                        He’ll go into the system.

           INT. SHERIFF’S STATION - HALL - DAY

           The door opens, and Palmer steps out. He briefly acknowledges 
           Sam who stares after him as he exits. Suddenly it becomes 
           clear to Sam that Palmer is leaving him behind. 
                                 SAM
                        Palmer?

           Palmer keeps walking... 

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           Palmer steps onto the sidewalk. He pulls a cigarette from the 
           pack and lights it. He walks to the Chevy, opens the door -- 

           But he doesn’t get in. 

           Palmer takes a few angry puffs off his cigarette, then looks 
           back at the Sheriff’s station. Annoyed. Torn. Emotions 
           tearing at him.

           Not wanting to be in this position. 

           EXT./INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           The Chevy rolls up to the house. Palmer steps out of the car 
           and yanks Sam’s suitcase from the backseat. 

           Sam runs inside the house...

           Palmer enters and sees Sam standing in the doorway to 
           Vivian’s bedroom. Sam locks eyes with Palmer -- then he 
           closes the door, leaving Palmer standing alone. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           The morning sun shines into the room. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME

           Sam places cookies into his “Little Princess” lunch box. 
           Palmer enters and heads straight for the refrigerator. 

           Sam watches Palmer retrieve a beer, then he clamps his lunch 
           box closed and exits. We hear the front door BANG SHUT.

           Palmer swigs down the beer... 

           INT. BAR - DAY

           Palmer plays pinball as he finishes off a longneck. 
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The TV is on. Sam is fast asleep on the couch, Vivian’s 
           makeup bag right beside him. His suitcase and Barbie dolls 
           are scattered around him on the floor. 

           The headlights of a car break into the room as --

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - SAME

           Palmer, drunk, staggers out of the Chevy...

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Moments later, Palmer enters. He sees Sam sleeping on the 
           couch, eyes the dolls, makeup bag. Reminders of Vivian. Anger 
           and grief build inside him. He staggers into the kitchen...

           When he returns -- he is holding a large trash bag.  

           Palmer walks right past the couch...

           He throws open the drawers and closets.

           Dumps all of Vivian’s belongings into the bag. Framed 
           photographs, a crocheted shawl, magazines, books, anything 
           and everything that is in his eyesight... 

           Then finally, Palmer staggers into the light of the TV. 

           Sam sleeps, undisturbed. Palmer glances down, and something 
           steals his attention. Sticking out of Sam’s suitcase -- is a 
           SNOW GLOBE. 

           The one that was on the little girl’s desk.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Palmer wakes. Feeling every bit of hung over. He exits his 
           room and walks into the living room. The TV is off. No sign 
           of Sam. The room in shambles. Then he remembers --

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Palmer opens one of the garbage cans. It’s filled with 
           Vivian’s belongings. He collects the items, carries them back 
           inside the house. 
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sam hurries through the door, excited. He drops his lunch box 
           on the floor and clicks on the TV. 

                                 SAM
                        Miss Vivian!

           We hear noise in the kitchen. Sam looks up from the floor, 
           expecting to see her, when... Palmer appears. 

           Neither say a word. Sam remembers, Vivian is gone. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Palmer sits at the table, depressed, smoking. Sam, using both 
           hands, carefully pours the contents of a pan into two bowls. 

           Palmer doesn’t touch his food. Sam examines his bowl, then 
           Palmer’s. His has all the tiny meatballs. Sam scoops out a 
           few meatballs from his bowl and drops them into Palmer’s. 

                                 PALMER
                        That’s good.

           Sam dumps in another one.

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        You don’t like the meatballs?

                                 SAM
                        They’re my favorite.

           He smiles up at Palmer. Beat. Palmer, ill at ease with the 
           affection, nods a thank you. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mail is piled up by the door. The TV plays to no one.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME

           Palmer stands in front of the medicine cabinet. He opens it, 
           stares at the row of prescription bottles. A long beat. He 
           grabs one marked ROXICODONE. Already sweating...

           He pops open the lid. A decision is weighed, then Palmer 
           closes the bottle and sticks it back inside the cabinet. 

           A car door SLAMS, then a second door SLAMS.
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer steps into the living room, looks out the window and 
           sees Sam run towards the house, followed by Maggie Hayes.

           Sam enters the house.

                                 SAM
                        Miss Maggie came to visit! 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Palmer emerges. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi. I hope you don’t mind. I gave 
                        Sam a ride. Thought I’d say hello.

                                 PALMER
                        Yeah... I’ll be right out.

           He disappears inside. Maggie stares after him, then focuses 
           on Sam, whose attention is currently on finding a TV show he 
           likes. Maggie looks around the inside the house, closely. 

           She eyes some of the clutter, but nothing seems troubling.  

           Palmer appears holding two beers. Maggie forces a smile.

           TIME CUT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie and Palmer sit on the porch steps. Maggie’s beer 
           remains untouched. Inside, the TV plays with Sam plopped in 
           front of it. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        ...it’s never easy to lose someone. 
                        When Vivian was healthier, she used 
                        to drive Sam to school. She took 
                        good care of him.  

           Palmer takes a swig of beer, remains silent. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        So how long you plan on looking 
                        after Sam?

                                 PALMER
                        It’s just temporary, ‘til his momma 
                        comes home.

           Maggie takes this in. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Sam said you two had a spaghetti 
                        and meatball dinner last night? He 
                        was very excited about that.

           Palmer nods.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s kind what you’re doing for 
                        him. Letting Sam stay here. Not 
                        many people would do that.

                                 PALMER
                        I felt sorry for him, tha’s all. A 
                        kid like Sam... He’s gonna have 
                        problems ‘round here, ‘less he 
                        changes who he is. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sam knows exactly who he is. It’s 
                        everyone else that has the problem.

           Palmer considers this.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, if you need anything, jus’ 
                        let me know.

           Maggie stands to leave. She looks back at the house -- sees 
           Sam inside. We hear him laugh. He sounds happy.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Bye, Sam.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Bye, Maggie!

           Another giggle. Maggie looks up and sees Palmer watching her. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Shelly’ll turn up soon. She always 
                        does.

           And with that she leaves. 

           EXT./INT. HOUSE/CHEVY - MORNING

           Palmer slides behind the wheel. He heads towards the end of 
           the driveway and sees Sam standing by the mailbox, waiting 
           for his school bus. 

           The Chevy slows to a halt...
                                 PALMER
                        Get in.

           Sam jumps in the Chevy. They drive off.

           INT. CHEVY - MOMENTS LATER

           Palmer, feeling he is being watched---looks over at Sam. And 
           he’s right. Sam smiles at him. Swinging his feet. Holding his 
           “Little Princess” lunch box.

                                 SAM
                             (off his lunch box)
                        My momma bought me this. She got it 
                        at a garage sale. She said it was a 
                        bargain, because she got it for 
                        fifty cents. And she said there was 
                        this woman, and her name was Heifer 
                        -- because ‘that old Heifer tried 
                        to steal it out from my momma, but 
                        my momma wouldn’t let her, because 
                        she knew Princesses were my 
                        favorite thing in the whole world.

           Sam smiles. Proud of his story.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Miss Vivian said your favorite 
                        thing was a ratty, old football. 

           This grabs Palmer’s attention.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        She said when you were little like 
                        me, you carried it ‘round like I 
                        carry around my dollies. And you’d 
                        bring it to the dinner table, and 
                        she’d yell at you, ‘cause it was a 
                        dirty, old thing. And then one day 
                        you lost it, ‘cause you wouldn’t 
                        listen to her when she said ‘don’t 
                        bring it to school, Eddie.’ She 
                        called you Eddie, not Palmer. And 
                        she felt bad, because you cried. 

           Palmer looks at Sam -- emotional for a beat.   

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I would’a cried, too, if I lost my 
                        doll. 

           Palmer’s eyes hold on the road.
                                 PALMER
                        I didn’t lose it...It was stolen.

           They drive in silence.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - JANITOR’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Sibs looks up from his desk, surprised to see Palmer enter. 
           Palmer retrieves some tools. 

                                 SIBS
                        I’m sorry about your grandmother.

           Palmer nods. He’s about to exit when...

                                 SIBS (CONT’D)
                        Hold on. 

           Palmer stops. Sibs opens his desk -- pulls out an envelope.

                                 SIBS (CONT'D)
                        It’s your paycheck.

           Palmer stares at the paycheck -- something he is not used to 
           receiving. He takes it, puts it in his pocket and exits.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

           Palmer grabs a beer from the refrigerator and takes a thirsty 
           sip. He glances back at Sam, watching TV, and wonders what he 
           has gotten himself into. 

           He looks out the window - no sign of Shelly’s return. 
           Bothered, Palmer sits down at the table. Not sure what to do 
           with himself he lights a cigarette, grabs a deck of cards and 
           starts playing solitaire.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Sam looks up from the TV, sees Palmer flipping the cards, 
           gets up and walks over.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

           Sam hovers by Palmer’s side.  

                                 SAM
                        What are you playing?
                                 PALMER
                        Solitaire.

           Palmer flips the cards, takes a drink of beer. Ignoring Sam.

                                 SAM 
                        Can I play?

                                 PALMER
                        Nope. It’s for one player.

           Palmer continues. Concentrating on the cards. Sam still 
           stands there, watching. Finally, Sam sits down. Palmer, 
           annoyed, flips another card, then...

           Sweeps the cards into one hand, looks at Sam.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        You ever play poker?

           Sam shakes his head no. Ready to learn. Palmer shuffles the 
           cards. 

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        The object is - to get a better 
                        hand than me.

           Sam looks at his hand compared to Palmer’s.

                                 SAM
                        But yours is bigger.

                                 PALMER 
                        In cards -- a hand is what you’re 
                        holding. 

           Palmer deals out the cards. Five each. 

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Pick ‘em up. Take a look at ‘em.

           Sam scoops up the cards.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Now if you have any that match, 
                        like two of a kind, three of a 
                        kind, you wanna hold onto those...

           Sam studies the cards. One in particular.

                                 SAM
                        Is this a boy or a girl?

           He holds up a JACK OF HEARTS. 
                                 PALMER
                        It’s a boy.

                                 SAM
                        He’s wearing a dress?

           Palmer stares at Sam’s expression. A long beat...

                                 PALMER
                        Yeah.

           Sam smiles. Ready to begin.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Daylight filters into the room. On a bedside table we see 
           Palmer’s paycheck. Palmer sits on the bed with Vivian’s 
           wallet and discovers very little money. He moves to the 
           closet and rummages around. He opens a shoe box and comes up 
           with cash.

           INT. CHEVY - MOMENTS LATER

           Palmer drives. Sam rides shotgun.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           The Chevy parks in front of the grocery mart. Palmer and Sam 
           exit. Sam carries his BARBIE DOLL.

                                 PALMER
                             (off the doll)
                        Leave that in the car.

           Sam looks at him, not wanting to.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Go ahead. Leave it.

           Sam reluctantly leaves the Barbie doll behind.

           INT. GROCERY MART - DAY

           Sam carries a basket that’s too big for him. Palmer wanders 
           aimlessly down the aisles. They move into the cereal aisle. 

                                 SAM
                        Which one?
                                 PALMER
                        Don’t matter to me, pick what you 
                        want. 

           Sam carefully eyes each box, then selects one...

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 

           A carton of milk is on the table. Sam eats junk food cereal 
           for dinner. He looks excited, as if knowing he is doing 
           something bad. Palmer notices Sam’s hands. They are filthy. 

                                 PALMER 
                        You wash today?

                                 SAM
                             (lying)
                        Yeah...I washed earlier.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - EVENING

           Sam sits in the tub. Alone. Playing with his Barbie Dolls. 

                                 SAM
                        Palmer!

           Palmer appears in the doorway. Beer in hand. Concerned. He 
           looks at Sam -- who smiles.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to make sure you were 
                        still here.

                                 PALMER
                        I’m watching TV.

           Sam looks at him, innocent.

                                 SAM
                        Okay.

           Palmer steps away. Sam waits a moment, then...

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Palmer!

           Palmer returns and he does not look friendly.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        You’re not going anywhere are you?
                                 PALMER
                        No.

           Sam gives this thought. He eyes the bottle in Palmer’s hand.

                                 SAM 
                        I’m ready to get out.

           Beat. Palmer looks at him. Then he realizes Sam wants help 
           out of the tub. 

                                 PALMER
                        Jus’ get out. 

           Palmer turns and leaves. Sam climbs out of the tub. 

                                 SAM
                        It’s cold!

           Sam grabs a towel and wraps it around his body. He shivers, 
           happy.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sam slides under a blanket on the couch. Palmer clicks on the 
           TV.

                                 PALMER
                        Go to sleep.

           Sam stares up at him. Eyes wide awake. 

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Close your eyes.

           Sam closes his eyes. Then quickly opens them.

                                 SAM
                        Palmer? 

           Palmer stops. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I sometimes get mad at my mommy for 
                        leaving.

           The comment catches Palmer off guard. He says nothing.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Do you ever get mad at your mommy?

                                 PALMER
                        I didn’t know the woman.
                                 SAM 
                        But you knew your daddy. 

           Palmer nods. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Do you miss him?

                                 PALMER
                        Sometimes.

                                 SAM 
                        Miss Vivian missed him, too...But 
                        now she gets to see him. 

           Beat.

                                 PALMER
                        Go to sleep, Sam.

           Palmer leaves.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Palmer steps into the bedroom. A fresh beer in hand. 

           Within a pile of strewn items, he finds a photo album and 
           sits down on the bed. He flips through the pages. Most of the 
           photographs are of Palmer as a young boy. Many with Vivian. 
           One with his FATHER. Some, Palmer (ages 11, 12, 13) in 
           football gear. Palmer flips the page. And there are no more 
           photos.

           He moves to put the book away and a yellowed piece of paper 
           falls out. Palmer picks it up. 

           It’s a newspaper article. With his IMAGE, his MUGSHOT. See: 
           MAN ARRESTED IN ARMED ROBBERY. Eddie Palmer, 20. Walked into 
           First National -- produced a gun and ordered...

           Palmer stares at the article, emotional.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Palmer rolls a garbage can into a room. He empties trash into 
           the can and sees MUSIC NOTES painted on the wall. In the 
           back, there’s a PIANO, a few ACOUSTIC GUITARS, and several 
           CASED INSTRUMENTS. All in good shape. Palmer takes careful 
           notice of the instruments --
           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer steps into the hall with the garbage can, stops to 
           wipe sweat onto his dirty shirt. Up ahead he sees Maggie, 
           nicely dressed, talking to two FEMALE TEACHERS and Principal 
           Forbes. 

           Embarrassed, Palmer wheels the garbage can down the opposite 
           hall. 

           But not before Maggie sees Palmer... and stares after him.

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - LATER

           Palmer carries several bags of trash towards the metal bins. 
           A mother hurries up to him. It’s Coles’ wife - Lucille. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        Hello, Mr. Palmer. I’m Lucille 
                        Coles. I believe you know my 
                        husband. I’m Emily’s mother. Well, 
                        Emily just adores Sam. And I was 
                        wondering if it’d be okay to have a 
                        play date with Sam? Sam said to ask 
                        you. Said you were his daddy.

           She laughs. Amused. Palmer follows her stare to where Sam 
           stands waiting with Emily.

                                 PALMER 
                        Yeah. Uh, play date? 

                                 LUCILLE
                        That’s right. I’ll take ’em from 
                        here. And all you have to do is 
                        pick Sam up at our house. Say five? 

           Palmer nods. 

                                 LUCILLE (CONT'D)
                        Great. We’ll see you then. 

           Palmer watches Lucille, Sam and Emily walk off to a car--

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Palmer opens the refrigerator. A six pack of beer stares out 
           at him. He checks the time: 3:45PM. He eyes the beer, knowing 
           if he has one, it won’t be his last. Finally, he pulls out a 
           Cola.
           INT. CHEVY - DAY

           Palmer, smoking, drives. He checks the time: 4:30PM.

           EXT. COLES HOUSE - DAY

           A lovely house. The Chevy pulls up to the curb.

           INT. CHEVY - DAY

           Palmer stares at the house, not sure what to do. It’s 4:45PM. 
           He kills the engine and sits there.

           INT. COLES HOUSE - DAY

           The house is decorated in an overly gaudy fashion. Sam and 
           Emily play amongst a wonderland of dolls and accessories. 
           Lucille enters the room. She looks out the window and sees 
           Palmer parked out front.

           EXT. COLES HOUSE - DAY

           Lucille steps onto the porch, shields her eyes from the sun 
           as she waves for Palmer to come inside. 

           INT. CHEVY - DAY

           Palmer stares at her, not about to move. She waves to him 
           again. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        Mr. Palmer?! Come in.

           INT. COLES HOUSE - DAY

           Palmer reluctantly follows Lucille into the house. 

                                 LUCILLE 
                        Let me get you something cold to 
                        drink. Pepsi? 

                                 PALMER
                        I’m fine.

                                 LUCILLE 
                        Oh, it’s no trouble. Just make 
                        yourself comfortable. 
           Sam looks up from the floor.

                                 SAM
                        Hi, Palmer.

           Palmer, incredibly uncomfortable, sits on a fluffy floral 
           couch. A small, white dog rushes into the room and sniffs 
           him.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Watch your feet! Remember what he 
                        did to Barbie. 

           Sam holds up a doll by its foot. He giggles. Lucille enters.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Baron, get! He just loves to eat 
                        Emily’s dolls. 

           Lucille hands Palmer a glass of soda. He drinks it. Wishing 
           he was anywhere but there. Even more so, when he sees...

           Emily and Sam coming at him with a tray stacked with tea 
           cups, saucers, spoons. 

                                 LUCILLE (CONT'D)
                             (to Palmer)
                        You’re in luck. It’s tea time. 

           Emily places a saucer and tea cup on Palmer’s lap. Sam grabs 
           the pot and pretends to pour tea into the cup. Palmer sits 
           trapped. Lucille smiles over at him.

                                 EMILY
                        How many lumps do you want?

           Palmer looks at her, blank.

                                 LUCILLE
                        She means sugar.

                                 PALMER
                        Ah...two.

           Emily drops two cubes of sugar into his cup. Lucille brings 
           her saucer to her lips.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Mmmmmmm. This is delicious.

           She motions for Palmer to do the same. After a beat, Palmer 
           awkwardly brings the cup to his lips. Sam smiles. 
           EXT. COLES HOUSE - EVENING

           Palmer and Sam climb into the car. Emily and Lucille wave 
           from the porch.

                                 EMILY
                        Bye, Sam!

           INT. CHEVY - EVENING

           Palmer drives off, relieved. He glances over at Sam who looks 
           happy. 

                                 SAM
                        That was fun.

           He smiles. Palmer nods, focuses on the road, when he looks 
           back at Sam - Sam is still smiling at him. 

                                 PALMER 
                        So, uh...is Emily your girlfriend?

                                 SAM
                        She says she wants to marry me when 
                        we get older.

                                 PALMER
                        That’s a good offer.

           Sam makes a sour face.

                                 SAM
                        I’m not gonna marry her.

                                 PALMER
                        Maybe you will.

                                 SAM
                        No...She’s too bossy.

           A smile escapes Palmer.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sam sits at the table, scribbling letters in a large book. 
           His dolls spread out nearby. Palmer walks in with the stack 
           of mail that was collected at the door. 

                                 SAM
                        Is that your homework?
                                 PALMER
                        Kinda. 

                                 SAM
                        You got a lot of homework.

           Palmer nods. Overwhelmed. Sam returns to his book. 

           Palmer flips through the mail with various return addresses: 
           POWER AND WATER. ATTORNEY AT LAW. Too much for Palmer to 
           handle, he stuffs the mail under a basket of towels. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Since you’re done with yours. Will 
                        you help me with mine?

           Palmer looks at Sam’s books. Nervous. Self-conscious.

                                 PALMER
                        I ain’t too good with school work. 

           He moves to the refrigerator. He stares inside... then he 
           sees Sam checking for answers in the back of the book.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        What’a you doin?

                                 SAM
                        Nothing.

           Palmer slams the door. He walks back to Sam. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                             (upset)
                        I don’t know how to spell this. 

                                 PALMER
                        You’re learning. That’s all. It 
                        takes time.

           He sits down. Looks at Sam’s books.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        You know what that is?

                                 SAM
                             (matter of fact)
                        It’s an egg.

                                 PALMER
                        Right. So it starts with...?

                                 SAM 
                        A.
                                 PALMER 
                        Nope. It sounds like an a, but it 
                        ain’t. 

                                 SAM
                        E?

                                 PALMER
                        Yep. Now what comes next? It’s a 
                        ggh, sound, right?

                                 SAM 
                        Yeah.

                                 PALMER
                        You know your alphabet?

                                 SAM
                        A, b, c, d, e, f...g!

           Sam smiles and writes a “g.” Palmer taps two fingers on the 
           table, as if to hint. Sam scribbles another “g.”

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        That right?

                                 PALMER
                        Yep.

           Sam smiles and resumes the rest of his homework. 

                                 SAM 
                        You’re smart.

           Palmer watches him for a beat, then takes a closer look at 
           one of the dolls. It’s brand new. Sam catches the look.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Emily let me borrow her. She said, 
                        it’s okay.

           Palmer, aware he is lying, nods. Something else is on his 
           mind.

                                 PALMER 
                        Sam, did you tell Emily’s momma I 
                        was your daddy?

           Sam looks at him, silent for a moment.

                                 SAM
                        Are you mad?
                                 PALMER
                        No, I ain’t mad. It’s jus’, you 
                        shouldn’t tell people that. You and 
                        me are friends and all. But when 
                        your momma comes back, you gotta go 
                        home.

                                 SAM
                        Do you know when she’s coming back?

                                 PALMER
                        No.

           Sam considers this.

                                 SAM
                        Will you help me with the rest?

           Palmer looks at him -- nods. They continue together.

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - MORNING

           The Chevy pulls into the parking lot.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - PRINCIPAL FORBES OFFICE - MORNING

           Principal Forbes glances out the window and sees Sam exiting 
           the Chevy with Palmer. His expression tells us he does not 
           like how it looks.

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Sam stands in line with his classmates. Principal Forbes 
           approaches. 

                                 TOBY
                        I didn’t do nothing.

           Principal Forbes passes and stops at Sam.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES 
                        Sam, come walk with me for a 
                        moment. 

           The children scream a collective, “you’re in trouble...” 
           Principal Forbes shoots them a sharp look, they fall silent.

           Sam walks alongside Principal Forbes.  
                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES (CONT'D)
                        I saw that Mr. Palmer gave you a 
                        ride to school this morning? 

           Sam nods.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES (CONT'D)
                        Does he always do that?

                                 SAM
                        Uh huh.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        He lives next door to you, is that 
                        right?

                                 SAM
                        His house is right beside my 
                        momma’s house.

           Principal Forbes smiles. Then he bends down. Eye to eye with 
           Sam. Like a friend.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        And he’s nice to you?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah. 

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES 
                        And everything’s okay? 

           Sam studies Principal Forbes’ face. He hesitates, then nods. 
           This gives Principal Forbes concern.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES (CONT'D)
                        Sam, if something weren’t okay, you 
                        could tell me. No matter what it 
                        is.

           Sam rolls back on his heels. Afraid to answer. 

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay, son. Go ahead...

                                 SAM
                        Anything?

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        That’s right. Anything.

                                 SAM
                        Your breath...smells kind of funny.
           Principal Forbes stands. He glares down at Sam, annoyed and 
           angry. He walks off. Sam, happy, runs back to his classmates.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Sam lies on the floor and runs the feathered end of a 
           SPECIALTY PENCIL across his nose and lips. He giggles at its 
           touch. Sam opens his eyes and sees Palmer staring at him.

                                 PALMER
                        You ever been to a football game?

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS, full of testosterone, warm-up. 
           Their high intensity COACHES bark orders.

           EXT. HOME SECTION - NIGHT

           Excited FANS fill the bleachers. Electricity thick in the 
           air. This is what this small town lives for. Palmer leads Sam 
           through the crowd. He stops at a fence separating the fans 
           from the players. 

                                 PALMER
                        See that guy. He’s the quarterback. 
                        That’s what I used to play.

           They watch the QUARTERBACK throw a few practice passes. As 
           they do -- an unseen person observes them from a distance... 

                                 SAM
                        Look - Miss Maggie is here!

           Palmer turns and sees Maggie working behind the concession 
           stand. 

           Sam and Palmer head off in that direction, revealing 
           Principal Forbes, seated next to his pregnant wife. 

           Principal Forbes stares after the two, concerned.

           EXT. CONCESSION STAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Sam steps up to the counter, excited. Maggie, working behind 
           it, brightens at the sight of him. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey, Sam! You having a good time?
                                 SAM
                        Yup. That’s the quarterback out 
                        there. Palmer used to be him when 
                        he played.

           He smiles. Happy. Palmer appears. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Quarterback, huh? 

            Her expression gives nothing away.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                             (to Sam)
                        So what can I get you? It’s on me. 
                        Hot dog, coca-cola? Wait - I 
                        know....

           She hands Sam cookies. 

                                 SAM
                        Thank you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I was thinking about doing some 
                        fishing tomorrow. You want to join 
                        me?

                                 SAM
                        We got church tomorrow.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You do, well then, how about after? 

                                 SAM
                        Sure.
                             (to Palmer)
                        You’re gonna like fishing!

                                 PALMER
                        No. Maggie invited you. 

                                 SAM
                        She don’t care if you come! Right, 
                        Maggie?

           Maggie, suddenly put on the spot, smiles, polite.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re welcome to join, if you 
                        like. 

                                 PALMER
                        I can’t. I got things to do.
                                 SAM
                        No! Pleeeeasssse! You have to come! 
                        Say yes!! Pleasssse! You have to! 

           Sam keeps at it, until finally... 

                                 PALMER
                        I guess we’re going fishing.

           Sam smiles, excited. Maggie scribbles an address and phone 
           number on a piece of paper. Hands it to Palmer.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        My address. See ya after church.  

           Palmer stuffs it in his pocket and walks off with Sam. Maggie 
           watches them go, another WOMAN steps next to her.

                                 WOMAN
                        What’s that all about?

           The Woman gives Maggie a raised eyebrow look. Maggie ignores 
           the look, turns to an ELDERLY WOMAN in line, friendly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hello, ma’am, what can I get ya?

           EXT. HOME SECTION BLEACHERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Palmer walks Sam into the stands. He sees Daryl and Ned. 
           Daryl waves Palmer up. Palmer hesitates, knowing it may not 
           be a good idea. Daryl throws him another hard wave...

           Moments later...

                                 NED
                             (to Sam, off the cookies)
                        Hey there, ‘lil fella. Can I have 
                        one of those?

           Sam looks at Ned, and it’s obvious he doesn’t like him. He 
           hands Ned a cookie.

                                 NED (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           Palmer sits down, separating Sam from the two. Daryl cracks a 
           beer and hands it to Palmer. 

           On the field -- the game begins.

                                 DARYL
                        C’mon, Jake!! Hit ‘em hard!
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - LATER

           A miraculous catch is made by a home player. 

           EXT. HOME SECTION BLEACHERS - CONTINUOUS

           The crowd erupts, as the second quarter ends. Palmer enjoys 
           the moment. Sam, bored, stares down at his shoes and clicks 
           them together. Daryl grabs another beer from a cooler and is 
           exhausted by the action.

                                 DARYL
                        Shit. When’d we get so old.

                                 NED
                        I don’t feel old. Just ‘cause you 
                        look it.

                                 DARYL
                        Look in the fuckin’ mirror! You ‘ol 
                        bald bastard. Fuckin’ eat leftovers 
                        off your double chin.

           Palmer laughs. Sam looks up.

                                 NED
                        At least I ain’t no janitor. 

                                 PALMER
                        Assistant janitor, Ned.

           Daryl takes a swig of his beer.

                                 DARYL
                        Hell, you’re lucky someone even 
                        hired your ass. 

                                 SAM
                        He’s smarter than you two! He knows 
                        how to spell egg.

           Daryl cracks up on that one. 

                                 DARYL
                        C’mon, Ned...let’s go feed your 
                        double chin.

           Daryl and Ned walk off laughing. They disappear into the 
           crowd, leaving Palmer embarrassed and sitting alone with Sam. 
           As down on the FOOTBALL FIELD -- 
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           The BAND plays “ON BROADWAY.” The female DRILL TEAM, wearing 
           plastered smiles, short skirts and matching hats, break into 
           a fantastic routine. The BATON TWIRLERS and FLAG CORPS join 
           them in synchronized fashion...

                                 ANNOUNCER’S VOICE
                        Please give a warm welcome for the 
                        Honey Bees!

           EXT. HOME SECTION BLEACHERS - SAME

           Sam rises from his seat and stares at the BATON TWIRLERS. His 
           eyes glued to their every motion. The music pounding, as --

           Palmer watches Sam - aware of the impact this has on him. 

           He considers pulling Sam back into the seat - but then he 
           thinks better of it and lets Sam have this moment.

           Batons are tossed into the air and miraculously caught. Music 
           continues...  

           INT. CHEVY - NIGHT

           Palmer parks in front of Vivian’s house. Engine running. Sam 
           steps out and realizes Palmer isn’t coming. He stops.

                                 PALMER
                        Go on.

           Sam doesn’t move. 

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Shut the door...get inside.

           Finally, Sam shuts the door. He watches Palmer drive off.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Loud MEN. Noisy bar. Palmer, drunk, slams Coles’ hand to the 
           bar in an arm wrestling match. He pockets a five and walks 
           away, happy. Coles feels his arm, in pain.

                                 COLES
                        Dang.

                                 PALMER 
                        Keep practicin’, Coles.
           Just then - Sibs enters with a FRIEND. They take a seat at 
           the bar. A group of rowdy FOOTBALL PLAYERS barrel in. Jake 
           (Daryl’s oldest son) is amongst them.

                                 DARYL
                             (proud, to the bartender)
                        Don’t be givin’ my boy liquor!

           Jake and the players enjoy the praises from the PATRONS as 
           they head to a back room. Daryl, unacknowledged by his son, 
           stares after him, angry, possibly hurt. Palmer appears.

                                 PALMER
                        Let’s rack.

           Daryl blasts a ball and misses the pocket. Palmer takes the 
           stick and lines up a shot... Jake exits the back room. He 
           gives Sibs a friendly pat on the back as he leaves the bar. 

           Daryl witnesses this. 

           Palmer looks up -- sees Daryl’s hating stare focused on Sibs. 

                                 DARYL 
                        I’ll be right back.

           Sibs sits at the bar drinking, enjoying his conversation with 
           his friend. Daryl steps next to him. 

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        Gimme a beer. 

           The Bartender fetches the drink. Daryl sees Palmer watching 
           him, he smirks. 

                                 DARYL (CONT’D)
                        Palmer, look who it is. Your boss, 
                        Sibs.

           Daryl aggressively leans into Sibs’s conversation.

                                 DARYL (CONT’D)
                        How’s my boy Palmer workin’ out? He 
                        ain’t steal nothing yet, has he? 

                                 SIBS
                        He’s doing just fine, Daryl.

                                 DARYL
                        No missing bleach or mops? No 
                        sponges missing?

                                 SIBS
                        Daryl, if you don’t mind...
                                 DARYL
                        I’m sorry... am I bothering you? 

                                 SIBS
                        Yeah, as a matter of fact, you are.

                                 DARYL
                        Sorry. Jus’ being friendly. 

           Sibs turns around. The Bartender arrives with Daryl’s beer 
           and senses trouble. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        I don’t want no trouble in here.

                                 DARYL
                        No trouble. I am wondering about 
                        one thing, though. When the fuck 
                        this become a nigger bar? You ought 
                        to be more selective in who you 
                        serve. 

           OTHERS look. Sibs stands. Faces Daryl. His small stature 
           pales in comparison to Daryl’s much larger frame, but none 
           the less he holds his ground.

                                 SIBS
                        You know what the problem is with 
                        you, Daryl? You jus’ never grew up. 
                        Too stupid to recognize that, I 
                        guess.

                                 DARYL
                        Say that to me again, friend, and 
                        see if I don’t bust every one of 
                        your shiny goddamn teeth. 

           Palmer, by the pool table, knows he has to do something --

                                 PALMER
                        Daryl, c’mon, you hit that ‘lil 
                        brown runt, the color will drain 
                        from his face quicker than a heart 
                        attack kills him. 

           Palmer laughs. And so does Daryl.

                                 DARYL
                        Shit. Ain’t that the truth.

           And with that, Daryl heads back to the pool table. Sibs pays 
           for his drinks and leaves with his friend. Palmer watches 
           Sibs exit, affected.
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Palmer is passed out in Vivian’s bed. Sam’s small voice is 
           heard from the doorway.

                                 SAM
                        Palmer?

           Sam waits, then slowly enters the room. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Palmer, you awake?

                                 PALMER
                        One week missin’ church ain’t gonna 
                        kill you. 

           Palmer rolls over and sees Sam holding something.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        What’s that?

           Sam shrugs, innocent. In his small hands he holds a beer for 
           Palmer. Palmer slowly sits up, clearly bothered by this. He 
           takes the beer from Sam and puts it aside.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Go get dressed.

           INT. CHURCH - MORNING

           The congregation sings along with the ORGANIST. Palmer stands 
           next to Sam. He catches Principal Forbes staring at him. 
           Principal Forbes smiles and looks away. 

           INT. CHEVY - LATER

           Sam sits in the car, alone. Palmer slides behind the wheel. 
           He doesn’t say anything for a moment. 

           Then he hands Sam his Barbie doll. They share a look. 

           Palmer throws the car into gear and drives off.

           EXT. FAIR - DAY

           We pass LIVESTOCK showings. Food vendors. Rides. Games.  
           PEOPLE having a good time... 
           A fishing pole bobs into water. Trying to latch onto one of 
           several plastic ducks that float by. Sam holds the pole. 
           Palmer and Maggie stand behind him.

                                 PALMER
                        So, this is the fishing.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Guaranteed a winner.

           Finally, Sam snags a duck. 

                                 SAM
                        Got it!

           The MAN behind the booth plucks the duck off his pole and 
           drops it in a basket. Sam looks up at Palmer who smiles at 
           him. He tries for others. 

           COTTON CANDY STAND

           Palmer, holding a bag of trinkets, walks beside Maggie and 
           Sam who eat cotton candy. Sam wanders ahead, excited.

                                 SAM
                        Look!

           Up ahead -- is a ring toss game. And the prizes -- WINNIE-THE-
           POOH, TIGGER, PIGLET and their other STUFFED PALS.

           RING TOSS STAND 

           Sam leads Maggie and Palmer to the stand. A FATHER plays for 
           his young DAUGHTER. The MAN behind the counter looks at Sam. 
           Is this a boy or a girl?

                                 SAM 
                        How do you play?

                                 MAN
                        One wins any prize. A dollar for 
                        five tosses. 

           Again the man looks at Sam. Confused. Then he sees Palmer -- 
           who hands him a five dollar bill. The man takes it. What the 
           hell. He places the plastic rings down.

           Moments later, Sam, Palmer and Maggie are tossing the rings. 
           Having a good time. One narrowly makes it around, causing all 
           three to grow excited. 

           Maggie watches Palmer play.
                                 MAGGIE
                        What were you like as a boy?

           Palmer thinks about the question, tosses a ring, answers 
           honestly.

                                 PALMER 
                        I was afraid, mostly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Afraid of what?

                                 PALMER
                        Depends. Sometimes it was real. 
                        Like my father coming home drunk. 
                        Sometimes it wasn’t...’jus how I 
                        felt inside.

           Maggie looks at him, tosses another ring. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I was fat.

           Palmer laughs.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I was. My mother said I never met a 
                        pork chop I didn’t like. No wonder 
                        I moved away. That was one of her 
                        kinder comments.

           The two share a kind smile. Keep tossing, when --

                                 MAN  
                        We got a winner!

           Sam sees the Man hand the young daughter a pink PIGLET DOLL. 

           EXT. ROAD - EVENING

           The Chevy travels down a two lane road. Nothing but farmland.

           INT. CHEVY - EVENING

           The Chevy pulls up to a modest house. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I had a good day.  

           Palmer nods, the same can be said for him. Maggie looks back 
           at Sam. 
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Sam - do you know you have a 
                        birthday coming up?

                                 SAM
                        I do?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yup. October twenty-first.

                                 SAM
                        Oh yeah.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to Palmer)
                        Sam’s going to be eight.

                                 SAM
                             (to Palmer)
                        Can I have a cake?

                                 PALMER
                        You gotta have a cake. It’s your 
                        birthday.

           Sam smiles, excited.

                                 SAM
                        Can I invite Emily?

                                 PALMER
                        Her feelings would be hurt if you 
                        didn’t.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Maybe we’ll even throw you a lil’ 
                        birthday party... ‘Til then, you 
                        got shotgun, Sam.

           Maggie exits the car. Sam climbs over from the back and plops 
           into the passenger seat. Maggie gives him a quick kiss.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        See ya tomorrow. Nite.

           She slams the door closed and walks away. 

           Palmer watches Maggie disappear inside her house before 
           driving off.
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Palmer enters. He watches Sam fill his lunch box with 
           cookies. 

                                 PALMER
                        Maybe we ought to put somethin’ 
                        else in there today. 

           Palmer opens the refrigerator and pulls out bologna. 

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Grab me that loaf of bread.

           Sam grabs the bread and watches Palmer build a sandwich.  

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        You know, when I was your age, I 
                        won the state sandwich making 
                        contest.

                                 SAM
                        There’s no sandwich contest.

                                 PALMER
                        There’s not? Then how’d I win. See, 
                        the secret is, you gotta spread the 
                        mustard equally. The judges like 
                        that.

           Sam shakes his head, not believing him.

                                 SAM
                        No. 

                                 PALMER
                        ...then there’s the pickle police. 
                        They walk around and check your 
                        sandwich. If you used too many 
                        pickles, they give you a ticket. 

           Sam looks up at him, curiously.

                                 SAM
                        You’re lying?

           Palmer looks at him, serious. 

                                 PALMER 
                        Yep, I am.

           Sam playfully grabs onto him, causing Palmer to laugh.
           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - JANITORIAL OFFICE - MORNING 

           Palmer, in a good mood, enters, sees Sibs sitting at his 
           desk, his memory suddenly refreshed about the bar incident. 
           He grabs some supplies and tries to make a silent escape.

                                 SIBS (O.S.)
                        Trash bins need to be washed out. 

           Palmer looks at him.

                                 SIBS (CONT'D)
                        Take ’em around back. There’s a 
                        hose. Wipe ’em down.

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - DAY

           It’s a demeaning task. Filthy bins are sprayed with water. 
           Palmer takes a moment to wipe sweat and dirt from his brow, 
           then continues spraying.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - LATER

           Palmer approaches the janitor’s office. He sees Principal 
           Forbes exit and walk off down the hall.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - JANITOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Palmer enters. 

                                 PALMER
                        Bins are clean.

                                 SIBS
                        Principal Forbes needs his file 
                        cabinet fixed. 

           Palmer grabs his tools. He stares at Sibs. Doesn’t leave.

                                 PALMER
                        About the other night, I... 

           He holds Sibs’s stare -- apologetic. 

                                 SIBS
                        Junior doesn’t like to wait. You 
                        should go.

           Beat. Another shared look. Palmer exits. 
           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - PRINCIPAL FORBES OFFICE - DAY

           Palmer knocks on the door. Principal Forbes looks up from his 
           desk and sees Palmer standing with his tools.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        Come in. 
                             (motions to the cabinet)
                        I think the hinge is broken. 

           Palmer enters. Moves to fix it. After a moment...

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES (CONT’D)
                        I noticed you were at the game on 
                        Friday night. My wife. It’s the one 
                        thing she doesn’t complain about. I 
                        think she enjoys their uniforms.

           He half-laughs. Palmer keeps working. 

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES (CONT’D)
                        I saw Sam was with you? 

           This is not a friendly question. Palmer, aware, keeps

                        His mother’s not around much, is 
                        she?

           The room grows tense. 

                                 PALMER
                        She’s around. Jus’ not all there. 

           Palmer finishes and stands. Wipes the grease from his hands.

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        You need anything else fixed? Or 
                        maybe you got another question for 
                        me?   

           He holds Principal Forbes’s stare, causing him to smile 
           weakly and back off. 

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                        No. None. Thank you, Palmer.

           Principal Forbes watches Palmer exit. 
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Palmer brushes his teeth, spits. Sam, right beside him, does 
           the same. They finish.

                                 PALMER
                        A’right. Let’s go see the man.

           INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY

           Sam sits on a chair in a long hallway, curiously observing a 
           few MEN (parolees) who walk past. THRU THE GLASS window 
           across the hall, he sees Palmer in a nearby office, sitting 
           with the Parole Officer (from earlier). 

           Sam watches the two talk. The Parole Officer marks a note in 
           a book. Nods with affirmation. Palmer rises to leave, exits 
           the office and steps into the hall -- 

                                 PALMER
                        You like root beer floats?

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know. I’ve never had one.

           The two head down the hall, toward the exit.

                                 PALMER
                        I know a place right up this road. 
                        Best root beer floats in the state.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Sam slurps up a root beer float with a straw, then uses a 
           spoon. Palmer sits across from Sam, enjoying his own float. 

                                 SAM
                        Why did you have to go see that 
                        man?

                                 PALMER
                        Because I did something bad. And he 
                        needs to check on me to see that 
                        I’m doing good.

                                 SAM
                        What’d you do?

                                 PALMER
                        I stole a whole lot of money that 
                        didn’t belong to me. 
                                 SAM
                        My momma stole money once. She 
                        never had to see that man.

                                 PALMER
                        Some people get caught. Some don’t. 
                        I got caught.

                                 SAM
                        My momma said she had to steal, 
                        because we’re poor.

                                 PALMER
                        Lots of people are poor, they don’t 
                        steal.  

                                 SAM
                        You did?

                                 PALMER
                        Yep. I did. And there ain’t a day I 
                        wished I hadn’t. 

           Sam stops slurping his float. He looks worried.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

                                 SAM
                        I stole, too.

                                 PALMER 
                        You think someone misses what you 
                        took?

                                 SAM
                        I know she does...She cried. 

           Sam looks at Palmer -- feeling worse about it.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Miss Maggie asked if anyone seen 
                        it, and I said no.

                                 PALMER
                        You lied, too?

           Another nod. 

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        You think that little girl would 
                        feel better if she got back what 
                        you stole. 
                                 SAM
                        I know if I gave it back...I’d feel 
                        better.

           Palmer forces back a smile.  

                                 PALMER
                        I’m sure she’d appreciate it. I’m 
                        sure they all would. 

           He gives Sam a look. Knowing there was more.

                                 SAM
                        But I can’t give it all back.
                             (beat, sad)
                        I stole from Miss Vivian.

                                 PALMER
                        What’s done is over. No one’s gonna 
                        punish you for that. But I bet if 
                        you would’a asked Miss Vivian for 
                        some food, she would’a helped you 
                        out. What do you think?

                                 SAM 
                        I think she would’ve.

                                 PALMER 
                        Me, too. 

           Palmer winks at him. Sam, feeling better, slurps up the 
           float.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Palmer tucks Sam into bed. He turns to leave.

                                 SAM
                        Palmer.

           Palmer stops at the doorway. 

                                 PALMER
                        Yeah?

           Sam stares at Palmer. He is happy. 

                                 SAM
                        Nothing.

                                 PALMER
                        Night, Sam.
           He clicks off the light and exits.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer enters. He picks up the SNOW GLOBE. He shakes it and 
           watches the white particles flutter.

           EXT. STORE - DAY

           The Chevy pulls up to the local store. 

           INT. STORE - LATER

           Palmer walks towards the toy section. He looks around - sees 
           a selection of guns, footballs, dolls, etc. No idea what to 
           get, he wanders the aisle, until something grabs his 
           attention. He stares at it, uncertain...

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sam, sharply dressed, runs to the front door and opens it.

           Maggie stands on the front porch, holding a wrapped present 
           and a shopping bag. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You wouldn’t know where the 
                        birthday boy is, would you? 

           Sam smiles, excited.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maggie, wearing a “Happy Birthday” hat, exits the kitchen, 
           holding a cake with eight burning candles. She, Palmer and 
           Emily (who also wear hats) sing to Sam. 

           Sam blows out the candles. Moments later, he is unwrapping 
           gifts. He gets to the last one. Palmer hands it to him.

                                 PALMER
                        This one’s from me. 

           Sam unwraps the gift...his face lights up as we see...a brand 
           new LITTLE PRINCESS DOLL. 

                                 SAM
                        It’s Little Princess!
           Sam wraps his arms tight around Palmer’s neck. Palmer, still 
           awkward with the affection, gives Sam a pat on the back.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I love it. 

           Palmer catches Maggie smiling at him. He gives her a look 
           like it’s no big deal. But it is.

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Sam and Emily run out of the house screaming, carrying-on, 
           having a good time. Sam carries his Little Princess Doll. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - SAME

           Maggie cleans up the room alongside Palmer, collecting dirty 
           plates and trash. A framed photo grabs Maggie’s attention.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is this you? 

           In it, Vivian (in her youth) stands with her arms wrapped 
           around a smiling boy (Palmer). Maggie picks up the photo.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Look how cute you were.

           She smiles at Palmer who stands there, watching her.

           Maggie examines the photograph closely, and one thing is for 
           certain - this little boy and grandmother loved one another. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Vivian raised you alone?

                                 PALMER
                        Yeah. My grandfather died when I 
                        was young. Father passed away 
                        before I got to high school. She 
                        looked after me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        And your mother?

           Palmer wags his head. This is clearly uncomfortable territory 
           for him. 

                                 PALMER
                        Anyone can give birth. A mother’s 
                        someone who raises you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Puts a band-aid on your knee. Tucks 
                        ya into bed at night. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I agree.

           Maggie smiles, places the photo back down. 

           She follows Palmer into the kitchen.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           They place the dishes in the sink. Maggie grabs a towel out 
           of a basket, ready to help wash. The stack of unopened mail 
           spills onto the floor. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know you’re supposed to open 
                        it?

                                 PALMER
                        Why? Can’t be good.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re probably right.

           Maggie smiles, and they collect it off the floor. Palmer 
           spots the envelope that reads: ATTORNEY AT LAW. He grows 
           uncomfortable and sticks everything back under the towels.

           They wash the dishes together. Palmer is suddenly quiet, then 
           he looks over at Maggie, curious...

                                 PALMER
                        Can I ask you a favor?

           She looks at him --

           TIME CUT:

           The dishes are washed and stacked. Maggie and Palmer sit at 
           the table facing one another. There’s a small pile of cash in 
           front of them, along with a small pile of return envelopes. 

           Maggie tears open an envelope, pulls out the gas bill.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Twelve dollars and sixty-one cents. 

           Palmer places thirteen dollars into the pile of cash. Maggie 
           writes out a check, slips it inside the return envelope and 
           sets it aside with the others.
                                 PALMER
                        Thanks.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re saving me a trip to the 
                        bank.

           She grabs the next piece -- the ATTORNEY AT LAW envelope.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Wanna do the lawyer?

                                 PALMER
                        No.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Could be good news.

                                 PALMER
                        Not with my history.

           He holds her look. She nods, understanding. Then finally...

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        Alrighty. Let’s do it. 

           Palmer nervously watches, as Maggie tears open the envelope, 
           pulls out the letter and reads it. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s about Vivian’s will. Her 
                        lawyer wants you to call his office 
                        and set up an appointment. That’s 
                        it.

           Palmer nods, it wasn’t so bad after all. He can do that. 

                                 PALMER
                        Thank you. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re welcome. Wanna keep goin’?

           Palmer nods, and Maggie tears open a new envelope. She looks 
           upset.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Publishers Clearing House... You 
                        didn’t win.

           They share a laugh. Move on to the next one...
           INT. CAR - LATER

           Maggie drives off. She looks in her rear-view mirror and 
           catches sight of Palmer and Sam as they wave after her. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           On the kitchen table is the birthday cake, or what’s left of 
           it, wrapped in cellophane. The house is dimly lit, quiet.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Sam fills his lunch box with cookies. Palmer appears, grabs a 
           loaf of bread. Sam pulls out bologna from the refrigerator. 
           They make sandwiches together.

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - EARLY MORNING

           Palmer and Sam wait to be let into the school. Sibs arrives 
           and unlocks the doors. They enter. 

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - MORNING

           Palmer stands outside Maggie’s classroom, keeping watch, as 
           Sam returns the stolen items...the SPECIALTY PENCIL...a PACK 
           OF GUM. One still remains - the SNOW GLOBE. Sam moves to the 
           rightful owner’s desk. Not wanting to return it. It’s 
           uncertain if he will. Finally, Sam places it on the desk. 

           Palmer gives Sam a passing smile as he exits.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Palmer fixes a set of blinds in the music room. Finished, he 
           snaps his toolbox closed and turns to leave. His eyes land on 
           the instruments in the back. He looks to the door, sees the 
           empty hallway. He walks over to the instruments. Sets the 
           toolbox down, and picks up one of the guitars. 

           Palmer plays a few cords. It’s tuned pretty good. Then 
           slowly, his fingers work the strings as if he’s played for 
           years... 
           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - SAME

           Sibs walks the empty hallway. He stops, hears what sounds 
           like Jimi Hendrix’s  “Little Wing.” Sibs heads in the 
           direction of the guitar playing... Then suddenly, the music 
           stops.  

           A moment later, Palmer exits the music room, carrying the 
           tool box. He spots Sibs staring at him. 

                                 PALMER
                        Blinds are fixed.

           Palmer walks past. Sibs stares after Palmer, odd.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - MAGGIE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Maggie enters her classroom and drops a stack of books on her 
           desk. She notices the air-conditioner blowing cold air. Then 
           at closer inspection, she realizes it is brand new. The tags 
           still on it. Something tells Maggie this did not come out of 
           the school’s budget. She smiles.

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - DAY

           Kids wait for their bus. Sam is playing with Emily. TWO BOYS 
           wander over to him. Toby trails behind them. The First Boy 
           approaches Sam, non-malicious. 

                                 BOY
                        Sam, we were just wondering...why 
                        do you act like a girl?

           Sam looks at them. Innocent. Maybe confused.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know.

           The Boy, unsure what to do with that answer, simply nods.

                                 TOBY
                        I know why...he’s a faggot.

           Toby smirks -- aware it’s a bad word. 

           He shoves Sam...when a HAND grabs hold of him. Toby looks up 
           and sees Palmer glaring down at him.

                                 PALMER
                        Go on, Sam. Catch your bus. 
                             (to the other boys)
                        You two get outta here.
           They run off. Palmer, still holding onto Toby, kneels down 
           and looks the kid dead in the eyes.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        You touch that boy again, I’ll 
                        break your fuckin’ arm. You got me?

           Toby, petrified, nods his head. Palmer lets him free. Toby 
           runs off. Palmer looks around, makes sure no one was 
           watching, and strolls off.

           INT. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - EVENING 

           Palmer, holding the letter addressed to him and ill at ease, 
           faces an ATTORNEY who flips through a stack of papers.

                                 ATTORNEY 
                        Were you aware of the provisions of 
                        her will?

                                 PALMER
                        No, sir. 

                                 ATTORNEY
                        According to Vivian’s will, the 
                        house is to be put up for sale and 
                        the money donated to the Saints of 
                        Christ Church. She left 
                        instructions that you were to 
                        receive a total of five thousand 
                        dollars. However, if you contest 
                        the will, you’re to receive 
                        nothing. 

                                 PALMER
                        When do I have to move out?

                                 ATTORNEY 
                        As soon as the house sells.

                                 PALMER
                        Thank you.

           Palmer rises to leave. The Attorney yells after him.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Mr. Palmer, executed originals will 
                        be sent... 

           He’s already gone.
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sam sits in front of the TV, giggling, as he watches the 
           “Little Princess Show.”  

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        “...don’t go anywhere, Princess 
                        fans! We’ll be right back!”

           Palmer enters. 

                                 SAM
                        On Little Princess they said if you 
                        write a letter to their show, you 
                        can join their club. They even give 
                        you a certificate. 

           Palmer ignores Sam. Lights a cigarette. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Will you write one for me?

                                 PALMER 
                        There’s things you can be, and 
                        things you can’t. You don’t see 
                        other boys on that show, do you?

                                 SAM
                        No.

                                 PALMER
                        Then what does that tell you?

                                 SAM
                        I can be the first.

           Palmer just looks at him.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           The Chevy pulls into a parking space.

           INT. STORE - DAY

           Palmer and Sam enter. Halloween costumes fill the shelves. 
           Sam carefully eyes his choices.

                                 SAM
                        Look - they have it!
           Excited -- he pulls a “LITTLE PRINCESS” costume off the 
           shelf. Palmer stares at the box. On it -- a LITTLE GIRL wears 
           a dress and tiara -- she smiles at us.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Can I get it?

           Palmer scans the other costumes. He sees a LITTLE PRINCE.

                                 PALMER
                        How ‘bout this - the Little Prince? 

           Sam looks at the Boy on the box -- he wears a uniform and 
           holds a sword. 

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Or a Pirate?

           Sam looks at all his options -- and the one that he truly 
           wants is the “Little Princess.”  

                                 SAM
                        It’s only twenty dollars. Emily’s 
                        going as Little Princess.

                                 PALMER
                        Sam, the thing about this 
                        costume...

           He pauses, long and hard.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Well, you know how you have 
                        separate bathrooms in school. You 
                        got one for boys and one for girls?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah.

                                 PALMER
                        Well, some costumes are made the 
                        same way. Some are made for boys, 
                        and some are made for girls. Now it 
                        don’t mean you can’t wear it -- you 
                        can. But it’s kinda like me walking 
                        into the ladies’s bathroom at 
                        school. 

           Sam laughs.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        That’s right. The ladies see me 
                        walking in, and they laugh at me. 
                                 SAM
                        ‘Cause it’s funny.

                                 PALMER
                        Yeah, and people are funny, Sam. 
                        They see something they’re not used 
                        to seeing, and they laugh. And they 
                        can get real mean. ‘Cause they 
                        don’t understand that you can be 
                        the first at something. They just 
                        expect to see a girl wearing it. 
                        Like your friend Emily. 

                                 SAM 
                        They should make one for boys.

                                 PALMER
                        They do. It’s the Little Prince. 

           Palmer nods to the Little Prince costume. Indicating the boy. 
           Sam looks at the box. He considers it and grows depressed. 
           His eyes travel back to the Little Princess costume.

           INT. STORE - CHECK OUT COUNTER - DAY

           Palmer and Sam walk to the check-out counter. The YOUNG 
           FEMALE CLERK grabs the costume box and rings it up. 

                                 YOUNG FEMALE CLERK
                             (to Sam)
                        You ready for Halloween?

           Sam nods with a smile. Happy. The Female Clerk looks at the 
           costume box -- it’s Little Princess. She smiles and hands it 
           to him. 

                                 YOUNG FEMALE CLERK (CONT'D)
                        You have yourself a good time.
                             (to Palmer)
                        It’s twenty-one dollars and eighty 
                        cents. 

           Palmer hands her money. Waits for change. An Elderly Woman 
           walks up behind him. 

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Eddie Palmer? 

           Palmer recognizes the woman from church.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hello, Sam.
                                 SAM
                        Hello.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        I can’t believe this. Are you still 
                        lookin’ after this child? 

           Palmer ignores her question, anxious to get his change. 

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        What on earth do you think you’re 
                        doing, Eddie? You got no business 
                        lookin’ after this child... You 
                        ain’t nothin’ but a criminal.

                                 PALMER
                        C’mon, Sam. 

           Palmer grabs his change, turns to leave, but Sam’s not going 
           anywhere --

                                 SAM
                        Palmer don’t steal no more, and 
                        he’s doin’ good! So you need to 
                        mind your business!

           The Elderly Woman, further angered --

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                             (to the Clerk)
                        Young lady, call Sheriff Coles.

                                 PALMER
                             (hurrying)
                        Sam, let’s go.

           The Young Female Clerk, looking like a deer in headlights, 
           simply watches Palmer and Sam walk out of the store.

           The Elderly Woman yells after Palmer, angry --

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        I’m gonna call child services!

           INT./EXT. CHEVY/STORE - DAY

           Palmer and Sam climb into the Chevy and drive off. 

           The Elderly Woman exits the store and stares after them --

           Palmer watches her in the rearview mirror, very concerned 
           with what she said, then he sees Sam watching him, Halloween 
           costume held in his lap.
                                 PALMER
                        I’m doin’ good, huh? 

           Sam nods his head, full of love for Palmer. Palmer manages a 
           smile. They head home... 

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - MORNING

           The hall is empty. Palmer wanders to a closed classroom door. 
           Inside the classroom are rows of computers. Palmer checks to 
           make sure no one is coming... Steps inside.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer sits down in front of a computer. Nervous. He turns on 
           the power... Moments later, Palmer hen pecks at the keyboard. 
           Searching for something. Finally, we see the screen: “Foster 
           Care Department of Children and Family Guidelines.”

           Palmer reads, then something causes him to stop... See: “HAS 
           AN ADULT IN YOUR HOME EVER BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME?”

           Palmer looks disappointed. He shuts off the computer.

           INT. MAGGIE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Maggie walks amongst the children, watching over them, as 
           they do work. She stops at Sam’s desk. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        And what are you so happy about? 

                                 SAM
                        I get to be a Princess.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Really?

                                 SAM
                        For Halloween.

           Maggie takes this in with a smile. But her face shows 
           concern.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Palmer stands outside the bathroom door, waiting. Sam exits -- 
           he wears the Princess costume. 
                                 SAM
                        I can’t get the crown to stay on my 
                        head.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - MAGGIE’S CLASSROOM - MORNING

           We hear snickers. And laughter. Sam sits with the tiara on 
           his head. All eyes are on him. Toby wears a football uniform. 
           A few others -- pirates, convicts, a ghost. The girls --  
           witches, a bunny. Emily and a few others -- Princesses. 

                                 TOBY
                        Sam’s wearing a girl’s costume! 
                        He’s probably wearing panties!

           More laughter as Sam starts to look uncomfortable. 

           The door opens, and Maggie enters. She’s dressed in a man’s 
           suit and shoes -- wears a mustache and a man’s wig. In fact -- 
           she looks like Principal Forbes.

           All eyes are suddenly on her.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (in fake man’s voice)
                        Does anyone know where Miss Hayes 
                        is?

                                 BOY
                        Right there!

           A boy in a pirate’s costume points to her. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (in man’s voice)
                        I’m Principal Forbes.

           They laugh.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                             (in man’s voice)
                        I guess Miss Hayes isn’t here 
                        today. She’s fired! 

           More laughter. Maggie sits on the edge of her desk, like a 
           man. Toby raises his hand as if to ask a question.

                                 TOBY 
                        Principal Forbes, Sam dressed as a 
                        Princess. Look...

           He points to Sam. Again -- laughter at Sam’s expense.
                                 MAGGIE
                             (in man’s voice)
                        Sam is that you under there?

           Maggie rises off her desk. Sam just looks at her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                             (in man’s voice)
                        That doesn’t look like Sam to me. 
                        Looks like a Princess? Anyone know 
                        where Sam is? 

           She moves to a LITTLE GIRL who is dressed as a WITCH.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                             (in man’s voice)
                        Excuse me, Miss Witch, do you know 
                        where Elizabeth is?

           The Little Girl shakes her head no. 

           There’s a knock on the door -- Maggie opens it, and in walks 
           Principal Forbes -- looking like Maggie, in a long wig, fancy 
           dress and heels.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES
                             (in mock Female Voice)
                        Principal Forbes -- what are you 
                        doin’ in my classroom?  

           Principal Forbes walks awkwardly in the heels. He almost 
           trips. The kids hysterically laugh. He sits behind Maggie’s 
           desk, with his legs crossed.

                                 PRINCIPAL FORBES (CONT'D)
                             (in mock Female Voice)
                        And how did these pirates get here? 

           More laughter.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Sam, in his Princess costume and carrying a stuffed candy 
           bag, runs up to Maggie’s house. Maggie, still in the man’s 
           suit, opens the door. 

                                 SAM
                        Trick or treat!

           Maggie smiles, then looks past Sam and sees Palmer standing 
           on the lawn. Beat. She is happy to see him.
           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sam, still in his costume minus the tiara, constructs a fort 
           with sheets. 

                                 PALMER
                        I got ya!

           Sam laughs and hides under the sheet...

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie takes off the jacket and throws it on a chair. Palmer 
           enters and watches her. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You made Sam’s year. 

           Maggie undoes the tie, removes it from her neck. Palmer meets 
           Maggie’s eyes. 

                                 PALMER
                        What were you? For Halloween?  

           Maggie pulls the mustache out of her pocket and places it 
           under her nose.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Principal Forbes.

           Maggie smiles. Palmer smiles back.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        And you? 

                                 PALMER
                        Me...I was a janitor.

           He holds her look. Waits for a response. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You wanna stay for dinner? 

           Palmer doesn’t even have to think about it.

                                 PALMER
                        Yeah.

           Maggie moves to the refrigerator. They take out items for a 
           cook-out. Hamburger meat. Cheese. Fixings. Maggie stops --
                                 MAGGIE
                        By the way, you didn’t happen to 
                        buy me a new air-conditioner?

           Palmer smiles. Giving Maggie her answer.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s the nicest gift any man has 
                        ever given me.

           They share a smile, happy to be with one another.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - HOURS LATER

           Palmer carries Sam, who is fast asleep, to the car. Maggie 
           opens the back door, and Palmer is careful to place Sam down, 
           then he closes the door.

                                 PALMER
                        Thank you. The dinner was good.

           Maggie stares at Palmer, smiles. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Good night, Eddie.

           She kisses him sweetly. Palmer, grateful for that, climbs 
           behind the wheel. Maggie watches him drive off, then walks 
           back to her house, happy. 

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - DAY

           Kids exit the school. Palmer walks Sam and Emily to Lucille 
           Coles’s car. Sam and Emily hop in the back, laughing, already 
           having fun. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        Thank you again for the play date. 
                        Now don’t rush yourself. Jus’ come 
                        over whenever you’re ready.

                                 PALMER
                        Tell Coles I said hi.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I will.

           Palmer waves to Sam and Emily as the car drives off.
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Palmer enters Vivian’s house, carrying several brown boxes.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Most of Vivian’s belongings are boxed up. Palmer tapes a box 
           closed. Outside, a car door slams. Palmer looks out the 
           window.

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - SAME

           Sam runs towards the house, crying. He wears a pink skirt and 
           is barefoot. Palmer stops him.

                                 PALMER
                        What’s wrong?

           Sam’s face is covered heavily in makeup (as if applied in a 
           mocking manner) and streaked with tears. He breaks free and 
           runs into the house. A frazzled Lucille Coles approaches 
           Palmer from her car.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I didn’t know what was going on. I 
                        jus’ left them for a bit. I’m 
                        sorry. I really am... 

           Palmer, without waiting for an explanation, disappears into 
           the house after Sam. Lucille stares after him, upset, then 
           backs into her car and drives off. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - VIVIAN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer finds Sam crying on Vivian’s bed. He sits down next to 
           him. 

                                 PALMER
                        Sam, you wanna tell me what 
                        happened?

           Sam doesn’t answer. Palmer puts a gentle hand on his back. 
           Sam’s breathing slows --

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a’right...
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE DAY

           Sam sits on the toilet, in shorts. Palmer faces him, wipes 
           the makeup off with a wet cloth. LOOKS CLOSER -- sees a 
           discoloring, redness on Sam’s cheek.

                                 PALMER 
                        Was it the same ones who always 
                        pick on you? Were they over there?

           Sam nods.  

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        I know you don’t want to hear this, 
                        Sam. But sometimes you gotta hit 
                        ’em back. 

                                 SAM
                        They’re bigger than me.

                                 PALMER
                        I know. But you gotta stand up for 
                        yourself, or these kids’ll never 
                        leave ya alone.

                                 SAM
                        They weren’t kids.

                                 PALMER
                        What do you mean?

           Sam doesn’t say anything.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        Who did this to you? Sam?

           Palmer holds Sam’s eyes. Finally...

                                 SAM
                        Your friend. From the football 
                        game.

           Palmer takes this in. 

           EXT. HOUSE - LATER (NIGHT)

           Palmer exits the house and drives off in the Chevy.
           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer enters. He sees Daryl, Ned and Coles, playing pool and 
           drinking. Palmer approaches Daryl. Daryl turns to meet him, 
           very aware of why Palmer is there. 

                                 DARYL
                        He already had the skirt on. I jus’ 
                        gave the ‘lil faggot some 
                        accessories...

           BOOM! Palmer punches Daryl right in his sarcastic grin. He 
           hits him again and again and again. Daryl gets one good shot 
           in, before Palmer beats this asshole until he can’t move.

           Ned rushes to Daryl’s aid. Palmer reels back with his elbow 
           and sends Ned flying. His bloodied fists come down on Daryl 
           in a homicidal rage. Coles jumps in -- but still Palmer is at 
           it... Angry. Violent. Full of rage.

           Finally and thankfully, Coles and Ned pull a heaving Palmer 
           off Daryl. Palmer stands there, catches his breath, suddenly 
           aware of what he has done. 

           Coles just looks at Palmer. Doesn’t move as...

                                 PALMER
                        Take me in. Do your job.

           INT. SHERIFF’S STATION - CELL - NIGHT

           Palmer, a bruise over his eye, sits in the corner of the 
           cell. Coles Senior approaches. Not happy one bit. 

                                 COLES SENIOR
                        You know the conditions of your 
                        parole?

           Palmer nods.

                                 COLES SENIOR (CONT’D)
                        And if I find any drugs in your 
                        system, you got yourself more 
                        trouble.

           Coles Senior picks up a urine-filled plastic cup off the 
           metal bars.

                                 COLES SENIOR (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back.
           INT. SHERIFF’S STATION - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Coles Senior enters. He drops the plastic cup on a desk and 
           glares down at his son.

                                 COLES SENIOR
                        You done with that report?

                                 COLES
                        This’ll send him back... Daryl 
                        ain’t gonna press any charges. 

                                 COLES SENIOR
                        The last time I looked, Daryl 
                        wasn’t the God damn Sheriff - you 
                        were!

           Coles Senior picks up the phone. He searches for a phone 
           number.

                                 COLES SENIOR (CONT’D)
                        I’ll deal with Daryl and Ned as 
                        soon as I’m done here. 

           Coles Senior finds what he’s looking for, starts dialing... 

                                 COLES
                             (worried)
                        It was in my home. I was there when 
                        it happened... How’s that gonna 
                        look?

                                 COLES SENIOR
                        And that’s exactly your problem! 
                        Not a damn bit a’common sense! 

           He stares at his son, angry.

                                 COLES SENIOR (CONT’D)
                        When the hell you gonna grow up, 
                        Billy?

           INT. SHERIFF’S STATION - NIGHT

           Coles Senior appears at the cell door. Palmer looks up.

                                 COLES SENIOR
                        I don’t want to ever see you again. 
                        You understand me?

           Coles Senior unlocks the door and walks off, leaving Coles to 
           lead Palmer away. Neither say a word. Palmer sees Maggie 
           waiting by the exit.  
                                 COLES
                        I’m sorry. I thought I should call 
                        her.

           Palmer suddenly looks embarrassed.

           EXT. TOWN - NIGHT

           Palmer walks down the street. Maggie follows.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is Sam okay?

           Palmer nods.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        So what are you going to do, beat 
                        up everyone who picks on him?

                                 PALMER
                        Nope, just the ones over thirty.

           Palmer finds the Chevy exactly where he left it. Keys and 
           all. He reaches for the door handle.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Eddie, I didn’t come out here in 
                        the middle of the night for you to 
                        drive off on me. 

                                 PALMER
                        I’m sorry. What do you want me to 
                        say? Coles shouldn’t have called 
                        you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He called me because he was 
                        worried. I came because I care. You 
                        love Sam - I get it... but there 
                        are other ways to handle it.

           Palmer, feeling ashamed, averts her eyes... Maggie notices 
           his bruised and bloodied knuckles.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Look, maybe Sam should stay with 
                        me.

           Beat. Palmer looks at her -- anger visible.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t my idea.
           Palmer, now knowing why Coles called her, opens the door to 
           the Chevy, gets behind the wheel.

                                 PALMER
                        You want Sam... you know where to 
                        find him.

           Palmer slams the door and drives off. Maggie stares after 
           him, suddenly hating herself. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Palmer, showered, examines his face in the mirror. There’s a 
           gash above his eye. He applies shaving cream to his face. Sam 
           enters. He watches Palmer shave, then grabs a band-aid from 
           the cabinet. He places it over the gash.

                                 PALMER
                        Thanks.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Sam sits at the table, excited, watching Palmer write a 
           letter. 

                                 PALMER
                             (reading off the letter)
                        Dear Little Princess club. My name 
                        is Sam, and I would very much like 
                        to be a member...

                                 SAM
                        Make sure you tell ‘em, how much I 
                        love their show, and I watch it 
                        every day. 

                                 PALMER
                             (writing)
                        I watch your show every day. And I 
                        love it, more than anything in the 
                        world.

                                 SAM
                        I do.  

           Palmer finishes. 

                                 PALMER 
                        A’right. Now all you have to do is 
                        sign your name.
           Sam grabs the pen and proudly signs. Palmer sticks it in an 
           envelope.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        It’s good to go.

           Sam smiles. Happy. 

           We hear the front door open and close. 

           Moments later, Shelly appears in the doorway. She stares at 
           her son, guiltily.

                                 SHELLY
                        Hey there, Sam.

           Sam looks at his mother, a mixture of emotions. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        You wanna give your momma a hug? 

           Sam remains seated. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        Well, you ‘jus gonna hurt my 
                        feelings if you don’t.

           Finally, Sam moves to his mother. It takes him a moment to 
           hug her, but when he does he wraps his arms tightly around 
           her. Shelly hugs him back. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        I missed you.

           She looks up and catches Palmer’s judgmental stare. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        We better get home.

           Shelly pulls away from Sam, leaving him to stare back at 
           Palmer. Suddenly, Sam looks sad. Torn. Not wanting to leave.

           Palmer picks up Sam’s lunch box and moves to him. 

                                 PALMER 
                        You and I had a good time. And you 
                        can come visit me whenever you 
                        like. Okay? 

           Sam nods. He takes his lunch box, then hugs Palmer for the 
           longest moment. Palmer forces a smile, gives him a pat. 
                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        A’right. Let’s get the rest of your 
                        things.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Palmer leads Sam into the room. He watches with difficulty as 
           Sam collects his dolls. Shelly places everything in his 
           suitcase. Notices the brand new Little Princess Doll.

                                 SHELLY
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 SAM
                        Palmer... For my birthday. 

           It hits her -- she wasn’t there for it. Beat. 

                                 SHELLY
                        Well, I got ya somethin’ at home. 
                        Had to travel for it. C’mon.

           She walks Sam towards the door. Stops, looks back at Palmer.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about Vivian. I liked 
                        her.

           Shelly leaves with Sam. Palmer stands alone. In silence. The 
           pain visible.

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The morning sun is strong. Palmer exits the house. A “FOR 
           SALE” sign is on the front lawn. His eyes shift to the end of 
           the driveway. 

           Sam is not there. Palmer climbs in the Chevy and drives off.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - MORNING

           Palmer walks to Maggie’s classroom. He doesn’t see Sam 
           inside. Maggie steps into the hall. 

                                 PALMER
                        Shelly came home.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That explains why he’s not here.

           The two stand, quiet.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about the other night.

                                 PALMER
                        It’s fine. It’s over. 

           He starts to walk away. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m not a good person.

           Palmer stops and turns. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I had an affair, and my husband 
                        divorced me. That’s how things 
                        worked out.

           Palmer just looks at her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not perfect, Eddie. I just 
                        pretend to be better than others.

           After a long beat, Palmer cracks a smile. He turns and walks 
           off. Maggie watches him go, then returns to her classroom. 

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           Palmer enters, takes a seat at the end of the bar. The 
           Bartender places a shot of Bourbon in front of Palmer, walks 
           off. Palmer stares at the drink, debating if he should 
           consume it... 

           INT. CHEVY - NIGHT

           Palmer, drunk, pulls up to Vivian’s house. Through the 
           windshield he sees Jerry’s red truck parked in front of 
           Shelly’s house. The lights are on.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           A small hand wakes Palmer from his sleep. Palmer opens his 
           eyes, hung over, and sees Sam standing above him. 

                                 SAM
                        I missed my bus.
           INT. CHEVY - MORNING

           Palmer drives. Sam sits quietly in the passenger seat, 
           without his lunch box.

                                 PALMER
                        Where’s your lunch box?

                                 SAM
                        Jerry threw it away. 

                                 PALMER
                        Did he?

           Sam nods. He looks sad.

                                 SAM
                        He said my momma was raising me to 
                        be a queer. And he ain’t living 
                        with no queer kid.  

           Palmer looks at him, silent.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        What does queer mean?

                                 PALMER
                        It means you’re different. 

                                 SAM
                        Are you queer?

                                 PALMER 
                        I’m different, that’s for sure. 

           Sam still looks upset.

                                 PALMER (CONT'D)
                        You know what else we are? We’re 
                        both good lookin.’ We are. Good 
                        lookin’ and smart. It intimidates 
                        people. Makes ‘em feel afraid. 

                                 SAM
                        Miss Maggie ain’t afraid.

                                 PALMER
                        Nope, she ain’t. ‘Cause she’s good 
                        lookin’ and smart, too. 

           Palmer smiles at Sam. Sam smiles back, feeling better.
           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - MORNING

           Palmer and Sam step out of the Chevy.

                                 PALMER
                        How ‘bout after school, we go get 
                        ourselves some root beer floats?

                                 SAM
                        I can’t. I gotta help my momma. 
                        We’re moving to Jerry’s. Momma said 
                        he wants to marry her. And I’m 
                        gonna have to go to another school.

           Palmer looks like he’s been hit in the stomach.

                                 PALMER 
                        I guess I’ll just have to visit you 
                        then.

                                 SAM 
                        You promise?

                                 PALMER
                        You got my word.

           The two walk toward the school together and slowly it 
           registers for Palmer --

           Sam will be gone.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - MAGGIE’S CLASSROOM - MORNING

           The children draw with colored pencils on white sheets of 
           paper. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who else needs an eraser?

           A few hands go up. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What is there an eraser monster who 
                        eats all the erasers?

           The kids laugh. Maggie stops at Sam’s desk. His sheet is 
           still mostly white.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Sam, you haven’t drawn anything?

           Sam looks up and sees Toby watching him. He says nothing.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Try to draw something, sweetie. 

           Sam picks up a colored pencil. Maggie places a comforting 
           hand on him and watches him draw... 

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - DAY

           Palmer carries the trash to the bins. He looks towards the 
           school buses and sees Sam being walked towards Jerry’s red 
           truck by Shelly. Palmer watches Sam disappear inside the 
           truck. A moment later, it drives off.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           Palmer steps out of the Chevy and heads towards the grocery 
           mart. He stops, sees --

           The familiar red truck parked in front of the diner. 

           A moment later, the door swings open, and Jerry walks out, 
           followed by Shelly, who does not look good. They’re arguing. 
           Loudly. Sam exits after her.

                                 JERRY
                        Christ! He don’t wanna come with 
                        us, leave him here.
                             (mocking)
                        I wanna play with Emily. 

                                 SHELLY
                        Jerry, shut up! I swear to God, 
                        you’re worse than an infant... And 
                        Sammy, please, I tol’ ya we gotta 
                        go home. Now come on now, I don’t 
                        feel well...

           Jerry shoots Sam a nasty look then catches Palmer staring 
           right at him. 

           It takes Palmer everything he has just to do nothing. 
           Finally, Sam slips into the truck with Shelly. Jerry gives 
           Palmer one last glance, then climbs behind the wheel.

           Palmer watches the truck speed away.

           INT. GROCERY MART - DAY

           Palmer stands at the check-out counter, waiting to be rung 
           up. Affected by moments earlier.
           INT. CHEVY - LATER

           Palmer approaches Vivian’s house from a distance, a bag of 
           groceries in the seat next to him... 

           As he nears, he notices Shelly’s house --

           Jerry’s red truck is parked out front. Along with two Sheriff 
           vehicles and an unmarked car. 

           Palmer grows very concerned...

           Noise escalates from inside Shelly’s house --

           A moment later, Sam is carried out of the door by Coles 
           Senior. 

                                 PALMER
                        Shit!

           Palmer tears into Vivian’s driveway, hopping out of the Chevy 
           and running towards Shelly’s house...

           EXT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Coles exits the house trying to control Shelly who is 
           screaming, crying and a bit out of her mind. A FEMALE SOCIAL 
           WORKER tries to talk to her. 

                                 SHELLY
                        Gimme my son!! You got no fuckin’ 
                        right! 

           Jerry holds onto Shelly, keeping her from hitting both Coles 
           and the Female Social Worker. 

           Palmer hurries towards Coles Senior who carries Sam towards 
           his vehicle. He blocks Coles Senior from putting Sam in the 
           back of his vehicle. 

                                 PALMER
                        Whaddya doin’?! Where you taking 
                        him?!

                                 COLES SENIOR
                        This ain’t your business. Move out 
                        of the way! 

                                 SAM
                        Palmer!!

           Palmer watches, as Coles Senior forces Sam into the back 
           seat. Coles Senior slams the door and prepares to leave.
                                 PALMER
                        Man, don’t do this!
                             (to Coles Senior)
                        Give him to me!

           Sam looks up at Palmer from inside the locked car, crying.

                                 SAM
                        Palmer!!!

           The car starts to pull away. Sam bangs on the glass window, 
           begging for Palmer to rescue him. Palmer, helpless, walks 
           alongside the Sheriff’s vehicle. 

                                 PALMER 
                        Don’t worry. I’ll come get you!

           Palmer walks as far as he can, until the vehicle speeds away. 
           He stands there, completely powerless. Over by the house, 
           Jerry is holding onto Shelly, as she spits on Coles who walks 
           away from her. 

                                 SHELLY   
                        Get off my property, you fuckin’ 
                        cocksucker!

           Palmer catches up to Coles, as he hurries towards his 
           vehicle. 

                                 PALMER
                        What the hell was that?! Where’s he 
                        taking him?

           Coles keeps walking...

                                 COLES
                        I had no choice!

           Palmer grabs Coles, hard. Throws him up against his car.

                                 PALMER
                        Where’d he take him?!

           EXT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND PROTECTIVE SERVICES - LATE DAY

           A dark, imposing building. Not in the nicest part of town.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND PROTECTIVE SERVICES - LATER

           Palmer sits across from a FEMALE CASE MANAGER who flips 
           through a very large stack of files. 
                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER
                        Normally we try to find relatives 
                        for temporary custody. I’ll need 
                        you to fill out this paperwork.

           She places several forms in front of Palmer. Hands him a pen. 
           Palmer doesn’t write.

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Palmer, do you have any 
                        questions?

                                 PALMER 
                        I have a felony record. 

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER
                        Are you currently on parole?

           Palmer nods. The Female Case Manager looks at him, 
           disappointed.

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, the agency won’t approve 
                        a foster care license if you’re on 
                        parole. 

                                 PALMER
                        Is Sam okay?

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER
                        Yes, he’s fine.

                                 PALMER
                        Can I see him?

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER
                        Not unless you’re the parent, 
                        guardian, or family member.

           They’re both quiet. Until --

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        There’s a case hearing in family 
                        court on Monday. The judge’ll 
                        decide then if Sam will be placed 
                        into a home or returned to his 
                        mother. Depending on how he rules, 
                        it’s possible he could make an 
                        exception... It’s unlikely, I have 
                        to tell you, but why don’t you fill 
                        out the application, and we’ll see 
                        what the judge says? 

           Palmer, not looking too confident, nods.
           INT./EXT. CHEVY/TOWN - LATER

           The Chevy drives into town and parks in front of the BANK.

           Palmer stares at the bank. Engine running. Uncertain about 
           what he’s about to do. Finally, he steps out...

           INT. BANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Palmer walks slowly up to an open window.

                                 OLDER FEMALE BANK TELLER
                        You jus’ made it, we were ‘bout to 
                        close. How can I help you? 

           Palmer, averting the older woman’s stare, empties the 
           contents of his jacket pocket down on the counter in front of 
           her.

                                 PALMER
                        I need cash. And a bank account. 
                        I’m not sure how this works.

                                 OLDER FEMALE BANK TELLER
                        Eddie?

           The older woman looks at Palmer, confused, maybe even a 
           little fearful, until she looks down and sees --

           All of Palmer’s paychecks. Bundled together.

           A relieved smile fills the woman’s face.

                                 OLDER FEMALE BANK TELLER (CONT’D)
                        Well, I think I can help you out.

                                 PALMER
                        Thank you.

           INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A knock on the door. Shelly, unkempt, moves to see who it 
           is... The room is in shambles.

                                 SHELLY
                        What do you want?

           INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer follows Shelly’s skeleton of a body into the kitchen. 
           Shelly searches for a cigarette, can’t find one. 
                                 PALMER
                        Where’s Jerry?

                                 SHELLY
                        At church, where else... You got a 
                        cigarette?

           Palmer retrieves one from a pack and lights it for her. 
           Shelly chokes on the first drag. Drops into a seat. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Why you here?

           Palmer, without wasting any more time, places several hundred 
           dollar bills on the table. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m good. But I ain’t that good.

                                 PALMER
                        It’s for Sam.

           Alongside the money, he places a document.

                                 SHELLY
                        What’s this?

           Palmer stares at her, silent. Shelly reads the first line. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        Legal guardian?

                                 PALMER
                        You’d be signing Sam over to my 
                        care.

                                 SHELLY
                        And why would I do that?

                                 PALMER
                        ‘Cause unless you get yourself 
                        clean, I don’t see the courts 
                        givin’ him back to you... 
                             (he eyes her closely)
                        You ain’t well, girl.  

           Shelly’s eyes narrow. 

                                 SHELLY
                        Get outta my house.

           Palmer doesn’t budge. Shelly springs from the chair and rips 
           the document up in his face.
                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you! You think you can buy my 
                        son?! You think you’re better than 
                        me?! Jus’ cause you spend time with 
                        my boy. You think you’re his daddy? 
                        You ain’t his daddy, and you ain’t 
                        better than me! 

                                 PALMER 
                        No, I ain’t better than you. Maybe  
                        a bit luckier this time ‘round. 
                        But if something were to happen to 
                        you, well, there ain’t gonna be no 
                        say in the matter. They’ll put Sam 
                        wherever they like. And Sam’s not 
                        like other kids. 

           These words sink in. Shelly knows it’s true. 

                                 SHELLY
                             (desperate)
                        They’ll give him back. And we’ll be 
                        just fine, Sam and me. We’re gonna 
                        leave this shit town behind. I’ll 
                        get clean. Get a good payin’ job. 
                        Buy us a nice home... Start taking 
                        good care of Sammy... You’ll see!

           She stares hard at Palmer, wanting so bad to believe it. Then 
           her fantasy gives way to tears. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        Get out.

           Palmer doesn’t move. Shelly scoops up his money and shoves it 
           into his hand. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        GET OUT!

           INT. FAMILY COURT - LOBBY - DAYS LATER 

           PEOPLE wait to have their turn in front of the judge. Palmer 
           sits next to Maggie, in dress pants and a nice shirt and tie. 
           He looks handsome and nervous. Maggie takes hold of his hand.

           A moment later, the Female Case Manager appears.  

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER
                        Mr. Palmer... come with me... 
           INT. FAMILY COURT - COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           An older black MALE JUDGE with a stoic look glances down at 
           Palmer’s application. Palmer sits before him with Maggie and 
           the Female Case Manager at his side. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Has the mother shown up yet?

                                 FEMALE CASE MANAGER
                        No, your honor.

           The Judge focuses on Palmer.

                                 JUDGE
                        Mr. Palmer, I understand you’re on 
                        parole, yet requesting the court  
                        permit temporary custody of the boy 
                        due to special circumstances, am I 
                        to understand that correctly? 

                                 PALMER 
                        Yes, sir... 

                                 JUDGE
                        Why don’t you tell me what those 
                        special circumstances are.

           Palmer stands, incredibly nervous.

                                 PALMER
                        You see, awhile back Sam’s mother 
                        took off and left him with my 
                        grandmother, well she died, and 
                        then Sam jus’ stayed with me. You 
                        see, I was already taking care of 
                        Sam... I drove him to school every 
                        morning.  I made him sandwiches for 
                        lunch. He’d only eat cookies if you 
                        let him. I washed his clothes. 
                        Bleached a few by accident. And 
                        Sam’s real funny, too, he don’t 
                        like to bathe much, but I still 
                        made him. I even helped him with 
                        his homework. We went trick or 
                        treatin’ together and...

           Maggie quietly watches. Palmer pauses, emotional. Realizing 
           just how much he loves Sam. The Judge waits. 

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        You see, I hadn’t felt like I was 
                        good at anything in a long time, 
                        until Sam. I had no purpose. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. I had a minimum paying job 
                        and was lucky for that. Now I ain’t 
                        blaming no one, your honor. I did 
                        what I did when I was younger, and 
                        I got what I got. And I accept 
                        that. But the thing is -- I don’t 
                        want one more regret in my life. I 
                        got too damn many. And it’s a hard 
                        way to live. Waking up every 
                        morning wishing you should’a done 
                        something different, or said 
                        something you never said. When my 
                        grandmother died, all I wanted was 
                        five more minutes. Jus’ to be able 
                        to say sorry for the things I done. 
                        Tell her I loved her. Let her know 
                        how much she meant to me. I never 
                        said any of that... And that’s the 
                        biggest regret I have. That woman 
                        took me in. Twice. When no one else 
                        would. I don’t want another regret 
                        to wake up to. 
                             (pauses, upset)
                        I can’t abandon that boy. I jus’ 
                        won’t... And I promise you, you 
                        wouldn’t have to worry about him, 
                        I’d take good care of Sam. 

           The Judge looks evenly at Palmer, weighing his decision, then 
           finally he picks up Palmer’s application and reviews it.

                                 JUDGE
                        I see you’re currently employed at 
                        Pineville Elementary?

                                 PALMER
                        Yes, sir, I’m a custodial engineer. 

           The Judge sees that on the application, then flips to the 
           attached reference letters. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Your supervisor John Sibs speaks 
                        well of you.... as does Sam’s 
                        school teacher, Ms. Maggie Hayes. I 
                        assume that’s you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes, your honor.
                                 JUDGE
                             (nods, continues...)
                        The address you listed as your home 
                        residence. Does anyone else live 
                        there with you? 

                                 PALMER
                        No, sir. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Is it a house, apartment?  

                                 PALMER
                        It’s a house... for now. 

                                 JUDGE
                        What do you mean, for now?

           Palmer looks at the Judge, realizes he just said the wrong 
           thing.

                                 PALMER
                        It’s my grandmother’s house. It’s 
                        up for sale. But I’ll have plenty 
                        of money to rent a new place. Even 
                        closer to the school.

                                 JUDGE
                        I see.

           The Judge examines Palmer. 

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Palmer, you seem like you’re 
                        heading in the right direction, 
                        doing well, and perhaps once you 
                        have your living situation squared 
                        away and are no longer on parole, 
                        you can apply for a license at that 
                        time. But for now, I’m sorry, I’m 
                        going to have to deny your request 
                        for temporary custody. 

                                 PALMER
                        But I’m gonna get a new home... 
                        you’ll see...

                                 JUDGE
                        My decision is that the boy will 
                        remain under the care of the state 
                        and be placed into a registered 
                        foster home, until the mother is 
                        well enough to regain custody.
                                 PALMER
                        Your honor, please. His mother is a 
                        drug addict, that ain’t happening.  

                                 JUDGE
                        I’m sorry, that’s my decision.

           He places Palmer’s application aside. Palmer stares at him, 
           dumbfounded. He looks to Maggie, who is also stunned.

           We hear yelling from the hall... The BAILIFF steps into the 
           hall to see what’s going on --  

           THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN

           Shelly hurries into the room, having pulled herself together 
           in a skirt and clean washed hair. She is followed in by the 
           Bailiff.

                                 SHELLY
                        I’m here! I’m here! Sorry I’m late, 
                        your honor. 

           She sees Palmer and Maggie, standing next to the Case Manager 
           and suddenly looks afraid...

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        They said to show up on Monday. 
                        Today’s Monday. So here I am. 

                                 JUDGE
                        And who are you?

                                 SHELLY
                        I’m Sam’s mother... that’s who I 
                        am.  

           She stands, dignified. The Judge looks to the Case Manager 
           who opens her folder. Shelly sees her name and points to it. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        That’s me, right there. Your honor, 
                        please... I don’t know what them 
                        notes say, or anyone else... But 
                        them sheriffs didn’t even talk to 
                        Sam. They jus’ came into my home 
                        and took him away. They didn’t even 
                        say why... 

           Shelly looks at Palmer and Maggie, who remain silent.
                                 JUDGE
                        Ms. Browne, a complaint of abuse 
                        and neglect was made to child 
                        protective services. Upon 
                        inspection, your home was deemed 
                        dangerous, and you were described 
                        as being violent and agitated. 

                                 SHELLY
                        That ain’t true... No, sir! But 
                        agitated, yeah, I was agitated... 
                        Now I’ve had some health problems, 
                        I’ll admit to that... And people 
                        have helped me out. Sure. I’m poor. 
                        Hell, I know I’m broke. I ain’t in 
                        denial ‘bout that. But I ain’t 
                        never once put a hand on my son! I 
                        never even raised my voice to 
                        Sammy. You go ask Sammy, and he’ll 
                        tell you the truth. He ain’t an 
                        unhappy boy, your honor. 

           The Judge looks at her -- 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll do whatever you want me to do. 
                        Jus’ please... don’t send my son to 
                        go live with no strangers. 

           Off Palmer’s look --

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING 

           A quiet morning haze. Palmer exits the house and walks to the 
           Chevy. He looks at Shelly’s house, which is noticeably quiet, 
           and then gets behind the wheel of the Chevy and drives off. 

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - HALL - LATER

           Palmer pushes an empty cart down the hall, stops at Maggie’s 
           classroom, looks in and sees her teaching. Sam’s seat is 
           empty. He moves on... 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The house is barren except for some pieces of furniture.
           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME

           Palmer collects his toothbrush, a few random items, and drops 
           them all into a duffle bag. He hears the front door open and 
           close...  

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer enters... standing alone in the doorway is Sam. 

           Sam sees Palmer and runs to him. Palmer meets Sam with a big 
           hug. Sam holds him tightly...

           Palmer pulls back with a smile. His eyes are wet.

                                 SAM
                        You’re crying?

                                 PALMER
                        Am I? I must be happy to see you.
                             (beat)
                        You a’right? 

           Sam nods, then off the room -- 

                                 SAM
                        What happened to Vivian’s things?

                                 PALMER
                        I got rid of ‘em. I’m moving.

                                 SAM
                        You are - where ya goin’? 

                                 PALMER
                        Don’t know.

                                 SAM
                        Maybe you can move to wherever me 
                        and momma are going? 

           Palmer forces a smile, then sees Sam is holding something in 
           his hand.

                                 PALMER
                        Whaddya got there?

                                 SAM
                        I found it outside. 

           We see that it’s one of those small grammar school photos, of 
           a young boy. 
                                 PALMER
                        That’s me. When I was your age.

                                 SAM
                        Can I keep it?

                                 PALMER
                        Sure.

           Sam sticks the photo in his pocket, like a treasure.

                                 SHELLY (O.S.)
                        Sam! Sammy! C’mon now!

           The two fall silent... 

                                 SHELLY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Sammy!!

           Finally --

                                 SAM
                        I gotta go.

           Beat. 

                                 PALMER
                        You better get then.

           Sam looks at Palmer, not wanting to leave him, then he gives 
           Palmer one last hug, before running out of the house... 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer steps onto the porch and watches Sam run back to his 
           house. 

           EXT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Shelly waits for Sam... 

                                 SHELLY
                        C’mon now! Get your things. 

           Sam runs past her and disappears inside the house. Shelly, 
           not looking healthy, and white knuckling it to stay clean, 
           catches Palmer staring at her -- she locks eyes with him, 
           then turns and walks inside the house.
           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer stares after Shelly a moment longer, then heads back 
           into the house.

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/LATER

           Palmer, carrying a box under one arm, folds up Vivian’s tray 
           table and heads out the door... 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer loads the box and tray table into the trunk of the 
           Chevy. He slams the trunk closed, about to head back into the 
           house, when he hears yelling coming from Shelly’s house... 

           INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The room is trashed. Jerry holds a wasted Shelly down on the 
           couch. He yanks her hair.

                                 JERRY
                        Say that to me again! You fuckin’ 
                        junkie!

                                 SHELLY
                        Get off me, you son of a bitch!

           Shelly tries to kick him. Sam grabs onto Jerry’s back.

                                 SAM
                        Leave her alone!

           Jerry pushes Sam off him, hard. Sam slams into the wall.

           The door swings open, and Palmer grabs Jerry and throws him 
           against the side of the house, ready to strike with his fist, 
           when he sees Sam watching from the floor --  

           Palmer releases Jerry and takes a step back, surveying 
           Shelly, the damage... a needle on the floor. 

           Palmer picks up Sam and carries him out of the house.

                                 SHELLY
                        Hey! Where the hell you goin’?! 
                        Come back here!
           INT. CHEVY - NIGHT

           Palmer speeds down the road, unsure where he is going. Sam 
           sits in the passenger seat. He begins to cry. This is all too 
           much for him. Palmer pulls over, hits the brakes. 

                                 PALMER
                        It’s a’right, Sam. It’s okay. 

           Palmer takes hold of Sam, comforting him, trying to decide 
           what to do. 

           EXT. TRUCK STOP/DINER - LATER

           A big rig pulls off a highway to fuel for gas. A lonely diner 
           sits adjacent to it. A few beat up cars are parked in front. 
           We see the Chevy amongst them, as...

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Palmer approaches a tired looking MANAGER who wears a name 
           tag pinned to his shirt. 

                                 PALMER
                        You got a phone I can borrow?

           The Manager places an iPhone down on the counter.   

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           Palmer dials, keeping his eye on Sam in the Chevy --

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME

           A phone rings. Maggie walks in from the living room and 
           collects the ringing phone off the wall. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hello? 

           INTERCUT: DINER/MAGGIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                 PALMER
                        It’s me.

           Maggie, both relieved and concerned -- 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Eddie... where are you? 
           Beat. Palmer, suddenly aware -- Coles already called her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You gotta bring Sam back. 

                                 PALMER
                        I can’t. Not to that. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s kidnapping. 

                                 PALMER
                        She ain’t fit.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Maybe so. But where you gonna go 
                        with him? Huh? You’ll end up back 
                        in prison. Is that what you want? 

           Palmer is silent. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        She’s his mother, Eddie. Good or 
                        bad, right or wrong - she’s Sam’s 
                        mother. 

           Palmer stares out the window at Sam who watches him from 
           inside the car. A small boy. Confused. Lost. Equally scared. 

           Finally, after what seems like forever, and fighting against 
           every instinct inside him --

                                 PALMER
                        Call Coles. 

           He hangs up the call. Walks out.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie stands holding the phone, upset. 

           INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS

           Palmer slides behind the wheel, doesn’t look at Sam, doesn’t 
           start the car. Uncertain about his decision -- 

                                 SAM
                        Palmer...

           Palmer is quiet.
                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Where we going? 

           Palmer, thinking, eyes the highway -- he could just take off, 
           keep going. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Palmer? 

           Palmer looks over at Sam, and even Sam knows, they have to go 
           back. 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - HOURS LATER

           Silence. Still dark out. Dawn breaking.

           The Chevy pulls into Vivian’s driveway. 

           THRU the windshield, Palmer sees the two Sheriff vehicles 
           parked in front of Shelly’s house, waiting for him. 

           Coles Senior steps out of one, locking eyes with Palmer. 

                                 PALMER
                             (to Sam)
                        You wait here, okay? 

           Sam, growing afraid, nods. Palmer exits the Chevy. 

           EXT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Coles, in plain clothes, exits the house with Shelly, looking 
           unwell, but nonetheless indignant -- staring angrily at 
           Palmer, wanting his arrest. 

                                 COLES
                        Stay here. 

           Coles leaves Shelly behind as he meets Palmer. 

                                 COLES (CONT’D)
                        She ain’t in any shape. I’m gonna 
                        take Sam over to Maggie’s. 

                                 PALMER
                        Thank you.

           Coles nods. It’s the least he could do, and he wishes he 
           could do more.

                                 COLES
                        I’m sorry, Palmer.
           Coles Senior approaches Palmer. No empathy here.

                                 COLES SENIOR
                        Turn around, Eddie, place your 
                        hands behind your back... You’re 
                        under arrest for abduction of a 
                        child.  

           Palmer does as he’s told, and his hands are promptly cuffed.

           His rights are read to him, when suddenly -- 

           The car door of the Chevy busts open, and Sam runs to Palmer. 

                                 SAM
                        NOOO! Leave him alone!! 

           Sam races across the lawn and attacks Coles Senior. Punching 
           and hitting him. Trying as hard as he can to push him away 
           from Palmer. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        NOOOOO! Let him go!! Let him go!!! 

           Coles grabs Sam, pulling him off Coles Senior, restraining 
           him, as -- 

           Palmer is placed inside the back of Coles Senior’s vehicle. 
           The door is slammed shut, locking Palmer inside. 

           Shelly simply stands by the house, unable to do anything but 
           watch Sam cry, as he is held back by Coles. Emotions build 
           for her --

           Coles Senior walks to the driver’s door, ready to drive off --

           A realization hits Shelly. Hard. Painful. Until finally --

                                 SHELLY
                        I lied!

           Coles Senior stops -- 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t take Sam. I lied.

           INT. SHELLY’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Shelly, dressed decently, applies makeup to her face, 
           covering a bruise. Her hands shake. She is nervous. She 
           applies red lipstick. Stares at herself in the mirror. She 
           looks pretty. 
           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Palmer steps outside Maggie’s house -- 

           Shelly approaches him. We see the red truck parked in the 
           street, engine running.

           It takes Shelly a moment before she is able to speak. 

                                 SHELLY
                        You, uh, you think I’m a bad 
                        mother?

           Palmer simply looks at her --

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - MORNING 

           Palmer walks Shelly into the house. She passes Maggie without 
           a word and follows Palmer to the kitchen...  

           Sitting at the table is Sam. Shelly enters and sits down next 
           to him, as Palmer disappears from the room...  

                                 SHELLY
                        Hey, Sammy.

           Sam doesn’t say a word. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re mad at me, and tha’s 
                        all right...

           Sam stares at his shoes, ignores her.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Well, look, Sammy, I uh, I need to 
                        talk to you about something 
                        important. You think we could do 
                        that? 

           Sam, without looking at his mother, gives the slightest nod 
           of his head.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Good. Tha’s good.

           Shelly watches Sam, uncertain how she is going to do this, 
           then finally...
                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        Well, you see, Sam, I’ve been 
                        thinkin’ ‘bout some things, and I 
                        think it might be best if you live 
                        with Palmer. 

           Sam is quiet.

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        He’s a real good man. He cares for 
                        you. And, well, I’m struggling, 
                        Sam. I’m struggling. It ain’t that 
                        I don’t love you. 

           Sam begins to cry. Shelly tries to force back her own tears. 
           But she can’t. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT'D)
                        I love you with all my heart.

           Sam moves off his chair and hugs Shelly. This only makes it 
           more difficult. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        You wanna live with Palmer? You 
                        want him to be your daddy? 

           Sam looks at his mother for the longest moment, then he nods. 

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - EARLY MORNING

           A blue sky. Quiet morning. The Chevy pulls into the school’s 
           parking lot and parks next to the only other car.

           INT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - JANITOR’S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

           Palmer enters. Sibs is already behind his desk. A large box 
           takes up the middle of the room. It rests on a cart.

                                 SIBS
                        Junior’s new air conditioner.

           Palmer nods, takes off his jacket, and that’s when he sees... 

           A set of KEYS on his desk. Nothing more.

           Palmer looks at Sibs, whose back is to him. 

                                 PALMER
                        Sibs -- 

           Sibs looks up from his paperwork.
                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        Thank you... For everything.

                                 SIBS
                        You better hurry up. Junior doesn’t 
                        like to wait.

           Palmer smiles. Sibs smiles back. And it’s fair to say - these 
           two men like one another. 

           Palmer grabs the keys, cart, and rolls out with both...

           EXT. PINEVILLE ELEMENTARY - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Buses, cars, kids everywhere. Principal Forbes stands talking 
           with a RANDOM PARENT and Lucille Coles.

           Palmer and Sam exit the school, heading toward the Chevy. 
           Lucille quickly stops Palmer, they talk for a moment, most 
           likely to arrange a play date. Finally --

           Palmer and Sam head off to the Chevy. 

           In the street, we see the familiar red truck.

           INT. JERRY’S RED TRUCK - SAME

           Shelly sits in the passenger seat. She stares out the window, 
           watching Sam. 

                                 JERRY
                        Whatya wanna do?

           Shelly’s eyes hold on Sam. He looks happy. A beat.

                                 SHELLY
                        Let’s go.

           Jerry throws the truck into drive. Pulls away.

           Shelly stares out the window, desperately watching Sam, until 
           he is no longer visible.

           EXT. TOWN - AFTERNOON

           We see the FENDER TIM ARMSTRONG HELLCAT in the window of the 
           PAWN SHOP. A MAN removes it from the display case.
           INT. CHEVY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sam watches Palmer exit the pawn shop, carrying the guitar. 
           Palmer opens the back door to the Chevy, places the guitar 
           down, then gets behind the wheel. Drives off.

                                 PALMER
                        One more stop. Then we’re done.

           Sam looks at the guitar. 

                                 SAM
                        You gonna learn to play that?

                                 PALMER
                        Learn? I a’ready had fifteen years 
                        of practice. I better be good by 
                        now.

                                 SAM
                        Will you teach me?

                                 PALMER
                        That’s the plan... 

           EXT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LATER

           The “For Sale” sign has the word “Sold” above it. The Chevy 
           is parked out front, next to another car. 

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - PALMER’S BEDROOM - LATER 

           Palmer takes his high school football pennant off the wall, 
           then walks out.   

           INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie carefully packs a few remaining items of Vivian’s into 
           a large box. Palmer walks over, places the pennant on top. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        That it?

                                 PALMER
                        Good to go.

           Sam runs out of the kitchen, holding a spatula.

                                 SAM
                        Do you want this?
                                 PALMER
                        Sure.

           Sam drops it in the box.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I have to get to that store. So I’m 
                        leaving the heavy liftin’ to you. 
                        And I’ll see you men shortly. 

           Maggie gives Palmer a kiss on the lips.

                                 PALMER
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to Sam)
                        I’m making my surprise dish for 
                        dinner. 

                                 SAM
                        What is it?

                                 MAGGIE
                        If I told ya it wouldn’t be a 
                        surprise.

           Maggie walks out giving Sam a gentle touch on the head. 

           EXT./INT. VIVIAN’S HOUSE/CHEVY - EVENING

           Palmer loads the box into the trunk of the Chevy. Sam hops in 
           the passenger seat as --

           Palmer slams the trunk closed, walks to the mailbox, collects 
           what’s inside. One piece grabs his attention, causes him to 
           look at Sam, perhaps worried...

           INT. CHEVY - EVENING

           Palmer slides behind the wheel. He watches Sam stare at his 
           former house. It looks vacant.

                                 PALMER
                        You ready?

           Sam nods.

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        This came in the mail for you.

           Palmer holds out an envelope addressed to Sam. 
                                 SAM
                        I never got mail before.

                                 PALMER
                        Well it’s yours. Go ahead, take it.

           After a moment, Sam takes the envelope... Palmer watches Sam 
           as he opens it and pulls out a fancy pink certificate...

           Sam stops... looks at Palmer who smiles at him. 

                                 PALMER (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations. 

           We see that it is from the PRINCESS CLUB. 

           Sam studies the certificate as if it were made of gold, 
           eyeing his name printed in bold scripted letters.

           THE END.
