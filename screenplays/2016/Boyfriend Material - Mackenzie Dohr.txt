           EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - MORNING

           Los Angeles in the near future. Things are basically the same 
           but most people walking around are “plugged in,” or viewing 
           the world through VIRTUAL REALITY. People wear thick, black 
           glasses that change their surroundings to whatever they 
           desire - a beach in Greece, a football stadium, the 
           possibilities are endless. Everyone carries a phone - which 
           connects them to the VR. Electric buses zoom by a crowded 
           coffee shop, several homeless people beg for change, and 
           nouveau hipsters argue about hydroponic vs soil marijuana. 
           Again, things are basically the same. 

           We ANGLE ON a harried-looking girl - 26, dressed in a plain 
           jacket and jeans. This is MAEVE. She stands out from the 
           crowd because she’s NOT “plugged in.” She takes a Moleskine 
           from her pocket and studies the front page. It reads “Ad-
           Dictive Entertainment. 6th and Santa Fe. 11AM.” She looks at 
           her phone - it’s 10:42. Damnit. She asks a man wearing dark 
           glasses for directions but he keeps walking. She throws her 
           hands up in frustration and HITS A GUY WALKING BY. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Holy shit, I’m so sorry. Are you 
                        okay?

           He takes his dark glasses off and smiles at her. He’s 
           handsome. This is HUNTER. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Hey if you wanted to get my 
                        attention, you could have just said 
                        “Hi.” 

                                 MAEVE
                           (blushing)
                        I’m late for this interview and I 
                        can’t find it and I’m just a mess. 
                        So sorry again. 

           She turns to walk away but Hunter grabs her arm.

                                 HUNTER
                        Where’s the interview?

                                 MAEVE
                        This place called “Ad-dictive 
                        Entertainment?” They must be one of 
                        those places that thinks it’s cool 
                        not to have a sign outside so 
                        people are constantly walking by, 
                        wondering if they’re in the right 
                        place. I hate those places I can’t 
                        believe I’m, interviewing here. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Hunter smiles and points across the street. An ENORMOUS SIGN 
           reads “AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT” in BIG, BOLD LETTERS. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Well this has been an enjoyable 2 
                        minutes of me embarrassing myself 
                        repeatedly.  

                                 HUNTER
                           (laughing)
                        Can I take you out sometime? 

           Maeve stares at him, confused. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Why?

                                 HUNTER
                        I think you’re funny. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh. Yeah, that tracks. 

                                 HUNTER
                        How about you call me after your 
                        interview? We can go grab coffee. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Okay. Wow, this is so weird. I’ve 
                        never like... met someone like 
                        this. Like in real life. I didn’t 
                        even know people did this anymore. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Me neither, honestly. 

           They look at each other for a long beat. 

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        You should probably get going. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Right, right. The interview. That 
                        I’m so excited about. 

           INT. AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT

           Maeve sits in a BEAUTIFUL OFFICE across from a well-dressed 
           MAN. His mouth moves but she doesn’t hear anything. Did she 
           just meet the man of her dreams? 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           MONTAGE:

           Maeve and Hunter RIDE BIKES in Santa Monica. They throw bread 
           to the seagulls, who attack. Maeve SHRIEKS and kisses Hunter. 

           Maeve and Hunter shop for antiques. Hunter picks up an iPod 
           and pretends to listen to music. Maeve LAUGHS - it’s 
           hysterical.

           Maeve goes to work at Ad-Dictive Entertainment. She looks 
           slightly unenthused but still happy.

           Hunter gets Maeve a CAT. She’s ecstatic! The cat hisses at 
           her.

           Maeve and Hunter KISS by the Griffith Observatory. 

           Maeve writes on her computer (a super high-tech version) 
           while Hunter makes a phone call. He looks stressed, she keeps 
           writing, trying to ignore it. 

           Maeve does a funny dance for Hunter - he looks at her 
           adoringly. 

           Maeve and Hunter move in together. They put their couch in 
           position and jump on it. Maeve puts photos of them together 
           on her fridge. 

           Maeve writes while Hunter “plugs in.” She looks at him, 
           annoyed, but keeps writing. 

           Maeve hangs up a phone call and SOBS into Hunter’s arms. She 
           grabs onto him, helpless. Something horrible has happened. 

           Maeve pours herself a large glass of wine. Hunter scoffs, 
           disapproving. 

           Maeve sleeps on the couch, Hunter covers her with a blanket. 
           She grabs his hand. He sits with her and rubs her head. 

           Maeve sits on the couch, drinking wine. She looks at the 
           clock: 1:03 AM. She taps her foot, anxious. 

           Maeve tries to hold Hunter’s hand at dinner, he moves his 
           hand away. 

           Hunter gives Maeve a pair of VR glasses as a gift. She holds 
           back tears - it’s obviously not what she wanted. 

           Maeve drinks wine in the bathtub. Hunter “plugs in” on the 
           couch. They seem like strangers.

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           We FADE IN on MAEVE and HUNTER FIGHTING. It’s the fight of 
           the century: plates are smashing, obscenities are being 
           thrown. In one corner of the room, an IMAGE is projected on 
           the wall. It’s a NAKED WOMAN, her face frozen in exaggerated 
           ecstasy. “THE SOUND OF SILENCE” by SIMON AND GARFUNKEL blasts 
           from a record player in the corner.

                                 MAEVE
                        You son of a bitch. You selfish, 
                        ungrateful piece of shit!

                                 HUNTER
                        Maeve, you have to calm down. My 
                        neighbors are going to complain. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh fuck the neighbors! You always 
                        care about what other people think. 
                        You should care what I think. 

                                 HUNTER
                        I do care what you think!

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh really? You don’t care that I’ve 
                        been home three nights in a row by 
                        myself while you’re out live-
                        blogging whatever the fuck it is.

                                 HUNTER
                        It’s my goddamn job! When are you 
                        going to understand that?

                                 MAEVE
                        You work in SOCIAL MEDIA. Who gives 
                        a flying fuck? 

                                 HUNTER
                        Look, it’s not my fault you can’t 
                        adapt. Technology is a good thing. 
                        It helps people. You can’t keep 
                        hiding in your own little world, 
                        pretending it doesn’t exist. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh no trust me, I know it exists. 
                        It’s staring me right in the face. 

           Maeve gestures to the NAKED WOMAN’s image on the wall. Hunter 
           LAUGHS. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HUNTER
                        Jasmine? She’s CGI. She’s not even 
                        real. 

                                 MAEVE
                        She’s real to you. We haven’t had 
                        sex in months and here I am 
                        thinking “the poor guy, he’s so 
                        stressed at work what can I do?” 
                        I’m buying new underwear and 
                        exercising - which is a fucking 
                        nightmare by the way - and then I 
                        find out the real reason is because 
                        I can’t compare to this!

           Maeve SMACKS the wall, hard. 

                                 HUNTER
                        MAEVE! The neighbors!

           Maeve SMACKS the wall again, over and over.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re acting insane!

           Hunter grabs Maeve, shaking her. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I can barely get you to look up 
                        from your phone most of the time. 
                        Now you’re fucking a fake pornstar 
                        and I’m not allowed to be mad?

           Maeve shakes off Hunter, picks up an ODDLY-SHAPED PLASTIC 
           CONE, grimaces, and throws it at him. She grabs her coat. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Have fun with her. I’m sure you two 
                        will be very happy together. 

           Maeve picks up the SLEEPING CAT and SLAMS THE DOOR. 

           INT. APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 

           Maeve stands outside of Hunter’s door, waiting. Her 
           expression turns from expectant to depressed when she 
           realizes he’s not coming after her. She walks away with her 
           head held high. As she gets further away, her expression 
           darkens. She reaches the stairway and immediately starts to 
           SOB. The cat in her arms MEOWS loudly.

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           CHYRON: ONE MONTH LATER

           We ANGLE ON: A sleeping Maeve caught in a tangle of sheets 
           and pillows. The cat sits on her stomach, pawing gently. An 
           ALARM sounds. Maeve’s EYES POP OPEN. 

           MUSIC CUE: “SECOND HAND NEWS” by Fleetwood Mac. 

           MONTAGE:

           As the music BLASTS, we ZOOM in on Maeve, her face 
           expressionless. Finally, she gets out of bed, sending the cat 
           flying. 

           Maeve opens her fridge, smells a carton of milk, makes a face 
           and puts it back. 

           Maeve sits on her couch, eating a STICK OF PEPPERONI. Her 
           PHONE (ultra slim, basically see-through) BUZZES next to her: 
           MOM CALLING. She buries it in the cushions. 

           Maeve sits cross-legged on her rug, eyes closed. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Meditate. Med-i-tate. Med-i-care. 
                        Medellin Cartel. Carvel. Carvel ice 
                        cream cake. 

           Maeve eats a CARVEL ICE CREAM CAKE straight out of the box.

           A DRUNK Maeve scrolls through pictures of her and Hunter on 
           her phone. She UGLY-CRIES loudly. A KNOCK at the door. Maeve 
           perks up - her pizza!

           Twenty minutes later, the pizza box is empty and so is a 
           bottle of wine. She leaves a VOICE MAIL for Hunter. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                           (drunk)
                        It’s me I wanted to say that you 
                        need to delete those naked pictures 
                        of me. Or you can keep them if you 
                        want. I don’t care. It’s Maeve by 
                        the way.

           She HICCUPS loudly and hangs up. She aims her phone’s camera 
           down her shirt. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just give you a little 
                        reminder, shall we?
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           She looks at the picture and grimaces. Then... she shrugs.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Could be worse.

           Maeve organizes her RECORD COLLECTION by color. There’s one 
           purple cover. She starts to cry, not knowing where to put it. 
           She PACKS A BOWL and inhales deeply.

           Maeve’s friends RAYMOND and MOIRA talk to Maeve while she 
           stares, high as a kite, back at them. They buzz around her 
           apartment, cleaning as they go. Raymond SCREAMS. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        There is a DEAD MOUSE under your 
                        couch, Maeve! 

                                 MAEVE
                        Okay. 

           Moira calls from the bathroom. 

                                 MOIRA (O.S.)
                        You have no toilet paper - what 
                        have you been using?!

                                 MAEVE
                        I usually just pee in the shower. 

           Later, Maeve sits on the couch, unmoving. The sun sets, she 
           stays seated. 

           Maeve crawls into bed and pops THREE XANAX. She pulls an eye 
           mask on and pets the cat, who snuggles in next to her. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Good day today, Beauregard. I’m 
                        proud of us. 

           Maeve’s phone BUZZES. 

                                 TEXT FROM MOM
                        CALL YOUR SISTER MAEVEY! AND TAKE A 
                        SHOWER!

           Maeve looks at the text, sighs loudly and pulls the covers 
           over her head. She plays a SAVED MESSAGE on her phone. 

                                 HUNTER’S VOICE
                           (singing)
                        You are my sunshine, my only 
                        sunshine, you make me happy--

           As Maeve falls asleep, we... FADE OUT.

           INT. CAR DEALERSHIP - A FEW DAYS LATER

           A bright and shiny car dealership in Los Angeles. The muzak 
           plays joyfully over the speakers, the place hums with 
           positivity. ANGLE ON: Maeve, slightly more alert but still 
           grumpy and unshowered. She glances gloomily around her. Other 
           customers stare into their tablets and phones. She pushes a 
           button on her chair to call a salesperson. But the 
           salespeople aren’t people, they’re ROBOTS - made up of a 
           long, metal rod with a digital screen on top which serves as 
           their “face.” Their “arms” are thin but dextrous. Several of 
           them roam the floor. A ROBOT SALESMAN with a smiley face 
           screen approaches Maeve.

                                 ROBOT SALESMAN
                        Hi Jensen comma Maeve! I am 
                        Anthony. How may I assist you?

                                 MAEVE
                        I’ve been waiting here for two 
                        hours. When can I speak to a human?

                                 ROBOT SALESMAN
                        I am equipped to answer any and all 
                        of your questions, perhaps even 
                        better than a human would!

           The smiley chuckles and tinny laughter emits from his 
           speakers. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Okay well, I just need my car to 
                        pass inspection.

           She points to a shitty-looking Corolla in the parking lot. 
           The robot’s smiley turns into a frown.

                                 ROBOT SALESMAN
                        That vehicle is not safe. Can I 
                        interest you in one of our electric 
                        models?

                                 MAEVE
                        No. I don’t need a new car. 

                                 ROBOT SALESMAN
                        If you are worried about money, we 
                        have a very reasonable payment 
                        plan. How much are you willing to 
                        spend?

                                 MAEVE
                        Nothing. Can you please just help 
                        me out?
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 ROBOT SALESMAN
                        That is what I am here for! How 
                        about taking a look at our new 
                        models-

                                 MAEVE
                        How about this? Does this mean 
                        anything to you?

           Maeve gives the robot the finger. The robot’s smiley turns 
           into a ?. His speaker emits a message in a woman’s voice.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        We are unable to process your 
                        request. Have a nice day.

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh fuck you very much.

           Maeve storms out of the dealership. The other customers chat 
           with the robots and play on their devices, not noticing her 
           dramatic exit.

           INT. MAEVE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Maeve sits in her beat-up car and lights a joint. “FERNANDO” 
           by ABBA plays through the meager stereo system. Exhaling, she 
           rubs tears from her eyes. She looks at her phone, thinks for 
           a beat, then calls HUNTER. 

                                 HUNTER (O.S.)
                        Maeve?

                                 MAEVE
                        Hi. So it’s been a month. Is there 
                        anything you’d like to say?

                                 HUNTER
                        Um... you sent me a really blurry 
                        picture of one of your nipples the 
                        other night?

                                 MAEVE
                        No I mean like... have you been 
                        thinking about our relationship?

           There’s a long beat. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Look, I don’t think it’s a good 
                        idea for you to keep calling.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Keep calling? This is the first 
                        time I’ve called--

           Maeve FLASHES to several nights of DRUNK DIALS. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Um what? I’m losing you I can’t 
                        hear you!

           She THROWS her phone and it lands in the space between the 
           seats. She tries to extract it and fails. She notices a robot 
           roaming the parking lot and rolls down her window.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Um, excuse me... sir? Is that the 
                        correct term?

                                 PARKING LOT ROBOT
                        Yes... miss? Is that the correct 
                        term?

           The robot chuckles.

                                 MAEVE
                        Jesus. I just need some help with 
                        getting my phone. I dropped it-

                                 PARKING LOT ROBOT
                        In between the seats? Don’t worry, 
                        happens all the time.

           He opens the passenger door and extracts her phone, hands it 
           to her, his smiley shining brightly.

                                 MAEVE
                        Wow. Um... thanks.

           She shakes his hand and smiles slightly.

                                 PARKING LOT ROBOT
                        Our new models have a special seat 
                        retractor that keeps things from 
                        falling in between-

           Maeve slams the door and flicks him off. The ? appears on his 
           screen.

                                 MAEVE
                        I know how to silence you! I have 
                        the power!

           She peels out of the parking lot, startling passerby and 
           several robots whose screens read “SLOW DOWN!”

           EXT. AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT - LATER

           A GIANT OFFICE BUILDING covered with DIGITAL BILLBOARDS.  

           INT. AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT - SIMULTANEOUS

           A beautiful, vibrant office buzzing with activity. People 
           swipe screens, talk on headsets and draw on enormous SMART 
           BOARDS covering the walls. Maeve walks in, disheveled and 
           HIGH and plops down at her desk. She puts her head down. A 
           BITCHY GIRL dressed in crazy heels and a tight dress taps her 
           shoulder. This is BLANCHE. Maeve groans. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t have any tampons, Blanche, 
                        go ask someone else. 

                                 BLANCHE
                        You missed a meeting this morning. 
                        Robert gave you the shittiest 
                        account. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Great. What else is new? 

           Blanche looks down at Maeve, who’s wearing old overalls and a 
           beanie. 

                                 BLANCHE
                        You know, they say you should dress 
                        for the job you want.  

           Maeve looks Blanche up and down. 

                                 MAEVE
                        So you want to get a job as the  
                        third lead in a porno? 

                                 BLANCHE
                        I’m just saying that Robert 
                        responds to effort. And looks. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah. Well. Thanks for the advice 
                        but I’m doing pretty good all by 
                        myself.

           Blanche holds back a laugh and walks away. Maeve looks around 
           - at all of the people swiping screens and talking into their 
           phones and “plugging in.” It seems really overwhelming - 
           especially in this open space. We see Maeve start to panic - 
           sweating and breathing heavily. Suddenly, she grabs her purse 
           and a bag of chips from the snack area and rushes out.

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           We get the full view of Maeve’s modest but cozy downtown 
           apartment. There are wine glasses everywhere and takeout 
           containers litter the floor. A record player blasts Elton 
           John’s “LEVON”. ANGLE ON Maeve, wearing a large t-shirt and 
           boxer briefs. She holds Beauregard in one hand. The chorus 
           starts and she begins to dance. She swings her arms then 
           transitions into some decent gymnastics.

                                 MAEVE

                        He was born the ba-ba-da-ba-da when 
                        the New York Times--

           Her phone RINGS, startling her and the cat, who jumps out of 
           her arms.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        God Damnit, you bastard! I have to 
                        cut your nails. Remind me tomorrow.

           She answers the phone.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        What?

           OLIVE JENSEN-ELLIS, 30, Maeve’s successful, brilliant and 
           slightly prettier sister sits at an immaculate desk in the 
           middle of an insanely modern office with no carbon footprint. 

                                 OLIVE

                                 MAEVE
                        Sorry, I’m working.

                        now?

           Maeve looks down at a TABLET on her table.

                                 OLIVE
                        Thrilling. Listen, I have a 
                        proposition for you, Maevy.

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m not gonna go out with your 
                        assistant, Olive. He smells like 
                        old barbecue. Like pulled pork 
                        that’s been left in the sun.

           REVEAL: Olive’s assistant is listening in on the call. Olive 
           mouths “I’m sorry” as he smells his shirt.

                                 OLIVE
                        No. It’s something else. Did you 
                        talk to mom? I need to run 
                        something by you.

                                 MAEVE
                        You know I didn’t talk to mom 
                        because she called you and told you 
                        I didn’t talk to her, didn’t she?

                                 OLIVE
                        Yep. That’s exactly what happened. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Ugh I don’t have time for her 
                        lectures right now. I have a lot 
                        going on. 

           Maeve takes a pull from the wine bottle. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Look, we need to talk. Can you come 
                        to the house later? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Why? You lonely without Truman?

                                 OLIVE
                        No. He’s here. 

           REVEAL: TRUMAN, Olive’s husband, is waving from a screen on 
           Olive’s desk.

                        Sure. Whatever you want. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Cool, I’ll call and order it. I’ll 
                        put it on your credit card. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Awesome! Thanks for asking. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Fine, can I put it on your-- oh you 
                        hung up. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN LA STREET - A LITTLE LATER

           Maeve sips a coffee and walks down a crowded street. She 
           looks around, every person is on their phone or “plugged in.” 
           Several people walk into each other but barely react. This is 
           par for the course these days. One man who’s “plugged in” 
           walks straight into Maeve. She shoves him. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Dude, are you serious?

           He keeps walking.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                           (to no one in particular)
                        What is wrong with you people?!

           People walk by Maeve, ignoring her. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a mad house! A mad house!

           She looks around. Nothing.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, people! Planet of the 
                        Apes. Really works in this 
                        situation.

           EXT. OLIVE’S HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER

           An enormous modern home set into a hill. 

           INT. OLIVE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SIMULTANEOUS

           Maeve sits on an oddly-shaped stool at the kitchen counter 
           and shovels pasta into her mouth. 

                                 MAEVE
                           (between bites)
                        I mean some guy actually walked 
                        into me, Olive. And it was like he 
                        didn’t even notice! I swear people 
                        are becoming robots.

           Olive stares at her with disgust. Truman, projected on a 
           screen, sits on the counter next to her.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 OLIVE
                        I’m just a little concerned about 
                        the amount of pasta you’re eating 
                        and the speed that you’re eating it 
                        with.

                                 MAEVE
                        Well excuse me Miss “I’ll just have 
                        a vitamin and some coconut water.”

                                 OLIVE
                        Maeve, I have something serious to 
                        talk to you about. 

                                 MAEVE
                           (continuing to eat)
                        Oh God. Are you sick? Is it cancer? 
                           (to Truman)
                        Does she have cancer?!

                                 TRUMAN O.S.
                        What? Olive do you--
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 OLIVE
                        Jesus, no! I just-- 
                           (to Maeve)
                        Can you stop eating for five 
                        seconds please?

           A beat. Olive looks at Maeve, serious.

                                 OLIVE (CONT’D)
                        What would you say if I told you 
                        that you could have the perfect 
                        man. Right down to the hairless 
                        balls.

                                 MAEVE
                        I’d say, firstly: balls are 
                        disgusting, hairless or not. And 
                        secondly: he doesn’t exist.

                                 OLIVE
                        Correct. He doesn’t exist... yet.

                                 TRUMAN O.S.
                        Except me of course!

           Truman laughs. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Can you put him on mute for a 
                        second, please? I don’t feel like 
                        talking about balls with your 
                        husband.

           Olive blows Truman a kiss and MUTES him. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, seriously. What the fuck are 
                        you talking about?

                                 OLIVE
                        I’m talking about the future, 
                        Maeve. About having the perfect 
                        man... with the touch of a button.

           She smiles and pulls out her phone.

                                 MAEVE
                        I already have that. It’s called a 
                        vibrator. And he has ten settings. 
                        Three of which I’ve never actually 
                        used so our relationship has 
                        potential.

                                 MAEVE
                        You mean a robot? I hate robots, 
                        Liv. Remember our conversation like

                        I know you do. But you’re missing 
                        the point. Imagine never having to 
                        go on an awkward first date again. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t do that now. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Exactly! And you shouldn’t have to.

                        Of course you don’t.

           Olive grabs Maeve’s arms. 

                                 OLIVE
                        I designed this technology. I

                        Olive, you’re scaring me. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Imagine a good looking man coming 
                        up to you at a bar. He’s all the 
                        things you’ve ever dreamed of. 
                        Because you’ve made him that way.

                        out what you want. You’re just 
                        thinking about Hunter because 
                        you’re lonely, admit it.

                                 MAEVE
                        No.

           Olive sighs. Maeve looks at her intently.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Liv, why did you create this 
                        technology in the first place?

                           (blushing)
                        Because... it’s the next frontier. 
                        And because it can help people. 

           Maeve sighs loudly.

                                 MAEVE
                        I’ll think about it. Give me the 
                        night.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

           Maeve gets out of her car and walks to the front door of a 
           luxury building. She presses a few buttons on a DIGITAL 
           SCREEN and CHUGS A BEER.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Maeve knocks on the door of 10D. HUNTER, 28, handsome and 
           very aware of it, answers. He looks tired.

                                 MAEVE
                        Are you going to let me in?

           He motions for her to come inside.

                        You and me.

           Hunter rubs his forehead in frustration.

                        I don’t understand you, Maeve. I 
                        moved out. I signed a lease. I 
                        bought a couch.

                        Kidding. Look, I know we both said 
                        a lot of things--

                                 HUNTER
                        Yeah I recall you saying I was a 
                        “selfish piece of shit?” 

                                 MAEVE
                        Don’t do that. Don’t be a dick.

                                 HUNTER
                        You obviously weren’t happy with 
                        me.

                                 HUNTER (CONT'D)
                        And I wasn’t that happy in the end 
                        either. You coming back here... 
                        groveling... it’s kind of sad. 

           He looks at her with genuine pity.

                                 MAEVE
                        Wow. Thanks. 

                                 HUNTER
                        You look like shit, Maeve. Are you 
                        drinking again? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Look, I didn’t come here to be 
                        judged. I came here to forgive you 
                        and give you another chance but if 
                        you don’t want one then fine! Fuck 
                        you. 

           Hunter looks down. Maeve, angry, looks out his window.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Shit view, huh?

                                 HUNTER
                        I don’t care about the view. I got 
                        a good price and it’s close to 
                        work.

                                 MAEVE
                           (bitter)
                        That’s good. Your work is super 
                        important to you.

                                 HUNTER
                        I have a steady job, Maeve. And I 
                        get paid a lot to do it. Sorry if I 
                        can’t blow it off like you do.

                                 MAEVE
                        Well I just got put on a super 
                        prestigious account, so.

           Hunter sits down on the couch.

                                 HUNTER
                        That’s good. You need to put in 
                        more effort there. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Why is everyone on my case about 
                        that? 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HUNTER
                        Because it’s obvious you don’t care 
                        about it. Sometimes it’s like you 
                        don’t care about anything. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well that’s because-- 

           She stops herself. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to live my life 
                        through a screen.

                                 HUNTER
                        It’s better than not living your 
                        life at all. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well I’m so sorry you don’t approve 
                        of the way I live my life. But you 
                        could have talked to me about it. 
                        You know in the olden days, that’s 
                        what couples did. They talked.

                                 HUNTER
                        Well we’re not in the olden days. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh, believe me. I know. 

           Hunter looks at her, skeptical.

                                 HUNTER
                        Do you?

           Tears gather in Maeve’s eyes. She heads to the door. 

                                 MAEVE
                        So it’s goodbye then. I just wish I 
                        knew how to quit you.

           She exits and slams the door behind her. Hunter stares at the 
           door for a beat. 

                                 HUNTER
                           (sincere)
                        She always was good with words.

           Maeve drinks directly from a bottle of wine. She speaks into 
           her phone.

                                 MAEVE
                        I’ll do it.

           Olive sits up in bed, a screen projecting Maeve’s face from a 
           tablet on her lap. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Well that was fast.

                                 MAEVE
                        But I don’t want him to just arrive 
                        ya know? I want to meet him in a 
                        public place and have him like... 
                        woo me. 90s romcom style.

                                 OLIVE
                        Totally fine. I can arrange that. 
                        By 90s romcom do you mean...

                        Isn’t that about a prostitute?

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh my GOD. I just want it to be 
                        romantic. And sex stuff is off the

                                 MAEVE
                        Does he have a plug?

                                 OLIVE
                        Excuse me?

                                 MAEVE
                        A plug! Do I have to plug him in or 
                        is he battery operated?

                        “charge” him.

                                 MAEVE
                        Alright, well I’ll get some WD-40 
                        just in case he needs to be oiled

                        You’ll get your payment next week.

                                 MAEVE
                        My payment?

                                 OLIVE

                                 MAEVE
                        Um why did you not mention this 
                        earlier? I would have said yes for 
                        sure. Not much of a saleswoman,

                        I didn’t want you to do it for the 
                        money.

                        Yeah.

                                 MAEVE
                        Please don’t tell anyone. It’s 
                        super embarrassing. 

                                 OLIVE
                        It’s not embarrassing! But I won’t

                           (to Olive)
                        So what’s his name?

                                 OLIVE
                        Stop calling him a robot. What do 
                        you want his name to be? You’re 
                        building him remember, you get to 
                        choose.

                                 MAEVE
                        Um. How about... Harry?

                                 TRUMAN O.S.
                        Ahh yes I forgot about your “Harry

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah, you need to get over that.

                                 MAEVE
                        Hey, you’re the one who said he’s 
                        supposed to be my “dream man.”

                                 MAEVE
                        So I can just... pick and choose 
                        things I want? Like toppings at 
                        froyo?

                        Sure, if that analogy helps you.

                                 MAEVE
                        I need to think about this. I mean

           Maeve finishes her bottle of wine and settles into an 
           armchair. She opens the APP on her phone.

                        “Not found?” What kind of bullshit 
                        is this?

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - OLIVE’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Olive is looking at the APP on her tablet. She looks at 
           Maeve’s specifications for Harry.

                                 OLIVE
                        She wants him to know karate? Why-- 
                           (realizing)
                        Her Jackie Chan thing. God, she has 
                        weird taste. 

           Just then, a man wearing a trench coat, odd Steampunk glasses 
           and holding a pipe in his mouth enters. He looks like an over-
           the-top Benedict Cumberbath as Sherlock Holmes. (Will be even 
           better if it’s actually Benedict Cumberbatch.) This is 
           BENJAMIN, the eccentric founder of TECH-NO-SPHERE. He’s 
           plugged in and is followed by a ROBOT ASSISTANT, Rosemary. He 
           looks at Olive pointedly.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Heard melodies are sweet, but those 
                        unheard are sweeter. 

           Olive looks back at him, confused and nervous.

                        Of course! Lovely. Is it a metaphor 
                        for something or-- 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Do you know how much money we spent 
                        last year on pens?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Zero dollars. We are officially a 
                        pen-less company.

                                 OLIVE
                        That’s amazing! Go Tech-no-sphere! 

                                 BENJAMIN
                           (wistful)
                        I do like pens though. 

           Rosemary makes a small noise - almost like a cough. Benjamin 
           snaps out of it.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Right. Why I’m here. As you know, 
                        Tech-No-Sphere is the number one 
                        company in the world that 
                        specializes in digital match-
                        making. Over 500 million people 
                        worldwide use our services. And we 
                        don’t have to do anything! We just 
                        provide them with the app and they 
                        find each other. Faceswipe alone 
                        has 100 million daily users.

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah, it’s pretty incredible. My 
                        husband and I actually met on--

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s a foolproof money-making 
                        venture. If you want only 
                        attractive people popping up, you 
                        pay extra. No fat chicks? Pay 
                        extra.

           Olive cringes. Benjamin’s social skills are... terrible.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s something I’m very proud of. 
                        But then I got to thinking - what 
                        if we took it one step further?

           Olive looks uncertainly to Rosemary, who’s shaking her screen-
           head. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        What if we could actually create 
                        love rather than just provide the 
                        medium to possibly, maybe, 
                        hopefully find it? Put the power in 
                        the people’s hands? Give them the 
                        tools to make their perfect match?

                                 OLIVE
                        Sir, I--

                                 BENJAMIN
                        A robot. A human-like robot that 
                        can breathe and think and talk and 
                        love. What would you say if I told 
                        you that was possible? 

           Rosemary gives a small cough again. She whispers something 
           into Benjamin’s ear. He looks at Olive and goes RED. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Er-- forgive me. It seems I thought 
                        you were someone else. There are so 
                        many employees that I often forget 
                        who is who. 

                                 OLIVE

                        understand!

                                 BENJAMIN
                        So how is that project coming along 
                        then? Hopefully well, since the 
                        speech I just gave you is the one  
                        I’m giving to investors. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Really well! We’ve got some 
                        prototypes and there’s a test 
                        subject who’s working with a model 
                        right now. She’s impossible to 
                        please - we should get some great 
                        data from her.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Love is a smoke made with the fumes 
                        of sighs. 

           Olive looks blankly at him. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        William Shakespeare. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Right!

           Benjamin bites on his pipe a couple times. Rosemary makes a 
           noise. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 BENJAMIN
                        And I’m off! I am meeting with a 
                        pop star about funding her charity 
                        for disabled cats.

           He and Rosmeary EXIT. 

                                 TRUMAN O.S.
                        I think he’s into you.

           Olive looks down at her tablet screen, where Truman’s face 
           looks back at her. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Nah, he watches porn on those weird 
                        VR glasses and thinks people can’t 
                        notice. From what I can gather he’s 
                        into large women of color. 

                                 TRUMAN O.S.
                        That’s what I’m saying. I think 
                        he’s into you!

           Olive MUTES Truman and looks at the APP again.

                                 OLIVE
                        Come on, Maevy. Gimme something 
                        good. 

           INT. COLE’S BAR - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           Maeve, dressed in an expensive outfit and too much makeup, 
           sips a martini at the bar. She motions to the ROBOT BARTENDER 
           - a computer screen that controls a series of bottles.

                                 MAEVE
                        Can I get another, garcon? 

                                 ROBOT BARTENDER
                        Your speech is slurred. I can’t 
                        serve you.

                                 MAEVE
                        I was speaking French, esse. Now 
                        I’m speaking Spanish. Get it?

           The Robot Bartender turns off. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Racist. 

           Just then, a BEAUTIFUL MAN walks into the bar. He’s like a 
           young Brad Pitt mixed with current day Channing Tatum. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           There is a whoosh of air and some romantic music begins to 
           play over the speakers. Everyone puts down their phones and 
           takes off their VR glasses and takes notice. The man takes a 
           seat at the bar next to Maeve.

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN
                        Can I buy you a drink?

                                 MAEVE
                        No, that’s okay. I don’t like to 
                        owe people things. Especially men.

           He chuckles.

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN
                        This one’s a freebie. No strings 
                        attached. Deal?

                                 MAEVE
                        Okay... 

           He motions to the Bartender, who immediately starts making a 
           drink.

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN
                        What’s your name?

                                 MAEVE
                        It’s Maeve. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN
                        Maeve. Are you Irish? 

                                 MAEVE
                        No idea. I like whiskey, does that 
                        count?

           Maeve’s drink arrives. The Bartender makes a “tsk tsk” noise. 
           Maeve scoffs. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        That guy is a dick. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN
                        Don’t worry about him. Tell me 
                        about you.

           Maeve looks at the door, nervously. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN (CONT’D)
                        Am I boring you?
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh no, I’m just waiting for 
                        somebody. Sorry.

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN
                        That’s too bad. I like you, Maeve. 

           Maeve BLUSHES. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Really? Why?

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN
                        Because I was programmed that way. 

           He stares at her. She realizes. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh my God.

                                 BEAUTIFUL MAN 
                           (laughing)
                        I’m Harry. I was told you wanted an 
                        anonymous meeting.

                                 MAEVE
                        Fuck me. This is so embarrassing.

                                 HARRY
                        Relax. I was just trying to lighten 
                        the mood. I’m funny, remember?

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah. Hilarious.

           Maeve downs her drink. She hiccups.

                                 HARRY
                        Let’s get you some food.

           INT. DINER - LATER

           The waitresses are all ROBOTS wearing 90s-themed flannel and 
           hats. A JUKEBOX plays grunge music. Pictures of New Kids on 
           the Block and My Little Pony cover the walls. Drunk people 
           yell and watch videos on their devices. Maeve and Harry sit 
           at a booth with an enormous amount of food spread out in 
           front of them.

                                 MAEVE
                        Are you sure you don’t want any? I 
                        feel bad. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HARRY
                        Do you want me to eat? 

           Maeve looks at him. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Do I really have to answer that?

                                 HARRY
                           (plainly)
                        The more direct you are the quicker 
                        I can learn. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yes. Please eat something so I 
                        don’t look like a fat ass who just 
                        ordered twelve things for herself.

           Harry takes a bite of a burger. He moans. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, it’s not that good. 

                                 HARRY
                        Oh no I can’t taste. I just want it 
                        to look like I’m really enjoying 
                        it. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well it looks like you’re about to 
                        jizz your pants. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m just trying to replicate the 
                        human experience--

                                 MAEVE
                        Dude. Enough with the Mr. Spock 
                        talk. Just speak like a normal 
                        person.

           Just then, a ROBOT WAITRESS approaches. Her screen has a 
           picture of Bill Clinton on it. 

                                 ROBOT WAITRESS
                        Cowabunga, dudes. Can I get you 
                        anything else? As if!

           Maeve rolls her eyes at the waitress. 

                                 MAEVE
                        No, we’re all good here. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 ROBOT WAITRESS
                        Coolio! Outie 5000.

           The Waitress rolls away. 

                                 HARRY
                        So what kind of music do you like? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Old music. 

           Harry frowns. 

                                 HARRY
                        “Old” meaning... suited for old 
                        people?

                                 MAEVE
                        No “old” meaning “classic.” And 
                        good. Barbra Streisand, Elton John, 
                        Queen... 

                                 HARRY
                        Women your age don’t normally 
                        listen to that. Have you heard the 
                        electronitrance band “Slash Fuck?” 
                        It’s very popular in your cohort. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Can you stop talking like Indiana 
                        Jones’ father? 

                                 HARRY
                        Again, a reference people your age 
                        don’t typically make. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Look. I like old stuff. I like 
                        simple. I’m not into drug-induced 
                        sleepscapes or whatever the fuck 
                        people are doing these days. And I 
                        really hate robots.

                                 HARRY
                        Ah. I see. Do you not find that 
                        technology has many merits? 

                                 MAEVE
                        No. I don’t. This is an experiment 
                        okay? To help out my sister.

                                 HARRY
                        So our relationship will be purely 
                        educational?
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Correct. 

           Harry sits back and sips his milk shake. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re not at all curious?

                                 MAEVE
                        Of what?

                                 HARRY
                        Of whether or not it might work? 

           Maeve laughs. 

                                 MAEVE
                        By “work” do you mean I fall in 
                        love with you and we live happily 
                        ever after?

                                 HARRY
                        More or less. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You’re not real. I can’t fall in 
                        love with someone who doesn’t 
                        exist. 

                                 HARRY
                        But I do exist! I’m sitting here 
                        and talking to you and eating and 
                        laughing. However you define “real” 
                        is up to you. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You’re weird. 

                                 HARRY
                        No I’m not. Not one of my 
                        personality traits. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well maybe you’re evolving. 

                                 HARRY
                        I doubt it. I have limits, just 
                        like you. Personalities are very 
                        finite things. You are hard wired a 
                        certain way just as I am. 

           Maeve takes a large bite of her burger. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        So what are my personality traits 
                        then?

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know yet. You have to give 
                        me the chance to find out. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Come on, give me something.

                                 HARRY
                        Well, so far I’d describe you as 
                        “contrarian.”

                                 MAEVE
                        What?! No I’m not!

           Harry smiles at her. Gotcha. She smiles back. He’s kind of 
           hot and she’s kind of drunk.

           INT. KARAOKE BAR - LATER

           Maeve takes a shot at the bar. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t normally sing in public but 
                        I might make an exception since I’m 
                        really drun--

           Maeve turns to look for Harry but he’s not there. She spins 
           around. Suddenly, “OH SHERRIE” By Steve Perry comes over the 
           speakers. Harry’s on stage. A DIGITAL SCREEN behind him 
           lights up - it looks like he’s in front of an ENORMOUS, 
           CHEERING CROWD. 

                                 HARRY
                           (singing)
                        You should’ve been gone! Knowing 
                        how I made you feel and I should’ve 
                        been gone--

                                 MAEVE
                        OH MY GOD! 

           Maeve is stunned. This boy can sing. She turns to the man 
           next to her.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s one of my favorites! How did 
                        he know?!
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAN
                        I’ve never heard it.

                                 MAEVE
                        Well you’re an idiot.

           Harry winks at Maeve, who smiles widely back at him. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A very drunk Maeve is carried into her apartment by Harry. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m not drunk I just can’t see.

                                 HARRY
                        That’s alright, I’ve got you.

                                 MAEVE
                        You’re really strong. I weigh like 
                        150 this week. My weight fluctuates 
                        5-10 pounds depending on whether my 
                        anxiety or depression is winning.

           Harry sets Maeve down on the couch.

                                 HARRY
                        So this is your apartment. It’s 
                        lovely. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You don’t have to lie.

                                 HARRY
                        Okay. It’s not that nice.

           Maeve curls up on the couch. Beauregard climbs on top of her.

                                 MAEVE
                        I know this is really weird but do 
                        you... can you rub my head? 

                                 HARRY
                        Do you have a headache? You should 
                        drink some water. Or take a hydro-
                        pill... do you have any?

                                 MAEVE
                        No I just... it would feel nice. 

           Harry sits down next to Maeve and begins to rub her head. 
           Tears spring to her eyes. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

                                 HARRY
                        For what? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Nevermind. You smell good. Not how 
                        I thought you’d smell.

                                 HARRY
                        How did you think I would smell?

                                 MAEVE
                        Like my coin collection. 

                                 HARRY
                        Well, thank you? I think?

           Harry rubs Maeve’s head as she drifts off to sleep.

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           We ANGLE ON Maeve, lifeless on the couch. Her hair is a mess 
           and mascara is smeared across her cheeks. Suddenly, she 
           awakes and bolts upright. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What time is it?!

           She scrambles around, looking for her pants. Harry enters 
           from the kitchen. 

                                 HARRY
                        You kicked your pants off around 
                        4am. I folded them for you. 

           Maeve grabs her pants from the side table.

                                 MAEVE
                        You were here all night? 

                                 HARRY
                        I was worried you might choke on 
                        your own vomit. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Where did you sleep? 

                                 HARRY
                        I did a few crossword puzzles while 
                        you slept. Very enjoyable. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           He points to a STACK of crossword puzzle books. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You did all of those? 

                                 HARRY
                        You were out for a while.

           Maeve pulls on her pants and sits up. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You don’t sleep? 

                                 HARRY
                        Nope. No need. 

                                 MAEVE
                        So you’re like a vampire.  

                                 HARRY
                        In most popular culture depictions, 
                        vampires sleep during the day in 
                        caskets. Sometimes upside down-- 

           Maeve rubs her eyes, impatient.

                                 MAEVE
                        Whatever, I have to get to work. I 
                        have a meeting. I think.

                                 HARRY
                        Should I wait here?

           Maeve stares at Harry blankly. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 HARRY
                        Or I could walk around until you 
                        get back. You need cat litter. 

           Maeve shakes her head. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You don’t... stay with me. This 
                        isn’t a live-in situation. I just 
                        met you. 

                                 HARRY
                        That’s part of the deal. Did Olive 
                        not tell you that? 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        No she did not.

           Harry stares at her, pathetic. She gives.  

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        But come to think of it I could use 
                        some cat litter. 

           Harry brightens.

                                 HARRY
                        Great! Would you like some 
                        breakfast?

           Maeve rubs her eyes, wearily. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t eat breakfast, dude. Plus 
                        there’s no food in the house. Look, 
                        I’ll text you after the meeting--

           Maeve opens her eyes to see a plate of eggs, bacon and toast 
           in front of her. 

                                 HARRY
                        Sure you’re not hungry? 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

           Maeve, now dressed, digs into her homemade breakfast in her 
           now clean kitchen. She surveys her table. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Did you... dust this?

                                 HARRY
                        Yep! 

                                 MAEVE
                        And my sink? You unclogged it?

                                 HARRY
                        It was easy. 

           Maeve chews on a piece of toast and thinks. 

                                 MAEVE
                        So you like cleaning?

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah, that’s one of my 
                        specifications, remember?

                        “Organizational skills?” It’s 
                        actually a good form of cardio, you 
                        can gain muscle mass, burn calories-

                                 MAEVE
                        Totally. So you wouldn’t mind... 
                        cleaning the rest of this place?

                                 HARRY
                        It would be my honor. 

           Maeve smiles.

                                 MAEVE
                        Wow. Awesome! So I’ll go to my 
                        meeting, you clean the house and 
                        we’ll post game later. Sound good?

           Maeve gets up from the table. Harry stops her and looks at 
           her outfit - old overalls and a flannel shirt. 

                                 HARRY
                        Can I make one suggestion?

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

           Maeve, now dressed in a TRENDY OUTFIT and with her hair done, 
           stands in front of an impressed Harry.

                                 HARRY
                        You clean up good!

           Maeve looks in a floor-length mirror that’s partially blocked 
           by boxes. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Damn. I kinda do. How did you know 
                        how to do an inside out French 
                        braid?

                                 HARRY
                        Just something extra Olive put in 
                        there for me. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’ve gotta get you to teach me that 
                        sometimes.

                                 HARRY
                        Hey Maeve? Good luck at your 
                        meeting. You’re gonna kill it. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                           (awkwardly)
                        Um... thank you.

           She walks out the door. Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        Alright, Beauregard I’m gonna teach 
                        you how to poop in the toilet.

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Olive stands in front of a group of employees, all taking 
           furious notes on their various devices. Olive points to 
           Maeve’s stats, which are projected on the wall. 

                                 OLIVE
                        As you can see, she picked traits 
                        that many women her age would 
                        choose in a man. Smart, organized, 
                        considerate. But Maeve isn’t like 
                        most women her age. These are the 
                        specifications that she’s picked 
                        after years of watching John Hughes 
                        films and listening to sad music. 

                                 MAN 1
                        What is John Hu--

                                 OLIVE
                        My point is, she doesn’t know what 
                        she wants yet. But it’s all part of 
                        the process. She has to get there 
                        on her own. 

                                 MAN 2
                        Wouldn’t it be better just to 
                        program “Harry” for her? 

           Several women in the room ROLL THEIR EYES.

                                 OLIVE
                        That would make this exercise 
                        useless. The whole point is to let 
                        people decide what they want and be 
                        in control! That’s what makes this 
                        technology so revolutionary. 

           Just then, BENJAMIN WALKS IN, dressed in a plaid suit and 
           bowler hat. Rosemary follows behind. Everyone immediately 
           perks up.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Hell hath no limits, nor is 
                        circumscribed in one self place, 
                        for where we are is hell, and where 
                        hell is there must we ever be. 

           Everyone holds their breath. Olive looks terrified. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Marlowe. 

                                 MAN 1
                        I love Marlowe. She’s amaz--

                                 BENJAMIN
                        This data looks good. Good work, 
                        everyone. 

           Benjamin leaves with Rosemary. Olive looks slightly relieved.

                                 OLIVE
                        Okay so the hell quote wasn’t in 
                        reference to us. I think. Back to 
                        the board...

           INT. AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT - LATER

           We ANGLE ON Maeve, who sits at a large CONFERENCE TABLE 
           inside of a glassed-in office. 

           INT. AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eight people sit around a large table. Maeve barely keeps her 
           eyes open while a NERDY GUY gives a presentation. 

                                 NERDY GUY
                        Flundies - the “flush-away” 
                        underwear for the modern man. Skid 
                        marks, be gone! 

           There’s some unenthusiastic clapping. A portly man dressed in 
           a loud outfit shakes his head. This is ROBERT, Maeve’s boss.

                                 ROBERT
                        Skid marks? Are you for real? We 
                        can’t run that during children’s 
                        programming. 

                                 NERDY GUY
                           (nervous)
                        I thought it would go over their 
                        heads. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 ROBERT
                        Not when they have the internet at 
                        their fucking fingertips. Think of 
                        something better by lunch. 

           The Nerdy Guy runs out of the room. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Maeve, you’re up. 

           Maeve stands up. She taps her phone and an IMAGE appears on 
           the wall behind her. It’s a SMILING DOG. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Bell’s dog food. A better way to 
                        feed your favorite pet. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Wait. Are you wearing makeup?

           Maeve looks at Robert, unsure of what to say. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Um. A little, yes. 

                                 ROBERT
                        I like it! You’re all sparkly! Go 
                        on. 

           She taps her phone again and another IMAGE appears. The dog 
           lays next to a sad-looking carrot.

                                 MAEVE
                        Are you sick of the bougey rabbit 
                        food the hipsters tell you to buy? 
                        It’s “organic,” it’s “healthy!” 
                        These are dogs we’re talking about. 
                        And dogs need the good stuff. You 
                        start feeding your dog fancy food, 
                        they’ll become a sissy. And you 
                        don’t want a sissy protecting you 
                        from a burglar.

           Another IMAGE appears: a dog nose-deep in a bowl. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Bell’s non-organic dog food. 
                        Nothing fancy. 

           An IMAGE appears: a RUGGED-LOOKING man pets a GOLDEN 
           RETRIEVER.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        This ad would appear on bathroom 
                        doors at airports, public buildings 
                        and certain chain restaurants.

           Lots of clapping. Maeve takes a bow.

                                 ROBERT
                        Great stuff, Maeve. Way to make the 
                        customer feel elitist by telling 
                        them not to be elitist. I love it.

                                 MAEVE
                        Thanks. It was fun to write, I 
                        guess. If not a little depressing.

                                 ROBERT
                        Alright assignments for this week: 
                        Andrea you take the lingerie ad--

           A drop-dead gorgeous woman, ANDREA, smiles. 

                                 ANDREA
                        Do you want me to add some concept 
                        art, Robbie? I actually own some of 
                        the pieces I’m advertising.

                                 ROBERT
                           (smiling)
                        I think that shows a lot of 
                        initiative, Andrea, thank you.

           Maeve GAGS. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Maeve. There’s a new account I want 
                        you to tackle. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Really? Is it lingerie? 

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s manure. 

           There’s a long beat. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Manure. As in... poop?

                                 ROBERT
                        Yep! But it’s synthetic so it’s not 
                        actually poop. I had them send some 
                        samples to your house. Needed my 
                        number one girl on this one.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Awesome. Really excited to dive in.

                                 ROBERT
                        Good meeting, everyone! Keep up the 
                        good work. See you next week. 

           People gather their things and start to exit. Robert pulls 
           Maeve aside. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Everything alright with you 
                        sweetie?

                                 MAEVE
                        Robert, I’ve told you so many 
                        times: you can’t call me “sweetie.” 
                        If our HR department was actually 
                        made up of humans, I’d complain...

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m sorry, angel, I just care about 
                        you. You seem... off lately. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Hunter and I broke up. A while ago. 

           Robert pulls Maeve into a BEAR HUG. He looks at her intently.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m so sorry. Is there anything I 
                        can do?

           Maeve wrestles herself free from the hug. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Actually, I was wondering if I 
                        could leave early? I’m feeling... 
                        sad. 

           Robert starts swiping on his phone, feverishly, like a coke 
           fiend.

                                 ROBERT
                        Of course. Go home and have a hot 
                        cup of tea. Maybe call a friend. 
                        Have a little booty call. Could 
                        really help relieve some tension.

           He walks away. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Thanks, Robert! Great advice, as 
                        always.

           INT. AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Maeve walks into the main office. She notices a group seated 
           around a table, including BLANCHE. They’re laughing and 
           watching a video on a GIANT SCREEN. She gets closer and sees 
           the video: it’s a monkey eating a banana. Maeve frowns. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t get it. 

           The people around the table turn to look at her. 

                                 BLANCHE
                        It’s a monkey. See? 

           She points at the screen. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I get it. But why is it funny? 

                                 GUY
                        Because monkeys are funny.

                                 BLANCHE
                        You look different, Maeve. Looks 
                        like someone took my advice about 
                        their appearance!

                                 MAEVE
                           (fake friendly)
                        Blanche, the day I take your advice 
                        is the day that Donald Trump climbs 
                        out of the grave and becomes 
                        President again.

                                 BLANCHE
                        How’s your boyfriend by the way? He 
                        hasn’t posted any pictures of the 
                        two of you recently.

           She gives Maeve an accusatory look. The other people at the 
           table hide laughter, swiping on their phones.

                                 MAEVE
                        I broke up with him. Dead weight.

                                 BLANCHE
                           (smiling)
                        Aww no I’m so sorry. He was so 
                        great. Too great almost. It was 
                        crazy that you guys even dated at 
                        all.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Well I’m actually seeing someone 
                        else now.

           Blanche is swiping on her phone now too.

                                 BLANCHE
                        Oh really? Who?

                                 MAEVE
                        His name’s... Harry. We met online. 

                                 GAY GUY
                        Well duh, where else would you 
                        meet? 

           The others LAUGH. Maeve looks exhausted.

                                 BLANCHE
                        Well you should bring him to the 
                        company picnic next month. Give us 
                        a chance to make sure he’s good 
                        enough for you.

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh for sure! Will you be bringing 
                        that guy? Oh man what’s his name? 
                        The one who went to jail for 
                        fucking a 15 year old. 

           Everyone stops swiping. Blanche clenches her jaw.

                                 BLANCHE
                        She was 17. And he was acquitted. 

           Maeve stares at Blanche for a long beat. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well it looks like you have a lot 
                        of important work going on so I’ll 
                        be on my way. 

           Everyone goes back to swiping, some “plug in.” 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                           (to Blanche)
                        Oh and just because he was 
                        acquitted doesn’t mean he’s not a 
                        rapist. Bye, guys!

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maeve opens the door to her apartment to find it COMPLETELY 
           TRANSFORMED. There are candles burning, light jazz is playing 
           and every surface looks like new. She stares, open-mouthed. 
           Harry enters from the kitchen. 

                                 HARRY
                        Hey, Maevy how was your day? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Um... It was fine. What happened 
                        here?  

                                 HARRY
                        Just some feng shui-ing. Are you 
                        hungry?

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah, actually. 

           Harry retreats into the kitchen. Maeve puts her bag down and 
           looks around the room. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        You did all this?

                                 HARRY O.S.
                        Yeah! I replaced the blinds in your 
                        room with new ones - they were 
                        really dusty. And covered in an 
                        indistinguishable substance. 

                                 MAEVE
                        That might have been a protein 
                        shake from the last time I worked 
                        out. 

                                 HARRY O.S.
                        Which was...

                                 MAEVE
                        Sometime last winter?

           Just then, Beauregard enters from the kitchen. He’s clean 
           shaven and looks miserable. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit I can actually see his 
                        body now. 
                           (looking at the cat)
                        It’s really gross.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Harry leads her to the now beautifully-dressed DINING ROOM 
           TABLE. She sits and take sips from a glass of wine. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus this wine is good.  

                                 HARRY O.S.
                        I got it from the French market 
                        down the street. The owner was 
                        really nice - gave me a good deal. 

                                 MAEVE
                        There’s a French market? Where?

           Harry enters holding TWO PLATES of LOBSTER. He puts one in 
           front of Maeve.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Wow. This is just like that scene 
                        in Mrs. Doubtfire. 

           Harry smiles and takes a seat. 

                                 HARRY
                        Not sure what that is but thank 
                        you. So how was your meeting? 

                                 MAEVE
                        It was fine. My boss is getting 
                        closer to a lawsuit every day but I 
                        got some good feedback on my ad. 
                        The one that I wrote while I was 
                        stoned for a full 48 hours. So 
                        that’s cool. 

                                 HARRY
                        Some samples arrived for you in the 
                        mail. Kind of smell like shit. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah that’s my next project. 

                                 HARRY
                        You look pretty. 

           Maeve nearly chokes on her lobster. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Ha. No I don’t. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why do you do that?
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Do what?

                                 HARRY
                        Reject compliments. Just say “thank 
                        you.” 

                                 MAEVE
                        It’s hard to really believe you. 
                        You know... since you’re programmed 
                        to find me attractive. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’ll bet a lot of people find you 
                        attractive. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah my boss, the homeless guy on 
                        8th ave who asks for pictures of my 
                        feet, and you. 

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t sell yourself short. Men like 
                        confidence. If you think you’re 
                        hot, we will too. 

           Maeve thinks for a minute.

                                 MAEVE
                        I’ll keep that in mind. Hey, would 
                        you want to come with me to this 
                        company picnic thing?

                                 HARRY
                        Of course. I’m your boyfriend, 
                        aren’t I?

                                 MAEVE
                        Are you? 

                                 HARRY
                        If you want me to be, yes. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Could you just... not say anything 
                        about being a robot? Just pretend 
                        we met on Faceswipe or something. 

                                 HARRY
                        Sure thing. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        And maybe don’t be so... perfect. 
                        No one will buy that we’re dating 
                        if you’re too polite. 

                                 HARRY
                        Okay I’ll punch everyone in the 
                        face when I meet them. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Awesome. 

           Harry winks at Maeve. They CHEERS. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Maeve climbs into bed. Harry stands by the door. 

                                 HARRY
                        Do you want me to come in there 
                        with you?

                                 MAEVE
                        I thought you couldn’t sleep. 

                                 HARRY
                        I could spoon you. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Sure. Who doesn’t like to spoon?

           Harry climbs into bed next to Maeve. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re warm. I thought you’d be 
                        cold like Casper. 

                                 HARRY
                        Is that your ex boyfriend? 

           He pulls Maeve in tight and starts to kiss her neck. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What are you doing?

                                 HARRY
                        Just relax. I can make you feel 
                        good. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t know. This feels weird. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Harry continues to kiss her neck. Finally she gives in and 
           starts making out with him. He moves down her chest until 
           he’s between her legs. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Wa-wait. How is this going to work? 
                        Can you even -- ohhhh my God. 

           Maeve smiles. She’s in heaven.

                        now we have a test subject who is 
                        responding really well to the 
                        technology.

                        Unreasonable haste is the direct 
                        road to error. Moliere. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Wow. That one is actually super 
                        relevant here. But yes she’s taking 
                        her time. The whole point is to try 
                        out a bunch of options and figure 
                        out what you want.

                                 INVESTOR 1
                        What’s wrong with the Faceswipe? Is 
                        it no longer working?

                                 OLIVE
                        No, it is. We just wanted to go 
                        further, to tap an untapped market. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Many people using Faceswipe and 
                        some of our other apps complained 
                        that they couldn’t find anyone to 
                        fit their needs. That the fish in 
                        the sea were not exactly worth 
                        catching, per se. 

                                 OLIVE
                        So we decided that if people could 
                        choose for themselves that they 
                        would be much happier than simply 
                        waiting to find someone.

                        It’s very alluring. If it works.

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - MINUTES LATER

           Olive walks into her office, past her assistant who looks 
           desperate to get her attention.

           She stops. Truman is in her office. She leaps into his arms.

                        What are you doing here? 

                                 TRUMAN
                        I had some extra time, thought I’d 
                        surprise my best girl. 

           Olive and Truman KISS. Olive’s assistant gags.

           INT. RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT

           A dimly-lit restaurant filled with gorgeous people. Maeve 
           sits at a table with her friends RAYMOND (extremely gay) and 
           MOIRA (extremely judgmental and wealthy.) They look at a 
           virtual menu, they’re several drinks deep.

                                 MAEVE
                        Three times. I came three times. 

                                 MOIRA
                        I don’t get it how is that 
                        possible? Does he even have a 
                        tongue?

                                 MAEVE
                        It was insane. He really is a boy 
                        wizard. And I didn’t feel guilty! 
                        Afterward he just kissed my 
                        forehead and sang me a lullaby. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        I wonder what it would be like if I 
                        could have a guy blow me and I 
                        didn’t have to pretend to be into 
                        doing things to him afterward.

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m telling you, it was magical. 
                        Hunter would have rather died than 
                        gone a night without coming in or 
                        around me. 

           Moira shivers.

                                 MOIRA
                        TMI. I don’t want to think about 
                        Hunter coming. He’s so spindly.

                                 MAEVE
                        Just be cool to Harry. I told him 
                        you guys were nice. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 RAYMOND
                        Why would you lie to him?

           Just then, Harry walks toward the table, all smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        Moira and Raymond! It’s such a 
                        pleasure to meet you, I’ve heard so 
                        much about you both. 

                                 MOIRA
                           (licking her lips)
                        Likewise, sweetie. 

           Harry sits down next to Maeve and kisses her on the cheek. 

                                 HARRY
                        Hi, honey. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Hello... honey? 

           Raymond ROLLS HIS EYES. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        What are you going to order, Harry? 
                        Do you like Italian food? 

                                 HARRY
                        Love it. It’s my favorite cuisine. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        Interesting. I thought pussy was 
                        your favorite--

           Maeve KICKS Raymond under the table. 

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Jokes, jokes. 

                                 HARRY
                        Raymond, you seem like someone who 
                        has never even thought about trying 
                        pussy. 

           Moira SPITS out her drink, laughing. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        You caught me. What gave me away? 
                        The eyebrows or the outfit? 

                                 HARRY
                        I’d say the fact that you got a 
                        hard on when I walked in here. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Raymond LAUGHS. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        I like him, Maeve. He’s saucy. 

           Maeve stares at him, taken aback. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Where is this coming from?

                                 HARRY
                        So what do you do Raymond? Besides 
                        suck cock?

                                 MAEVE
                        Jesus, Harry. Take it easy.

                                 MOIRA
                        No, no please don’t. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        I work in retail. 

                                 HARRY
                        Well that’s a surprise. And you, 
                        Moira? 

                                 MOIRA
                        I don’t work. 

                                 HARRY
                        Even bigger surprise. 

           Moira and Raymond LAUGH. Maeve frowns. 

                                 MAEVE
                        He’s kidding, you guys. Harry, 
                        Raymond and Moira are my oldest 
                        friends... we went to theater camp 
                        together as kids. I was the total 
                        class clown back then. 

                                 RAYMOND
                           (to Harry)
                        Or so she likes to think. 

                                 MOIRA
                           (laughing, to Harry)
                        Poor Maevy. We laughed at her jokes 
                        when no one else would. 

           Maeve looks offended. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        What are you guys talking about? I 
                        was hilarious! Everyone always 
                        requested my Celine Dion 
                        impression!

                                 RAYMOND
                        No one knew who that was. We just 
                        liked to watch you try to sing.

           Maeve frowns.

                                 MOIRA 
                        So Harry, have you seen Maeve’s 
                        apartment yet?

                                 HARRY
                        You mean the hovel?

                                 RAYMOND
                           (cackling)
                        Isn’t it disgusting? She lives like 
                        a gypsy, seriously. 

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah it’s a good thing I got my 
                        tetanus shot before I entered. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        That’s what he said!

           Moira, Harry and Raymond CRACK UP. Maeve scowls. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Why is everyone ganging up on me? 

                                 MOIRA
                        Relax, sensitive Sally. 

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah, lighten up!

           Maeve gives Harry a look that says “Shut up. Now.” 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Should we get some shots? 

                                 RAYMOND
                        Fuck yes!

           Harry goes to the bar. Moira leans in to Maeve. 

                                 MOIRA
                        He is a keeper.

           Maeve seethes. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Maeve and Harry enter, Maeve SLAMS the door behind them. 

                                 HARRY
                        Can you do your Celine Dion 
                        “impression” now?

                                 MAEVE
                        What the fuck was that? 

                                 HARRY
                        What was what? I like your friends, 
                        they seemed to like me. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What was with the personal attacks? 
                        I felt like I was with my 
                        grandmother. 

                                 HARRY
                        We were just having fun. You want 
                        me to be funny, remember? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Not at my expense, dude! Plus, I’m 
                        the funny one in my friend group. 
                        You totally commandeered the 
                        conversation. 

                                 HARRY
                        According to your friends, you 
                        actually aren’t the funny one. 

           Maeve laughs, bitterly. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I thought maybe you’d stand up for 
                        me, that you’d defend me. But 
                        instead you join in?

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t understand. Humor is the 
                        biggest specification you had for 
                        me. Do you want me to be funny or 
                        not? 

                                 MAEVE
                        I want you to understand my sense 
                        of humor and laugh when I tell 
                        jokes.

                        I don’t want you being Seinfeld 
                        while I sit there being ridiculed 
                        like Newman!

                                 HARRY
                        Who are those people?!

                                 MAEVE
                        Couldn’t you see that I was 
                        unhappy? Do you not pick up on 
                        nonverbal cues? 

                                 HARRY
                        I didn’t want to acknowledge your 
                        irrational behavior. 

           Maeve is visibly angry.

                                 MAEVE
                        That is not irrational. You should 
                        know better. Aren’t you supposed to 
                        be super smart? 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m supposed to be what you 
                        programmed me to be. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well maybe I chose wrong. Perhaps I 
                        should just--

           Maeve pulls out her PHONE. 

                                 HARRY
                        What are you doing? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Reprogramming you. That’s what this 
                        is about. I’m making my perfect 
                        man. And so far, you’re not him.

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t be ridiculous. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m not being ridiculous! You’re 
                        the one who fucked this up! You’re 
                        like a child.

                                 HARRY
                        I’m not the one who’s playing with 
                        a toy though, am I? 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           There’s a long beat. Maeve hits a few buttons on her phone. 
           She CHOOSES “SENSITIVE” and “DOTING” and un-chooses “FUNNY.” 
           She looks up at Harry, satisfied.  

                                 MAEVE
                        There. No more of that. Let’s go to 
                        bed. 

                                 HARRY
                        Hi! I’m Harry. It’s nice to meet 
                        you. 

           Maeve stares at him. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Are we role-playing?

                                 HARRY
                        Nice place you’ve got here, very 
                        neat and tidy. 

           Maeve sits on the couch, deflated. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You don’t remember me, do you? 

           Harry sits down with her. 

                                 HARRY
                        You have really beautiful eyes. 

                                 MAEVE
                        No I don’t. I mean... thank you. 

           Harry smiles. 

                                 HARRY
                        I like a girl who can take a 
                        compliment. 

           Maeve closes her eyes, pissed. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I know. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Maeve sits on her bed, whispering urgently into her phone. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You fucking bitch!

           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           INT. OLIVE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Olive wipes sleep from her eyes. 

                                 OLIVE
                           (whispering)
                        What is it?! 

                                 MAEVE
                        You didn’t tell me that I would 
                        have to completely start over every 
                        time I reprogram him!

                                 OLIVE
                        What did you think would happen? 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t know! I thought maybe his 
                        head would like cock to the side 
                        for a second and he would... I 
                        don’t know... recallibrate. 

                                 OLIVE
                        When you change his specifications, 
                        you’re changing him. It comes with 
                        the territory. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well it’s not fair. I don’t feel 
                        like doing this--

                                 OLIVE
                        Maeve, I can’t deal with this right 
                        now. I’ve got investors to worry 
                        about, I’ve got a ton of things 
                        going on. My reputation not to 
                        mention career is on the line. Just 
                        please stick with the program. 

           There’s a long beat. Maeve isn’t used to Olive being 
           stressed.

                                 MAEVE
                        Ugh. Fine. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Just think of it like you’re dating 
                        a different guy. But he’s still 
                        gorgeous and has to like you. And 
                        make sure you ask him to go 
                        downtown. He’s especially equipped 
                        to do that-- 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Way ahead of you, sis. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Just have fun. You’re creating the 
                        perfect man. It’s gonna take some 
                        duds to get there, right? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Alright fine. But you owe me. 

                                 OLIVE
                        I’m already paying you. Good night! 

           Olive hangs up. 

                                 TRUMAN 
                        You really should have told her. 

           Olive looks over at Truman who’s in bed with her and SMACKS 
           him with a pillow. 

           BACK TO MAEVE.

           Maeve lays on her bed, mad. Harry pokes his head in. 

                                 HARRY
                        Everything okay?

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah, everything’s fine. 

                                 HARRY
                        Are you sure?

                                 MAEVE
                        Yes. I am sure. 

                                 HARRY
                        You seem upset.

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh my GOD if I say I’m fine, I’m 
                        fine. 

                                 HARRY
                        Gotcha. I’m here if you want to 
                        talk. 

           Maeve waves him off, annoyed. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Look, I need to be alone tonight. 
                        Can you sleep -- stay on the couch?
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HARRY
                        Of course. You need your space, I 
                        respect that completely. 

           He leaves the bedroom. Maeve lays back down.

                                 MAEVE
                        Off to a great start. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Maeve sits on the couch, writing on a legal pad. The manure 
           samples sit on the coffee table. Harry sits in an armchair, 
           staring at her politely. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What are you looking at?

                                 HARRY
                        Just admiring your beauty. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well it’s distracting me. I need to 
                        focus. Can’t you go for a walk or 
                        something?

                                 HARRY
                        I’d rather stay with you, keep you 
                        company. 

           Maeve’s tablet DINGS. REQUEST FOR AD ANALYTICS. Maeve ignores 
           it. It DINGS again. She presses a button and turns it off. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        That looked important. 

                                 MAEVE
                        It’s fine. They’ll figure it out. 

                                 HARRY
                        Is it for work? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yep. 

           Harry stares at her. 

                                 HARRY
                        If you want, I could show you how 
                        to use the program--
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Look, I know we haven’t spent much 
                        time together and all but I can 
                        tell this is not going to work. 

           Maeve un-chooses “DOTING” and “SENSITIVE” and chooses 
           “SPONTANEOUS” and “CONFIDENT.” 

                                 HARRY
                        What do you-- 

           Harry blinks for a moment. He smiles at Maeve, he somehow is 
           emitting a “bad boy” vibe.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You must be Maeve. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I am. You’re Harry?

           Harry walks over to the couch and scoops Maeve up in his 
           arms. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God what are you doing?

                                 HARRY
                        I’m taking you out!

           Harry carries a giggling Maeve out of her apartment.

           EXT. SILVER LAKE RESERVOIR - LATER

           The reservoir is completely devoid of water - instead, a 
           digital “lake” is projected into the empty canyon. It looks 
           almost real, the “water” ebbing and flowing.

           Maeve and Harry walk hand in hand around the perimeter, past 
           joggers and families (most of who are “plugged in.”) 

                                 HARRY
                        What’s the craziest thing you’ve 
                        done in the past year? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Pretty much everything I’ve done 
                        could fit in that category since I 
                        feel crazy all the time. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re not crazy. You’re... 
                        creative. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Maeve LAUGHS. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well there was one thing I did a 
                        couple weeks ago... when I was kind 
                        of fucked up on NyQuil. 

                                 HARRY
                        Anal? Apparently it’s very popular 
                        these days with women your age.

                                 MAEVE
                        No. Never. I... wrote my own 
                        eulogy. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why would you do that?

                                 MAEVE
                        Honestly, I don’t know. I was 
                        weirdly trying to convince myself 
                        not to commit suicide and I thought 
                        it would help? So anyway I start 
                        writing it from the perspective of 
                        someone who knows me - my mom or 
                        sister maybe. And I realize I have 
                        nothing positive to say. All I can 
                        hear is disappointment. My mom 
                        saying “Oh she was always so 
                        dramatic, never took anything 
                        seriously.” Or my sister saying how 
                        she wished I could just be happy 
                        for once. How much easier I would 
                        have made it on everyone if I could 
                        just live like a normal person and 
                        stop complaining. 

                                 HARRY
                        I feel like this is something you 
                        would tell a therapist--

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m an asshole, right? Like I’m 
                        dead. I think my mother’s going to 
                        focus on my emotional setbacks? 
                        She’d be a wreck. But all I can 
                        picture are these people pitying 
                        me, thinking how if I could have 
                        opened myself up I could have lived 
                        a happier life, embracing 
                        technology.

           Maeve stops. Harry looks at her.

                                 HARRY
                        Do you feel that way? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Honestly, no. I’m incapable of 
                        “opening” up. That’s not my style. 
                        I play my cards close to the chest. 
                        Because the second I let someone 
                        take a peek, they fuck me over and 
                        ruin my hand. Every time. 

                                 HARRY
                        I like the card metaphor, it really 
                        works. But I’m sorry you got hurt. 

           Maeve laughs, dully.

                                 MAEVE
                        It seems to be a reoccurring thing 
                        in my life.

                                 HARRY
                        You know what your problem is?

                                 MAEVE
                        The chemical imbalance in my brain?

                                 HARRY
                        No. You don’t know how to have fun. 
                        Be in the moment. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yes I do! I just... haven’t in a 
                        while. And when I do I just keep 
                        thinking about how it won’t last.

                                 HARRY
                        That’s no way to live. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I should have you write my eulogy. 

                                 HARRY
                        Let’s do something crazy. What’s 
                        something you’ve always wanted to 
                        do but never have?

           Maeve thinks for a beat. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You can’t make fun of me.

           EXT./ESTAB. THEME PARK (Knott’s Berry, Six Flags, or similar) 
           - DAY

           Maeve and Harry, holding hands, walk into the park. 

           EXT. THEME PARK - CONTINUOUS

           There’s almost no one at the park - it’s a little eerie. The 
           place is old but not rundown. Half of the rides are closed 
           and most of the concessions are shuttered but there’s still a 
           magical feeling to it.

                                 HARRY
                        This is what you’ve always wanted 
                        to do? Why? You know you can “plug 
                        in” and feel like you’re riding a 
                        roller coaster, right?

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t just want to feel like I’m 
                        doing it. I want to do it. And I 
                        never have. 

           Maeve walks Harry up to a ride. There’s a very BORED-LOOKING 
           ATTENDANT playing on his phone. Maeve taps her foot.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Welcome to the Quantum Falcon. Are 
                        you pregnant or expecting to be 
                        pregnant anytime soon?

           Maeve looks at Harry. He shakes his head.

                                 MAEVE
                        Nope. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Enjoy your ride. 

           Maeve and Harry walk through toward the front of the line... 
           which is about ten people long. A dream for anyone who’s ever 
           waited in a line at Disney. Maeve looks at the ROLLER COASTER 
           that’s zooming by them.

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh God. I might have just changed 
                        my mind. 

           Harry grabs her by the hand. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’ve got you. We’re doing this. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Maeve smiles at him. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Whatever you say, Mr. Spontaneous. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. THEME PARK ROLLER COASTER - MINUTES LATER

           Maeve and Harry HURTLE down a 200-foot drop, screaming their 
           heads off. The roller coaster WHIPS and TURNS and DIVES at 
           breakneck speed. We see Maeve, who’s laughing so hard she’s 
           crying. This is the happiest she’s been in... maybe forever. 

           EXT. THEME PARK - LATER

           Maeve and Harry walk around eating ice cream. They play a 
           game at the arcade, shoot some baskets (Harry sinks every one 
           perfectly - the STONED ATTENDANT looks on in amazement. They 
           ride a few more roller coasters - each one crazier than the 
           last. Maeve SCREAMS her head off in ecstasy. Maeve carries an 
           ENORMOUS STUFFED ELEPHANT to the car. 

           INT. MAEVE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Maeve and Harry kiss in her car outside of her downtown 
           apartment. The STUFFED ELEPHANT takes up the backseat. 

                                 MAEVE
                        That was fucking amazing. I peed my 
                        pants a little bit on the last ride 
                        but it was wroth it. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m so glad you had fun. You were 
                        living in the moment.

                                 MAEVE
                           (satisfied)
                        Yeah. I guess I was. 

                                 HARRY
                        Do you want to roll?

                                 MAEVE
                        Roll around? Like on the ground? 

                                 HARRY
                        No, roll. I brought some Zeks.  

           He pulls out a BAG OF PILLS from his pocket. Maeve gasps. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Holy SHIT! Zeks? As in X times ten? 
                        Where did you get that? 

                                 HARRY
                        A guy at the tilt a whirl sold me 
                        some. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Are you insane? 

                                 HARRY
                        He gave me a deal. Seemed like a 
                        good guy. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh I’m sure he did. Was it the guy 
                        with his hand down his pants or the 
                        one who was puking in the bushes? 

                                 HARRY
                        Hands down his pants. But I thought 
                        we were being spontaneous. Living 
                        in the moment. 

           Maeve looks at the bag of pills, torn. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well... I guess in the spirit of 
                        trying new things...

           Harry smiles a devilish grin. Maeve smiles too. This might be 
           fun?

           MUSIC CUE: “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - LATER

           A VERY HIGH MAEVE runs down the street, hand-in-hand with 
           Harry. She HIGH FIVES everyone she passes and KICKS and JABS 
           her hands at every intersection. She’s really feelin’ it. 

           INT. DANCE CLUB - LATER

           Maeve and Harry DANCE WILDLY on the lit-up dance floor. 
           Raymond and Moira are there - DANCING lewdly. Insane techno 
           music is playing but we still only hear QUEEN. Maeve throws 
           her head back and KISSES Harry. He grabs her and puts her on 
           his shoulders. She SPINS around a few times then TOPPLES 
           OVER. Harry looks down at her concerned until... she POPS up, 
           still dancing. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 RAYMOND
                        That’s my bitch!

           INT. BOOK STORE - LATER 

           A giant sign above the store reads: “THE ONLY REAL BOOKSTORE 
           LEFT IN THE U.S.” Hipsters and tourists gather outside, 
           taking pictures of the relic. Maeve and Harry enter the 
           store, still HIGH AS KITES.

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh my God I think I’m going to cry. 
                        I’ve never seen anything so 
                        beautiful. 

           She sits down in a FICTION AISLE, a puddle of emotion. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        They have paperbacks, Harry. Real 
                        paperbacks. 

           A SALES ASSOCIATE rushes over. 

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        What are you doing? 

           Maeve is petting the books. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m just feeling their energies. 

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        These products are extremely rare. 
                        We ask you only touch what you 
                        intend to buy. 

           Maeve stops her petting and looks at Harry. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I can’t afford any of this. That’s 
                        why I don’t come in here - I can’t 
                        stand the temptation. 

           Harry looks down at her, smiling.

                                 HARRY
                        Whatever she touches I’ll purchase. 

           Maeve CLAPS enthusiastically. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yay! I’m gonna go touch some more!
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Maeve and Harry run through the endless aisles, grabbing 
           books as they go. The Sales Associate follows behind, 
           nervously.

           Maeve enters the CHILDREN’S SECTION and plops down in a bean 
           bag. Harry leans down and KISSES HER. She smiles, this is 
           fun! He pulls her up and dances with her. Suddenly, she pulls 
           away and taps him on the shoulder. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Tag! You’re it!

           She runs away and he chases her through the labyrinth. 
           Suddenly, she reaches the MYSTERY section and stops. The 
           music cuts out. She enters the room hesitantly, a concerned 
           Harry behind her. 

                                 HARRY
                        What game are we playing now?

                                 MAEVE
                        No game. I just... want to look for 
                        something. 

           She walks to the “J” section and squints. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                           (to Harry)
                        The drugs are making my eyes wonky, 
                        can you help me?

                                 HARRY
                        What are you looking for?

                                 MAEVE
                        It’s a book by Robert Jensen. It’s 
                        called “MIDNIGHT IN MADRID.”

           Harry scans the bookshelf and pulls out a VOLUME. He hands it 
           to Maeve, who handles it delicately. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s... 

                                 HARRY
                        I know. 

           She turns the book over and sees the AUTHOR’S PHOTO. A 
           handsome man with glasses looks back at her. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Hey, buddy.

           The Sales Associate, out of breath, marches up to Maeve. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        Young lady, we are closing soon and 
                        these shenanigans have to stop. 

                                 MAEVE
                        We’re ready. I’m getting this one 
                        too. 

           She hands the Associate MIDNIGHT IN MADRID. 

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        I’ll meet you at the front. 

           EXT. POWELL’S BOOK STORE - A LITTLE LATER

           Maeve and Harry walk out of the store, laden with books. 
           Maeve blinks back tears. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What should we do now? 

                                 HARRY
                        I have more Zeks... we could go to 
                        this underground club that has a 
                        trance-rave starting at 3. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m pretty tired, maybe let’s just 
                        go home. 

           Harry frowns. 

                                 HARRY
                        Is that what you want? Doesn’t seem 
                        very spontaneous. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Spontaneity is only fun for so 
                        long, dude. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Harry and Maeve are laying on the bed, fully clothed. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m still really high. 

                                 HARRY
                        Me too.

                                 MAEVE
                        He died last year. Car crash. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           Harry looks at her. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        He was in a self-driving car. One 
                        of the crazy electric models - the 
                        ones they said were foolproof? He 
                        was so proud of that car. When he 
                        got the advance on his second book 
                        he went out and bought it first 
                        thing. 

                                 HARRY
                        What happened? 

                                 MAEVE
                        There was a glitch. Something 
                        jammed the steering wheel and he 
                        didn’t have control. The car drove 
                        him straight into a tree. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m so sorry. That technology was 
                        well-developed though, it may have 
                        been a user error-

                                 MAEVE
                        It was the fucking car, okay?

                                 HARRY
                        Okay.

                                 MAEVE
                        He was a really good writer. Only 
                        wrote the one book though.

           Harry puts his arm around Maeve. Maeve closes her eyes. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        When I was little he would rub my 
                        head every night to get me to go to 
                        sleep. 

           Harry starts to rub her head, but she pulls away.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        How long does this last? 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m not sure. Drugs don’t actually 
                        affect me. 

           She looks at him, he’s grinning. She takes a pillow and 
           WHACKS him in the face. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Maeve wakes up to an empty room. She looks at her father’s 
           book on the shelf and cringes. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Goddamnit, Maeve. 

           She checks her phone: 3 MISSED CALLS FROM: MOM. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Of course. 

           She climbs out of bed and into the shower. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maeve turns the water on and lets it run down her hair. She 
           rubs her eyes, trying to wake up. Suddenly, a hand pulls the 
           door open. It’s Harry’s. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What are you doing?

           Naked, he climbs in with her. 

                                 HARRY
                        Nothing. 

           He kisses her, she pulls away. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m not in the mood. Those drugs 
                        fucked with my head. I lost 
                        control.

                                 HARRY
                        I just wanted you to have some fun, 
                        to let go a little bit.

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah, well I don’t like “letting 
                        go.” 

           He kisses her neck. 

                                 HARRY
                        You need to relax. Trust me.

                                 MAEVE
                        No, I don’t. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           She pushes him away but he grabs her and pushes her up 
           against the wall. 

                                 HARRY
                        Let’s do it right now.

                                 MAEVE
                        What the fuck! Stop!

           He doesn’t. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, STOP! 

           She SLAPS him in the face, he recoils. 

                                 HARRY
                        What is wrong with you? 

           Crying, Maeve steps out of the shower. She wraps a towel 
           around herself and grabs her phone with shaking hands. Harry 
           follows her out. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You say you want to be in the 
                        moment but you don’t know what you 
                        want, do you? 

           He grabs her shoulder. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Back the fuck up. Living in the 
                        moment does not mean attacking me 
                        in the shower. 

           She grabs her phone.

                        Look, thanks for going with me to 
                        the park and paying for my books 
                        but this isn’t working out.

           She looks at Harry, who’s laughing bitterly. 

                                 HARRY
                        You think that was my money? 
                        Everything I spent came out of your 
                        payment from Olive.

                                 MAEVE
                        Of course it did. Way to go, 
                        passing it off like your own. 
                        You’re a real gentlemen.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           She opens her APP and presses a few buttons. She braces 
           herself and looks up at Harry, who is smiling and holding out 
           his hand. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m Harry. 

           Maeve sighs and walks out of the bathroom. 

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - BENJAMIN’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Benjamin’s office looks like the inside of a child’s tree 
           house. It is paneled in wood, and the floor is covered with 
           old-timey toys and papers. Benjamin and Olive sit cross-
           legged next to a typewriter that is typing as they talk. It’s 
           obvious Benjamin likes taking old things and making them 
           modern (he probably read a lot of Steampunk fan fiction as a 
           kid.) Olive looks at her tablet.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What was the problem with the last 
                        one? 

                                 OLIVE
                        He was too aggressive - he pushed 
                        her too far. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I see. 

           Benjamin motions to the typewriter who makes a note. Olive 
           clocks this. 

                                 OLIVE
                        But she’s learning! She’s getting 
                        better about it, seriously. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Our investors want to know what the 
                        typical time frame on mate matching 
                        is. They’re worried that people 
                        will give up if it takes too long. 
                        Production starts soon - I need 
                        answers.

                                 OLIVE
                        Totally get it. But I think we’re 
                        really close.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Truths and roses have thorns about 
                        them. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 OLIVE
                        That one’s Thoreau! I finally got 
                        one!

           She looks at Benjamin, expecting a smile. But he gives her a 
           blank stare. He motions to the typewriter again.

           MUSIC CUE: “LOVIN’, TOUCHIN’, SQUEEZIN’” by JOURNEY.

           MONTAGE:

           -Maeve and Harry swim in the ocean, laughing and playing. 

           -Maeve looks at a sleeping Harry and reprograms him on her 
           app. 

           -Harry teaches Maeve how to swing a golf club, she’s 
           terrible. 

           -Maeve and harry fight in her apartment, she takes out her 
           phone again. 

           -Harry and Maeve eat at a restaurant with Moria and Raymond, 
           who are both drinking to excess. They SCROLL on their phones 
           while Maeve sits glumly.

           -Maeve smokes a bowl on the couch and watches Harry do push-
           ups. She rolls her eyes and brings out the phone. 

           -Maeve looks at her phone - 4 MISSED CALLS FROM: MOM. She 
           looks at Harry, who’s making a goofy face. Reprogram. 

           -Olive looks at Maeve’s data. It’s not lining up the way she 
           needs it to. Why hasn’t she gotten it right yet? 

           -Maeve texts her mom: I’M ALIVE DON’T WORRY XO. 

           -Maeve and Harry have sex. She looks bored and grabs the 
           phone. 

           -Maeve and Harry eat ice cream. She looks at him and nods. 
           This one might be a keeper. 

           EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - A FEW DAYS LATER

           A banner hung from a tree reads “AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT 
           ANNUAL PICNIC.” Maeve sits at a table with a few people who 
           are “plugged in.” She looks around and sees Harry playing 
           frisbee with a dog. She smiles. Blanche and her minions spot 
           Maeve and sit down next to her. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 BLANCHE
                        So where’s the famous boyfriend, 
                        Maeve? Or did you “break up with 
                        him” too?

           Blanche’s minions giggle. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You really know how to turn a joke, 
                        Blanche. Have you thought about 
                        pursuing a comedy career?

                                 BLANCHE
                        Pretty girls don’t need to be 
                        funny. 

           Maeve rolls her eyes. Suddenly, Harry appears at the table, 
           panting and glistening with sweat. 

                                 HARRY
                        Hey, babe. Can you pass me a water? 

           Maeve hands him a HYDROPILL. He swallows it down and kisses 
           her on the mouth. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Are these your friends? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Not quite. This is Blanche. She 
                        works in analytics. Non-creative.

           Blanche, who’s gobsmacked, holds out her hand.

                                 HARRY
                        Nice to meet you, Blanche. Maeve 
                        and I met online.

           Harry puts his arm around Maeve, who looks at him, nervous.

                                 BLANCHE
                        And what is it you do, Harry? 

           Harry looks at Maeve, who panics. 

                                 MAEVE
                        He’s in finance. Numbers and shit, 
                        really boring. 

                                 BLANCHE
                        Oh what firm? My boyfriend works at 
                        Cohen and Krause in Century City.

                                 HARRY
                        Oh very nice. I actually do more 
                        freelance work. Go from place to 
                        place.

                                 BLANCHE
                        What do you think about the Fed’s 
                        projections for this year? Kind of 
                        crazy, right? 

                                 HARRY
                        Totally crazy! I couldn’t believe 
                        it when I heard. 

                                 BLANCHE
                        That’s odd because they’re not 
                        releasing the projections for a few 
                        more weeks. 

           She stares at Harry, who looks back at her, unfazed. 

                                 HARRY
                        Maybe to the public, but like I 
                        said: I work freelance. Often with 
                        the federal government. So excuse 
                        me if I have information before the 
                        rest of the population. Tell your 
                        boyfriend to call me if he needs 
                        some tips.

           Maeve smiles, proud of him. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Blanche, stop badgering him. Why 
                        don’t you go eat and throw up 
                        another hotdog.

           Blanche turns on her heel, angry, and walks away.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                           (to Harry)
                        Holy shit, that was amazing! You 
                        totally fooled her. 

                                 HARRY
                        Well I’m quick on my feet, aren’t 
                        I? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Is that one of your traits? I can’t 
                        keep it straight anymore. 

           Harry frowns at her. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HARRY
                        Can’t keep what straight? 

           Maeve realizes and waves it off. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Uhh nevermind. Let’s go play with 
                        Rufus!

                                 HARRY
                        Okay! I’m easy-going too, remember?

           Maeve laughs. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yes. That I remember.

           Just then, ROBERT approaches. He’s obviously drunk. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Maevey baby! How’s it hanging? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Not at all. Since I’m a woman. 

           Robert laughs loudly. 

                                 ROBERT
                        You kill me. Did you see the 
                        receptionist from the second floor? 
                        Ho-ly moly. I mean her tits are 
                        obviously fake but--

           Robert looks up at Harry, who now has his arm around Maeve, 
           protectively. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Maeve! Who is this tall man? 

                                 MAEVE
                        This is Harry. My boyfriend. 

           Harry shakes Robert’s hand. 

                                 HARRY
                        I would appreciate it if you 
                        stopped making sexist and demeaning 
                        comments in front of her. 

           Robert looks like he’s going to PUNCH Harry. Maeve winces. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 ROBERT
                        Point taken, sir. I wouldn’t want 
                        some old creep hitting on my 
                        girlfriend either! Even if she is a 
                        little minx.

                                 MAEVE
                        Lawsuit, Robert. Lawsuit.

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Maeve and Harry sit on the couch with two glasses of wine. 
           Maeve is laughing. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Did you see the look on Blanche’s 
                        face? She couldn’t believe someone 
                        so out of my league would actually 
                        be into me!

                                 HARRY
                        Hey. Not out of your league. Stop 
                        selling yourself short.

                                 MAEVE
                        Ugh, she’s the worst. I hate people 
                        like her. She’s “plugged in” like 
                        80% of the time because her life is 
                        so disappointing. I bet she uses a 
                        “Buddy.”

           Harry looks confused. 

                                 HARRY
                        A “Buddy?”

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah it’s this little attachment 
                        you can hook up to your phone or VR 
                        that simulates sex. Like a little 
                        plastic thing. 

                                 HARRY
                        You don’t have one of thess? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Hell no! My boyfriend-- I mean my 
                        ex-boyfriend used one and it was 
                        just... disturbing. 

                                 HARRY
                        I will keep that in mind when 
                        buying you a Christmas present. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Christmas is a ways away, bro. 

                                 HARRY
                        But I like you. 

           Maeve smiles.

                                 MAEVE
                        I like you too. I can talk to you. 
                        Nobody really talks anymore.

                                 HARRY
                        That makes you sad, doesn’t it?

           Maeve nods. Harry leans in and KISSES her. She closes her 
           eyes, enjoying it.

                                 MAEVE
                        Talking isn’t really all it’s 
                        cracked up to be though. 

           She pulls him in and KISSES him again. She smiles and pulls 
           him toward her on the couch.

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER - THE NEXT DAY

           A rundown cinema in Los Feliz, one of the last in LA. Maeve 
           holds Harry’s hand, excited. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - SIMULTANEOUS

           Maeve and Harry, sitting in the back row, are the only ones 
           in the theater. The seats are ripping, the floor’s covered in 
           popcorn and spilled soda. Harry looks at Maeve, is she crazy?

                                 HARRY
                        This is your favorite place?

                                 MAEVE
                        Yes! It’s quiet and no one’s 
                        allowed to be on their phones. 

           Harry looks around. 

                                 HARRY
                        But there’s no one else here. 

                                 MAEVE
                           (smiling)
                        Exactly. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           An USHER walks up to the screen. He looks like he’s 100 years 
           old. 

                                 USHER
                        Welcome to the Los Feliz cinema, a 
                        historic piece of Los Angeles. The 
                        film you’re about to see is a 
                        classic - one that has influenced 
                        countless filmmakers over the 
                        years. Please silence your phones, 
                        tablets, VR devices and turn off 
                        all pygmy cameras. Enjoy the show. 

           The usher walks away and the screen comes to life. “MEAN 
           GIRLS” starts playing. Maeve CLAPS. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’ve never seen this one. Where are 
                        the 3D contacts? 

           Maeve takes a handful of popcorn and puts her feet on the 
           seats. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Get ready for your world to be 
                        rocked, Glen Coco. 

                                 HARRY
                        Glen who?

           But Maeve shushes him. Harry puts his arm around her and she 
           leans into him. This is her happy place.

           INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           Maeve and Harry walk into a cute French place, very cheap and 
           cheerful. 

                                 HARRY
                        So are girls actually that mean in 
                        real life? 

                                 MAEVE
                        They’re worse. When I was in high 
                        school the cyber bullying was so 
                        bad half the kids had to be home-
                        schooled. 

                                 HARRY
                        Wow. That’s so sad. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        I think high school was terrible 
                        for everyone though. I should show 
                        you this movie called “The 
                        Breakfast Club.” It’s weird because 
                        they never actually eat breakfast--

           Just then, Moira and Raymond WALK IN and spot Maeve and 
           Harry. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh God. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        Look who it is! 

                                 MOIRA
                        This is hilarious. We never come 
                        here! 

                                 RAYMOND
                        We’re being ironic. 

           Raymond HUGS Maeve and goes to hug Harry, who sticks out his 
           hand. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m Harry. 

           Raymond and Moira look at Maeve, who nods, sheepish. So this 
           is a new Harry. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        Hi, Harry! So lovely to meet you. 
                        For the first time. 

                                 HARRY
                        You too. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Maybe we should go somewhere else?

                                 MOIRA
                        Oh come on! Stay and have a drink. 
                           (winking to Maeve)
                        It went so well the last time.

                                 HARRY
                        Last time? 

           Maeve grabs Harry’s hand. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Okay, actually I’m not feeling 
                        well. Let’s go, Harry. 

           Harry WAVES to Moira and Raymond, who WAVE back, mockingly. 
           Maeve shoots them a withering look. 

                                 MOIRA
                        Ooph we’re gonna pay for that I’m 
                        sure. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        Girl is out of her damn mind. He’s 
                        like the twelfth ‘Harry’ we’ve met.

           A plate of food passes by and Raymond GASPS dramatically. 

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Oh my stars we can’t eat here. 
                        Ironically or otherwise. 

                                 MOIRA
                        Let’s just do the alternative. 

           They both “plug in” and start chewing. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        Steak, medium rare. 

                                 MOIRA
                        I’ve got a chocolate milk shake 
                        that’s to die. 

           As these two pretend to eat in the middle of a restaurant, we 
           CUT TO:

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - OLIVE’S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Olive is working late, on Truman’s screen we see he’s working 
           hard too. Olive looks at him, she misses him. She gets a 
           text.

                                 TEXT FROM MAEVE
                        I think this is the one. He’s got

                        Thank GOD. Benjamin is really 
                        starting to freak out. He’s been 
                        stress-eating full ears of corn for 
                        the past couple days.

           Olive smiles and calls Benjamin.

           INT. BENJAMIN’S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Benjamin sits in a bubble bath in an ORNATE BATHROOM 
           decorated with Victorian-style drapes and furniture. Several 
           half-eaten ears of corn lay next to him. He smokes a pipe and 
           listens to jazz on a radio. His Steampunk VR glasses emit 
           GROANING noises. He’s obviously watching porn. He ANSWERS 
           Olive’s call on his glasses. 

                                 BENJAMIN

                        Benjamin! Big news. She’s found 
                        him. She’s matched her mate! 

           Benjamin sits up in the bath. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        This is incredible news. Let’s 
                        activate the team. I want to start 
                        full production with the investors’ 
                        approval. Congratulations, Olive.

           Olive smiles WIDELY. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maeve and Harry, post-coital, sit on the couch. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Well that was... 

                                 HARRY
                        Amazing?

                                 MAEVE
                        Yep. That was amazing. It’s like 
                        you knew what I wanted. 

                                 HARRY
                        I did.

                                 MAEVE
                        Uhhh I don’t want to go to work 
                        tomorrow. I just want to stay here 
                        with you and have like five more 
                        orgasms. 

                                 HARRY
                        That can be arranged. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Work is stupid anyway. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why is it stupid? Besides your boss 
                        being an actual sexual predator?

                                 MAEVE
                        I have to present a commercial I 
                        wrote.

                                 HARRY
                        That sounds cool!

                                 MAEVE
                        For manure. 

                                 HARRY
                        Oh. 

                                 MAEVE
                        It’s idiotic. I always get the 
                        worst clients. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why?

                                 MAEVE
                        Probably because I don’t wear 
                        enough low-cut shirts. But also 
                        because I hate using all of the 
                        devices they force us to have.

           Harry thinks for a minute. 

                                 HARRY 
                        Have you ever asked for a specific 
                        assignment?

                                 MAEVE
                        Nah no one really does that.

                                 HARRY
                        Well maybe you should start.

           DAY

           Maeve finishes a presentation while Robert and others sit 
           around the conference table. She clicks something on her 
           phone and a picture of a pile of manure appears on the wall.

                                 MAEVE
                        Hurley’s manure: Good shit.

           Robert and the team CLAP loudly. Maeve smiles. 

                                 ROBERT
                        I love it! Simple, to the point. 
                        Catchy. Well done my dear. How did 
                        you think of the tagline?

                                 MAEVE
                           (sarcastic)
                        It came to me in a dream. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Well you’re brilliant and amazing 
                        and you have a body that literally 
                        will not quit. 

           Maeve looks down at her clothes, uncomfortable. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Thank you? 

                                 ROBERT
                        You seem different. Have you been 
                        working out? Air yoga? Ballet swim?

                        expect a raise at the end of this 
                        quarter. 

           Maeve smiles. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Thanks, Robert. And in terms of my 
                        next assignment -- 

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ve got one all picked out for 
                        you. Laser pubic hair removal. They 
                        said they’d even throw in 15% off a 
                        treatment for you so you should get 
                        on that. Quick. 

           He stares at her pointedly.

                                 MAEVE
                        No. I want the sneaker account. 

           Everyone murmurs around the table. The gorgeous woman, Andrea 
           pops up. 

                                 ANDREA
                        Sorry, Maid, but Robert’s promised 
                        me that account. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Andrea, we’ve worked together for a 
                        year. Why would my name be Maid? 

           Robert, sensing tension, intervenes. 

                                 ROBERT
                           (giddy)
                        Now, now girls let’s not fight. 
                           (then)
                        Maeve, why do you want the Sneaker 
                        account?

                                 MAEVE
                        Because I deserve it. I’m smart and 
                        I work faster than anyone and 
                        that’s a great account. And I want 
                        a pair of those sneakers that weigh 
                        less than a quarter.

           Robert looks at her, impressed.

                                 ROBERT
                        Alright, it’s yours. And may I say 
                        you are hotter than ever when 
                        you’re assertive. 

                                 MAEVE
                        No. You may not say that. 

           INT. AD-DICTIVE ENTERTAINMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A happy Maeve walks into the main office and straight into 
           Blanche.  

                                 MAEVE 
                        Oh hey, Blanche. Have fun the other 
                        day? 

           Blanche smiles an evil smile.

                                 BLANCHE
                        Tons. But have you seen Hunter’s 
                        new girlfriend? She kind of looks 
                        like you! But less big.

           Maeve’s face falls. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What are you talking about? 

           Blanche hands Maeve her phone. There’s a picture of Hunter 
           and a PRETTY GIRL holding hands. Maeve blinks back tears. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, no I saw. I... gotta go. 

           Maeve pushes past Blanche, who watches her go with a 
           vindictive look. 

           INT. MAEVE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Maeve hyperventilates and looks through POSTS of Hunter and 
           his new GIRLFRIEND on her phone. She puts on Joni Mitchell, 
           which blasts through the speakers. With shaking hands, she 
           calls Hunter.

           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        You’re dating Annabel. From work. 
                        You lied to me. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Maeve, calm down. I didn’t want you 
                        to find out this way. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What way? Social media? The thing 
                        that every person on Earth uses? 

                                 HUNTER
                        Yes, except you. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t live under a rock, you 
                        asshole. So how long did you cheat 
                        on me for?

           There’s a long beat.

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh God, you cheated on me. I feel 
                        like Hillary Clinton. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Look, we grew apart a long time 
                        ago. I thought it would be easier 
                        on you if you didn’t know the full 
                        story. 

           Maeve laughs, bitterly. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Easier on me?! You made me believe 
                        there was something wrong with me! 
                        You let me think it was my fault! 

                                 HUNTER
                        Maeve, you pushed me away. You 
                        holed yourself up in your own 
                        little world and wouldn’t let me 
                        in. What was I supposed to do?

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t know-- not fuck someone 
                        else?

                                 HUNTER
                        I cared about you. A lot. I loved 
                        you.

                        But you were never going to accept 
                        the fact that I was moving along 
                        with the rest of the world and I 
                        wouldn’t stay behind with you.

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m so sorry I held you back. 
                        Thanks for digging the knife in YET 
                        AGAIN.

           Maeve hangs up and throws her phone. It lands in between the 
           seats. She SCREAMS.

           A very drunk Maeve walks into the apartment carrying a bottle 
           of whiskey. Harry gets up from the couch. 

                                 HARRY
                        Jesus, what happened to you? Why 
                        are you drinking again?

                                 MAEVE
                        Why are men the worst things? Why 
                        do they make women crazy then break 
                        up with them because they’re crazy? 
                        Why do they get paid more than me? 
                        WHY DO THEY GET TO FUCK WHOEVER 
                        THEY WANT AND GET AWAY WITH IT?

           Maeve sways, unsteady. 

                                 HARRY
                        You need some water. And you need 
                        to relax. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You sound just like him. “Relax, 
                        calm down. It’s not that bad. 
                        You’re acting insane.” Yeah well 
                        fuck that I’m not the insane one. 

           Harry hands Maeve a glass of water. She pushes it away. He 
           looks at her, concerned. 

                                 HARRY
                        You need to cool off. Go take a 
                        shower. 

           She pushes him. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Don’t tell me what to do! Are you 
                        cheating on me too? Are you gonna 
                        tell me you found another girl? 
                        Somebody else is programming your 
                        motherboard now?

                                 HARRY
                        That’s not how it works. And I’m 
                        telling you you need to calm down 
                        before I talk to you. 

                                 MAEVE
                        No. You’re wrong. You’re all wrong. 

           Maeve takes her phone from her purse and opens the APP. She 
           pushes a few buttons. Harry grabs the phone from her and 
           looks at it. He stares at Maeve. 

                                 HARRY
                        What are you doing?

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m reprogramming you. That’s what 
                        I’m supposed to do.

           Harry sits down on the couch. 

                                 HARRY
                        So you’re just gonna erase me?

           Maeve looks at him. 

                                 MAEVE
                        No, no. I’m just gonna... 
                        recallibrate you. 

                                 HARRY
                        And what’s going to happen to me? 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t know, okay? It’s not my job 
                        to worry about that shit. This 
                        whole thing is one big mistake. 

                                 HARRY
                        Maeve, don’t do this. Please. 

           She looks at him, torn. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You’re not supposed to act like 
                        this. You’re not a person. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HARRY
                        I’ve been with you for weeks, that 
                        doesn’t feel real to you?

           Maeve sways, rubbing her head. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Look, just stop talking. I can’t 
                        deal with this right now. 

           There’s a beat. 

                                 HARRY
                        What number am I. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What?

                                 HARRY
                        How many “Harry’s” were there 
                        before you got to me? 

           Maeve looks down, ashamed. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t know. I lost count. 

                                 HARRY
                        Jesus Christ. Ballpark. 

                                 MAEVE
                           (quietly)
                        Eighteen or nineteen?

           Harry laughs. 

                                 HARRY
                        Wow. You’ve really gone all out, 
                        haven’t you?

           Maeve starts to cry. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m just a guinea pig! I’m testing 
                        it for my sister that’s all. 

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t think so. I don’t think 
                        that’s all I was to you. But now 
                        you’re hurt and afraid and you’re 
                        taking it out on me. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Shut up. Just shut up!

                                 HARRY
                        Go ahead and do it then. Erase me. 

           He looks at her, daring her. She hesitates. Then...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Maeve, wait--

           She presses a few buttons on her phone and looks up. Harry’s 
           smiling at her.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Maeve. I’m Harry. 

           Maeve THROWS UP on his shoes. 

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           Maeve wakes up in her bed, hung over as hell. She looks 
           around for her phone and sits up. Bad idea. She lays back 
           down. Harry walks in wearing workout attire.

                                 HARRY
                        Good morning, Maeve. There’s a 
                        granola bar out on the counter for 
                        you. Care to come on a run with me? 

                                 MAEVE
                        Harry? What are you doing? 

                                 HARRY
                        It’s 8am already, are you getting 
                        up?

           Maeve rubs sleep out of her eyes. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You don’t run, what are you talking 
                        about? 

                                 HARRY
                           (testy)
                        Just get up. 

           Maeve is confused. Why is he being like this?

                                 MAEVE
                        Jesus, what’s with you? I’m hung 
                        over, I don’t even remember coming 
                        home last night. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HARRY
                        Well I sure do. You threw up over 
                        my favorite brogues. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You have multiple pairs of shoes?

           Suddenly, Maeve’s phone BUZZES somewhere in her bed. She 
           feels around for it. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’ll see you when I get back from 
                        my run. I hope you’re up by then.

           He exits Maeve’s room. She grabs her phone. OLIVE CALLING. 
           She answers, wearily. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - OLIVE’S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Olive sits behind her desk, a slew of digital screens in 
           front of her, Truman on one of them. 

                                 OLIVE
                           (to Maeve)
                        What the fuck happened last night? 

                                 MAEVE
                        What do you mean?

                                 OLIVE
                        I saw on your records that you 
                        reprogammed Harry. I thought you 
                        were done, Maeve. You were supposed 
                        to be done!

           This hits Maeve like a ton of bricks. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Wait. Last night I did this? 

                                 OLIVE
                        Yes... 

           Maeve hits herself. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Fuck! I don’t remember, I was 
                        drunk. Hunter’s dating this girl 
                        from work and--

                                 OLIVE
                        Maeve, I told you to take this 
                        seriously. My ass is on the line 
                        here! I told Benjamin you had a 
                        mate match and now he’s gonna 
                        fucking kill me or start quoting 
                        the Bible to me to smote me or 
                        something--

                                 MAEVE
                        I was having a bad day, okay? Look, 
                        just put him back the way he was, 
                        get the good Harry back. 

           Olive shakes her head. 

                                 OLIVE
                        No, no it doesn’t work like that. 
                        Once he’s gone he’s gone. You can’t 
                        get him back. Even if you gave him 
                        the exact same specifications, due 
                        to circumstances and his 
                        environment he’s not going to be 
                        the same. And you won’t have any 
                        context or memories or--

                                 MAEVE
                        Okay, okay I get it. Damnit. What 
                        did I reprogram him with? This 
                        version seems to be some sort of 
                        sadist who’s trying to get me to 
                        lose five pounds in an hour.

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah you picked horrible traits. I 
                        swear to God if you don’t make him 
                        your perfect man within a week I’m 
                        gonna cut off all your hair.

           Olive hangs up. She looks up and sees Benjamin and Rosemary, 
           watching her. They both look upset. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Is there something you’d like to 
                        tell me, Olive?

           Rosemary’s screen FROWNS.

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maeve sits on her couch, still looking a mess. She texts 
           RAYMOND and MOIRA from her phone. 

                                 TEXT TO MOIRA AND RAYMOND
                        Do you guys want to hang out? 

           She waits for a beat. Then the phone BUZZES.

                        Out with some twinks.

                        How many Harry’s have you made 
                        today?

                                 TEXT FROM MOIRA
                        And have they all found out you’re 
                        crazy yet?

           Maeve THROWS her phone down, angry. Just then, Harry returns, 
           sweaty from his run. He looks at her, disapprovingly. 

                                 MAEVE
                        What?

                                 HARRY
                        Have you not showered yet?

                                 MAEVE
                        No I have not. And I don’t plan on 
                        it.

           Harry shakes his head and makes a smoothie in the kitchen. 
           Maeve grabs her head. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Dude! Come on, that hurts. 

                                 HARRY
                           (calling O.S.) 
                        You need protein! 

           He comes out with a GLASS and hands it to Maeve.

                                 HARRY
                        Drink it. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Please stop telling me what to do. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why don’t you go back to bed if 
                        you’re gonna be a bitch. 

           He walks back into the kitchen, leaving a PISSED OFF Maeve on 
           the couch. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Why don’t you go back to -- the 
                        main frame if you’re gonna keep 
                        being such a -- fucking-- 
                        GODDAMNIT. 

           Not having a good comeback and severely on edge, she pulls 
           out her phone and reprograms him. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Maeve sits at a table with Harry, who’s wearing a FLASHY SUIT 
           and looking around the restaurant, bored. Maeve picks at her 
           cheeseburger. 

                                 MAEVE
                        So I’ve been working on this 
                        sneaker account and I can’t quite 
                        figure out the angle. 

                                 HARRY
                           (not listening)
                        Look, Griffin Charles is sitting at 
                        that table. He was on that meme 
                        show, remember?

                                 MAEVE
                        What? No. I don’t watch that shit. 

                                 HARRY
                           (mocking)
                        Excuse me, I wasn’t aware you were 
                        so judgmental. 

           Maeve sighs. She looks at him, point blank.

                                 MAEVE
                        Will you rub my head later?

                                 HARRY
                        Tonight? No way, you didn’t shower 
                        today. 

           Maeve takes a GIANT SIP of her drink. 

           MUSIC CUE: “Only Love Can Hurt Like This” By Paloma Faith

           MONTAGE: 

           Maeve sits on her couch while Harry scrolls through his 
           phone, ignoring her. She reads a book and pets Beauregard. 
           She reprograms him.

           A COMPANY PARTY while Harry flirts with Blanche. Maeve stands 
           in the corner, getting drunk.

           Harry YELLS at Maeve outside of restaurant. She walks away, 
           seemingly unaffected and reprograms him. She’s somehow 
           getting a sick pleasure of making him nastier and nastier. 

           Maeve gets a call from her MOM. She stares at it, unsure of 
           what to do. She IGNORES the call. She looks at Harry, who’s 
           playing a VIOLENT VIDEO GAME. 

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - BENJAMIN’S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Olive sits nervously as Benjamin TWIDDLES HIS THUMBS. 
           Rosemary gives Olive a judgmental look.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        That perfect bliss and sole 
                        felicity, the sweet fruition of an 
                        earthly crown. 

           He stares at Olive plainly. She hesitates. 

                                 OLIVE
                        So... I know this isn’t what you 
                        bargained for but I swear I can get 
                        her on the right track. She had a 
                        horrible breakup and it might have 
                        been too soon to throw her back in 
                        the ring... especially with Harry--

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Why are you apologizing?
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 OLIVE
                        Well I know the outcome isn’t what 
                        you wanted and the investors might 
                        be spooked--

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Oh yes they’ve all pulled out. 

                                 OLIVE
                        What?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Yes the project is dead. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Benjamin, seriously we can fix 
                        this.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What’s to fix? It’s wonderful. This 
                        has proven that people don’t know 
                        what they really want. That they’re 
                        incapable of deciding for 
                        themselves.

                                 OLIVE
                        But I also think--

                                 BENJAMIN
                        We have to be the ones to decide. 
                        This data has helped us create an 
                        entirely new algorithm. Where we 
                        match people together. Take the 
                        power away completely. 

                                 OLIVE
                        But no one wants that! Everyone 
                        wants to feel in control of their 
                        own destiny. 

           Benjamin bites his pipe and laughs. Rosemary chuckles, Olive 
           shoots her a look. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        People want to feel in control of 
                        their own destiny. So let them. Let 
                        them think they’re matching with 
                        people on their own. But it will be 
                        us pulling the strings. 

           Olive stares at Benjamin, speechless. 

                                 OLIVE
                        But that’s...that’s...
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Brilliant? I know. Don’t know why I 
                        didn’t think of it before. Turns 
                        out that when people have the power 
                        of choice, they often choose wrong. 

                                 OLIVE
                        But I met my husband on Faceswipe! 
                        I chose right. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Did you? Doesn’t your husband live 
                        thousands of miles away?

           Olive holds back tears. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for your brilliant mind, 
                        Olive. It was a lovely idea. But in 
                        the end... it was a bad idea. 

           Olive nods. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Every man dies, not every man 
                        really lives. Mel Gibson. 
                        Braveheart. 

           He gives Olive an awkward hug. 

                                 OLIVE
                        That one kind of made sense.

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maeve flops down on the couch and puts on a record. 

           MUSIC CUE: “THE SOUND OF SILENCE” by SIMON AND GARFUNKEL. The 
           same song playing at the beginning. 

           Harry walks in from the kitchen, angry. 

                                 HARRY
                        Where have you been?

                                 MAEVE
                        Out. 

                                 HARRY
                        Where is “out?”

                                 MAEVE
                        Why do you care? 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 HARRY
                        Because I’d like to know where 
                        you’ve been for six hours. I almost 
                        called the police. 

           Maeve rolls her eyes. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Look, I don’t need a babysitter, 
                        okay? Just go do some crossword 
                        puzzles or something. 

           Harry gets in her face.

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t like to be told what to do. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Alright, relax. Jesus. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’d like to know where you were. 

           Maeve HITS THE WALL in exasperation.

                                 MAEVE
                        I was out walking around, okay? Is 
                        that alright with you?

                                 HARRY
                        CALM DOWN. You’re acting insane!

                                 MAEVE
                        I just met you! You were 
                        reprogrammed last night! God, this 
                        feels just like--

           Maeve thinks for a moment. Suddenly, she flashes to the 
           OPENING SCENE - where Hunter shakes her. 

                                                     FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - MONTHS AGO

           MUSIC CUE: “THE SOUND OF SILENCE” by SIMON AND GARFUNKEL. The 
           same song is playing. Maeve SMACKS THE WALL. 

                                 HUNTER
                        You’re acting insane!

           BACK TO SCENE. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - PRESENT 

           Maeve stares at Harry, who’s looking at her with daggers in 
           his eyes. He looks strangely like Hunter.

                                 MAEVE
                        Oh, God. What the fuck is wrong 
                        with me?

                                 HARRY
                        Stop being so dramatic. 

           Harry takes out his phone and is immediately engrossed. Maeve 
           stares at him, horrified of what she’s done.

           INT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - BURBANK - LATER

           A DEPRESSED Maeve walks into reception at Olive’s office. A 
           ROBOT ASSISTANT greets her with a smiley face screen.

                                 ROBOT ASSISTANT
                        Hello how may I help you?

                                 MAEVE
                        I need to see my sister. Olive 
                        Jensen. Wait, I mean Olive Glass. 

           The robot makes a noise. 

                                 ROBOT ASSISTANT
                        She’s not available at the moment. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Okay, thanks very much. 

           Maeve walks through a pair of glass doors into the office. 
           The Robot Assistant yells after her. 

                                 ROBOT ASSISTANT
                        Stop! Stop!

           Maeve looks back at the robot as if to say “What are you 
           gonna do about it?” And keeps walking.

           EXT. TECH-NO-SPHERE - OLIVE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Maeve walks up to Olive’s glassed-in office and is about to 
           knock on the door when she stops. Inside, Olive is CRYING on 
           Truman’s shoulder. Maeve is confused, what is he doing here? 
           Olive looks up at Maeve and her face falls. She opens the 
           door.
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 OLIVE
                        Maeve, before you say anything--

                                 MAEVE
                        Hey, Truman. I had no idea you were 
                        back from Japan. 

           Truman looks at her, oddly. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on here? Why are you 
                        crying? Are you guys getting a 
                        divorce?

           Olive and Truman look at each other. 

                                 OLIVE
                        Maeve, this isn’t Truman. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Um. What?

           Olive goes to her desk and shows Maeve a SCREEN - which shows 
           Truman at his desk in Japan, on a phone call. Maeve looks at 
           the man standing next to her. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        What the FUCK is happening. Am I in 
                        the Matrix?

                                 “TRUMAN”
                        What’s the Matrix?

                                 MAEVE
                        Come ON you people need to get more 
                        of my pop culture references--

                                 OLIVE
                        Maeve... he’s a robot. He’s like 
                        Harry.

           Maeve sinks into a chair. 

                                 OLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I built him to keep me company 
                        while Truman is away.

                        Is he a... clone?

                                 OLIVE
                        No, no. But he’s essentially the 
                        same person. All the same traits.

                                 MAEVE
                        So when Truman “surprised” you that 
                        time--

                                 OLIVE
                        He was still in Japan.

                                 MAEVE
                        Good GOD.

                                 “TRUMAN” 
                        Nice to meet you, Maeve. 

           Maeve looks at him and then at Olive, angry. 

                                 MAEVE
                        So this is why you created this 
                        technology. Because you’re lonely. 

                                 OLIVE
                        No, no, not entirely. I mean that’s 
                        where the idea came from but it 
                        turned into something larger. 

                                 MAEVE
                        So you used me as a guinea pig to 
                        service your creepy fantasy? 

                                 “TRUMAN”
                        Maeve, this isn’t a “creepy 
                        fantasy.” Olive and Truman wanted 
                        to be together while they’re apart. 

                                 MAEVE
                           (to Olive)
                        Is there one of you in Japan?

           Olive NODS. 

                                 MAEVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my GOD. Your relationship is 
                        fucked up, Olive! Why don’t you 
                        just marry someone who actually 
                        lives here! 

                                 OLIVE
                        Because Truman and I love each 
                        other. And we found a way to make 
                        it work. I know you think that 
                        technology ruins people’s lives 
                        it’s saved ours. 

           This hits Maeve. 
           "BOYFRIEND MATERIAL"            05/20/16

                                 MAEVE
                        Then what are you so upset about if 
                        you’re so “happy” together?

                                 OLIVE
                        My boss saw your data and shut the 
                        program down. I guess he realized 
                        that even when given the power, you 
                        still manage to fuck it up. 

           Maeve’s eyes fill with tears.  

                                 MAEVE
                        You’re right. I’ve turned Harry 
                        into a monster. He’s Hunter 2.0. 

                                 OLIVE
                        You chose to make him that way. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I know. What’s wrong with me? 

                                 OLIVE
                        Nothing is wrong with you. But you 
                        have to decide if you want to spend 
                        your life trying to get the rest of 
                        the world to live the way you 
                        want... or just live.

           There’s a long beat. 

                                 TRUMAN O.S.
                        I vote for “just live,” Maeve!

                                 MAEVE
                           (re: Truman and Olive)
                        I think I could say the same for 
                        you two. 

           Olive looks at Robot Truman and nods. 

                                 OLIVE
                        You’re probably right. Look, 
                        Benjamin’s shutting down production 
                        of the rest of these guys, but I 
                        can probably convince him to let 
                        you keep Harry. I just have to 
                        quote a dead poet or something.

           Maeve looks at Robot Truman, thinking.

           Maeve sits on a bench and dials her phone. Her MOM answers. 

                                 MAEVE’S MOM
                        Maevey?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Maeve’s mom, sitting at her kitchen counter, is near tears.

                                 MAEVE
                        Hi Mama. Do you hate me? 

                                 MAEVE’S MOM
                        Hate you? How could I hate you?

                                 MAEVE
                        Because I haven’t talked to you in 
                        months. I’m a horrible daughter. 

                                 MAEVE’S MOM
                        I’ve missed you. But I could never 
                        hate you. 

           Maeve starts to cry. 

                                 MAEVE
                        You just remind me too much of Dad. 
                        Every time I think of you I think 
                        of him. And it hurts too much to 
                        think of him. 

                                 MAEVE’S MOM
                        I know. Me too. But I like to think 
                        about him, I don’t want to forget. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t want to forget him either. 
                        He would be so disappointed in me, 
                        Mom. I really fucked up. 

                                 MAEVE’S MOM
                        Come on, Maevy. Language. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I screwed up. Badly. I pushed 
                        everyone away who was somewhat 
                        close to me and now I’m lonely and 
                        I’m mad because I’m lonely and I 
                        just hate myself.

                        You may have pushed people away but 
                        that doesn’t mean they won’t come 
                        back to you. Look at me!

           Maeve smiles. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Yeah, you’re right. 

                                 MAEVE’S MOM
                        And I know it’s a cliche mother 
                        thing to say, but... you have to 
                        make yourself happy first. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I don’t really know how to do that. 

                                 MAEVE’S MOM
                        I have no doubt you’ll figure it 
                        out.

           INT. LOS FELIZ MOVIE THEATER - LATER

           Maeve watches “Titanic” on the screen and cries.

           Maeve thumbs through some dusty records. She finds QUEEN and 
           smiles. 

           INT. ITALIAN TAKE OUT RESTAURANT - LATER

           Maeve eats a GARLIC KNOT and nods. Amazing! The waiter’s 
           smiley face screen lights up. Maeve smiles back at it.

           EXT. DOG PARK - LATER

           Maeve plays with a GROUP OF DOGS, who lick her face. A stray 
           follows her around. He looks at her, pleading. She caves.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - LATER

           Maeve, rescue dog in tow, walks down the same street she 
           walks down every day, but she smiles at people walking by 
           her. Most are “plugged in” and ignore her, but some smile 
           back. She looks up at the sky, breathing in the sunshine.

           INT. MAEVE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maeve walks into her apartment, looking more secure and calm 
           than we’ve seen her. She kisses her new dog and let’s him 
           sniff Beauregard. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Beau, I’m sorry but my you would 
                        have done the same thing. 

           Beauregard HISSES at the dog. Maeve looks around her 
           apartment - sees her collection of records and books, things 
           that represent exactly who she is. Harry, still in “Hunter” 
           mode, walks in from the kitchen and glares at her. 

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t you dare walk out on me like 
                        that. Ever. 

           Maeve pulls out her phone and opens the APP. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Who do you think you are? I mean 
                        honestly, Maeve. What do you have 
                        to offer when it comes down to it? 
                        Who are you--

           Maeve presses the RESET button on the app. She looks up, 
           hopeful. Harry looks back at her, somewhat confused. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I’m Harry. 

                                 MAEVE
                        Hi Harry. 

           There’s a long beat. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m sorry, I’m not sure I know who 
                        you are. 

           Maeve smiles and holds out her hand. 

                                 MAEVE
                        I’m Maeve. It’s nice to meet you.
