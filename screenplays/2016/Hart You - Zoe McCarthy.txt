           INT. NAOMI’S STUDIO APARTMENT - PALM SPRINGS - AFTERNOON

           Naomi’s dingy abode hosts a floor-to-ceiling stack of career 
           instructional/reference books, The Easy Way series, with 
           subjects ranging from fortune cookie writing to sea lion 
           taming to dreamcatcher making, etc., a broken lava lamp, a 
           fish-less fish tank, a chunky laptop, and pot paraphernalia. 
           Three posters bring the room together: El Chapo, Janis, and 
           Oprah. 

           NAOMI HART, 32, quixotic and manipulative, but indolent-- 
           loves herself and hates reality, sings along mournfully to 
           her favorite NARCO CORRIDO while stalking her ex boyfriend, 
           MAX KEENER, 35, a hot but futureless musician, on Instagram--
           in every picture Max makes out with a different HOT TWENTY-
           SOMETHING on a different beach in a different country.

                                 NAOMI
                        Con un cuerno de chivo y bazuka en 
                        la nuca volando cabezas al que se 
                        atraviesa...

           SUBTITLED: With an AK and a bazooka taking aim and blowing 
           off the heads of whoever gets in the way...

           Naomi, worked up, TURNS UP THE MUSIC and deletes all of her 
           social media accounts.

           Newly empowered, she grabs the llama-shaped backpack that 
           rests on the floor. 

           CLOSE ON: A NOTE ON THE LLAMA’S FOREHEAD, FOR INSPIRATION, 
           LOVE DAD. 

           Naomi unzips the backpack: It’s an arsenal of every kind of 
           creativity-inspiring-vision-quest-inducing drug imaginable. 

           Naomi pops a pot pop and selects Blackjack: The Easy Way from 
           her library.

           Naomi reads, totally engrossed, when her phone, protected by 
           an ice-cream sandwich-shaped phone case, VIBRATES - Text from 
           Mom -- Where are you?

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. BRANDON’S AND NAOMI’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - EVENING

           The Hart residence is a paradisiacal hippie sty. Small and 
           mostly domesticated animals roam freely beneath finished and 
           unfinished sculptures, floor to ceiling book cases, roach 
           filled ashtrays, and a multicolored cacti garden.
           BRANDON HART, 30, the self-proclaimed “normal one” of his 
           nuclear family, an earnest and reliable trial lawyer, stares 
           anxiously at the post-and-beam ceiling as his mother, JULES 
           HART, 63, a soulful raven-haired sculptress, massages a 
           mountain of moist red clay, and his father, STAN HART, 65, a 
           spry neuropsychopharmacologist, professor and researcher, 
           fiddles with the mini drug lab set up on the coffee table.

                                 BRANDON
                             (checks his watch)
                        This is ridiculous! Naomi’s thirty 
                        minutes late to the family meeting 
                        she called. 

           Jules lights a joint, takes a hit, and passes it to her son - 

                                 JULES
                        Brandon, I know you’re stressed 
                        about getting married and losing 
                        your freedom--

                                 BRANDON
                        Mom, I don’t want “freedom” and, 
                        thanks, but I’ll pass on the 
                        narcotics.

                                 STAN
                        “Narcotics?”

           Stan and Jules share a chortle.

           Stan stabs a vial of serum with a needle, squirts a drop onto 
           a sugar cube, pops it in his mouth, and sets a timer.

                                 BRANDON
                        What are you doing? 

                                 STAN
                        I’ve synthesized a new compound of 
                        lysergic acid diethylamide. 

                                 JULES
                             (off Brandon’s confusion)
                        Daddy’s studying the potential 
                        therapeutic uses of LSD.

           Brandon sighs as Naomi barrels inside carrying a crazily 
           wrapped wedding gift. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hello beautiful family! Sorry, for 
                        the tardiness--I was mastering the 
                        art of blackjack. Pretty sure it’s 
                        my calling.
           Naomi feasts her eyes on Brandon, who rolls his eyes -

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Brandon! My little pinworm!

           Brandon flinches as Naomi dramatically leaps over the coffee 
           table, runs over to him, and pinches his cheeks.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        How ARE you? 

           She tosses the present in his lap. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        That’s your wedding gift. I wrapped 
                        it myself--

                                 BRANDON
                        Naomi, you’re not coming tomorrow. 
                             (off her discomfiture)
                        I’m only here to tell you in 
                        person, in front of witnesses, that 
                        you’re not invited, not welcome, 
                        not wanted, not allowed-- 

                                 NAOMI
                             (prepossessing)
                        Brandon--

                                 BRANDON
                        Tomorrow is the most important day 
                        of my life and I will not let you 
                        ruin it.

                                 NAOMI
                        That’s not fair!

                                 BRANDON
                        Fair?! 
                             (beat)
                        Were you being fair when you hooked 
                        up with my prom date in my bed? Or 
                        when I crashed the car during my 
                        driver’s test because you stowed 
                        away in the trunk and popped out in 
                        the middle of an intersection? Were 
                        you being fair when you switched my 
                        high school graduation speech with 
                        a chapter of Mein Kampf? Or how 
                        about when you gave me a mescaline 
                        cookie AN HOUR BEFORE I TOOK THE 
                        BAR EXAM?! 
                                 STAN
                        Brandon, your father’s a 
                        neuropsychopharmacologist--

                                 JULES
                             (giggles, to Naomi)
                        --Thirty-five years of marriage and  
                        I can’t say it three times fast--

                                 STAN
                        --It’s not surprising your sister 
                        thought a good trip could have a  
                        positive effect on your exam score. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (realizes, to Brandon)
                        That’s why you stopped speaking to 
                        me three-years ago isn’t it?

                                 BRANDON
                        I FAILED THE BAR, NAOMI. I HAD TO 
                        RETAKE IT! MY PERMANENT RECORD IS 
                        PERMANENTLY BESMIRCHED! 

           Naomi considers this.

                                 NAOMI
                        Like Dad said, I truly thought the 
                        cookie would open you up and help 
                        you think creatively. The papers 
                        you wrote in law school were so dry 
                        and repetitive.  

                                 BRANDON
                             (exasperated)
                        They were legal briefs!

           Beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        Mom, Dad, I called this family 
                        meeting so Brandon and I could 
                        clear the air, but he’s obviously 
                        still harboring resentment towards 
                        me from childhood. 

           Stan checks his timer.

                                 BRANDON
                             (sarcastic)
                        You think?
                                 JULES
                             (to Brandon)
                        Sweetie, your sister is doing 
                        everything she can to show you how 
                        much she cares about you.

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank you, Mother.

                                 STAN
                        Son, if you’re interested, I’ve got 
                        some ayahuasca guaranteed to heal 
                        your psychological and spiritual 
                        distress.

                                 BRANDON
                        Pass.

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon, I’ve never once intended 
                        to hurt you. I swear. 
                             (candid)
                        I slept with your prom date because 
                        I thought I might be a lesbian and 
                        she clearly wasn’t into you. Hiding 
                        in the trunk during your driver’s 
                        test was a performance art piece 
                        about society’s dependency on 
                        technology. And I switched your 
                        speech because graduation fell on 
                        Holocaust Remembrance Day and we 
                        must never forget the Holocaust. We 
                        must NEVER forget!  

                                 BRANDON
                        Enough! All of you! I promised 
                        Jessica our wedding day would be a 
                        perfect celebration of our love, 
                        NOT a Naomi special.

           Beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        So, it’s Jessica who doesn’t want 
                        me there?

                                 BRANDON
                        Naomi, DO NOT under ANY 
                        CIRCUMSTANCES show up tomorrow.

           Brandon turns to leave, sees Naomi’s wedding gift, and walks 
           out.

           Naomi’s stung.
           Suddenly, Stan’s face droops and contorts crazily--the drug 
           has taken effect - 

                                 STAN
                        When I die wrap me up like Moo Shu 
                        pork. I want to die like Moo Shu 
                        pork. 

           Naomi pockets two acid cubes and puts them in her purse.

           INT. BRIDE’S COTTAGE - GOLF RESORT - SAME

           Naomi, clutching the wedding present, knocks on the door. 

           JESSICA BERRI, 27, a pretty, crane fly-shaped blonde with 
           luxury taste buds, who’s been throwing up, answers - 

                                 JESSICA
                        ...Naomi? 

                                 NAOMI
                        You look more like Tara Reid 
                        seventeen years ago every day.

           Naomi tosses Jessica the wedding gift, waltzes into the 
           wedding cottage, and marvels at its size and splendor. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        This is tits. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Naomi, this isn’t a good time.

           Jessica runs into the bathroom and PUKES HER GUTS OUT as 
           Naomi helps herself to a glass of wine from an open bottle -

                                 NAOMI
                        ...Is that look-hot-in-your-wedding-
                        dress retching or contagious 
                        retching?

           Naomi spots Kleenex wads, relationship self-help books, and 
           Jessica’s open journal on the table--the ink’s still wet.

           Naomi picks up the journal--there’s a Brandon Pros and Cons 
           list...

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Pro - Treats me like a princess. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s nice. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Con - When he’s inside me I think 
                        about Lil Wayne. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s alarming... And unexpected.

           Jessica comes outside and bursts into tears.

                                 JESSICA
                        I love Brandon, okay, Naomi?! I do. 
                        Just... More in the snuggle on the 
                        couch and eat grilled cheese kind 
                        of way... Not the throw me over the 
                        table and--

                                 NAOMI
                        I get it... Max, my shit stain ex, 
                        and I reenacted the hotel sex scene 
                        from Shame north of thirty-seven 
                        times. 

                                 JESSICA
                        --I just kept thinking with a 
                        diamond ring I’d be happy, with the 
                        perfect wedding I’d be happy, with 
                        rose gold Apple products I’d be 
                        happy--I knew he had massive 
                        student loans--I just--I grew up 
                        very poor and I thought--I thought 
                        all this...

           She gesticulates re: the fancy wedding cottage - 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Would make me happy...  
                             (beat)
                        Brandon’s such a good guy--I’d be 
                        crazy not to love him.

                                 NAOMI
                        But, you don’t. 

           Jessica shakes her head, no. 

           Silence.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Then you have to call off the 
                        wedding.  

                                 JESSICA
                        I can’t! It’s too late! I could 
                        never face everyone--and then 
                        there’s the honeymoon... Oh God...
           Jessica runs back into the bathroom and PUKES.

           Naomi runs in and holds her hair back -

                                 NAOMI
                        What honeymoon? 

                                 JESSICA
                        The One, the dating site where 
                        Brandon and I met, had an essay 
                        contest for their best success 
                        story.

           Jessica lies down on the cold bathroom tile weakly - 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Brandon won an all expenses paid, 
                        luxury honeymoon to the Amalfi 
                        Coast and two-hundred fifty 
                        thousand dollars in prize money--

                                 NAOMI
                        TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND 
                        DOLLARS?! 
                             (to herself, incredulous)
                        Am I the only one not getting rich 
                        without any talent or effort?

                                 JESSICA
                        If I marry him.

           Beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        That’s a big, fat pickle.

                                 JESSICA
                        I wish I could just... put everyone 
                        on another planet and talk to 
                        Brandon--be honest with him without 
                        everyone else judging me.

           Naomi thinks for a moment and pockets the journal - 

                                 NAOMI
                        You could. You can. You will. I’ll 
                        handle it. I promise.  
           INT. GROOM’S COTTAGE - GOLF RESORT - PALM SPRINGS - NIGHT 

           Brandon pours two whiskeys while JAKE TANOUYE, 30, a beefy 
           Japanese-American photographer with evocative tattoos and 
           wavy shoulder-length hair, takes pictures of the pre-
           honeymoon swag spread, which consists of matching his and 
           hers suitcases, cozy airplane sweat suits, heart-shaped neck 
           pillows, and leather-bound passport wallets all branded with 
           The One logo.

                                 BRANDON
                        Dude, thank you so much for being 
                        my best man and photographer. 

                                 JAKE
                        Of course, dude.

           Brandon jumps in the shot and grabs the passports - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Get one of me holding our 
                        passports!

           Jake shoots Brandon making a doofy face. 

                                 JAKE
                        Gimme more Travis Scott, less 
                        Brendan Dassey.

           Brandon puffs his chest and snarls his upper lip when his 
           phone VIBRATES - Marissa Tremblay calling.

                                 BRANDON
                        It’s the woman from The One. 

                                 JAKE
                        Answer it! Maybe she’s throwing in 
                        a brand new car.

           Brandon answers and WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from the wedding 
           cottage to The One offices in New York City.

                                 BRANDON
                        Hi, Marissa. What’s up?

           MARISSA TREMBLAY, 40, intense and impatient, stands next to 
           her romantic and understated underling, RACHEL PUTNAM, 28, 
           West Indian with an infectious British accent. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Brandon, you have myself and my 
                        associate, Rachel Putnam. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        Rachel will be on the ground with 
                        you in Positano--she’s running 
                        point on this project.

                                 BRANDON
                        Hi, Rachel. Nice to meet you!

                                 RACHEL 
                        You too, Brandon! 

                                 JAKE
                             (re: Rachel’s accent)
                        She sounds hot, dude. Hook a 
                        brother up.

           Brandon smiles and shushes Jake.

                                 RACHEL
                        Alright then, I know you have loads 
                        to think about the night before 
                        your wedding, but I need to  
                        quickly remind you to tell your 
                        photographer to e-mail us your 
                        wedding pictures ASAP so we can 
                        begin selecting which ones we’ll be 
                        wanting to upload to our site for 
                        the testimonial.  

           Brandon looks at Jake who give him a thumbs up.

                                 BRANDON
                        He’s right here. No problem.

                                 RACHEL 
                        Okay then! We’ll let you go. Best 
                        of luck tomorrow! Cheers!

                                 BRANDON
                        Cheers back at you, m’lady!

           Jake gives Brandon a look, oof.

                                 MARISSA 
                        One more thing, Brandon. Please 
                        keep in mind this is a once-in-a-
                        lifetime opportunity for you and 
                        Jessica, but it’s a make or break 
                        promotion for The One.

                                 BRANDON
                        Absolutely. And thank you both--

           Marissa hangs up.
                                 JAKE
                        I’m so pumped for you, dude.

                                 BRANDON
                             (grins, vengeful)
                        Sure makes high school seem far 
                        away.

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Jefferson Airplane’s White Rabbit plays as Naomi, in the 
           kitchen/living room, stirs a large stainless steel stock pot 
           of a dark-colored brew.

           Naomi tastes a spoonful of the brew, adds an entire box of 
           sugar, tastes again, grabs a five ounce package of magic 
           mushrooms from her llama backpack, empties its contents into 
           the pot, and stirs. 

           Naomi hums along until she catches her reflection in the 
           broth and starts to sing - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Remember what the dormouse said:
                        Feed your head. Feed your head.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - 200 PERSON WEDDING ON THE GREEN WITH A 
           VIEW OF THE SAN JACINTO MOUNTAINS - BEFORE ARRIVALS - DAY

           Naomi, wearing a ripped denim and lace trench, suede thigh-
           high boots, a floppy, oversized feathered hat, and powder 
           blue heart-shaped sunglasses walks up to the wedding ceremony 
           entrance, pours out the glass container of Brandon’s and 
           Jessica’s welcome cocktail, and replaces it with her vat of 
           mushroom infused brew.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER (O.S.)
                        Hey! Stop! What are you doing?! 

           Naomi nearly spills the brew, but steadies the pot, finishes 
           pouring, and faces Brandon’s and Jessica’s WEDDING PLANNER.

                                 NAOMI
                        There was a centipede in the 
                        original batch of the welcome 
                        cocktail. I had the kitchen whip up 
                        a new one.  

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        Ew! Thank goodness you caught that.

           The wedding planner pours a glass and downs it.
                                 NAOMI
                             (moralistic)
                        There’s more... This alcoholic 
                        beverage was completely unattended, 
                        and there will be children at this 
                        wedding...!

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        You’re so right! I’ll get a server 
                        all over it, immediately.

           Naomi nods, approvingly.

                                 NAOMI
                        How we doing on time?

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        Guests should be arriving in five. 
                        Go time’s in thirty. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Groovy.

           CHYRON: THIRTY MINUTES LATER.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE WEDDING - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           PROCESSIONAL MUSIC SWELLS indicating the ceremony is about to 
           begin.

           Jake snaps pictures as USHERS seat Jules, Stan, and JESSICA’S 
           PARENTS. 

           Brandon takes his place at the altar, followed by a no-
           nonsense female JUDGE/OFFICIANT, followed by a gorgeous, but 
           mid-panic attack, Jessica. 

           The officiant looks out into the crowd:

           BACK TO THE ALTAR - 

                                 OFFICIANT
                        We good to go or...?

           The crowd is beginning to look like a mosh pit at Woodstock.

           WE JUMP AROUND to the guests’ points of view: The white-rose-
           covered wedding arch drips and melts, colors swirl, the 
           mountains pulsate, and people LAUGH AND CRY AND SPEAK FREELY 
           AND FERVENTLY ABOUT LOVE WHEN - 

           Brandon is horribly confused as suddenly JESSICA PUKES AGAIN 
           ALL OVER HERSELF - 
                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica, what’s wrong? 

                                 JESSICA
                        Brandon...

                                 BRANDON
                        Are you sick or is it nerves?

                                 JESSICA
                        Brandon--

                                 BRANDON
                        WHAT?!

                                 JESSICA
                        Brandon, I can’t marry you.  
                             (tears)
                        I’m not in love with you.

           Brandon’s heart shatters. 

           GUESTS’ POV: The sky changes colors and textures. People 
           start to kiss and hug and dance--their hearts full of 
           psychedelic love.

           Jessica runs down the aisle, stumbles over the train of her 
           dress, wildly and kicks off her shoes--they go flying BUT 
           NOBODY IN THE CROWD NOTICES OR CARES. 

           Brandon quickly looks around for Naomi but can’t find her.

           FROM THE BACK - 

           From where she has been hiding, Naomi watches while playing 
           blackjack on her phone. She hits with thirteen, gets a six, 
           and - 

           YOU’RE A WINNER flashes on the phone screen as five-hundred 
           “dollars” is added to her piggy bank. 

           Naomi grins as she looks up to see Jessica race past her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re welcome.

           Brandon snaps out of shock and runs after Jessica - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica, wait!

           Jessica hops into a golf cart and rides across the green. 
                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        JESSICA! COME BACK! PLEASE!

           Brandon jacks a golf cart and rides after her plowing through 
           mid-game GOLFERS.   

           BACK AT THE ALTAR - 

                                 JAKE
                        The fuck’s happening?!

           Suddenly, Jake spots Naomi slinking out through the back - 

           FRONT ROW - 

                                 JULES
                        I’m so glad Naomi had nothing to do 
                        with this. Could you imagine? 

                                 STAN
                             (shudders, knowingly)
                        I could imagine...

           INT. BRIDE’S COTTAGE - A BIT LATER

           Jessica struggles to get out of her soiled wedding dress when 
           Brandon barges inside. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica, stop! Talk to me!

                                 JESSICA
                        Don’t yell at me, Brandon. This is 
                        hard for me too.

                                 BRANDON
                        Hard for you? Hard for YOU?! 

                                 JESSICA
                        Brandon, you’re amazing. You’re the 
                        best boyfriend I’ve ever had.

                                 BRANDON
                        Is there another guy?

                                 JESSICA
                        No. No! Of course not. I just... I 
                        don’t... 
                             (sigh)
                        We’ve never reenacted any of the 
                        sex scenes from Shame.

           Beat.
                                 BRANDON
                        Shame?... That’s Naomi’s favorite 
                        movie...

                                 JESSICA
                        Brandon, you look crazy.

                                 BRANDON
                        She got to you didn’t she? 
                             (realizes)
                        She drugged our entire wedding, 
                        DIDN’T SHE?! THAT SHIT EATING--

           Jake comes in carrying a feisty Naomi with bloodshot eyes - 

                                 JAKE
                        Look who I found looking like 
                        Cookie Lyon fucked Timothy Leary.

                                 NAOMI
                             (thinks about it)
                        Thank you.

           Brandon grabs a golf club so tightly he starts shaking - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I told you to stay away from my 
                        wedding!

                                 NAOMI
                        I know, but that hurt my feelings. 

           Brandon raises the club over his head, apoplectic. 

                                 BRANDON
                        DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF, NAOMI? 

                                 JAKE
                        Dude, you can’t hit a girl.

                                 BRANDON
                        She’s not a girl! She’s the devil!

           Jessica still can’t get out of her dress. 

                                 JESSICA
                             (uncomfortable, to Jake)
                        Can you unzip me? I can’t breathe.

           Brandon points the golf club at Jake - 

                                 BRANDON
                        No, Jake! Do not unzip her! I was 
                        supposed to unzip her! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRANDON (CONT'D)
                             (to Jessica, quiet, sad)
                        I was supposed to unzip you.

           Jessica finally tears off her dress.

                                 JESSICA
                        I’m truly sorry, Brandon. You did 
                        nothing wrong. 

           Brandon, baffled, throws his hands up as Jessica throws on 
           sweats and heads for the door. 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        And don’t blame Naomi--without her 
                        help we’d be married and you’d 
                        never know how deeply I don’t love 
                        you.

           Brandon SMASHES A LAMP with the golf club.

                          BRANDON
                                                          JAKE
           GODDAMNIT!
                                              HOLY SHIT!

                                 NAOMI
                             (to Jessica, quiet)
                        This is where you give the ring 
                        back.

           Naomi yanks the ring off of Jessica’s finger - 

           Jessica leaves.

                                 JAKE
                        That just happened... 

           Naomi tries on the ring--it doesn’t fit. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica loved me. You poisoned her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        No, Brandon. She didn’t.

           Naomi pulls Jessica’s journal out of her bag and hands it to 
           Brandon - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Read this.

           Brandon’s heart beats out of his chest which turns into a 
           THUMPING BASS LINE.
           INT. MEAT WAVE - TABLE/LAP DANCE AREA - LATER

           Naomi and Jake sit next to a wasted Brandon who chugs from a 
           whiskey bottle and pours his heart out to the TWO STRIPPERS 
           giving him a lap dance - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I did everything for Jessica. I 
                        dressed how she wanted. I combed my 
                        hair how she wanted. 
                             (messes up his hair)
                        I made love to her how she wanted--
                        I personally prefer eye contact 
                        during sex.

                                 STRIPPER 1
                        That shit is fucked up! Like fucked 
                        up!

                                 STRIPPER 2
                        Want some molly?

                                 BRANDON
                        You’re not listening! Her name was 
                        Jessica. JESSSSIIICAAAA!

           Brandon gets up, stumbles, and falls--Jake and Naomi rush to 
           catch him before he face plants. 

           The strippers cross their arms, indignant. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Jake, pay them. 

           Jake glares at Naomi and gives the strippers all his cash.

           The strippers trot off.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                             (to Jake)
                        Is it true about the honeymoon? 

                                 JAKE
                             (sadly)
                        And the two-fifty k? Yup. 

                                 BRANDON
                        My ass is vibrating...

           Brandon reaches his hand towards the back of his pants - 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        It’s not the worst feeling in the 
                        world...
                                 JAKE
                        Sucks he has to cancel. They were 
                        supposed to leave tomorrow.

                                 NAOMI
                        Tomorrow?!

           Brandon pulls out his VIBRATING phone and stares at it - 

                                 BRANDON
                             (laughs)
                        It’s my phone. 
                             (answers)
                        Hello phone.

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from the club to Rachel’s office where 
           Rachel, slumped at her desk, dour, works on a satirical 
           comic, The Misadventures of Corporate Girl. 

           CLOSE ON: A SKETCH OF CORPORATE GIRL VS. EXPECTATIONS -- 
           Corporate Girl, who looks a lot like Rachel, is anchored to 
           the ocean floor by her laptop, drowning, while an oblivious 
           couple canoodles above her in a boat.

                                 RACHEL
                        Brandon, I know it’s your wedding 
                        night but your photographer never 
                        sent us your wedding pictures. 

           Brandon gets up - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Hold on, Rachel. I can’t really 
                        hear you. I’m at a strip club.

                                 NAOMI
                        Who’s Rachel? Did Brandon have a 
                        piece on the side??

                                 JAKE
                        She’s one of the peeps from The 
                        One. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Brandon, is everything okay?

                                 BRANDON
                             (voice cracking)
                        Rachel, everything is so not okay--

           Naomi grabs the phone and shoves Brandon face first into the 
           crotch of a sweaty STRIPPER - 
                                 NAOMI
                        Because everything’s great!

                                 RACHEL
                        Sorry, who’s this?

                                 JAKE
                        What are you doing?!

                                 NAOMI
                             (a la Jessica)
                        It’s Jessica! I just wanted to tell 
                        you how excited I am about the 
                        trip! 

           Rachel puts the finishing touches on Corporate Girl’s 
           lifeless eyes. 

           INT. BRIDE’S COTTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A belligerent Brandon’s in bed swilling champagne, scarfing 
           his wedding cake, and opening his presents.

           Naomi stands in front of the mirror in a towel. She rings out 
           her wet hair and rifles through a bag of freshly purchased 
           drug store beauty products. 

           Jake paces around the room, stressed. 

                                 JAKE
                        This is the worst idea of all time. 
                        You look about as much like Jessica 
                        as I look like The Rock. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Nobody on those dating sites looks 
                        like their pictures. That’s the 
                        most genius part. 

           Naomi grabs scissors and begins hacking off her long hair. 

                                 JAKE
                        No one will ever believe you and 
                        Brandon are newlyweds!

           Naomi peeks at her naked body under the towel - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Why not? I’m a solid eight and a 
                        half. 

                                 JAKE
                        He hates you!
                                 NAOMI
                        He won’t hate me when he’s cashing 
                        the check for two-hundred and fift--

           Brandon sits up in bed clutching Jake’s gift - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Dude, you got me a Vitamix?!

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah, buddy. I did. 

           Naomi sprays an obscene amount of Sun In into her hair.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Naomi, think this through. You’d 
                        both be committing fraud. Do you 
                        understand what that means?  

                                 NAOMI
                        I understand that my brother went 
                        into debt trying to make someone 
                        love him. I also understand what it 
                        feels like to be completely and 
                        utterly heartbroken. Thirdly, I 
                        understand, that without a miracle, 
                        Brandon will spend the rest of this 
                        decade underwater and hating 
                        himself for it.

           Jake sighs, knowing she’s right, but deeply uncomfortable. 

                                 JAKE
                        Okay, but, it’s not that simple. 
                        The honeymoon’s a publicity stunt 
                        for the website--the whole thing’s 
                        going to be documented on social 
                        media. 

                                 NAOMI
                        So? I’m not on social media. I 
                        can’t stand seeing pictures of my 
                        ass hat ex with his tongue down all 
                        his children’s throats. 
                             (off Jake’s horror)
                        Max’s teenage mutant pussy posse.

                                 JAKE
                        The point is: I was supposed to 
                        send them the wedding pictures so 
                        they could post the ones they 
                        liked, but since there was no 
                        wedding, there are no pictures. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAKE (CONT'D)
                        All I have are shots before the 
                        ceremony and the ones my assistant 
                        took of the real Jessica getting 
                        ready. 

           Naomi drops her towel and turns on the shower - 

                                 NAOMI
                        You have a camera though, right?

           Jake stares at her, nonplussed as Brandon makes a champagne 
           and wedding cake smoothie, chugs it, and BURPS.

                                 BRANDON
                        I’m so glad we went with red 
                        velvet.

           INT. BRIDE’S COTTAGE - AN HOUR LATER

           A ludicrous looking Jessica-esque Naomi emerges from the 
           bathroom stuffed into Jessica’s ripped wedding dress and 
           sporting a blonde-orange bob. The ring’s on her pinky.

           Bleary-eyed Brandon stares at her and falls out of bed - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica?

                                 NAOMI
                             (to Jake)
                        See!

           RE-CREATING THE WEDDING PHOTO SHOOT MONTAGE SHOT BY JAKE:

           OUTSIDE ALL OVER THE HOTEL: Brandon and Naomi pose for all 
           kinds of cuddly couple shots--Brandon looks drunker and more 
           miserable in each one. 

           HOTEL BAR: Naomi leads Brandon into the packed space and 
           dances with him to re-create their reception. She leads and 
           he falls all over her.

           HOTEL RESTAURANT: Naomi takes a centerpiece from a table and 
           “throws the bouquet” into the crowd. PATRONS look confused. 

           HOTEL LOBBY: Brandon and Naomi pose with “THEIR PARENTS.” 
           Afterwards, Naomi makes Jake pay them. He has no cash left, 
           so he Venmos. 

           HOTEL KITCHEN: Jake shoots a close shot of Brandon and Naomi 
           cutting a not white cake. From the shot you can’t tell 
           they’re standing in a hectic kitchen. Brandon, nodding off, 
           nearly slices Naomi’s finger off. 
           ABANDONED WEDDING ARCH: THE KISS!... Naomi tries to get 
           Brandon to dip her, but he drops her. Naomi tries to dip him, 
           but he’s too heavy. Naomi attempts to give him a regular 
           kiss, but she gags and spits. Finally, she pulls his eyes 
           open and pecks him on the cheek. 

           EXT. BRIDE’S COTTAGE - CRACK OF DAWN

           Naomi, wearing Jessica’s The One travel outfit, struggles to 
           strap a trying-to-pass-out Brandon, wearing his matching 
           travel outfit, into Jake’s car. 

           Jake, drained, hops in the driver’s seat and starts the car - 

                                 JAKE
                        The pictures are sent. I bccd you. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Baller. 

           Jake drives and checks on Brandon in the rearview mirror - 

                                 JAKE
                        Naomi, you’re fucked up, but your 
                        heart’s in the right place.

                                 NAOMI
                        Tell Brandon that if he wakes up 
                        and tries to kill me.

           INT. RACHEL’S TEASPOON OF AN APARTMENT - NYC - SAME

           Rachel clicks through Jake’s pictures, horrified. 

           She clicks out and begins drafting a letter of resignation 
           when her phone BUZZES - text from Mom - I need money.

           Rachel sighs and gets back to work.

           INT. PALM SPRINGS AIRPORT - SECURITY LINE - MORNING

           Naomi, wearing both neck pillows, wheels their matching 
           suitcases up to the security line while Jake struggles to 
           escort still drunk, but now obstreperous Brandon.

           Brandon sees a GROUP OF HOT GIRLS unloading their stuff into 
           security trays and lunges at one them that bears a slight 
           resemblance to Jessica - 
                                 BRANDON
                        You’re a little lying succubus, 
                        aren’t you? AREN’T YOU?!

           The girls jump, startled. 

                                 NOT JESSICA
                        Do they even allow homeless people 
                        in the airport?

                                 BRANDON
                        I’m gonna be homeless cause of YOU.

           Jake picks up Brandon and carries him away from the girls. 

                                 JAKE
                             (to Brandon)
                        Dude, you gotta calm down. You’re 
                        gonna get arrested. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica’d love me if I were behind 
                        bars. She’d think I’m a badass... 

                                 NAOMI
                        No, she’d think you’re a dumbass.

           Brandon grunts and hurls his body around the security line as 
           Jake restrains him.

                                 BRANDON
                        Zip it, Naomi! Nobody loves you 
                        either.

           A crabby TSA AGENT approaches - 

                                 TSA AGENT
                        If he ain’t sober he ain’t gettin’ 
                        on the plane.

           Naomi digs in her purse and goes for the drug dealer shake - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Would a fifteen dollar gift card to 
                        Panera Bread change your mind?

           The TSA agent smiles like she’s going to accept, but - 

                                 TSA AGENT
                        Security!

           A SECURITY GUARD thunders over to Naomi, who quickly 
           retreats, falling into an OLD WOMAN IN A WHEEL CHAIR. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Watch where you’re walking! Er, 
                        wheeling! 
                             (lightbulb)
                        Ohmygod.

           Naomi sweetly wheels the old woman towards the food court.

           Jake, now giving Brandon a piggy-back ride, runs after Naomi - 

                                 JAKE
                        Naomi, I agreed to the honeymoon. I 
                        did not agree to kidnapping an old 
                        woman!

                                 BRANDON
                             (mopey)
                        --I was supposed to be on MY 
                        honeymoon--

           Brandon’s head falls -- he passes out on Jake’s back.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                             (flirty, to Jake)
                        Everything hurts, but it still 
                        works.

           Jake grimaces.

                                 NAOMI
                        Jake, I need you to get me 
                        something from the car... 

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. PALM SPRINGS AIRPORT - SECURITY LINE - MOMENTS LATER

           Naomi pushes a snoring, out cold Brandon, in the wheelchair, 
           through a different security line. 

           We PAN TO the old woman who is now seated at Panera Bread 
           with a killer soup and salad combo and... Naomi’s llama drug 
           backpack from which she is sampling.

           Jake watches Naomi get further and further away as he looks 
           more and more anxious. 

           INT. PALM SPRINGS AIRPORT - BOARDING AREA - AN HOUR LATER

           Naomi wheels a now drooling and mouth-hanging-open Brandon to 
           the gate and hands the petite AIRLINE EMPLOYEE their 
           passports. 
                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        Ma’am, could you please wake your 
                        companion before boarding?

                                 NAOMI
                        My husband’s um... How do I put 
                        this... He’s a Stephen Hawking 
                        situation. This is as awake as he 
                        gets... We’re actually on the way 
                        to Europe to see a specialist.

           The airline employee nods understandingly, but freezes when 
           she looks at Jessica’s passport and then back at Naomi - 

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        Ms. Berri, what year were you born?

                                 NAOMI
                        Nineteen... eighty... eight...?

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        And your middle name?

           Naomi sweats, looks around, and SNEEZES all over the 
           employee, who drops the passport, disgusted.

           Naomi hands the passport back to the employee. CLOSE ON: 
           JESSICA MARIE BERRI.

                                 NAOMI
                        Marie.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MID-FLIGHT - DAY

           Naomi and Brandon are seated in first class. Naomi’s 
           reclined, watching Shame, playing blackjack on her phone -- 
           her piggy bank’s now pleasantly plump, and feasting on 
           lobster when Brandon wakes up, hungover and addled - 

                                 BRANDON
                        What the...? How did...?

           Naomi sweetly hands him her chocolate soufflé - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Before you overreact, I promise I 
                        have everything under control. 
                             (signals the FLIGHT 
                              ATTENDANT)
                        Top me off, Toots. 

           The flight attendant refills Naomi’s champagne glass as 
           Brandon rubs his eyes - 
                                 BRANDON
                        Is this first class?

           Naomi throws the bubbles back - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hard to believe you were gonna 
                        throw this opportunity away, huh?

           Naomi belches delicately. 

                                 BRANDON
                        What opportunity? 
                             (omg)
                        You didn’t. 
                             (laughs)
                        You couldn’t. 
                             (nauseous)
                        There’s no way-- 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’ve thought it all through. I’ve 
                        weighed the Pros and Cons... 
                             (realizes, off his snarl)
                        Sorry, poor word choice. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Poor LIFE choice! Naomi, this is 
                        insane!

                                 NAOMI
                        What’s insane is bankrupting 
                        yourself cause girls like Jessica 
                        wouldn’t fuck you in high school. 
                             (sighs)
                        Hardly an original narrative. 
                             (off his outrage)
                        Brandon, your soufflé’s getting 
                        cold. 

           Brandon, face empurpled, starts to choke Naomi. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Brandon, you’re in debt! If you 
                        have a better plan to save yourself 
                        I’ll get off this plane right now! 
                        Er, when we land!

           Brandon releases Naomi - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Who told you I’m in debt? 
                                 NAOMI
                        Mom... You stopped speaking to me 
                        three years ago, but I asked about 
                        you every day. Okay, week. Fine, 
                        month.

                                 BRANDON
                        Really?

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes. 
                             (sincere)
                        I love you Brandon. I wish you’d 
                        believe it. 

           Silence.

           Brandon stares at Naomi’s laptop--frozen Michael Fassbender 
           is mid doggy-style. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I just realized why Shame’s your 
                        favorite movie. 
                             (off her curiosity)
                        Handsome and successful brother 
                        ruins his life when he moves in 
                        with his sister...

           Naomi smirks. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You have the rest of the flight to 
                        brief me on your relationship with 
                        Jessica. Spare no detail or we both 
                        go to jail. 
                             (re: her transformation)
                        Obviously, I’ve knocked the Tara 
                        Reid circa ninety-nine look out of 
                        the park.

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica looks nothing like Tara 
                        Reid now or ever. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Are you familiar with the American 
                        Pie franchise? She’s the spitting 
                        image!

                                 BRANDON
                        Is not!
                                 NAOMI
                        Is too times infinity times squared 
                        infinity to the power of infinity 
                        sucking infinity’s dick.

           Brandon squirms.

           Naomi resumes her game of blackjack. She has eleven, the hint 
           pops up instructing her to hit, she hits, and gets a nine, 
           which gives her twenty -- YOU’RE A WINNER flashes onscreen. 

           Naomi pumps her fist and reaches for Brandon’s cold soufflé.

           EXT. AMALFI COAST - ESTABLISHING

           Picturesque beaches. Quaint fishing villages. Resplendent 
           villas. Lush lemon groves. Terraced vineyards. SEXY.

           WE FLY ABOVE THE RUGGED CLIFFTOPS, and, buttressed by mother 
           nature, with a view of the Mediterranean, is an enchanting 
           tenth century aristocrat’s palace turned luxury hotel, THE 
           BLUE HORIZON. 

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - LOBBY - POSITANO - NIGHT

           Rachel sketches CORPORATE GIRL VS. THE BOSS while she’s on 
           the phone with an irate Marissa. 

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from Rachel, being burnt to a crisp by 
           a fire-breathing dragon in a blazer in her comic, to Marissa, 
           on a headset, slaying her five am NYC spin class and flipping 
           through the Brandon/Naomi wedding photo shoot on her phone - 

                                 MARISSA
                        These are the ugliest wedding 
                        pictures I’ve ever seen! Brandon is 
                        clearly inebriated and Jessica 
                        looks like she just placed last in 
                        a cartel sponsored beauty pageant!

           Beat.

                                 RACHEL
                        Candidly, I’m equally baffled. I’ve 
                        never seen a bride gain weight for 
                        her wedding. 

                                 MARISSA
                        “Candidly,” if this promotion for 
                        The One tanks your promotion here 
                        tanks.  
                                 RACHEL
                        I’ll give Brandon and Jessica the 
                        business as soon as they arrive. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Rachel, you picked this couple. Now 
                        get me pictures brimming with so 
                        much love and happiness that sad 
                        single people will wonder which way 
                        to drag the blade across their 
                        wrists... 
                             (cheerful)
                        And then sign up for The One. 

           Marissa hangs up as Corporate Girl’s body turns to dust.

           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandon and Naomi, jet-lagged and cranky, get out of a black 
           town car whisper-bickering - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I don’t need to sleep on it. I’m 
                        telling Rachel the truth as soon as 
                        I see her.

           A BELLMAN whisks their luggage onto a cart. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon, do you know what life 
                        looks like without risk?

                                 BRANDON
                        If mom had used protection thirty-
                        two years ago I would.

           Naomi flips Brandon off and they walk into the lobby - 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re insufferable. 

                                 BRANDON
                        You’re pathological. 

           Rachel approaches, ready to lay down the law, but - 

                                 RACHEL
                        You made it!

           Naomi looks at Brandon - don’t fuck this up. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m Rachel. 
           Brandon stares at Rachel, whoa she’s cute. 

                                 BRANDON
                        You are?

                                 NAOMI
                        Great to meet you, Rachel! I’m 
                        Jessica, and this here is Brandon.

           Naomi jabs a drooling Brandon in the ribs - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        My husband. 

           Brandon flinches. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Guess I’m still getting used to the 
                        new title. Feels a bit creepy. 

           Naomi glares at Brandon. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay, then. First order of 
                        business. We got your wedding 
                        pictures--

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh God! Do I look hideous? 
                             (pathetic)
                        I got so overwhelmed with all the 
                        wedding prep I put on twenty 
                        pounds. Can you tell? I’ve been 
                        really beating myself up about it.

           Brandon stares at Naomi - holy shit. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (guilty)
                        Nobody could tell... You were a 
                        beautiful bride!

                                 BRANDON
                        --It’s, uh, true... wife--

                                 NAOMI
                             (to Rachel)
                        I don’t know, was I? You didn’t 
                        congratulate us upon arrival. My 
                        appearance didn’t disappoint you, 
                        did it? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Of course not!
                                 NAOMI
                        Sorry, to be a girl about it, but 
                        then again, society puts an awful 
                        lotta pressure on us girls to, you 
                        know, find The One. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (awkward laugh)
                        I see what you did there. 

                                 BRANDON
                             (to Rachel)
                        So, you’re single?

                          RACHEL
                                                          NAOMI
           Correct. 
                                              Brandon!

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                             (to Rachel)
                        Sorry. 
                             (to Naomi)
                        Can I see our wedding pictures? 

                                 NAOMI
                        We’ll, uh, look at them later, 
                        Peanut--when we’re in a self-
                        accepting sex haze! 

           Rachel blushes as Brandon pukes in his mouth. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Rachel, do you have any other 
                        questions? Or may we go up to the 
                        room and urinate? 
                             (sweetly)
                        It was an awfully long flight. 

           Rachel stares at Naomi, dizzy.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           A stunned Naomi and Brandon burst inside their epic love nest 
           complete with a fireplace, a private terrace with a panoramic 
           view, jacuzzi, and outdoor shower, a Cal King bed covered 
           with rose petals, a chocolate-dipped fruit arrangement, 
           champagne, a multi-person bathtub in the center of the room, 
           and a hundred flickering votive candles.    

                                 NAOMI
                        Wow! I would totes open a sweatshop 
                        to maintain this lifestyle.
           Naomi somersaults onto the bed - 

                                 BRANDON
                             (barely audible)
                        Jessica would’ve loved this. 

                                 NAOMI
                        That’s on her, little brother. SHE 
                        dumped YOU. Remember?

                                 BRANDON
                        Yes, Naomi. I remember. 

           Naomi draws herself a bath - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Close your eyes. 

                                 BRANDON
                        What? Why?

           Naomi disrobes. 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Oh God! 

           Brandon whips around frantically and faces the wall as Naomi 
           squeezes the entire tube of bubble bath into the tub. 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Can we have an actual conversation?

                                 NAOMI
                        Always.

           Brandon sits and stares out the window - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Brandon, your entire life is a 
                        reaction to your being ashamed of 
                        your perceived unconventional 
                        upbringing. 
                             (off Brandon’s glower)
                        It’s fine. You don’t have to say 
                        “touché.”

           Brandon turns to face his sister. Her body is concealed by an 
           igloo of bubbles - 

                                 BRANDON
                        You know what, forget it. 

           Brandon starts for the balcony when Naomi beans him in the 
           head with a perfectly rolled towel. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Hey! 

                                 BRANDON
                        What?!

                                 NAOMI
                        Stop punishing yourself for not 
                        being what you’re not and start 
                        loving yourself for being what you 
                        are.

                                 BRANDON
                             (yells)
                        What I am is heartbroken and on my 
                        honeymoon with my sister!

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

           Brandon SNORES as Naomi, wide awake, sneaks out of the suite. 

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - LOBBY BAR - LATE NIGHT

           Naomi, playing blackjack on her phone, wins again and again, 
           her piggy bank BURSTS and YOU’RE A HIGH ROLLER flashes across 
           the screen. 

           She grins, drains a scotch, and waves over the BARTENDER -

                                 NAOMI
                        Kind Sir, might you know where a 
                        little lady could find a super 
                        swank casino around these parts? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        You feeling lucky? 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m feeling ready.

                                 BARTENDER
                        The best casino in Amalfi’s on the 
                        water.

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m listening...

           EXT. PORT OF POSITANO - LATER

           Naomi, on the dock, stares a gleaming eighty-foot Riva super 
           yacht. 
           She checks her bank statement on her phone -- there’s two 
           thousand and seventeen dollars in it.

           She takes a deep breath, and marches toward it.

           INT./EXT. YACHT - PORT OF POSITANO - CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Naomi, clutching her entire savings in chips, is mesmerized 
           by her opulent surroundings. Deeply insecure, she forces 
           herself to smile and make eye contact with all of the 
           besotted, moneyed GAMBLERS on the floor, but gets distracted 
           by the WAITERS carrying trays of caviar jars and champagne.

           She scoops a few jars of caviar into her bag, and sits down 
           at a blackjack table with THREE PLAYERS - 

                                 NAOMI
                             (”overconfident”)
                        What’s the buy-in please? 

                                 DEALER
                        Five-thousand. 

           Naomi ejects herself from her seat and heads towards the 
           opposite and less populated side of the room. 

           She sits down at an empty table and smiles at the dealer - 

                                 NAOMI
                             (meek)
                        What’s the buy-in please? 

                                 DEALER
                        Two hundred. 

           Naomi places her chips in front of her and slides “two 
           hundred dollars” on the table. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m Naomi.

           The dealer grimaces, shuffles the cards, and deals - 

                                 DEALER
                        I have enough friends.

           Naomi’s stung, but doesn’t show it as the dealer deals Naomi 
           two cards face up and deals herself one card face down and 
           one card face up.

           Naomi stares at her cards -- she has sixteen. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Stand.

           The dealer smirks as Naomi realizes everyone else in the 
           casino is using hand signals. 

           The dealer flips over her card, hits with twelve, gets a six 
           and beats Naomi with eighteen. 

           Panic creeps across Naomi’s face--she wants to quit. Instead, 
           puts in two hundred more, and stares at the dealer - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Lose the tude--I’m a paying 
                        customer.

           The dealer deals Naomi in -- she loses again, gets up from 
           the table, and slinks off of the yacht.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - EARLY MORNING

           Brandon wakes up to a SNORING Naomi snuggling him tightly. 

           He shudders and quickly wriggles out of her grasp -- she 
           turns over in her sleep, mooning him. Brandon gags, looks 
           around desperately, grabs his complementary The One swim 
           trunks, and races out. 

           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - POOL AREA - MORNING

           Brandon tries to swim laps, but the pool’s littered with HOT 
           EURO COUPLES canoodling on inflatable rafts.

           Frustrated, Brandon plops into the hot tub between two 
           COUPLES... Who promptly begin making out. 

                                 BRANDON
                             (sarcastic)
                        Just pretend I’m not here.

           Brandon tries to relax, but can’t. He heaves himself out of 
           the tub, heads for the bar where he spots Rachel working.

           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - POOL BAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandon sits down next to Rachel. 
                                 BRANDON
                        Morning, Rachel! 
                             (nervous, re: her laptop 
                              screen)
                        Is that Jessica’s facebook?

           CLOSE ON: STICK-FIGURE JESSICA IN A BIKINI ON THE BEACH.

           Rachel quickly closes her laptop. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I was checking to see if anyone 
                        posted any candid shots from your 
                        wedding.  
                             (beat)
                        Nobody’s posted anything.

                                 BRANDON
                             (nervous)
                        Oh! Uh, that’s because, um, Jessica 
                        and I... we, um... promised each 
                        other... that... we’d disconnect on 
                        our honeymoon! 
                             (wipes his forehead)
                        We made it pretty to clear 
                        everyone: Don’t bug us! 
                             (quickly)
                        Do you want a drink? I could use a 
                        drink?

           Rachel holds up a mimosa - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Way ahead of you.

           Brandon smiles and scoots closer to her -  

                                 BRANDON
                        Hey, uh, thanks again for picking 
                        us, er, my essay. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Sure. It was thoughtful and very 
                        well written.

                                 BRANDON
                        Being here is a big deal for me. I 
                        haven’t done a lot of traveling... 
                        My biggest early twenties regret, I 
                        don’t have many “boys will be boys” 
                        stories, is not studying abroad in 
                        college.

           Rachel stares at him and softens.
                                 RACHEL
                        Me too, actually.  

                                 BRANDON
                        Really?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. I wanted to study graphic art 
                        in Japan, but, my mom had some 
                        problems and I couldn’t be too far 
                        from home.

           Brandon nods -- it’s suddenly awkward. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Did you come to the pool alone? 
                        Where’s--?

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        Somebody almost say, “Jessica?”

           Brandon and Rachel turn to find Naomi, arms akimbo, bursting 
           out of a sexy, clinquant bikini. 

           Every poolside male mouth is agape. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Ugh! Gross! Put some clothes on! 
                             (covers, off Naomi’s look)
                        ...I, uh, don’t want other men 
                        ogling what’s... mine!

           Rachel is fixated on Naomi’s breasts. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes, they’re fake. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, I didn’t--

                                 NAOMI
                             (melodramatic)
                        It was all part of my epic wedding 
                        body image breakdown. 

           Rachel cocks her head, quizzically.

                                 BRANDON
                        It’s true. They’re super fake. They 
                        feel like shit. I don’t even like 
                        touching them. 

           Rachel bites her lip.
                                 NAOMI
                             (bitchy wife)
                        Brandon! We talked about you having 
                        my back in public!

                                 BRANDON
                        We did? 
                             (off Naomi’s glare)
                        Oh, we did! Sorry, honey. I’m the 
                        worst. 

           Naomi smiles slightly and nods, “satisfied.”

           Rachel forces herself not to stare at Naomi’s tits.

           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - POOL AREA - LATER

           Brandon and Naomi, on a snug pool raft, struggle to get comfy 
           without touching or falling into the water.

                                 BRANDON
                        If you emasculate me in front of 
                        Rachel again--we’re done. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (duh)
                        I was trying to make our marriage 
                        look realistic. 
                             (off his confusion)
                        No woman worth wifing would let you 
                        tell another woman her tits feel 
                        like shit!

                                 BRANDON
                        You said they were fake, not me!

                                 NAOMI
                        Right. And you were supposed to be 
                        outraged by my lack of self-worth, 
                        tell me I’m beautiful, and cajole 
                        Rachel to agree and fuss over me. 

           Beat. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Naomi, I passed the bar and that 
                        logic makes zero sense.

                                 NAOMI
                        You passed the bar the second 
                        time...

           Brandon pounds the raft -- they CAPSIZE. 
           FROM ACROSS THE POOL - 

           A perplexed Rachel, on the phone with Marissa, watches Naomi 
           and Brandon like they’re a sporting event - 

                                 RACHEL
                        They’re the most peculiar 
                        newlyweds...

           Naomi furiously dunks Brandon’s head under the water. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Jessica’s a bit of a bully with a 
                        dubious boob job...

           Brandon retaliates by yanking Naomi’s leg and dragging her, 
           KICKING AND SCREAMING, underwater. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        And Brandon... He’s like a poor, 
                        tormented little turtle who got 
                        flipped on his shell...

           People start to stare as Naomi butterfly kicks Brandon in the 
           face. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        ...No, they matched four years ago, 
                        and, trust me, these two don’t have  
                        the mental capacity to pull a fast 
                        one on us... 

           Brandon coughs and gags and swims to the bottom of the pool, 
           pushes off the concrete with his feet, and tries to uppercut 
           Naomi, but she dodges him and Brandon crashes into a COUPLE’S 
           raft, knocking their fruit plate into the water. 

                                 COUPLE
                        WHAT THE?!/AHHHHH!

           Naomi CACKLES. 

           Brandon gives Naomi the finger, hops out of the pool, brushes 
           the fruit from his hair, and huffs back to their room.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes, I will absolutely suss out--
                        hello? Marissa? Marissa? 
                             (sighs)
                        Twat. 
                             (embarrassed laugh)
                        Oh, you’re still there?

           Rachel falls into a cabana and buries her head in Lean In.
           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HOTEL SUITE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           An incensed Brandon chucks his suitcase on the floor as Naomi 
           stands over him, unpacking his belongings as he packs them - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon, c’mon. You can’t leave. We 
                        haven’t even tasted limoncello yet.

                                 BRANDON
                        I am well within the time limit to 
                        explain to The One how you put me 
                        on a plane AGAINST MY WILL and 
                        dragged me across the world under 
                        FRAUDULENT PRETENSES.

                                 NAOMI
                        I know you’re emotional right now 
                        and need to get laid--

           Brandon takes all of the items Naomi has unpacked and shoves 
           them into his suitcase - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I’m not the slightest bit emotional 
                        and regular sex has never been a 
                        pillar of my existence! I’m 
                        operating entirely from the logic 
                        epicenter of my brain which is 
                        sending me very clear signals to 
                        leave right now and never speak to 
                        you again.

                                 NAOMI
                        You tried that already. It didn’t 
                        work. 

                                 BRANDON
                        It was working great until you 
                        leapt over my boundaries and 
                        dropped a nuclear shitbomb on my 
                        wedding. 
                             (to himself)
                        Maybe I should join the Witness 
                        Protection Program?

           Beat. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m sorry I emasculated you in 
                        front of Rachel. Okay? There.
                                 BRANDON
                             (laughs, furious)
                        This isn’t about Rachel. This is 
                        about me refusing to let you ruin 
                        my life because yours is worthless. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hyperbolic much?

                                 BRANDON
                        You have no job, no significant 
                        other--you have nothing that 
                        indicates you’re doing anything 
                        right. And do you know why that is? 
                        It’s because every time you get an 
                        opportunity to show what you’re 
                        made of, every time you’re tested, 
                        every time something is at stake, 
                        you fuck it up. 
                             (serial killer-ish)
                        Worthless.

           Naomi’s stung.

                                 NAOMI
                        Do you really mean that? 

                                 BRANDON
                        With every fiber of my being.

           Naomi runs into the bathrooms and SLAMS THE DOOR. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           TWENTY OR SO MINUTES LATER - 

           Brandon is all packed. 

           He looks around the room, angry and guilty at the same time. 

           He starts for the door, but stops and sighs - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Bye, Naomi. 

           Silence. 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                             (louder)
                        I said, “Bye, Naomi.” 
                             (beat)
                        I’m leaving. 
           Silence. 

           Brandon grits his teeth and decides, fuck it. 

           He heads for the door... but can’t walk out. 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        Goddamnit. 

           Brandon marches over to the bathroom door and KNOCKS - 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Naomi, I refuse to drown in your 
                        manipulation quicksand, but I won’t 
                        be able to sleep on the plane if I 
                        have to wonder if you’ve done 
                        something... stupid. 

           Silence. 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Naomi, answer me!

           Naomi does not respond and Brandon barges into the bathroom -- 
           he finds Naomi, eyes closed, lying in a bubble bath igloo 
           surrounded by DARK RED BATHWATER. 

           Brandon RUSHES TO HER SIDE AND SHAKES HER - 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        NAOMI, OHMYGOD! NAOMI PLEASE WAKE 
                        UP! I’M SORRY I SAID YOUR LIFE WAS 
                        WORTHLESS. I DIDN’T MEAN IT. 
                        OHMYGOD FUCK FUCK FUCK.

           Naomi hazily opens her eyes and stares at Brandon - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon...

                                 BRANDON
                        Oh, thank God. Naomi, stay with me 
                        I’m calling 911. 

           Naomi sits up, her body is covered with bubbles - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Wait, why? 

                                 BRANDON
                        Your blood’s in the water! 
                             (confused)
                        Didn’t you try to...
           Naomi digs around in the tub and fishes out an empty bottle 
           of red wine and points to yet another gift basket on the 
           chair - 

                                 NAOMI
                        ...I must’ve dropped the bottle 
                        when I fell asleep. After our 
                        fight, I stress ate a fist full of 
                        melatonin gummies. 
                             (off Brandon’s relief)
                        I didn’t mean to scare you.   

                                 BRANDON
                        ...That’s--I’m just... glad you’re 
                        okay. 

           Beat. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (impish grin)
                        You love me. 
                             (her smiles grows/sing 
                              songy)
                        No matter what you say, you love 
                        me!

           Brandon smiles in spite of himself when - 

           There’s a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  

           Naomi grabs a towel, quickly trots to the door, and peers 
           through the peephole -- it’s Rachel clutching an envelope. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                             (whispers)
                        Balls, it’s Rachel. 

                      NAOMI (CONT’D)
                                                         BRANDON
                 (yells)
                                                (yells)
           Go away, we’re fucking.
                                              Just a minute!

           Naomi quickly starts teasing her hair and ransacking the 
           room.

                                 BRANDON
                             (whispers)
                        What are you doing?!

                                 NAOMI
                             (whispers)
                        Making it look like newlyweds live 
                        here!
           Brandon sighs and helps Naomi tousle the sheets and throw 
           underwear all over the floor - 

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        Should I come back later or...? 

           Naomi and Brandon, panting, open the door -

                                 BRANDON
                        Hi, Rachel! What’s up? 

           Naomi smacks Brandon’s ass and bears her teeth.

                                 RACHEL
                             (uncomfortable)
                        I have a small welcome gift for you 
                        two--compliments of The One.

           Rachel goes to hand Brandon the envelope, but Naomi 
           intercepts and hastily opens it - 

                                 NAOMI
                             (reads)
                        A couple’s massage?!

                                 RACHEL
                        An interactive couples massage. 
                             (checks her watch)
                        Right now.

                                 NAOMI
                        Right now?!

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s what I said.

                                 BRANDON
                             (sick)
                        How interactive? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Very. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You know what, Rachel, you and your 
                        company have already done so much-- 

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica’s right. We really can’t 
                        accept anything else from you--it’s 
                        too much. 
                                 RACHEL
                        Nonsense. 
                             (beat)
                        Also, it’s contractual. 

           Brandon and Naomi swallow hard.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - SPA - MASSAGE ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Candles. Floating orchids. Hot stones. Champagne. 

           Silk robe-clad Brandon and Naomi sit on the edge of the 
           massage table like they’re waiting for STD test results. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Whatever you do--don’t get a boner. 
                        I could never come back from that. 

           Brandon gags.

                                 BRANDON
                        If you were the last woman on 
                        earth, and we lived in Mississippi, 
                        and nobody would find out or care, 
                        and it was the human race’s only 
                        chance for survival, and twenty 
                        billion dollars would fall from the 
                        sky, I’d rather die than--

           Rachel and a rakish Aussie photographer, TRENT, 35, enter - 

                                 TRENT
                        Who’s ready to make love for the 
                        camera?

           Brandon and Naomi stop breathing. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (awkward laugh)
                        He means make love to the camera. 
                             (beat)
                        Right, Trent?  

                                 TRENT
                             (shrugs)
                        That’s up to Mr. and Mrs. Hart.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MASSAGE TIME - 

           Naomi lies prone on the table. 
           Brandon takes a deep breath, leans back, and brusquely tosses 
           a hot stone on Naomi’s upper back -- CRACK.

                                 NAOMI
                        Ow! That’s my shoulder blade!

                                 BRANDON
                        Sorry, Peanut. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon, you’re “Peanut.” I’m 
                        Princess Greatness, remember? 

           Brandon clenches his jaw and inches the stone down Naomi’s 
           spine. 

                                 TRENT
                        C’mon Brandy, let’s see some 
                        passion. Pretend you’re an orca 
                        taunting its seal pup prey.

           Brandon reluctantly puts more muscle into the massage -

                                 NAOMI
                             (snarky, to Trent)
                        Brandon’s allergic to passion. He’s 
                        been that way since he was little. 
                             (off Trent’s look)
                        I assume.

                                 BRANDON
                        I don’t know who decided that men 
                        are supposed to act like giant, 
                        veiny dicks in order to prove how 
                        awesome they are--

                                 RACHEL
                             (to Trent)
                        --We can edit out the “giant veiny 
                        dick” part, right?

                                 TRENT
                        Sure, doll, whatever--

           Naomi, caught in “the moment” turns over and faces Brandon - 

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t want a “giant veiny dick,” 
                        Brandon. I want you! 

           Rachel grimaces.
                                 BRANDON
                        Then you better start appreciating 
                        me. 
                             (off Naomi’s supplication)
                        You can start by giving me a new 
                        pet name. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You got it... Stingray.

                                 TRENT
                        Stingrays are badass, mate.

           Brandon grins proudly as Rachel rubs her temples, stressed.

                                 RACHEL
                             (to Brandon and Naomi)
                        Guys, I need pictures of you two 
                        looking like you love each other or 
                        I’m going to lose my fucking job! 

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Naomi, on the bed, stuffs her face with room service 
           Profiteroles while practicing blackjack with a deck of cards.

           MEANWHILE, ON THE BALCONY - 

           Brandon paces while debating whether to call Jessica. 

           Finally, he calls, hangs up, sighs, pounds his chest, and 
           calls again -- after two rings he’s sent to VOICEMAIL.

                                 BRANDON
                             (annoyed)
                        Hey, Jessica, it’s Brandon. Not 
                        sure why you sent me to voicemail 
                        considering we haven’t talked in 
                        two days... I’m mainly calling to 
                        let you know, cause you’re probably 
                        worried about me, I’d be worried 
                        about me, but, rest assured I’m 
                        fine. Actually, I’m better than 
                        fine. I’m in Italy with Naomi--
                        yeah, cause, I’m fucking the shit 
                        out of life now!

           Brandon hangs up, cringes, and calls back... he’s instantly 
           sent to VOICEMAIL.
                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Jessica, please delete this message 
                        as well as my previous message or I 
                        could end up behind bars... That’s 
                        the kinda man I am now. 

           Brandon hangs up and comes back inside, and, distracted and 
           out of sorts, trips - 

           Naomi cracks up -

                                 NAOMI
                        Sorry, it’s just so funny when 
                        controlling people trip, and you 
                        get to watch that free-falling 
                        second as they’re forced to 
                        confront mortality--it’s seriously 
                        my favorite thing, other than retro 
                        ice-cream trucks. 

           Beat.

                                 BRANDON
                        Am I unlovable?

                                 NAOMI
                        Of course you’re lovable...

                                 BRANDON
                        Then why did Jessica leave? 

           Brandon moves the cards and sits down on the edge of the bed -  

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        I thought I did everything right 
                        with her!

           Naomi sighs, empathetic.

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon, you can’t control other 
                        people. 
                             (offers him her mostly 
                              eaten dessert)
                        Profiterole?

                                 BRANDON
                        No, thanks.

                                 NAOMI
                        If you prefer constructive 
                        criticism to sugar, I’d say... You 
                        could be more comfortable in your 
                        own skin. 
                                 BRANDON
                             (ugh)
                        What does that mean?

                                 NAOMI
                        Max’s band was called, The Suicide 
                        Notes. 

                                 BRANDON
                        ...That’s awful. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (laughs)
                        I know.

                                 BRANDON
                        So?

                                 NAOMI
                        So, he loved it. And, at the time, 
                        I loved how much he loved it. 
                             (longingly)
                        I loved his passion. 

           Brandon thinks about it - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I have no passion. Why do you think 
                        I wanted to get married?!

           Naomi laughs. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re a good person, Brandon. 
                        You’re not ugly, and you’re funny 
                        when you’re mad. Get a better 
                        haircut, and, when you’re ready, 
                        get back out there. 

                                 BRANDON
                        What is it with women and good 
                        hair?

                                 NAOMI
                        It’s everything. 

           Beat. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Thanks, Naomi. 

           Naomi beams proudly and leaps up - 
                                 NAOMI
                        I’ll, uh, be right back. I just 
                        inspired myself!

           Naomi heads for the door -

                                 BRANDON
                        Dinner’s at eight-thirty. Don’t be 
                        late. We can’t give Rachel any more 
                        BS.

           Naomi nods and runs out as Brandon picks up the cards.

           INT./EXT. YACHT CASINO - EVENING

           Naomi stares at the dealer from the previous scene and boldly 
           slaps two hundred bucks in chips the table.

                                 NAOMI
                        Guess who’s back?

           The dealer doesn’t look Naomi in the eyes, but deals.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - SAME

           A freshly showered Brandon holds up two virtually identical 
           light blue dress shirts up to himself in the mirror. 

           Defeated by indecision, he tosses the shirts on the bed when 
           he notices the time, 8:15pm, and texts Naomi - ETA?!?!

           INT./EXT. YACHT CASINO - LATER

           Naomi, focused, having lost a few hands, stares at her cards, 
           and ace and a ten. Her mouth drops a little and she adds them 
           up on her fingers to be certain - 

                                 NAOMI
                             (mouths)
                        Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, 
                        fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, 
                        seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, 
                        twenty...
                             (realizes)
                        Blackjack, sucka!

           The dealer smirks and flips over her face down card, hits, 
           loses to Naomi with a hand of nineteen, clears the table, and 
           tosses Naomi a couple of chips.
           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - RESTAURANT - SAME

           Trent sets up the camera while Brandon, in a striped light 
           blue shirt, fiddles with the menu - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Trent, um, have you and Rachel... 
                        ever... hooked up?

           Trent smirks.

                                 TRENT
                        Rachel’s not my type. 
                             (off Brandon’s look)
                        I’m gay. Like really gay.

           Beat.

                                 BRANDON
                        That’s so great, man!

           Rachel charges up to the table, fuming - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Jessica’s not in the bathroom. I’ve 
                        checked every stall. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I’ll call her again.

           Brandon calls Naomi as Rachel’s phone BUZZES - Marissa 
           calling. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (fake)
                        Marissa, hi!--

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from Rachel at the restaurant to 
           Marissa getting a two-thousand dollar snail poop facial in 
           NYC - 

                                 MARISSA
                        The massage footage is an 
                        unmitigated disaster--your fault, 
                        no doubt, but, as long as we get 
                        some footage we can actually USE, I 
                        don’t care if Brandon and Jessica 
                        are happily married or not.

           Rachel, irked, steps away from Brandon.
                                 RACHEL
                        But, Marissa, if we’re selling 
                        “finding the one” isn’t it a bit 
                        dishonest if they’re not happily 
                        married?

           Marissa laughs dryly. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Your promotion’s off the table, but 
                        if you’d like to keep your job, I 
                        suggest you capture a few magical 
                        fucking moments for my website 
                        tonight at dinner!

           Rachel steams as Brandon repeatedly calls Naomi.

           INT./EXT. YACHT CASINO - LATER

           Naomi, sitting in front of a sizeable stack of chips and with 
           a small audience, is on a winning streak.

                                 NAOMI
                        Hit me!

           Naomi wins again and again as a super impressed CROWD CHEERS 
           HER ON. 

           Finally, Naomi busts and her phone BUZZES - Brandon calling.

           The dealer swipes Naomi’s chips.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Guys, I should really get back. 

           NICO, 35, a walking cologne ad, sits down next to her - 

                                 NICO
                        So soon? 
                             (off Naomi’s drooling)
                        I am Nico. This is my yacht. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (glares at the dealer)
                        Nico, I’m Naomi. 
                             (bats eyelashes)
                        Of all the yachts I’ve been on--
                        this is the choicest one.

           Nico laughs.
                                 NICO
                        I’m having a party tomorrow night. 
                        Please come. Bring your friends.

                                 NAOMI
                        Done.

           Naomi grins and snaps to the dealer who hands her seventeen 
           thousand in cash -- she nearly faints.

           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Trent and the camera are long gone. 

           Brandon and a slightly drunk Rachel, having called it, enjoy 
           a candlelit dinner - 

                                 RACHEL
                        No way! My dad’s a 
                        neuropsychopharmacologist too!

                                 BRANDON
                        Seriously?! Because I’ve never met 
                        anyone--

           Rachel laughs, suddenly guilty.

                                 RACHEL
                        No, I was lying. 
                             (laughs, off his look)
                        I get it though. My mom was a 
                        bartender. 

                                 BRANDON
                        So, you too were the only shining 
                        light in your circle of 
                        dysfunction?

           Rachel laughs, knocking her bag off of the table --

                                 RACHEL
                        “Circle of dysfunction?” I love 
                        that. I’m going to use it at 
                        Christmas.

           -- She and Brandon reach for the bag when her sketchbook 
           falls out. Brandon picks up the sketchbook - 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Brandon don’t! 
           Brandon, impressed, flips through CORPORATE GIRL VS 
           LONELINESS, VS SUNDAY NIGHTS, VS STAFF MEETINGS, VS STRESS 
           EATING, etc. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        That’s private.

                                 BRANDON
                        Rachel, these are good. 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Can I have my sketchbook back 
                        please?

           Brandon hands Rachel the sketchbook. 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Have you shown these to anyone?

                                 RACHEL
                        No. They’re just for me. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I think they’re cool. And, I think 
                        a lot of working people could 
                        relate to--

           Rachel smirks and snatches her sketchbook when Naomi skips 
           into the hotel lobby bar, slips the bartender who told her 
           about the yacht casino a fiver, runs out of the bar, into the 
           restaurant, and up to Brandon and Rachel’s table, snags some 
           of Brandon’s calamari, and plops between Brandon and Rachel -

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m SO sorry, I lost track of time 
                        shopping, but I brought caviar! 
                             (drops the bag of jars on 
                              the table)
                        It’s the best thing I’ve ever put 
                        in my mouth.

           Rachel, in fuck it mode, digs in.

           Brandon stares at his sister, suspicious.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Naomi and Brandon, wearing matching The One robes, brush 
           their teeth in silence. 

           Brandon spits and checks his phone -- no new messages.

           Naomi splashes water on her face as her phone BUZZES. 
           She dries off, prances out of the bathroom, and checks it - 
           text from Nico - You’re the talk of my yacht.

           Naomi texts back - Love it and three moneybags emojis.

           Brandon comes out and crawls into bed -

                                 NAOMI
                        Night, Brandon. Sorry again about 
                        dinner. I’ll keep better track of 
                        time from now on.

           Brandon pulls the covers over his head, but then, frustrated, 
           immediately throws them off - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Is it weird that I haven’t heard 
                        from Jessica?

                                 NAOMI
                        That’s kinda how breaking up 
                        works... 

                                 BRANDON
                        How can she go from thinking she’s 
                        going to spend the rest of her life 
                        with me to not caring if I’m dead 
                        or alive?! 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re alive, Brandon.

           Brandon glares at her and pulls the covers back over his 
           head.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - RACHEL’S ROOM - SAME

           A now drunk Rachel, chugs from a new bottle of wine while 
           reading up on self-publishing, but insecurity consumes her 
           and she switches to facebook stalking the real Jessica - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Small breasts suited you fine. 

           She swigs again and signs into her The One profile. She 
           smiles hopefully when she sees she has two new matches! 

           She clicks on the first -- a skeezy sixty-year old dude is 
           sprawled out on a pile of money.

           She groans and clicks on the second -- dick pic.

           She gags, quickly shuts her laptop, and drinks more when her 
           phone BUZZES - Marissa calling. 
                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        For fuck’s sake.

           Rachel watches it ring, but finally answers - 

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from Rachel’s room to Marissa fuming in  
           JFK airport - 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        ...Hi, Marissa--

                                 MARISSA 
                        WHY THE FUCK IS THERE NO DINNER 
                        FOOTAGE?! 

                                 RACHEL
                        There was a bit of a snafu--

                                 MARISSA
                        A snafu?! A SNAFU?!

           Marissa closes her eyes and attempts to meditate, but quickly 
           opens them, and HURLS HER COMPUTER AT THE WALL -

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        A SNAFU is un-FUCKING-acceptable! I 
                        don’t know what I was thinking when 
                        I hired you, Rachel. Someone must 
                        have slipped some CRACK into my 
                        coffee. I don’t know. What I DO 
                        know is: This is your LAST CHANCE 
                        to stop giving me EXCUSES and start 
                        giving me RESULTS!

                                 RACHEL
                        STOP YELLING AT ME!

           Rachel hangs up on Marissa, and then, horrified by what she 
           just did, downs the rest of the wine, and passes out.

           TIME LAPSES AS - 

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        Brandon. Brandon! Are you listening 
                        to me?

           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - BREAKFAST HALL - LATE MORNING

           Naomi devours a seafood breakfast for two while Brandon, 
           groggy and distracted, sips black coffee. 

                                 BRANDON
                        What?
                                 NAOMI
                        I’ve been thinking about what you 
                        said... I’m an adult, and, as much 
                        as I hate that idea, maybe it’s 
                        time for me to stop wearing 
                        sweatpants with adjectives on the 
                        butt, find myself, and join the 
                        ranks of the one percent.

                                 BRANDON
                        There’s a lot in between unemployed 
                        and the one percent.

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah, but, if I’m trying my hardest 
                        I want real results. 
                             (off his smile)
                        I wanna be like you--but like me. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I’m not the one percent. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re not?! 

                                 BRANDON
                        No. But, if I didn’t blow a stupid 
                        amount of money on Jessica, I’d be 
                        comfortable. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’d like to be comfortable.

                                 BRANDON
                        Then pick something that interests 
                        you and stick to it. 
                             (beat)
                        If you fail you get to hate the 
                        world instead of yourself. It’s 
                        better. I promise.

           Naomi stares at her food, and looks up at him, vulnerable - 

                                 NAOMI
                        I think I might’ve found something. 

           Brandon snags a crab claw from her plate - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Oh, really?

           Naomi pulls her winnings from her purse and places them on 
           the table.
                                 NAOMI
                        Blackjack.

           Brandon nearly falls out of his chair. 

                                 BRANDON
                        That’s... That’s...

                                 NAOMI
                        Seventeen grand. 
                             (grins proudly)
                        I wish you could’ve seen me!

           Brandon looks like he might split her head open as Rachel and 
           Trent, carrying camera equipment, walk over to the group - 

                                 RACHEL
                             (miserable)
                        Who’s ready for wine tasting? 

                                 LACOPO (PRE-LAP)
                        Bonjourno! I am Lacopo Bianchi, 
                        owner of the Lacopo Bianchi winery. 

           INT. LACOPO BIANCHI WINERY - WINE CELLAR - SALERNO - 
           AFTERNOON

           The cellar is an intimate and atmospheric warren made of 
           limestone. 

           Naomi, Brandon, Rachel, and Trent walk alongside stacks of 
           perfectly portioned barriques. 

           LACOPO BIANCHI, 55, the proud and jovial winery owner, stops 
           and points to a roped off barrique - 

                                 LACOPO
                        This is my prized possession: 
                        A rare rosso blend aged fifteen 
                        years--impossible to replace. 

           Naomi and Brandon whisper fight - 

                                 BRANDON
                             (whispers/realizes)
                        You were playing blackjack last 
                        night when we were supposed to be 
                        having dinner, weren’t you?

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes. But, Brandon, I won. I’m 
                        actually good at something. 
                        Blackjack could be my career!
                                 RACHEL
                             (to Brandon/Naomi)
                        Sssshhhh!

                                 BRANDON
                        You need help!

                                 LACOPO
                             (offended, to 
                              Brandon/Naomi)
                        I’m sorry. Am I boring you? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Of course not, Lacopo. 

                                 TRENT
                        Please continue. 

           Naomi and Brandon smile and nod. 

                                 LACOPO
                        One bottle of my rosso blend would 
                        cost about... Three hundred U.S. 
                        Dollars. But, not for sale. Too 
                        much, how you say... sentimental 
                        value... 

           Lacopo waxes wine fermentation while Naomi and Brandon 
           whisper fight - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I can’t believe I was stupid enough 
                        to think you were trying to help 
                        me, when, in actuality, you just 
                        came here to use my prize money, 
                        which isn’t even in my possession 
                        yet, to gamble!

                                 NAOMI
                        I didn’t know the casino existed 
                        before I got here, Brandon! And I 
                        didn’t even think about using your 
                        money--I’m not an idiot. I used my 
                        all of savings!

           Brandon rolls his eyes.

                                 BRANDON
                        I will never trust anything that 
                        comes out of your mouth ever again.

                                 RACHEL
                             (to Brandon/Naomi)
                        Everything okay?
           Naomi and Brandon smile and nod.

                                 BRANDON
                        You know what Naomi, I wish you had 
                        found your dream career--truly. 
                        But, the problem, as usual, is your 
                        thinking, or lack there of--a 
                        career, big sister, isn’t something 
                        that happens over night that is 
                        entirely based on luck and odds. 
                             (beat)
                        Promise me you’ll never get it into 
                        your head that having a child is 
                        your calling. There’s enough evil 
                        in the world already, we don’t need 
                        more of your DNA. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Fuck you, Brandon.

           Naomi, raw, UPPERCUTS BRANDON -- BRANDON GOES FLYING --

           -- AND CRASHES INTO THE PRIZED BARRIQUE -- SMASHING IT AND 
           SOAKING BRANDON WITH RED WINE. 

           Everyone is STUNNED SILENT except Lacopo, who throws himself 
           on the floor -

                                 LACOPO
                        Il mio bambino! Mia madre! Mio 
                        padre! La mia famiglia!

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - LOBBY - AFTERNOON

           A wine soaked Brandon, a very guilty Naomi, and a furious 
           Rachel walk into the lobby lounge.. 

           Rachel’s phones BUZZES. 

           She checks it and her face falls - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Lacopo’s invoicing The One for 
                        thirty thousand dollars. 
                             (sick)
                        If I tell my boss that, she’ll-- 

                                 MARISSA (O.S.)
                        Tell me what?

           Naomi, Brandon, and Rachel turn and stare at Marissa, 
           sporting a chic linen tunic and a scowl.
           Rachel stops breathing - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Marissa?!

                                 NAOMI
                             (whispers, to Rachel)
                        Say nothing. I got this. 

                                 MARISSA
                             (re: Rachel’s dizziness)
                        Earth to Rachel. What happened?

           Rachel helplessly stares at Naomi and then at Brandon - 

                                 RACHEL
                             (barely, to Marissa)
                        Nothing.

           Marissa gives Rachel a death stare - 

                                 MARISSA
                        You know what’s not, “nothing?” I 
                        called the County Clerk’s office... 
                             (pivots to Brandon/Naomi)
                        There’s no record of your marriage 
                        certificate.

           Naomi and Brandon exchange a glance -- shit.

                                 RACHEL
                             (sotto)
                        Oh God.

                                 NAOMI
                             (laughs nervously)
                        That must be because...

                                 BRANDON
                        Because! Our officiant got the flu, 
                        so, my best friend, Jake... stepped 
                        up and married us-- 

                                 NAOMI
                        --He must not have sent in the form 
                        yet... 

           Rachel looks like she might throw up as - 

           Trent, carrying camera equipment, walks inside, but spots 
           Marissa, and walks right back out.
           INT. BLUE HORIZON - CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           At the conference table, Naomi sits next to Rachel, who sits 
           next to Brandon, who sits next to Marissa.

           Marissa dials Jake’s number on the speaker phone as, under 
           the table, Naomi texts Jake - Don’t fuck this up. 

           Naomi gets a text from Jake - ?? 

           The phone RINGS on the speaker phone. 

                                 JAKE
                        ...Hello?

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from the conference room to Jake in 
           bed. 

                                 BRANDON
                             (immediately)
                        Hey, dude. You have me, Jessica, 
                        and, Rachel and Marissa from The 
                        One.

           Naomi texts Jake - We’re in deep (two poo emojis). 

                                 JAKE
                        Hey guys... What’s up?

                                 BRANDON
                             (nervous laugh)
                        It’s all good, dude... Marissa just 
                        wants to know that the wedding went 
                        great, and... about the multiple, 
                        integral roles you played-- 

           Marissa snaps her fingers at Brandon, silencing him.

                                 JAKE
                             (stiff)
                        ...”The wedding went great. I 
                        played multiple, integral roles.” 

                                 RACHEL
                             (timid)
                        What were your roles, Jake?

           Naomi texts Jake - Now!

                                 JAKE
                        I was the best man... The 
                        photographer...
           Naomi texts Jake - You married us bc our officiant got the 
           flu. 

                                 MARISSA
                        That’s it? The best man and the 
                        photographer? 

           Jake stares at Naomi’s text, nervous. 

                                 BRANDON
                             (tense)
                        Any day now, Jake!

           Jake takes a deep breath and - 

                                 JAKE
                             (reads)
                        I married them because our 
                        officiant--their officiant--got the 
                        flu. 

           Marissa freezes as Rachel heaves a sigh of relief.

                                 BRANDON
                        Bye, Jake! Thanks!

           Naomi grins at Marissa - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Happy?

           Marissa locks eyes with Naomi--and storms out.

                                 RACHEL
                             (stressed, to Naomi)
                        Now what?

           Naomi’s phone BUZZES - Text from Nico - Where are you?

                                 NAOMI
                        Get dressed. 
                             (grins)
                        We’re going to a yacht party. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (hushed, to Brandon)
                        Is she out of her mind?

                                 BRANDON
                        Usually. 
                             (beat)
                        Just, go with it. 

           Rachel massages her temples when Trent pokes his head in - 
                                 TRENT
                        A yacht party?! Can I come? I’m the 
                        Herman Melville of yacht parties. 

           EXT. YACHT - PORT OF POSITANO - NIGHT

           Naomi, Brandon, Rachel, and Trent, dressed in their 
           respective ideas about what one wears to a yacht party, strut 
           across the yacht packed with a zoo of PRETTY PARTY ANIMALS 
           and a Berghain worthy SOUND SYSTEM.

                                 TRENT
                        This is where I pretend not to know 
                        any of you.

           Trent immediately ditches the group and waltzes into a cove 
           of DANCING, GLOW STICK CLUTCHING BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.

                                 BRANDON
                        I hate this. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Me too. 

           Brandon and Rachel smile at each other awkwardly.  

                                 NAOMI
                        You know, statistically, lame, 
                        judgy people are seventy-seven 
                        percent more likely to get raped 
                        and killed than happy, cool people. 
                             (off their fear)
                        Quit buzz killing and help me find 
                        Nico.

           Brandon and Rachel follow Naomi past a group of SEXY MEN AND 
           WOMEN SNORTING COKE OFF OF A PANTHER, a very serious FLAMING 
           CHAMPAGNE TASTING, and through a PETIT ORGY - 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’ve never seen anyone snort 
                        cocaine in real life! 

                                 BRANDON
                             (smitten)
                        Me neither. 
                             (beat)
                        Dad’s only into psychedelics. 

           Naomi groans, and quickly spots Nico, who waves at Naomi from 
           the upper deck/hot tub area.

           Naomi waves back and climbs the steps to the upper deck - 
                                 NICO
                        Naomi! Buenosera! 

                                 NAOMI
                        Buenosera, yourself.

                                 NICO 
                             (laughs)
                        I saved you a seat at my table. 

           Naomi beams as AN INTENSE TAGGING PARTY forms around Rachel 
           and Brandon down below -- they get BLASTED WITH SPRAY PAINT 
           OF EVERY COLOR. 

           Brandon protectively leaps in front of Rachel, using himself 
           as her shield - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I’ll protect you. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (laughs)
                        You’re so brave.

           INT./EXT. YACHT - CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Naomi sits next to Nico at a blackjack table full of the most 
           beautiful and exotic MEN AND WOMEN GAMBLERS she’s ever seen - 

                                 NAOMI
                        What’s the buy-in?

                                 DEALER
                             (nonchalant)
                        Ten.

                                 NAOMI
                        Thousand?!

                                 NICO
                             (laughs)
                        Of course! 

                                 DRUNK GAMBLER
                        Hey, everyone! Nico’s got a new 
                        high roller! 

           The dealer shuffles the cards as a CROWD forms behind them.

                                 NICO
                        Naomi, are you in or out?

           Naomi stares at the crowd, excited to have their attention.
                                 NAOMI
                        In.

           The dealer deals each player two cards face up, and deals 
           himself one card face down and one card face up.

           Naomi hits with thirteen and gets a seven. The dealer hits 
           with fourteen and busts. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        OHMYGOD!

           Nico pinches Naomi on the cheek as the crowd CHEERS and the 
           dealer hands her ten thousand dollars worth of chips. 

           Naomi beams and looks around to see if Brandon saw -- but 
           he’s not there.

           INT./EXT. YACHT - ELSEWHERE ON THE UPPER DECK- SAME

           Brandon and Rachel, covered in spray paint, watch a MUSICIAN, 
           32, parading around naked save for his guitar, being fed moon 
           rocks by HOT GROUPIES like they’re grapes.

           Rachel grimaces - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Ugh! Overconfident musicians 
                        repulse me.

           Brandon stares at Rachel like he’s floating on a cloud -

                                 BRANDON
                        Right?! They’re selfish, unkempt, 
                        and not half as clever as they 
                        think they are. 

           Rachel smiles and Brandon inches closer to her, when - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Um, Brandon. Where’s Jessica?

           Brandon looks around for Naomi when he and Rachel hear 
           CHEERING coming from the casino. 

           INT./EXT. YACHT - CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandon and Rachel elbow their way through the excited CROWD, 
           shocked to find Naomi in her element at the blackjack table. 

           The dealer deals. 
           Naomi, with a hand of fifteen, hams it up for her audience by 
           staring at her cards intensely, pulling at her chin, and 
           dabbing her brow with Nico’s pocket square.

           The crowd, loving it, begins CHANTING HER NAME. 

           Rachel cocks her head, confused as - 

                                 OLD RICH LADY
                        You think Naomi’s counting cards? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        No. I think she’s lucky. I met her 
                        in my bar a couple nights ago--told 
                        her about this place. 

                                 RACHEL
                             (wtf)
                        “Naomi?”

           Naomi closes her eyes, quickly opens them, hits, and busts. 

           The crowd BOOs as the dealer swipes ten thousand worth of 
           Naomi’s chips.

           Naomi freezes, horrified.

                                 BRANDON
                             (dazed)
                        She didn’t come here to gamble... 
                        She came here for me.

                                 RACHEL
                        Brandon, your wife just lost ten 
                        thousand dollars!

                                 BRANDON
                        She came here for me!

           Beat.

                                 RACHEL
                        Aren’t you going to do something!?

                                 BRANDON
                        Yes. 

           Brandon, inspired, grabs Rachel and kisses her.

           Rachel wriggles away - 

                                 RACHEL
                        That was NOT what I meant!
                                 BRANDON
                        Sorry!--Sorry! I...

           Rachel, disgusted, storms off.

           Brandon goes after her -

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Rachel!

           Naomi, in the zone, sweats as she counts her chips -- she’s 
           back to the seventeen thousand she started with. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (determined)
                        Can we make the buy-in fifteen? 

           The dealer looks at Nico. 

           Nico nods.

                                 NICO
                        Sure!

           The crowd CHEERS as the dealer deals.

           Naomi stares at her cards and stands with nineteen, but the 
           dealer has twenty. 

                                 NAOMI
                        NOOOO!

           The dealer swipes fifteen thousand dollars worth of Naomi’s 
           chips. 

           Naomi stares at the two thousand dollars -- her savings. 

           The crowd CHANTS HER NAME, but - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Nico, I have to stop.

           The crowd sighs, immediately stops caring, and dissipates. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Hey, wait! Where is everyone going? 

           Nico winks.

                                 NICO
                        They’ll come back when your luck 
                        changes.

           Naomi stares at the floor, defeated.
           EXT. PORT OF POSITANO - BEACH - SAME

           Brandon pants as he chases after Rachel, who’s in much better 
           shape.  

                                 BRANDON
                        Rachel, wait! Please!

           Rachel stops running, whips around, and faces him - 

                                 RACHEL
                        All I’ve EVER wanted, Brandon, 
                        other than a good job and my 
                        health, is to find the one--

                                 BRANDON
                        Me too! Those are literally my 
                        exact same priorities--

                                 RACHEL
                        --But, what I’ve learned, working 
                        in the “love industry,” is that 
                        everyone’s fucked up and there’s no 
                        such thing as THE ONE.

                                 BRANDON
                        Maybe everyone is a little fucked 
                        up! So what?! If love is something 
                        you want in your life, you can’t 
                        give up on it. 

           Rachel laughs, incredulous.

                                 RACHEL
                        Really, Brandon? Look at your 
                        marriage! It’s an utter shit show!

           Brandon shuffles in the sand, wanting to tell her the truth, 
           but -

                                 BRANDON
                        I guess you’re right.

           Rachel stares at him --

                                 RACHEL
                        Guess so.

           -- And walks away.

           Brandon sighs, and then remembers - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Goddamnit.
           Brandon takes off running BACK TOWARDS THE YACHT - 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Naomi!!

           EXT. YACHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Naomi shoves her way off of the yacht and runs up the dock - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon!!

           WE JUMP BACK AND FORTH from Brandon to Naomi running and 
           CALLING OUT TO EACH OTHER, in a classic rom-com manner.

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandon and Naomi rush up to each other, out of breath - 

                                 BRANDON
                        There you are. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Here I am. 

           Beat.

                                 BRANDON
                        Naomi, I’m sorry I thought you came 
                        here to gamble. I’m a terrible 
                        brother.

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m sorry about everything I’ve 
                        ever done to make you think I 
                        would’ve lied to you. I’m sorry for 
                        being a terrible sister. 

                                 BRANDON
                        You’re not a terrible sister, 
                        you’re just--

                                 NAOMI
                        --I know. I’m a very unique 
                        creature, like a bird of paradise 
                        or a narwhal.

           Brandon laughs. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I think deep down, I’ve hated you 
                        because mom and dad love you more. 
                                 NAOMI
                        They don’t love me more. I’m just 
                        more like them. 

                                 BRANDON
                        That’s fair. 

           Beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        You were right about my blackjack 
                        career... and that’s really all I 
                        want to say about it.  

           Brandon nods - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Okay then.

           Brandon holds out his hand - 

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Truce?

           Naomi shakes his hand - 

                                 NAOMI
                             (”romantic”)
                        I thought you’d never ask.

           Brandon and Naomi walk back to the hotel, arm in arm - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Oh, I tried to kiss Rachel and she 
                        ran away and gave up on love. 

           Naomi looks at Brandon for a pitying minute, and cracks up.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - LOBBY BAR - SAME

           Rachel thunders inside the lobby bar and spots Marissa, who 
           nearly falls out of her chair, repulsed - 

                                 MARISSA
                        Where have you been and why do you 
                        look like you got gang raped by a 
                        band of troll dolls?

                                 RACHEL
                        Brandon and Jessica, aka “Naomi,” 
                        are one-hundred percent not 
                        married. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        I want a camera put in their room 
                        so we can find out who the fuck 
                        they really are. 

           Marissa smiles.

                                 MARISSA
                        And to think I was about to fire 
                        you.

           Rachel grabs her phone and calls Trent. 

           We CUT BACK AND FORTH from Rachel in the bar to Trent on the 
           yacht, hooking up with a SUPER HOT RAVER - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Trent, it’s Rachel. I need you to 
                        come back to the hotel. 

                                 TRENT
                        The problem with that, Rachel, is 
                        that I’m quite high--

                                 RACHEL
                             (a la Marissa)
                        NOW!

           Marissa smirks, impressed.

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandon and Naomi share a bottle of wine on the pier -

                                 BRANDON
                        Do you ever wanna get married? 

                                 NAOMI
                        No, I wanna be free forever. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I really want a family one day. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I really wanna find my calling... 
                        And have a lot of really good sex.

           Brandon smiles - 

                                 BRANDON
                        We haven’t done one fun thing since 
                        we’ve got here. 
                             (excited)
                        I wanna do something fun.
           Beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        Do you mean actual fun? Or Brandon 
                        fun?

                                 BRANDON
                             (dangerous)
                        Actual fun. 

           Naomi pulls the two acid cubes she swiped from her father 
           (before they left) from her purse - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ever dropped dad’s acid? 

           Brandon trembles - 

                                 BRANDON
                        No. 
                             (beat)
                        Fuck it. 

           Brandon grabs one of the cubes and puts it on his tongue. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Dad would be so proud.

           Naomi puts the other cube on her tongue.

                                 BRANDON
                        I know! Should we text him?

           Naomi grabs her phone and she and Brandon take a picture with 
           their tongues out - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Sure.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - SAME

           Rachel, holding a room key, and Marissa, with crossed arms, 
           watch as Trent, shirtless, installs a tiny spy camera in a 
           ceiling sconce - 

                                 TRENT
                        A little voice in my head is 
                        telling me this isn’t right.

                                 MARISSA
                        That little voice is called 
                        weakness. 
           Trent looks at Rachel imploringly, but - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Hurry up Trent--before they come 
                        back.

           NAOMI AND BRANDON PAINT THE TOWN (ON ACID) LATE AT NIGHT: 

           CLUB - Naomi and Brandon stare at all of the lights and whip 
           their hair and limbs around to the music.

           LEMON GROVE - Brandon and Naomi run screaming under the lemon 
           trees--they pick lemons and get into a lemon-throwing fight 
           with an imaginary adversary and laugh hysterically as they 
           are run out by the OWNER -  

           RESTAURANT - Naomi and Brandon make art out of heaping plates 
           of spaghetti and find much meaning in their work.

           STREETS - They enjoy a horse-drawn carriage ride and pretend 
           to be royalty -- they stare up at the moon which changes its 
           shape and color.

           CLIFFS - Together, Brandon and Naomi hold hands, trust 
           exercise-style, and jump off of a cliff into the ocean. 
           Brandon takes longer to surface than Naomi, but, eventually, 
           he surfaces.

           HONEYMOON SUITE - Brandon and Naomi pop open a bottle of 
           champagne and reminisce and laugh and talk about life and 
           love and put on a two-man show, and dance, and do something 
           that resembles yoga and trip balls until sunrise...

           INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - LATE MORNING

           The room looks like a war zone. 

           Brandon wakes up, realizes he’s not wearing clothes, and 
           looks over to Naomi, who is passed out on the other side of 
           the bed, NO DIVIDER, and also... not... wearing... clothes...

           Brandon SHRIEKS. 

           Naomi sits up, startled and hungover - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Did we miss brunch?! 
                             (yawns)
                        I have an insane craving for 
                        pumpkin pancakes, which usually 
                        only happens after a night of wild--
                                 BRANDON
                        DON’T SAY IT!

           Naomi, confused, stares at Brandon, ghost-white and cloaked 
           in the duvet. She then stares down, under the covers, as she 
           realizes... she’s not wearing any clothes. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ohmygod... 
                             (beat)
                        OHMYGOD! 
                             (sick)
                        What happened last night?

                                 BRANDON
                             (grave)
                        I don’t remember.

           Beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        There’s no way we--

                                 BRANDON
                        DON’T SAY IT! 
                             (beat)
                        If you trigger some sort of “acid 
                        flashback,” I’ll commit suicide.

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t talk like that! 
                             (beat)
                        Also, you can’t do that to mom and 
                        dad. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Then what can we do?!... If it’s 
                        true...

                                 NAOMI
                        If it’s true, and we don’t know 
                        that it is, we make a pact to bury 
                        it deep within our souls forever. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I’m gonna be sick.

           Brandon runs and THROWS UP in the bathroom. 

           Naomi follows him - 
                                 NAOMI
                             (re: his puking)
                        ...If it’s true and I got pregnant 
                        would you wanna know or...?

           Brandon THROWS UP again as -

           THE REAL JESSICA, PUSHING A LOUIS VUITTON SUITCASE, WALKS 
           INSIDE - 

                                 JESSICA
                        Brandon, I’ve made a terrible 
                        mistake!

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica?!?

           Beat.

                                 JESSICA
                        What happened in here?

                                 NAOMI
                        WE DON’T KNOW!

           Jessica stares at Naomi and Brandon, disquieted.

           EXT. BLUE HORIZON - POOL BAR - SAME

           A sleepless, guilty Rachel, sitting with Trent, books a boat 
           trip to the Blue Grotto on her phone.  

                                 RACHEL
                        I DON’T KNOW why I told you to put 
                        the camera in their room! It was 
                        wrong.
                             (sighs)
                        I’ve been single for so long... 

                                 TRENT
                        Sorry?

           Beat.

                                 RACHEL
                        We need to get the camera out of 
                        their room--now.

           Trent grins and slaps Rachel on the back - 

                                 TRENT
                        Glad to have you playing for our 
                        team again. 
                                 RACHEL
                        Trent, I’m not... gay. 

                                 TRENT
                        The decent human being team. 

           Rachel nods, chagrined.

                                 RACHEL
                        Right, of course.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           A very uncomfortable Brandon watches Naomi affix Jessica to 
           the toilet with a bed sheet.

                                 JESSICA
                             (to Naomi)
                        Let go of me! 
                             (to Brandon)
                        Can we please talk? 
                             (beat)
                        Alone.

                                 BRANDON
                             (passive aggressive)
                        If you wanted to talk, maybe you 
                        should’ve returned my calls...

                                 NAOMI
                        What calls?

                                 JESSICA
                             (ignores her)
                        I didn’t call you back because I 
                        wanted to tell you in person that I 
                        still love you. 

           Before Brandon’s brain can decide on an emotion, Naomi SLAPS 
           JESSICA IN THE FACE - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Stop fucking with my brother’s 
                        heart!

                                 JESSICA
                             (stunned, to Naomi)
                        You hit me! 
                             (to Brandon)
                        She hit me! 
                             (re: Naomi’s hand)
                        Is that my ring?!
                                 NAOMI
                        Not anymore.

           Suddenly, there’s an URGENT KNOCK ON THE DOOR - 

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        Brandon! Jessica! I have a surprise 
                        for you! 

           Brandon and Naomi exchange a glance - Fuck.

                                 JESSICA
                        “Jessica?!” 
                             (to Naomi)
                        ... Are you pretending to be me!?

                                 BRANDON 
                             (yells to Rachel)
                        Be right there!

                                 JESSICA
                             (realizes, to Naomi)
                        Ohmygod! You took my passport, 
                        didn’t you?! 
                             (furious)
                        Do you have any idea how much a 
                        same day passport costs?! 

           Jessica tries to unshackle herself from the toilet -

                                 NAOMI
                             (scoffs, to Brandon)
                        Now, she puts a price on love.
                             (re: Jessica’s flailing)
                        You’re not going anywhere. I was a 
                        girl scout for three and a half 
                        weeks. Those knots are stronger 
                        than Malala’s commitment to women’s 
                        education.

           Brandon looks from Jessica to Naomi, darts from the bathroom, 
           and opens the door to find a slightly unhinged Rachel. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Hey, Rachel. Um, sorry about last 
                        night--
                                 RACHEL
                        It’s fine! I overreacted! I’ve had 
                        this thing against adultery ever 
                        since my dad ran off with my baby 
                        sitter when I was six and my mother 
                        went into psychosis and repeatedly 
                        jumped off the deck thinking she’d 
                        discovered time travel...  
                             (quick beat)
                        Anywhoo, I booked you and Jessica a 
                        boat trip to the Blue Grotto. No 
                        visit to Amalfi’s complete without 
                        one! 

           Brandon regards her strangely.

           BACK IN THE BATHROOM - 

                                 JESSICA
                        This was your plan the whole time, 
                        wasn’t it, Naomi? Break us up so 
                        you could go on MY trip? Brandon 
                        was right about you--you’re nothing 
                        but a--

           Naomi yawns and STUFFS A HAND TOWEL IN JESSICA’S MOUTH.

                                 NAOMI
                        Pretend this towel’s Lil Wayne.

           Jessica gags and THRASHES and UTTERS MUFFLED SCREAMS as Naomi 
           bursts into Lil Wayne’s Lollipop, whipping her hair around 
           and giving Jessica a lap dance - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Shawty wanna lick me like a 
                        lollipop... She lick me like a 
                        lollipop....

           IN THE HALL - 

           Rachel gives Brandon a look - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Jessica’s just, um, shaving her 
                        legs. We’ll meet you downstairs. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Great! Bus leaves in ten minutes!

           Rachel dashes off. 

           Brandon slips the DO NOT DISTURB hanger on the door handle, 
           closes the door, and runs back into the bathroom -  
                                 BRANDON
                             (to Naomi)
                        Get dressed. We’re going to the 
                        Blue Grotto. 

           Jessica SPITS OUT THE HAND TOWEL - 

                                 JESSICA
                        What about me?!
                             (catches her breath)
                        If you love me you’ll let me go. 

           Beat. 

                                 BRANDON
                        If you love me, you’ll stay put 
                        while I figure this out.

           Naomi nods to Brandon, proud. 

           STATICKY PUCCINI BLARES FROM SHODDY SPEAKERS -

           INT./EXT. OPEN-TOP TOURIST BUS - SS 163 AMALFITANA - DAY

           Brandon and Naomi sit next to each other on the CROWDED bus 
           that crawls through traffic up the steep, but picturesque 
           shoreline route famous for its hairpin bends, jetliner views, 
           and barely there railings. 

           Brandon and Naomi whisper back and forth - 

                                 BRANDON
                        I can’t believe Jessica came.
                             (beat)
                        You think she really loves me?

                                 NAOMI
                        No. I think she fired up her The 
                        One account, got slapped with a 
                        deluge of dick pics, cried a 
                        little, showered, noticed some 
                        cellulite on her upper thighs that 
                        wasn’t there last week, and booked 
                        her flight.

           Rachel, sitting in front of them and sketching CORPORATE GIRL 
           VS GUILT, whips around - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Dick pics make me understand 
                        terrorism.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                             (crazy eyes, off their 
                              concern)
                        Who’s excited for the Blue Grotto?!

           Naomi and Brandon smile meekly and raise their hands like 
           school children -

                                 BRANDON
                             (to Naomi, re: Rachel)
                        Did you slip her something?

                                 NAOMI
                        No. Should I?

           Guilt chokes Corporate Girl to death.

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - HONEYMOON SUITE - BATHROOM - SAME

           Jessica, covered in sweat, tries to wiggle out of her 
           thousand thread count restraints.  

           She strains and grits her teeth when she hears the DOOR OPEN - 

                                 JESSICA
                        HEEELLLLPPP! MAID! HELLLLPP! 

           A very confused Trent, ready to uninstall the spy camera, 
           walks into the bathroom - 

                                 TRENT
                        You look quite familiar... 
                             (excited)
                        Tara Reid, is it?! You were 
                        marvellous in Sharknado 3.
                             (beat)
                        What brings you to Amalfi?

           INT. BLUE HORIZON - LOBBY LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marissa, wearing headphones, sips a coffee while watching 
           last night’s hidden camera footage from Naomi’s and Brandon’s 
           room on her laptop. 

           WE CAN’T SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING, but Marissa is visibly 
           disturbed by what she’s watching. 

           She shuts the laptop, sees Jessica dart through the lobby, 
           and SPITS OUT HER COFFEE - 

                                 MARISSA
                        JESSICA?!!?
           Jessica freezes and looks around, confused to see Marissa -

                                 JESSICA
                             (uh oh)
                        Yes?

           Marissa gets up, drags Jessica back to her table, and opens 
           the laptop - 

                                 MARISSA
                        If YOU’RE the real Jessica then who 
                        THE HELL IS THIS?!

           Jessica bites her lip.

           INT./EXT. TOURIST BUS - SS 163 AMALFITANA - LATER

           The bus is stuck in gridlock.  

           Naomi, Brandon, and Rachel are respectively tense.

                                 NAOMI
                        What if housekeeping discovers 
                        Jessica? Will she rat us out?

                                 BRANDON
                        She wouldn’t put me in danger. 

                                 NAOMI
                        But she’s mad. And selfish. And a 
                        woman who doesn’t identify as a 
                        feminist. 

           Rachel’s phone BUZZES - Trent calling -  

                                 RACHEL
                             (nervous)
                        ...Hey, Trent... No, we’ve barely 
                        moved... Did you do the thing we 
                        talked about...? No, I’m not 
                        familiar with the Sharknardo 
                        films... You met Tara Reid, 
                        where...? Hello? I can’t hear 
                        you... Trent?

           The call drops and Rachel’s pulse quickens. 

           Naomi nudges Brandon and whispers - 

                                 NAOMI
                        She ratted.
                                 BRANDON
                             (defensive)
                        It might’ve been the real Tara 
                        Reid. Historically, Amalfi’s a 
                        celebrity hangout...

           Naomi gives Brandon a dubious look when - 

                                 MARISSA (O.S.)
                        BRANDON AND NAOMI HART!

           Brandon, Naomi, and Rachel turn to see an incensed Marissa, 
           weaving through traffic in the back of a PEDICAB -  

           Marissa hands the PEDICAB DRIVER a wad of cash - 

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Right here’s good, thanks.

           Marissa steps out of the pedicab, BANGS ON THE BUS DOOR, the 
           concerned DRIVER opens the door, and Marissa HURLS HERSELF 
           INSIDE and marches toward Brandon, Naomi, and Rachel, who 
           look for an escape route as the PASSENGERS of the bus watch 
           and yell like they’re watching interactive dinner theater - 

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                             (to Rachel)
                        First, you’re fucking fired. 
                        Second, Brandon and Naomi are 
                        brother and sister. 
                             (to Brandon and Naomi)
                        BROTHER AND FUCKING SISTER!

                                 OLD WOMAN PASSENGER
                        Brother and fucking sister?!

                                 NAOMI
                             (quickly, to the woman)
                        Just brother and sister.

                                 RACHEL
                             (mind blown)
                        This whole time?!

                                 BRANDON
                        Actually... since birth.

           Rachel looks like she’s going to scream, but then softens and 
           BURSTS OUT LAUGHING -

                                 RACHEL
                        That means... I’m not crazy. I’M 
                        NOT CRAZY!
                                 MARISSA
                        Stop laughing. This is not funny!

                                 RACHEL
                             (realizes)
                        I don’t work for you anymore, so, 
                        suddenly... I find it pretty 
                        hilarious. 
                             (laughs)
                        Brother and sister.

           Brandon and Naomi laugh nervously.

                                 MARISSA
                             (to Naomi and Brandon)
                        Are you two familiar with the 
                        consequences of committing fraud?

                                 OLD MAN PASSENGER
                        Fraud’s a serious crime. There was 
                        this episode of Law and Order--

                                 NAOMI
                             (panicking, to Brandon)
                        Run.

           Naomi and Brandon tear out of the bus. Brandon looks back at 
           Rachel who stares at Brandon and then back at Marissa, and - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Brandon, wait! I’m coming with you.

           Brandon lights up as the PASSENGERS of the BUS CHEER. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Oh, for fuck’s sake.

           EXT. SS 163 AMALFITANA - LATER

           Naomi, Brandon, and Rachel spill out of the bus. 

           Naomi spots a DOUCHEBAG zipping up the hill on a Ducati and 
           shoves her purse under her shirt -

                                 NAOMI
                        SIR! STOP! EMERGENCY! I’M HAVING A 
                        BABY. 

           Irritated, he stops - 

                                 DOUCHEBAG
                        I’m not the father, so that’s not 
                        my problem. Now move. 
           Naomi pulls her “baby” from her shirt and bashes the douche 
           in the head with it and SHOVES him off of the bike -

                                 NAOMI
                        I was gonna do this anyway, but now 
                        I’m not gonna feel bad about it.

           Naomi hops on the Ducati and motions for Brandon and Rachel 
           to join her as the douchebag CURSES NAOMI IN ITALIAN.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

                                 RACHEL
                        I AM SO TURNED ON RIGHT NOW!

                                 BRANDON
                        ME TOO!

           Brandon kisses Rachel as Marissa spills out of the bus after 
           them - 

                                 MARISSA
                        You will NOT get away with this! 
                        Any of you!

           Brandon and Rachel pile onto the back of the bike, excited 
           but afraid, and Naomi GIVES THE BIKE SOME GAS - 

                                 NAOMI
                        HOLD ON!

           -- AND DRIVES AGAINST TRAFFIC WEAVING THROUGH THE CARS THAT 
           ARE STUCK IN GRIDLOCK. 

                                 BRANDON
                        YOU’RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!

                                 NAOMI
                        I CAN SEE THAT, BRANDON!

           Marissa JUMPS BACK IN THE PEDICAB and tosses a pile of money 
           at the driver - 

                                 MARISSA
                        Follow that bike. It will 
                        eventually crash and burn--like 
                        everything my former associate 
                        touches.

           The pedicab shrugs and turns around following the Ducati as - 

           Naomi speeds through traffic as DRIVERS YELL at her and flip 
           her off - 
                                 BRANDON
                        Rachel, I need you to know we never 
                        intended to deceive you or The One.  
                        My fiancé, the real Jessica--

                                 NAOMI
                        --AKA “Tara Reid”--

                                 BRANDON
                        --Left me at the altar--

                                 NAOMI
                        --The relevant backstory is: 
                        Brandon bankrupted himself trying 
                        to win her love--

                                 BRANDON
                        --So, Naomi, “convinced” me to go 
                        on the honeymoon with her 
                        pretending to be Jessica so I could 
                        collect the prize money and start 
                        over...

           Rachel takes this in, and - 

                                 RACHEL
                        I have a confession to make too! 
                        Last night I had Trent put a camera 
                        in your room. It was the low point 
                        of my short-lived career in the 
                        love industry and I’m sorry.

                                 BRANDON
                        ...A camera?... Last night?

           Naomi turns her head around to stare at Rachel - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Did you watch the footage?!

                                 RACHEL
                        No. I’m not an animal.

                                 BRANDON
                        LOOK OUT!

           Naomi SWERVES TO AVOID A FLOCK OF BICYCLISTS AND DRIVES OFF 
           OF THE CLIFF AND DOWN THE HILL, MOWING, AT A BREAKNECK PACE, 
           THROUGH THE CLIFFSIDE COMMUNITY OF SHOPS AND SUN-BLEACHED 
           VILLAS - 

                                 NAOMI
                        I CAN’T STOP!
                                 RACHEL
                        I HATE MY MOTHER!

                                 BRANDON
                        I DON’T WANNA BE A LAWYER ANYMORE!

           Brandon, Naomi, and Rachel SCREAM and grip each other, 
           clinging for dear life, as Naomi tries to stop the bike.

           BACK ON THE STREET - 

           Marissa watches gleefully as she putzes along in the pedicab - 

                                 MARISSA
                             (smug, to herself)
                        When you’re right, you’re right.
                             (to the driver)
                        Stop here, please.

           The concerned driver stops and Marissa gets out and skips 
           down the hill after them.

           DOWN THE HILL - 

           Naomi WHIPS THROUGH GARDENS, A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT, A BOAT 
           RENTAL SHOP, AND FINALLY PLOWS THROUGH A LUXURIOUS OUTDOOR 
           SPA --

                                 NAOMI
                        BRANDON, IF WE DIE, YOU DIE KNOWING 
                        THAT JESSICA NEVER LOVED YOU AND 
                        I’M AN AMAZING SISTER.

                                 BRANDON
                        NAOMI, IF WE DIE, YOU DIE KNOWING 
                        THAT IT’S YOUR FAULT, BUT THAT I 
                        BELIEVE YOU WERE WELL INTENTIONED!

                                 RACHEL
                        IF WE DON’T DIE I’M GOING TO SHOW 
                        THE MISADVENTURES OF CORPORATE GIRL 
                        TO THE WORLD!

           -- AND CRASHES INTO A STUNNING INFINITY POOL.

           SPA GUESTS FREAK OUT as Brandon, Naomi, and Rachel surface, 
           gasp for air, and catch their breath. 

                                 NAOMI
                        We didn’t die.

                                 BRANDON
                        We didn’t die!
                                 NAOMI
                             (to Rachel)
                        What’s Corporate Girl? 

           Marissa waltzes over and throws them towels - 

                                 MARISSA
                             (to Rachel)
                        And I thought trying to screw over 
                        my company was the stupidest thing 
                        you and your new friends would ever 
                        do... 

           An incensed Rachel heaves herself out of the pool and walks 
           up to Marissa - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Wrong again, ex-boss.

           Marissa gets out her phone and calls the police - 

                                 MARISSA
                        --Hello, police--

                                 RACHEL
                        This is!

           Rachel DECKS MARISSA IN THE FACE. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        And another thing! The One owes the 
                        Lacopo Bianchi winery thirty 
                        thousand dollars in damages.

           Marissa staggers backwards, and falls into a cabana as GUESTS 
           SHRIEK.

                                 NAOMI
                        Damn, girl.

                                 BRANDON
                        My hero!

           Naomi runs and grabs Marissa’s phone, scans through Marissa’s 
           contacts, and calls Trent -  

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from the destroyed outdoor spa to 
           Trent, in a fluffy robe, luxuriating in the honeymoon suite 
           watching the last night’s mystery footage from the hidden 
           camera on his laptop, LAUGHING - 

                                 TRENT
                        Hi, Marissa...
                                 NAOMI
                        Trent, it’s Jessica, er, Naomi, er 
                        Princess Greatness. 
                             (beat)
                        We need a ride--like right now.

           Marissa sits up, appearing concussive, and lays back down.

                                 BRANDON
                        Should we call an ambulance?

                                 RACHEL
                        No. Horrible people are always okay 
                        in the end.

                                 BRANDON
                        That’s so true.

                                 NAOMI (PRE-LAP)
                             (whispers)
                        ...So, you watched last night’s  
                        “hidden camera footage?”

           INT./EXT. TOWN CAR - EN ROUTE TO NAPLES AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

           Trent drives, Naomi’s up front, and, in the back, a sleeping 
           Brandon snuggles Rachel, who is on the PHONE rescheduling 
           Brandon’s and Naomi’s flights and adding hers - 

           Naomi peers over her shoulder to make sure Brandon can’t hear 
           her - 

                                 TRENT
                        You had a woman tied to the toilet! 
                        It was practically my civic duty to 
                        watch it. 
                             (guilty)
                        Sorry, if you feel violated. 

                                 NAOMI
                        It’s fine... 
                             (whispers)
                        I’m just curious, did you happen to 
                        notice any behavior that would be 
                        considered illegal in most states 
                        and frowned upon in others?

           Trent scratches his chin.
                                 TRENT
                        ...I thought your ceremony of 
                        stripping yourselves of your 
                        clothes and possessions and 
                        sacrificing them to the Murano 
                        glass flamingo on the nightstand 
                        was beautiful. A bit wacky, but 
                        beautiful.  

                                 NAOMI
                        That’s it? There was nothing on 
                        there could, um, catapult me to 
                        undeserved stardom? 

                                 TRENT
                        I doubt it. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ...If the tape were a video game 
                        what would it’s rating be?

                                 TRENT
                        E for everyone--it contains 
                        delightful comic mischief and mild 
                        language. 

           Naomi heaves a tremendous sigh of relief and glances back to 
           make sure Brandon’s still asleep.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        I wish my brother and I could bond 
                        like that, but Jason’s an arrogant, 
                        closed off little prick.  

           Naomi puts her feet up on the dashboard - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Try being the bigger person and 
                        reach out to Jason. It’s really 
                        hard, but spending time with your 
                        brother will provide insight into 
                        the conflict in your relationship--
                        then you can work on repairing it.

                        I had no idea how great of a guy 
                        Brandon was until I pretended to be 
                        married to him.

                                 TRENT
                        Jason, would never go for that...

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m just saying, it’s never too 
                        late to reach out to your sibling.

                        a friend to gain.

           Trent contemplates this as he pulls up to the Naples airport - 

                                 TRENT
                        Alright ladies and gents--we’re 
                        here!

           Rachel nudges Brandon awake -

                        Brandon, we’re here.

           Brandon stares at her - 

                                 BRANDON
                        You really wanna come with me to 
                        Palm Springs?

                                 RACHEL
                        I do.

                        Even if we don’t last, I could use 
                        a vacation and I really like 
                        midcentury architecture.

                                 BRANDON
                        I really appreciate your honesty.

           EXT. NAPLES AIRPORT - DEPARTURES - MOMENTS LATER

           Naomi, Brandon, and Rachel hustle to get inside, but stop 
           when they see Jessica waiting for Brandon - 

                                 JESSICA
                        Brandon, I’m so sorry! I didn’t 
                        mean to give you up!

                                 NAOMI
                             (to Rachel, re: Jessica)
                        Ugh! She’s like an unpoppable butt 
                        pimple. 

           Rachel gives Naomi a behave yourself look. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Can we talk before you get on a 
                        plane? Please.

           Brandon drops his bag on the concrete - 
                                 BRANDON
                        You wanna talk? Fine. Let’s talk. 
                             (beat)
                        You are a very selfish person!

                        I didn’t see it when we were 
                        together because I wanted, more 
                        than anything, to believe someone 
                        like you... Could love someone like 
                        me, but you can’t love another 
                        person if you only think about 
                        yourself. 
                             (remembers Naomi’s pep 
                              talk)
                        Also, I’m a good person. I’m not 
                        ugly, and I’m funny when I’m mad. 
                        If that’s not enough for you--
                        that’s your problem, not mine.

           Naomi beams. 

                                 NAOMI
                        --Get it, Brandon!--

           Jessica tears up.

                        Are you breaking up with me?

                        You broke up with me! 
                             (and isn’t it ironic)
                        But, yes, now I’m breaking up with 
                        you.

                        Good luck, Jessica.

           Brandon stares at Jessica for a second and heads inside. 

           Rachel follows - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Brilliant speech.

                                 BRANDON
                        Thanks. I rehearsed in my sleep on 
                        the way over. I can get you a copy 
                        if you like. 
           Rachel laughs as Naomi, still outside, sings and dances her 
           final performance of Lil Wayne’s Lollipop for a boiling 
           Jessica -

           INT. NAPLES AIRPORT - CHECK IN AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandon, Rachel, and Naomi approach the ticket counter. The 
           AIRLINE EMPLOYEE, 40s, gorges on Nutella - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Hi! We’re checking in for flight 
                        six-seven-seven at six pm final 
                        destination Palm Springs--I called 
                        ahead. The names are--

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        Passports please.

           A twinge of anxiety courses through Naomi as everyone hands 
           over their passports - 

                                 NAOMI
                             (over confident, re: 
                              Jessica’s passport)
                        That’s Jessica Marie Berri and my 
                        birthday is--

           Suddenly, a battered Marissa, dragging a snivelling Jessica 
           by the arm, rushes the ticket counter - 

                                 MARISSA
                        August eleventh, nineteen eighty-
                        four. Her real name’s Naomi Hart.

                        This is Jessica Berri.

                                 JESSICA

                        --I want nothing to do with this!--

                        She’s lying! They’re lying! This is 
                        girl on girl on girl bullying!

           Marissa snags Jessica’s passport from the employee’s hands 
           and holds the passport picture up to Jessica’s face - 

                                 MARISSA
                        Pictures don’t lie. People lie.

                        whole time I’ve thought you were 
                        this perfect, evil robot. I was 
                        pretty sure you were a virgin--

           The airline employee grabs her phone/intercom -

           Naomi stares from Marissa to the airline employee, to Brandon 
           and starts RUNNING, but is immediately tackled and handcuffed 
           by SECURITY -

                        STOP! UNHAND ME! UM, ONE OF YOU 
                        JUST TOUCHED MY BOOB!

           Security drags Naomi off --

                             (wtf, to Brandon)
                        You love each other now?

           Brandon glares at Jessica.
           INT. NAPLES AIRPORT - INTERROGATION ROOM - EVENING

           A drained Naomi sits, handcuffed to a table, inching her 
           fingers towards the panini security left for her -- it’s just 
           out of reach.

           Finally, two CUSTOMS AGENTS burst inside. 

           One of them throws the panini on the floor, hostile. 

                                 NAOMI

                        And you wonder why people of color 
                        hate the police...

           Customs agent 1 locks eyes with Naomi -- he seems friendly.

                        willing to cooperate. 

           Customs agent 2 KICKS THE TABLE -

                        I know, I’m a little old to be

                        Naomi, did you steal a passport 
                        with the intention of committing a

           Beat.

                        ...Like ISIS?

           The agents grin -- we got her. 

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT 2
                        YES, NAOMI. LIKE ISIS. HAVE YOU 
                        BEEN IN CONTACT WITH ISIS?

                                 NAOMI
                        No!
                             (off their suspicion)
                        I have no social media! There’s no 
                        way to get in bed with those that 
                        fly the black flag sans Twitter! 
                        Also, I’m hardly the isolated, 
                        victim type.

                        Search her bag. 

                                 NAOMI
                        For what? A bomb?!

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT 2
                        BOMB?! DID SHE SAY “BOMB?!”

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT 1
                        SHE SAID, “BOMB.” SHE SAID, “BOMB.”

           The customs agents THROW NAOMI AGAINST THE WALL and put her 
           in a headlock. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FEW MINUTES LATER - 

           A BOMB SQUAD carefully dumps her entire bag on the floor. 

           The bomb squad leader, grossed out, sorts through melted Hi-
           Chew candies, a key-ring with a way too many furry animal key 
           chains, and multiple uncapped lipsticks -
                                 BOMB SQUAD LEADER
                        There’s no bomb.

           Relieved, the customs agents release Naomi.

                                 NAOMI
                        I told you! All I did was fly from 
                        Palm Springs pretending to be 
                        Jessica and now all I’m trying to 
                        do is go home. 
                             (emotional)
                        I would never harm anyone! I was a 
                        vegan for almost three months!

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT 1
                             (to agent 2)
                        The crime originated in the United 
                        States. Put her in holding.

           INT. NAPLES AIRPORT - OUTSIDE THE HOLDING ROOM - SAME

           Brandon tries to level with the GUARD. Rachel is beside him. 

                                 BRANDON
                        With respect, Sir, Naomi couldn’t 
                        build a bomb if her life depended 
                        on it! She failed chemistry for 
                        athletes. 

                                 GUARD
                        Step away from the door please. 

                                 BRANDON
                        But, I’m her lawyer. I’m entitled 
                        to see her. 

                                 GUARD
                        You are not entitled to anything. 
                             (shakes his head, sighs)
                        Americans. 

           Brandon steams as Rachel steps up to the plate - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Sir, I’m actually from the UK...
                             (off the guard’s glare)
                        ...And we’re just going to wait 
                        patiently and get something to eat.

           Rachel ushers Brandon away from the guard - 
                                 BRANDON
                             (yells over his shoulder)
                        Has Naomi had something to eat? 
                             (off the guard’s silence)
                        I SAID, HAS NAOMI HAD SOMETHING TO 
                        EAT?

           Suddenly, Marissa, with multiple duty free shopping bags 
           waltzes over to Brandon and Rachel - 

                                 MARISSA
                        Brandon, you should stop worrying 
                        so much about your sister and start 
                        worrying about yourself. I fully 
                        intend to press charges against 
                        both of you. 

           Brandon, losing his shit, stares at Marissa, and, a la Naomi - 

                                 BRANDON
                        If you even think about pressing 
                        charges I will tell the world that 
                        The One matched siblings for 
                        everlasting love. 

                                 MARISSA
                        But that isn’t true. And I can 
                        prove it.

           Beat.

                                 RACHEL
                        But... what you can’t prove, is 
                        when we found out Brandon and Naomi  
                        were brother and sister. 
                             (off Marissa’s shock)
                        It could’ve been the day they 
                        arrived, and we could’ve gone ahead 
                        with the promotion anyway to save 
                        money...

                                 MARISSA
                        You don’t have the balls. 

           Rachel grabs her crotch and sneers defiantly at Marissa - 

                                 RACHEL
                        It appears they just dropped. 

           Brandon looks at Rachel, completely enamored. 
           INT. NAPLES AIRPORT - HOLDING ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           The holding room is small, grim, and quiet.  

           Naomi paces around, thoughtful. She springs to the floor and 
           busts out a few prison montage-like pushups -- she gets to 
           three and fatigues when a GUARD opens the door - 

                                 GUARD
                        Naomi Hart, you’re going home.

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh, thank God.
                             (beat)
                        So, how does this work? Do I get my 
                        own “potential terrorist threat” 
                        plane or...?

           EXT. AIRPORT - SOMEWHERE NEAR PALM SPRINGS - DAY

           A PLANE TOUCHES DOWN ON THE TARMAC as we DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Brandon, Rachel, Stan, and Jules wait eagerly as a handcuffed 
           Naomi appears, escorted through the airport by GUARDS.

                                 BRANDON
                        Naomi!

           Naomi turns, touched to see her entire family, and Rachel - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon! Mom! Dad!...Rachel!

                                 RACHEL
                             (to Brandon)
                        Is it weird that I’m here? 

                                 BRANDON
                        My family’s weird--you’ll fit right 
                        in.

           Stan digs in his pocket and approaches Naomi - 

                                 STAN
                        Snapdragon, I have something for 
                        you--to take the edge off. 

           Brandon urgently yanks his father back before the guard can 
           react - 
                                 BRANDON
                             (harsh whisper)
                        Dad, you can’t give her drugs. 
                        She’s going to be held in prison! 
                             (smiles at the guard)
                        Naomi, good behavior, okay? I’m 
                        gonna help you as best I can.

           Naomi looks grateful, but before she can respond, she is 
           grabbed by FEDERAL MARSHALS -

                                 FEDERAL MARSHAL
                        Naomi Hart? 

                                 NAOMI
                        Instead of the usual phone call 
                        upon arrival, might it be possible 
                        to buck tradition and arrange for a 
                        Double Double Animal Style and a 
                        large strawberry milkshake to be 
                        waiting for me in my cell? I 
                        haven’t eaten an American meal in 
                        days and I’m very concerned about 
                        my iron levels--

           -- And CARTED OFF TO A POLICE CAR.

           Jules gives Brandon a hug. 

                                 JULES
                        It is so nice to see you and your 
                        sister getting along.

                                 BRANDON (PRE-LAP)
                        You running the joint yet?

           INT. JAIL - CONFERENCE ROOM - PALM SPRINGS - DAY

           Brandon and a dejected Naomi sit across from each other. 

           A GUARD is a few feet away. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hardly. 
                             (beat)
                        Are mom and dad disappointed in me? 

                                 BRANDON
                             (jocular)
                        Don’t worry, you’re still the 
                        favorite child.
                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon, don’t be crass. I’m trying 
                        to take my trial prep seriously.  

                                 BRANDON
                             (impressed)
                        Understood.

           Naomi sits up in her chair - 

                                 NAOMI
                        What’s the maximum sentence I could 
                        get for pretending to be Jessica 
                        and what should I wear in court 
                        tomorrow? 

                                 BRANDON
                        Ten years in prison and probably a 
                        neutral-colored twin-set or 
                        something.

           Naomi nearly falls out of her chair - 

                                 NAOMI
                        A TWIN-SET?!

                                 BRANDON
                        Yes, Naomi. Committing a federal 
                        crime warrants wearing conservative 
                        attire. 
                             (off Naomi’s dazed horror)
                        Now, before we begin, I need you to 
                        promise me that you will let me do 
                        all of the talking. 

           A vein begins protruding on Naomi’s forehead.

           INT. COURTROOM - NAOMI’S TRIAL - PALM SPRINGS - DAY 

           The courtroom is PACKED. 

           On one side of the JUDGE is the FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, who has 
           the floor. On the other side of the judge, Naomi, miserable 
           in an almond-colored twin-set, sits next to a suited Brandon.  

           Stan, Jules, Rachel, Jake, and Marissa are seated in the 
           gallery, on edge.
                                 FEDERAL PROSECUTOR
                        On June seventh, possessing a 
                        complete lack of regard for the 
                        consequences of her actions, Naomi 
                        Hart saw an opportunity to travel 
                        to the Amalfi coast, and Naomi Hart 
                        took it. 

           Naomi opens her mouth to object, but Brandon stares her into 
           silence.

                                 FEDERAL PROSECUTOR (CONT’D)
                        Naomi Hart may not be ISIS chief, 
                        Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but so long 
                        as terrorists are a threat to our 
                        great nation, we don’t have the 
                        luxury of allowing our citizens to 
                        commit passport fraud at their 
                        leisure. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (whispers to Brandon)
                        --He’s desecrating my character! Do 
                        something!

                                 BRANDON
                             (whispers back)
                        It’s not my turn to talk yet--

           The federal prosecutor steps closer to the bench - 

                                 FEDERAL PROSECUTOR
                        Your Honor, it is imperative that 
                        we make an example of Naomi Hart 
                        and give her the maximum sentence. 
                             (straight to Naomi)
                        Perhaps behind bars she will begin 
                        to respect herself, her fellow 
                        citizens, and her country. 
                             (beat)
                        Thank you. 

           MURMURS from the gallery as the prosecutor sits down.

           Marissa CLAPS and immediately receives glares from Jules and 
           Stan.

                                 JUDGE
                        Thank you to the prosecutor. 
                             (to Brandon)
                        Mr. Hart, what do you have to say 
                        on behalf of your client?
           Brandon stands up -- as he speaks Naomi fidgets uncomfortably 
           in her twin-set --

                                 BRANDON
                        Your Honor, Naomi Hart is a first 
                        time offender with no criminal 
                        record. She is aware that what she 
                        did was wrong. And she is sorry. 
                        However, it is important to point 
                        out that Naomi did not actually put 
                        anyone in any real danger--

           -- When suddenly, Naomi stands up, rips off her twin-set, 
           and, now, wearing only an undershirt, takes a full breath - 

                                 NAOMI
                             (to the Judge)
                        Sorry, can I please say something?

           Brandon whips around and Naomi and Brandon whisper argue - 

                                 BRANDON
                             (clenched teeth)
                        Naomi, sit down! This is a 
                        courtroom not an audition for a 
                        staged reading of Antigone for 
                        Beginners.

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t get that joke because I’ve 
                        never read Antigone. 

                                 BRANDON
                        They’ll have a copy in prison.

                                 JUDGE
                             (to Naomi)
                        Ms. Hart, if you think it’s best--
                        feel free to speak. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (smiles at Brandon)
                        Thank you, Your Honor.

           Brandon sits and glances back at Stan and Jules, helpless as 
           Naomi approaches the bench. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Your Honor, do you have a brother 
                        or sister? 

                                 JUDGE
                             (confused)
                        ...A sister, yes. 
                                 BRANDON
                        Objection! On behalf of my client’s 
                        best interests and my desire to 
                        keep my personal life personal--

                                 JUDGE
                        Overruled. The defendant wishes to 
                        speak.

           Brandon backs off as Marissa and the prosecutor grin.

           Naomi nods, and with gravitas - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Your Honor, like many brothers and 
                        sisters, Brandon and I didn’t get 
                        along when we were kids. Actually, 
                        up until a week or so ago we were 
                        estranged. 

           Jake whispers to Rachel - 

                                 JAKE
                             (optimistic)
                        She hasn’t lied under oath yet.

                                 NAOMI
                        The thing is Your Honor, you can’t 
                        pick your siblings. Unfortunately 
                        for Brandon he got stuck with a big 
                        sister who is unconventional, a big 
                        sister who makes life up as she 
                        goes along, a big sister who has 
                        never fit in and never wanted to, a 
                        big sister who loves attention even 
                        more than she loves getting her 
                        way, a big sister with tragic but 
                        really fun taste in men, a big 
                        sister who is so good at arguing 
                        she could’ve been a lawyer but for 
                        her self-diagnosed dyslexia, a big 
                        sister he may never truly 
                        understand... 

           Naomi stops, starts to cry, and walks up to a frozen Brandon - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        But, Brandon, that “big sister,” 
                        this “monster” standing in front of 
                        you wants you to know, that despite 
                        our vast and numerous differences, 
                        and all of the times I’ve put 
                        myself first... I love you very 
                        much. 
           Stan and Jules tear up as Naomi approaches the bench - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        What I’ve learned sitting in jail 
                        with ample time to think and nobody 
                        to listen, Your Honor, is being a 
                        good sister is not about doing what 
                        you think is right for your sibling-
                        -it’s about actually doing what’s 
                        right for your sibling. 
                             (Naomi dries her tears)
                        Deep shit, I know. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve also realized it’s sorta the 
                        same for abiding by the laws... I’m 
                        sorry I stole Jessica’s passport--
                        even though I meant no harm, it was 
                        a selfish act and this proceeding 
                        is waste of the court’s time and 
                        resources. 
                             (sweetly, to the Judge)
                        It’ll never happen again, I swear. 

           The Judge, the prosecutor, Brandon, and everyone in the 
           courtroom are gobsmacked and silent.

           INT. COURTHOUSE - LATER

           The courtroom doors swing open and EVERYONE files out 
           MURMURING, LAUGHING, and TALKING. 

           Brandon, stunned, hangs back with a very supportive Rachel.

                                 JAKE
                             (pumped, to Naomi)
                        Six months probation--woot woot!

                                 NAOMI
                        And an eternity of community 
                        service, but, yes, I too am amazed 
                        by the Judge’s benevolent ruling. 
                             (thoughtful)
                        Maybe next Brandon and I can double-
                        handedly close the gender pay gap?

           Jake laughs. 

                                 JAKE
                        You’re something else, Naomi.

           Naomi beams and stares at Jake, noticing him - 
                                 NAOMI
                        It’s probably the adrenaline 
                        talking, but you look really good.

                                 JAKE
                        ...Thanks.

                                 JULES
                             (to Naomi)
                        Honey, that was beautiful self- 
                        expression. 

           Naomi smiles and turns to her brother, imploringly - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Brandon, what did you think? 

           Beat.

                                 BRANDON
                             (smiles)
                        I accept your apology. 

           Naomi hugs Brandon tightly.

                                 NAOMI
                        I love you, little brother. 

                                 BRANDON
                        I love you too.

           Jake gives Brandon a thumbs up.

                                 JAKE
                        Awwww. So sweet.

           Brandon playfully punches Jake in the arm as Rachel spots a 
           livid Marissa skulking out of the courtroom and runs to her - 

                                 RACHEL
                        Marissa, wait. In light of 
                        everything, I want to wish you good 
                        luck. 

           Marissa stares at Rachel, cold. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Jesus, Rachel. You can’t even gloat 
                        properly. 

           Marissa walks off as Rachel stands there, nonplussed.

           Stan takes Brandon aside - 
                                 STAN
                        Son, I’m proud of you. 
                             (off Brandon’s disbelief)
                        Your mother and I are keenly aware 
                        that Naomi’s mature, self-
                        reflective insights were inspired 
                        by spending time with you.

           Brandon basks in a rare moment of parental approval - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Thanks, dad!

           Naomi ushers her family out of the courtroom - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hart family and friends, vámanos! I 
                        am in dire need of victory mole 
                        enchiladas and sipping tequila. 

           INT. HART RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - FAMILY DINNER - EVENING - 
           A FEW WEEKS LATER

           The entire Hart family plus Rachel and Jake chow down on a 
           delicious meal from Jules’ garden. Naomi sits at one head of 
           the table--Brandon, wearing a fun, flower print shirt, sits 
           at the other. Stan, likely tripping, fixates on the stained-
           glass window.

                                 NAOMI
                        Community service’s going great. 
                        I’m pretty much the mayor of the La 
                        Quinta soup kitchen. Also, before I 
                        forget, I’ve found my calling. 

                                 JULES
                        That’s great, snowflake. What is--

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m going to be a life coach!

           The table is silent and a bit disturbed. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        There’s no training required. You 
                        just need clients--and I’m not 
                        giving up ‘til I get them. 

           Brandon smiles.

                                 BRANDON
                        Good for you, Naomi.  
                                 RACHEL
                        I could help you establish a social 
                        media presence.

                                 NAOMI
                        Splendid. 

           Everyone resumes eating, when Brandon unbuttons his top 
           button like a boss and - 

                                 BRANDON
                        Actually, I have some news as well. 
                             (beat)
                        I quit my job. 
                             (beat)
                        Rachel and I are going to travel 
                        for a bit.

                                 STAN
                        Where to?

                                 BRANDON
                             (”devious”)
                        Unclear! We don’t have an itinerary 
                        or an end date.

                                 RACHEL
                        We’re both unemployed, so, on the 
                        one hand, it’s not the ideal time 
                        for a vacation, on the other hand--

                                 JULES
                        Honey, we don’t qualify our life 
                        choices at the table. 

           Rachel nods and relaxes into her chair.

                                 NAOMI
                        How fun! If I could leave the 
                        country and I wasn’t laser focused 
                        on success, I’d third wheel the 
                        shit out of your trip.

           Brandon smiles as Stan nudges Brandon, “slyly” - 

                                 STAN
                        You know, Brandon, pancakes are 
                        legal in Amsterdam.

                                 JULES
                             (to Brandon)
                        He means prostitution. 

           Rachel and Brandon laugh. 
           INT. JESSICA’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Jessica checks her The One account -- as Naomi predicted she 
           is hit with a deluge of DICK PICS -- each is thicker and more 
           veiny than the last. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Ugh! Gross!

           INT. HART RESIDENCE - BRANDON’S CHILDHOOD ROOM - SAME

           Rachel stares nervously at the detailed and stylish website 
           she’s created to debut The Midadventures of Corporate Girl. 

           She takes a deep breath and squeals as she clicks “upload.”

           INT. HART RESIDENCE - DEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Naomi, who has the remote, and a chill Brandon, who doesn’t 
           care because he’s smoking a joint, watch Shame and scarf Sour 
           Patch Kids in their The One robes - 

                                 NAOMI
                        Did Jake have a big crush on me in 
                        high school? 

                                 BRANDON
                        Nope.

                                 NAOMI
                        You sure?

                                 BRANDON
                        Pretty sure. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m thinking of asking him out. I’m 
                        not like super attracted to him, 
                        but I might be if we had sex. 
                             (off Brandon’s shrug)
                        Ohmygod! I totally forgot!

                                 BRANDON
                             (re: the joint)
                        This shit is way stronger than the 
                        shit I didn’t smoke in high school. 
                             (off Naomi’s look)
                        What?

                                 NAOMI
                        Remember, on our “honeymoon” when 
                        we thought we--
                                 BRANDON
                        --And then agreed never to mention--

                                 NAOMI
                        I know. 
                             (beat)
                        I can’t believe I forgot to tell 
                        you--though, I was pretty caught up 
                        with the trial and impending jail-- 

                                 BRANDON
                        Tell me what? You had a flashback, 
                        didn’t you? 

                                 NAOMI
                        No.
                             (whispers)
                        Trent saw the footage from the 
                        hidden camera. 
                             (off Brandon’s look)
                        Nothing happened!

           Brandon stares at Naomi calmly - 

                                 BRANDON
                        How long have you been sitting on 
                        this?

                                 NAOMI
                        ...A month or so?
                             (off Brandon’s nod)
                        Brandon, why aren’t you 
                        overreacting? It’s freaking me out!

           Brandon takes a big hit and slowly blows the smoke out of his 
           mouth -  

                                 BRANDON
                        Hey, Naomi. Be cool.

           Naomi freezes, blindsided, and stares at Brandon crazily -- 
           the way he used to stare at her. 

           THE END

           AS THE CREDITS ROLL we finally see the footage of Naomi and 
           Brandon in the hotel room that night tripping on acid, 
           sacrificing themselves to the glass flamingo on the 
           nightstand -- it’s pretty great.
