                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        Say there’s a girl in Chicago or 
                        Houston or Augusta, Maine--doesn’t 
                        matter--but this girl, she’s 
                        looking for love, right?

           INT. BAR - DOESN’T MATTER, USA - NIGHT

           We stumble into this cliché movie DATE SPOT (imagine if 
           Aaron Eckhart fucked your favorite cocktail bar) packed 
           with LAUGHING COUPLES downing COLORFUL DRINKS, reveling 
           in the divine miracle of each other’s company. 

           Who gives a shit.

           Instead, we settle on the ONLY LONER in the place--our 
           proverbial GIRL LOOKING FOR LOVE (20s)--propped on a bar 
           stool, ready to make the dating world her bitch. 

                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        On the surface, dating apps are a 
                        game changer. Hell, she can find 
                        the perfect guy from the comfort 
                        of her own phone! 

           Sure enough, she scans the room for the BRO ON HER PHONE--
           until, alas, that very BRO approaches. 

                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        And she’ll go into the date 
                        optimistic. After all, this could 
                        be her soulmate--you know, the one 
                        long foretold by Disney musicals 
                        and the college intern writing 
                        horoscopes for People Magazine.

           They sit, skim the cocktail menu, make SMALL TALK. 

                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        But the minute he mentions he 
                        doesn’t like tacos...

           She SWIPES HER HAND in midair and, with that, he becomes 
           a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DUDE.

                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        ...or that he thinks E.D.M. is the 
                        new Rock & Roll...

           She SWIPES AGAIN. New GUY.
                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        ...or he recently subscribed to a 
                        microbrew-of-the-month club...
                  (SWIPE)
                        ...or he saw Furious 7 at midnight...
                  (SWIPE)
                        ...and it made him cry...
                  (SWIPE)
                        ...he’s a goner. Look, it’s Twenty- 
                        Sixteen. She’s a modern woman with 
                        a hundred other hot guys burning a 
                        hole in her pocket, and a million 
                        better things to do than swap war 
                        stories with a fuckboy.

           Our Girl SWIPES once more... and the stool is suddenly 
           occupied by a NORMAL, HANDSOME GENT. She LIGHTS UP. 

                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        And say she does find someone 
                        worth a second date. 70 percent of 
                        those assholes--and we ran the 
                        numbers on this--are just trying 
                        board the midnight train through 
                        Pound Town and never look back. 

           As he brazenly rests his hand on her thigh, she SWIPES 
           him off the stool, leaving it EMPTY. 

                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        And most of the riff-raff left 
                        over? They’ll only make textual 
                        contact in the pursuit of more 
                        sexual contact. 

           Her phone BUZZES with a text. OHIO MIKE: You up?

                                 NINA (V.O.)
                        Sure, there are plenty of fish in 
                        the sea. But these days, odds are 
                        she hangs herself with the line 
                        before catching something edible.

           She SIGHS, closing the text and pocketing the phone.  

                                 NINA
                        I’m not saying love exists. Only 
                        that there’s a market for it. So, 
                        now that the app’s out of the bag... 

           EXHAUSTED, she pulls herself off the stool, wandering 
           past all those impossibly HAPPY COUPLES, as we CUT TO--
           INT. PALO ALTO AIRPORT - PRIVATE HANGAR - NIGHT

           --a helluva LAUNCH PARTY in full swing: CALVIN HARRIS (or 
           is that Diplo?) mans the DJ BOOTH as an OPEN BAR fights 
           back a MILLENNIAL STAMPEDE. 

           APP DEVELOPERS mingle with newly-minted TECH MILLIONAIRES, 
           each taking a break from reinventing the wheel to get 
           shitfaced the old fashioned way. Above it all, a giant 
           BANNER insists: PLAN YOUR NEXT LAUNCH WITH LAUNCH!

           At one of the scattered high-top tables, NINA EMSER (28, 
           boss bitch) pontificates to a group of RAPT NERDS. 

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        ...the question becomes: how to 
                        you save this girl the headache? I 
                        mean, beyond cloning her, then 
                        sending the clone on those God-
                        awful first dates until it finds 
                        the perfect match.

           Nina LAUGHS. She’s kidding, of course. 

                                 ROMANTIC NERD
                        Wouldn’t that be nice!

                                 SUPER NERD
                        Allow me to interject. Nice? 
                        False. At best, it would be a 
                        dystopian nightmare. How would you 
                        dispose of said clone? Would it 
                        not have the presence of mind to 
                        anticipate its finite existence, 
                        and dispose of you first?
                  (to the Romantic Nerd)
                        So, in trying to find love, you’ve 
                        instead actualized your deepest, 
                        darkest fear: dying alone.

                                 NINA
                        Whoah, Dr. Doom. It was a joke--

                                 JULIAN (O.S.)
                        --Okayyy, we get it! You’re Nina 
                        Emser, the brilliant engineer 
                        behind the “swipe right”!

           She SPINS to find JULIAN (27, Kanye West if Kanye West 
           was a gay party planner), his fitted polo emblazoned with 
           the LAUNCH logo. 

                                 NINA
                        Don’t remind me. 
                                 JULIAN
                        I think you’re forgetting that 
                        tonight is MY night!

           They HUG. He hands over a cocktail.  

                                 NINA
                        I thought I’d seen it all, Jules, 
                        but a launch party for a company 
                        that plans launch parties...

                                 JULIAN
                        Do you even realize how many new 
                        apps launch in the Valley every 
                        day?? It’ll be like taking 
                        thousands of dollars from a baby. 
                        Is the shuttle too much?

           In the corner of the hangar, a few GEEKS snap pictures in 
           front of an actual SPACE SHUTTLE.

                                 JULIAN
                        It’s AMAZING what you can rent from 
                        the Air & Space Museum if you tell 
                        them you served in the Middle East.

                                 NINA
                        You were a bartender in Dubai. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Car bombs are car bombs, Nina. 
                        Mine just happened to be Irish.

                                 NINA
                  (re: the shuttle)
                        Just keep my sister away from it. 
                        I’ve seen her total a parked car.

           As if ON CUE--

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        Guys, this is the best day of my 
                        dog’s Instagram’s life!

           --HARPER (26, human hurricane) STORMS in, holding three 
           SHOT GLASSES in one hand and an adorable FRENCH BULLDOG 
           (”Wedgie”) in the other. 

                                 HARPER
                        Just got a picture of Wedgie in 
                        the cockpit of that sucker. 

                                 JULIAN
                        You went inside?? But it’s locked!
                                 HARPER
                        Yeah, and so was my ex’s iPhone. 

           She passes around the SHOTS, lifting hers for a toast.

                                 HARPER
                        To lunch!

                                 JULIAN
                        You mean Launch.

                                 HARPER
                        No I mean lunch. 
                  (off his look)
                        Don’t tell me you’re a breakfast 
                        person.

           She KNOCKS it back. Nina and Julian follow, reluctantly.

                                 HARPER
                        Why are you wasting time talking 
                        to each other? Look around. 
                        There’s so much purebred dick in 
                        this room they should call it the 
                        Ken-fuck-me Derby. 

                                 NINA
                        I paid off your student loans and 
                        still don’t believe you actually 
                        went to college.

                                 HARPER
                        I took baths with you as a kid and 
                        still don’t believe you actually 
                        have a vagina.

                                 NINA
                        I don’t see YOU getting after it.  

                                 HARPER
                        If you must know, I’ve kinda been 
                        seeing my hot hot yoga instructor. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Do you mean like really hot yoga? 
                        Or attractive hot yoga instructor?

                                 HARPER
                        Why can’t you just be happy for me?

                                 NINA
                        Just look at these morons. They 
                        all think they’re Mark Zuckerberg 
                        when they’re really Chris Hughes.
                                 JULIAN
                        Who’s Chris Hughes?

                                 NINA
                        Exactly. They wouldn’t invest in 
                        dinner and a movie if it had a ten 
                        billion dollar IPO. 

                                 HARPER
                        Neens. Neeners. Neentendo 64. 
                        You’re looking at the glass half-
                        douchey, when you should be 
                        looking at it half-cool.

                                 NINA
                        No, I’m looking at a glass full of 
                        tech guys when I’d rather drink 
                        bleach. 

                                 HARPER
                        Well if that isn’t the pot calling 
                        the kettle unfuckable...

                                 JULIAN
                  (to Nina)
                        You DID date Brad for four years.

                                 NINA
                  (sarcastic)
                        And that turned out wonderfully.

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah, it did. What do you call 
                        getting 20 million for your equity 
                        in Matcher? All I ever got from 
                        Mike was 15 bucks. And even that I 
                        had to take out of his wallet 
                        while he was sleeping.

                                 NINA
                        Well, it would’ve been 200 million 
                        if Brad hadn’t forced me out of 
                        our company before it went public. 
                        But I’m gonna show that bastard I 
                        can do it alone, even if I burn 
                        every cent designing my prototype.

                        launch whatever it is you’ve been 
                        designing in your evil lair that’s 
                        gonna “revolutionize dating”?

                        It’s been THREE YEARS, Nina. Blue 
                        Ivy couldn’t even walk when you 
                        started, and now she can dance.

                        Ooooo I bet it’s an app that 
                        translates what guys say into what 
                        they actually mean. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Like when they say “Let’s get food” 
                        but actually mean “I’m about to dump 
                        you in a Benihana parking lot.”

                        Or maybe she’s making fuzzy 
                        handcuffs, but instead, they’re just 
                        regular handcuffs--

                        haven’t seen you since my half-
                        birthday party at Dave & Busters. 

                                 NINA

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Nina, in sweats on a GRUNGY COUCH, watches “The 
           Bachelorette” and MUNCHES on a bag of popcorn.

                                 CHRIS HARRISON (ON TV)
                        Next week on The Bachelorette, 
                        will Luke find an Epipen in time 
                        save Zoe’s life during their 
                        romantic one-on-one date at the 
                        local bee sanctuary? 

           But... there’s something DIFFERENT about Nina. She 
           looks... prettier? Almost like the “after” version of the 
           nerd who gets a makeover in a 90s rom-com. Weird.

           Suddenly, the door into the garage SWINGS OPEN, and NINA--
           the one from the party--STUMBLES IN. What... the fuck?

           The girl on the couch--we’ll call her OTHER NINA--spins.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        “And to thee and thy company I bid 
                        a hearty welcome!”
                  (off her look)
                        “The Tempest”. 

                                 NINA
                        Knew I shouldn’t have given you wifi. 
                  (re: the TV)
                        You figure out which eligible 
                        bachelor Zoe should choose?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Ethan. 

                                 NINA
                        The guy who got drunk in that hot-air 
                        balloon and admitted he was sexually 
                        attracted to patio furniture??

                                 OTHER NINA
                        He appreciates good craftsmanship.
                                 NINA
                        He’s a DJ at a waterpark!

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Sure, but his face is perfectly 
                        symmetrical. 

           Other Nina’s torso emits a sudden BEEPING NOISE. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Should I be eating less of this?

           Nina lifts up the side of Other Nina’s shirt and pulls 
           out a large DRAWER-LIKE TRAY from her torso, brimming 
           with CHEWED POPCORN.

                                 NINA
                        No, it’s good. Mindless eating is 
                        uniquely human. I should’ve made 
                        this thing bigger. 

           She DUMPS the tray’s contents in a TRASH CAN. 

                                 NINA
                        What you SHOULD be doing is giving 
                        more weight to a guy’s profession 
                        than his jawline. Remind me to 
                        tweak your code.

           Nina SHOVES Other Nina’s “stomach” back into place. BEEP.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Why can’t I just watch “Titanic”? 
                        Jack--now there’s a male specimen.

                                 NINA
                        We’ve watched “Titanic” 11 times. 
                        That teaches you about the depth 
                        of human emotion, while “The 
                        Bachelorette” tests your ability 
                        to judge the keepers from the 
                        creepers. Which is your entire 
                        purpose, after all.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Just admit you like it too. 

                                 NINA
                        “Titanic” is the story of a 
                        wealthy, ambitious young woman who 
                        throws it all away for a fucking 
                        pretty boy, and literally doesn’t 
                        get over him until she’s a hundred-
                        and-one-years-old.

                        Just because it makes me cry every 
                        time, doesn’t mean I like it. 

           Nina FLIPS OFF the TV, motioning to a COUNTER TOP. 

                                 NINA
                        I promise we can watch it 
                        tomorrow. Tonight, however, your 
                        creator gave into a little human 
                        thing called “peer pressure” and 
                        it’s time for bed.

           Other Nina CLIMBS onto the counter and LAYS DOWN.

           With a LAUGH, Nina plugs what resembles an iPHONE CHARGER 
           into a HIDDEN PORT behind one of Other Nina’s ears and 
           presses a HIDDEN POWER BUTTON behind the other... putting 
           her robot to sleep.  

           INT. NINA’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           As an iPhone RINGS on the bedside table, Nina’s ARM 
           emerges from the sheets, putting the call on SPEAKER. 

                                 HAROLD (ON SPEAKER)
                        Nina, hi. We’ve got a big problem.

           Her GROGGY HEAD appears.

                                 NINA
                        Yeah, my accountant calling me at

           INT. HAROLD’S SLEEK OFFICE - SAME TIME

           HAROLD (50s, sleeps in his suit) POWER WALKS on his 
           retrofitted TREADMILL DESK, speaking into a headset, 
           Facebook pulled up on his iMac.
                                 HAROLD 
                        This is serious, okay? My ex-wife 
                        just sent me a friend request. 

                                 NINA
                        Wow. Aggressive.

                                 HAROLD 
                        Do I accept it? I mean, I don’t 
                        need Heidi telling our kids that 
                        Daddy won’t be her friend. They 
                        already think I’m a monster for 
                        making them share an iPad after 
                        Atlas left his in an Uber.
                  (SIGH)
                        That’s the last time I let HIM 
                        rideshare to kindergarten. But, 
                        Nina, this is the woman who 
                        intentionally fucked my favorite 
                        sommelier and then took half my 
                        houses. Excuse meeee if I’d prefer 
                        not to be constantly reminded 
                        she’s still alive.

                                 NINA
                        Why don’t you just accept her 
                        request then hide her posts from 
                        your newsfeed?

                                 HAROLD 
                        And THAT’s why Fast Company called 
                        you a savant! But it’s not why I 
                        rang. How do I say this... you’re 
                        running out of money. 

                                 NINA
                        Or so you’ve told me.

                                 HAROLD
                        Let me put it a different way: 
                        you’re almost out of money. Two 
                        more months and you will be out of 
                        money. Whatever you’ve been 
                        working on, it needs to be ready 
                        for market. And quick.

                                 NINA
                        Well, that’s not really how it 
                        works, Harold. It’s not even ready 
                        to be field tested. 

                                 HAROLD
                        You don’t want to go broke, Nina.

                        worst two weeks of my life. I had 
                        to sell one of my horses just to 
                        go on vacation until I was rich 
                        again. I miss Butterscotch every

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

           As Nina WILLS her hangover through the door, we may start 
           to notice this ain’t your everyday garage: HIGH-TECH 
           EQUIPMENT lines the walls... some COMPUTER PARTS lay 
           strewn about... SECURITY CAMERAS keep watch.

           She YANKS open a MINI-FRIDGE labeled “Soylent”, SNAGGING 
           a bottle and CHUGGING it dry before pushing Other Nina’s 
           POWER BUTTON, the slumbering machine SPRINGING to life.

                                 NINA
                        Good news and bad news. Bad news 
                        is we’re not watching “Titanic”. 
                        Good news is we’re going to start 
                        your field testing.

                        Well, “ready” is relative. Let me 
                        show you something.

           She leads Other Nina to the far wall, opening a CLOSET. 

           Other Nina GASPS... because she’s staring at HERSELF. 
           Well, another version of herself (BETA NINA, as it were) 
           in a LIFELESS BALL, her head BASHED IN and one arm TORN 
           from its socket, like she tried to wrestle a speeding bus.

                        No. I thought you--she--was ready, 
                        so to ease her in, I brought her 
                        to the Mecca of the human 
                        experience: a shopping mall. Next 
                        thing I know, she’s trying to

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - PRESENT DAY

           Other Nina listens in SHOCK. 

                                 NINA
                        ...And after we were forcibly 
                        removed, she martyred herself by 
                        jumping off the roof of the 
                        parking garage. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I’m not going to jump off a roof.

                                 NINA
                        I know you’re not. I fixed that 
                        flaw in your A.I. And that’s a good 
                        thing because, frankly, we don’t 
                        have time to be careful anymore.

           She pulls out her phone, opening the APP STORE.

                                 NINA
                        Never thought I’d do this...

           She downloads MATCHER, clicking “Create Your Profile”.

                        What’s a stupid but popular 
                        Marilyn Monroe quote?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        “Give a girl the right pair of 
                        shoes and she’ll conquer the

                                 NINA
                        We ran the numbers... girls who 
                        make their bio something innocuous  
                        said by Marilyn or Audrey Hepburn 
                        or Coco Chanel get swiped right 
                        60% more than anyone who includes 
                        actual biographical details.

                        You’ll quickly learn the outside 
                        world’s a superficial garbage swamp.

           A BEAT as Nina picks out a couple FLATTERING PICTURES. 

                                 NINA
                        We just need the bare essentials 
                        to ensure some dates. And then 
                        you’re engineered to make a 
                        perfect first impression.
                  (off her look)
                        Everyone tries to present the best 
                        possible version of themselves on 
                        a first date, right? They try to 
                        act smarter, look better... why do 
                        you think I gave you Wikipedia and 
                        an extra cup size?

                        Hell no. I’m not actually trying 
                        to find a soulmate. Just need to 
                        make sure you work before I take 
                        money from people who are. 

           Other Nina starts SWIPING, while her human twin snags a 
           screwdriver and two MICROCHIPS from a tabletop.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        No. No. Yes. No. Oooo this guy has 
                        letters from the Greek alphabet on 
                        his tank top. 
                  (reading)
                        Sigma... Chi. Do you think he’s a 
                        linguist?
                                 NINA
                        Far from it. Probably can’t spell 
                        his own name. But we’re playing a 
                        game of quantity, not quality.  

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Sure, but you programmed me with 
                        some standards. 

           Other Nina swipes LEFT on FRAT TANK GUY, while Nina 
           UNSCREWS a large panel from the bot’s back, revealing an 
           INTRICATE ARRAY of WIRES and CIRCUIT BOARDS.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        What are you doing back there?

                                 NINA
                  (showing her the chips)
                        This one lets me see what you see. 
                        And this one’s lets me track you. 

           Nina POPS the chips into a circuit, screws the panel SHUT. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        We’re already getting matches! 

                                 NINA
                        Just find one that seems normal 
                        and is free tonight.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        So NOT the guy that just asked me 
                        if I want to “fuck until we’re 
                        both paralyzed”?
                  (taking it literally)
                        Does that mean he’s already 
                        paralyzed? Or we’re both going to 
                        become paralyzed simultaneously? 
                        Furthermore, are we making love in 
                        the midst of a skiing accident? Or 
                        does he intend for his penis to 
                        literally sever my spinal column?
                  (moving on)
                        Hmmm what about this one?

           She shows her HENRY (30), a pleasant-looking chap. 

                                 NINA
                        Worth a shot...
           INT. NINA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Nina CLAWS through a PACKED closet. T-shirt. T-shirt. 
           Hoodie. T-shirt. Hoodie.

                                 NINA
                        It’s in here somewhere. 

           Other Nina watches on, NAKED as the day Nina built her. 
           But there’s nothing graphic--her body’s as FEATURELESS as 
           a mannequin. (Sorry to burst your bubble, but Other Nina 
           ain’t no sex robot.) 

           Nina lands on a COCKTAIL DRESS, tossing it to Other Nina.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Graduation dress?

                                 NINA
                        No, I wore overalls to graduation. 
                        This was a cousin’s wedding. 
                  (beat)
                        Humans are strange. Take marriage 
                        for instance... We fly across the 
                        country, get dressed up and then 
                        “congratulate” someone for setting 
                        flame to their personal freedom.

           Other Nina starts PULLING it on. 

                                 NINA
                        Dear parents everywhere: how about 
                        you spend 50 grand on a party when 
                        your daughter becomes a CEO. Or a 
                        doctor. Not just because she 
                        decided to trade the lifetime 
                        rights to her vagina for a 
                        glistening finger trinket--

           A GASP as she takes in Other Nina, STUNNING in the dress. 

                                 NINA
                        Damn... Is it weird that I feel proud?

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - LATER

           Parked curbside, Nina and Other Nina PLOT the next move. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        What if he asks me where I’m from? 
                        Or about my family?
                                 NINA
                        I transcribed my old journals into 
                        your hard drive. There should be 
                        plenty of context in there.   
                  (beat)
                        I’ll be watching through your eyes 
                        on this. 

           She flips open a LAPTOP. 

                                 NINA
                        If he gets weird, you can leave. 
                        If anything makes you feel 
                        uncomfortable--

                                 OTHER NINA
                  (ready to go)
                        --I can leave.

                                 NINA
                        And when you’re finished, just 
                        tell him your Uber’s arrived, and 
                        I’ll pull up right here. Here’s my 
                        ID and debit card. You pay. I 
                        don’t want any jackasses claiming 
                        they helped fund my R&D... Also--
                        ya know--feminism.

           She pulls in Other Nina for a WARM HUG.

                                 NINA
                        Good luck. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        It’s just a date.

                                 NINA
                        Yeah, and dates are hard for 
                        humans, much less androids. 

           Other Nina WRIGGLES free, HOPPING out. Free at last!

           INT. NERO’S WINE BAR - NIGHT

           Our curious robot SAUNTERS into the DIMLY LIT space, 
           greeted by a SASSY HOSTESS.

                                 SASSY HOSTESS
                        Good evening, welcome to Nero’s.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Are you my waiter?
                                 SASSY HOSTESS
                        No I’m the hostess.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        So you’re the waiter’s apprentice? 

                                 SASSY HOSTESS
                        Sure. Do you have a reservation?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Yes. Under Henry. 

                                 SASSY HOSTESS
                        Henry...? Henry Harris?
                  (pointing)
                        The gentleman there?

           At a rear table, HENRY (more DISHEVELED than his profile) 
           gives a SHY WAVE.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        You’re sharp. I can tell you’ll 
                        make a fine waiter one day. 
                  (beat)
                        Do I tip you?

                                 SASSY HOSTESS
                        No...

           With that, Other Nina crosses the CROWDED room, STARING 
           at PATRONS like exotic animals, making uncomfortable EYE 
           CONTACT and giving a few awkward “hello’s.” 

           At last, she reaches a NERVOUS Henry, who stands for a 
           cringe-worthy SIDE-HUG. 

                                 HENRY
                        Nina. Wow. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Henry. You’re older and more dirty 
                        than in your pictures. Did you 
                        recently return from war? Thank 
                        you for your service.

                                 HENRY
                        No I... I guess I didn’t have any 
                        recent shots I liked--please, sit!

           A DEPRESSED WAITER (20s) bellies up to the table. 

                                 DEPRESSED WAITER
                        Welcome to Nero’s. I’m James, and 
                        I’ll be--
                                 OTHER NINA
                        --Our waiter!

                        Much to my father’s disappointment.

           Other Nina LAUGHS, as the Waiter contemplates suicide. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Sorry. First I get to meet a 
                        waiter, and then to see Carl 
                        Jung’s “father complex” playing 
                        out in real life... dating is fun!

                        I mean. You shared something

                        during grade school back in

                        Free wine that they just hand you. 
                        And the art’s probably some awful 
                        post-modern nonsense, but even 
                        finger paintings would be an

                        Well, he’s not in tech, thank God. 
                        He owns a food truck... moved out 
                        here from Nashville on a whim... 
                        knows the difference between a 
                        Baldassari and a Basquiat, but not 
                        HTML and XML. Honestly...
                  (just realizing)
                        ...it’s refreshing. 

           Oh shit... is Nina into Connor?

                                 HARPER
                        Sounds like you found a fuckin’ 
                        needle in the bae stack. How was 
                        the sex?

                                 NINA
                        Thaaat I didn’t find out. 
                                 HARPER
                        The hell are you waiting for?? Him 
                        to list his dick as one of his 
                        food truck’s daily specials?

                                 NINA
                        No. I just... can’t get distracted. 
                        Especially not right now.

                                 HARPER
                        How long have we known each other?

                                 NINA
                        Um. Our whole lives...?

                                 HARPER
                        Exactly. And this whole time, 
                        you’ve been so laser focused on 
                        trying to change the world, you’ve 
                        never ONCE tried to have fun. 

                                 NINA
                        C’mon, that’s not fair! I was a 
                        fun big sister.

                                 HARPER
                        You built motion sensors into our 
                        chimney to prove there was no Santa.
                  (beat)
                        Point is... fuck this guy, enjoy 
                        fucking him, wake up the next 
                        morning in his--what I’m imagining 
                        to be--gorgeous arms and THEN go 
                        back to engineering the future.

           She SNAGS the CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE from the Waiter...

                                 HARPER
                  (to Nina)
                        You’ll Venmo me for half, right?

           ...and POPS IT!

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - NIGHT

           On her laptop, Nina watches through Other Nina’s POV as 
           she GLIDES into Big Juan’s backyard...

           The QUINCEANERA’s in FULL SWING--complete with STRING 
           LIGHTS, BALLOONS, a fully stocked TEQUILA BAR, and an 
           AMATEUR DJ (aka the MEXICAN NEIGHBOR BOY doing his best 
           Mark Ronson impression).  
           Nina PERKS UP as her robot’s POV spots Connor through the 
           CROWD of tipsy PARENTS and gangly TEENS.

           EXT. BIG JUAN’S BACKYARD - SAME TIME

           Connor FIGHTS his way to Other Nina. 

                                 CONNOR
                        You made it!

           Other Nina hands him a WRAPPED GIFT.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Something for...

                                 CONNOR
                        Maria. Too kind. 
                  (shaking the gift)
                        Don’t tell me you’re the one who 
                        outbid me on eBay for that lock of 
                        Justin Bieber’s hair.

           She LAUGHS as Connor GRABS Big Juan’s arm. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Juan, you remember Nina. 
                  (re: the gift)
                        She brought this for Maria.

                                 BIG JUAN
                        Ah, gracias!

           Other Nina replies in PERFECT SPANISH. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                  (English subtitles)
                        It’s Titanic on Blu-ray. Thought 
                        it might help Maria navigate her 
                        newfound womanhood. It did the 
                        trick for me.

                                 BIG JUAN
                        I’m sure she’ll love it.
                  (to Connor)
                        I didn’t know you had taste in 
                        women.

                                 CONNOR
                        ...Neither did I. 

           Suddenly, a HIP-HOP BANGER KICKS IN (think “Panda”). The 
           kids go completely APE SHIT--RAPPING along and making up 
           new DANCE MOVES in real time. 
                                 CONNOR
                        So you can speak Spanish, but can 
                        you speak the language of... dance?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I... no. I’ve never.
                  (catching herself)
                        I mean. I try to avoid it.

                                 CONNOR
                        C’mon. I bet you’re better than 
                        you think. It’s all in the hips. 
                        Or so I’ve been told by the “Step 
                        Up” franchise.

                                 OTHER NINA
                  (re: a dancing kid)
                        What do you call what he’s doing? 
                        Maybe I can do that.

                                 CONNOR
                        Oh... the robot? I’d like to see 
                        you try!

           He steps back, giving her space. Other Nina extends an 
           arm, letting her FOREARM fall at the ELBOW.

                                 CONNOR
                        Beginner move.

           She does the same with the OTHER ARM... but Connor’s none 
           too impressed. All the sudden, she finds a RHYTHM--bending 
           her KNEES, HIPS and WRISTS with MECHANICAL PRECISION. 

                                 CONNOR
                        What the...

           The song’s CHORUS IGNITES--and with it, Other Nina’s POPS 
           and LOCKS like her battery life depends on it. 

           Connor CAN’T BELIEVE IT, as a CIRCLE FORMS around Other 
           Nina, CHEERING ON her endless barrage of IMPOSSIBLE 
           MOVEMENTS... BENDING-TWISTING-TURNING-GLIDING. 

           As the SONG ENDS, the crowd EXPLODES with APPLAUSE. 
           Connor, FLABBERGASTED, gives a SLOW CLAP. 

                                 CONNOR
                        And where’d you learn that?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        It came naturally, I suppose. 
                                 CONNOR
                        Any MORE secrets I should know 
                        about?

           This HANGS THERE between them, as the DJ (aka Neighbor 
           Boy) picks up a microphone. 

                                 DJ AKA NEIGHBOR BOY
                        THIS TRACK GOES OUT TO ALL MY LIL 
                        HOMIES WHO NEED TO COOL DOWN AFTER 
                        THAT HOT ASS BITCH GONE AN’ BURNED 
                        UP THE BACKYAAARR--

                                 BIG JUAN
                  (Spanish, subtitled)
                        --JESUS CHRIST, RICKY, YOU GO TO 
                        PRIVATE SCHOOL. YOUR PARENTS WORK 
                        FOR GOOGLE. JUST HIT PLAY AND SHUT 
                        THE HELL UP. 

           The DJ motions “sorry” and THROWS ON a SLOW, ROMANTIC JAM 
           (think Adele). Connor EXTENDS a hand to Other Nina.

                                 CONNOR
                        Slum it with me for a box-step? 
                        Watch my feet.
                  (leading her)
                        One-two-three-four, one-two-three-
                        four, one-two-three-aaaand dip.

           Other Nina GIGGLES, delighted by this newfound game.  

                                 OTHER NINA
                        And where’d you learn this?

                                 CONNOR
                        The South loves its débutante balls.
                  (off her look)
                        Families down there have this 
                        weird tradition of spending 
                        thousands of dollars on a party 
                        just to introduce their daughters 
                        to prospective suitors...

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - SAME TIME

           Nina STARES through the android’s eyes into Connor’s.

                                 CONNOR (ONSCREEN)
                        ...Shit, I say throw a party when 
                        she graduates college or gets 
                        promoted, you know?
                                 NINA
                        Oh... I know.

           She LEANS IN to the laptop as Other Nina gets even closer 
           to Connor... the TENSION BUILDING toward history’s first 
           man-on-android kiss... WHEN SUDDENLY--

           EXT. BIG JUAN’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           --THE MUSIC CUTS, and the party TURNS ITS EYES toward Big 
           Juan, who HOISTS a GIANT PIÑATA (a DONKEY wearing a 
           festive SOMBRERO) into the air. 

                                 DJ AKA NEIGHBOR BOY
                        TIME TO BEAT SOME ASSSSSS!

                                 BIG JUAN
                  (Spanish)
                        I SWEAR TO GOD, RICKY! 

           Other Nina and Connor PULL AWAY from each other, 
           disappointed. Big Juan holds out a WOODEN STICK. 

                                 BIG JUAN
                        Who’s first?

           As the BIRTHDAY GIRL moves in, the BIGGEST KID in the 
           bunch--a PUDGY little fucker--BOXES HER OUT, grabbing the 
           stick and motioning for the BLINDFOLD. Big Juan 
           begrudgingly TIES IT ON, giving him a spin. 

                                 BIRTHDAY GIRL
                        Spin him extra!!

           Her father obliges--WINDING him like a TOP--as Other 
           Nina, Connor and the rest of the party CROWD AROUND the 
           piñata. BLIND and WOBBLING, the Pudgy Little Fucker cocks 
           back the stick for a BIG SWING...

           A HUSH falls over the crowd... WOOOOOOSH and... CLAAANK--
           he makes contact with OTHER NINA’S ARM! Onlookers GASP, 
           as Other Nina YELPS, grabbing at the point of impact.

                                 PUDGY LITTLE FUCKER
                  (still blindfolded)
                        Did I do it? Did I bust the burro??

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - SAME TIME

           Nina’s HORRIFIED as, onscreen, Other Nina checks the 
           damage--a piece of her synthetic skin HANGS OFF, exposing 
           her arm’s WIRES and TITANIUM. 
                                 NINA
                        SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT--

           She presses the IGNITION. 

           EXT. BIG JUAN’S BACKYARD - SAME TIME

           Connor RUSHES to Other Nina’s side, as she HIDES HER ARM 
           under her free hand. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Are you okay??

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I’m fine, yes. I should just--I 
                        should go.

                                 CONNOR
                        Lemme take a look! It might be 
                        fractured.

           He REACHES for her, she RECOILS. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        No! No--seriously. I’m fine. I’ve 
                        had a great time, but I should go. 
                        Home. It’s late. 
                  (sotto)
                        That’s something people say right?

                                 CONNOR
                        What?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Call me.
                  (sotto)
                        Nailed it.

           With that, she SCURRIES out of the party, leaving Connor 
           STARING after her.

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - LATER

           Nina holds what looks like a high-tech GLUE GUN to Other 
           Nina’s arm, fixing the TEAR in her skin. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        You don’t think I ruined it, do 
                        you? I really like him.
                                 NINA
                        That’s a great sign.
                  (off her look)
                        The actual users won’t be watching 
                        in real time like me--they’ll be 
                        going about their lives. Sure, 
                        they can go back and skim the 
                        dates, but when you “like” a guy, 
                        that’s the true testament. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Right. Because I’m just a product 
                        and my feelings don’t matter.

                                 NINA
                        No... I’m just saying you’ve come 
                        a long way since cliff diving off 
                        a parking structure. Might even be 
                        time to put a switch to the test.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        What? No! Let me go on another 
                        date with him.

                                 NINA
                        We’ll see...

                                 OTHER NINA
                        We’ll see??

                                 NINA
                        We’ll see if Connor even calls! 
                        Between the second and third date 
                        is prime ghosting territory. 
                  (off her look)
                        “Ghosting” is when instead of 
                        ending things, a guy just cuts off 
                        all communication and disappears.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        But don’t ghosts haunt people? 
                        Technically, shouldn’t “ghosting” 
                        be when a guy refuses to leave your 
                        house, and then keeps sneaking up 
                        on you in the dark?

                                 NINA
                  (LAUGHING)
                        Yes... technically. I guess this 
                        is more like “evaporating.” 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Is that what Brad did to you?
                                 NINA
                        No, Brad went a more creative 
                        route and had his attorney dump me 
                        over e-mail. And they say 
                        chivalry’s dead!

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I’m still getting a handle on 
                        human interaction, but you must 
                        have done something to upset him.

                                 NINA
                        Hardly! A few magazines put me on 
                        the cover and gave me credit for 
                        coming up with Matcher’s swiping 
                        feature--which I did!--and next 
                        thing I know I’m being accused of 
                        creating a “hostile work 
                        environment.” Buuuut that’s enough 
                        bedtime story for one night.

           Other Nina RECLINES on the counter, Nina PLUGGING her in.  

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I hope Connor doesn’t evaporate.

           Nina gives a SMILE, POWERING DOWN her beautiful machine. 

                                 NINA
                        Me too...

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - LATER

           Nina LOUNGES on the couch, watching “The Bachelorette”. 

                                 ZOE (ON TV)
                        Before I came on this show, I 
                        didn’t think love existed. But 
                        then I met YOU, and learned about 
                        the selfless work you do as seeing-
                        eye human to blind dogs.

                                 FRANCO (ON TV)
                        Just because they can’t see 
                        shouldn’t mean they can’t fetch.

           They KISS, as Nina FLIPS OFF the TV with a SIGH. 

           Suddenly, her phone starts BUZZING... it’s CONNOR. 

           Nina freezes, STARING at it. She shoots a glance at Other 
           Nina, ASLEEP... then back at the PHONE... then back at 
           OTHER NINA. Conflicted, she ANSWERS IT.
                                 NINA
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. CONNOR’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Connor’s UNPACKING boxes, phone to his ear.

                                 CONNOR
                        Hey! So I know calling right after 
                        a date isn’t the chill thing to do, 
                        and I should really wait a couple 
                        days and then “like” a few of your 
                        Instagrams just to confuse you. But 
                        I’m a rule breaker. I don’t know if 
                        you knew that about me.

                                 NINA
                  (smitten)
                        I didn’t know that about you. 

                                 CONNOR
                        You’re not the only one with 
                        secrets, Miss Rosetta Stone. How’s 
                        the arm?

                                 NINA
                        Better... I think I’ll get away with 
                        a bruise. I overreacted, sorry.

                                 CONNOR
                        No, I’M sorry. And hey, to make it 
                        up to you, I got us a reservation 
                        tomorrow night. You like Thai? 
                        Thinkin’ we could catch the new 
                        Denzel flick after. 

                                 NINA
                  (shocked)
                        Dinner and a movie?

                                 CONNOR
                        Yeah... not your speed?

                                 NINA
                        No, I... Sure, yeah. Yes! I’m in.

           Nina HANGS UP, staring at Other Nina... her GUILT slowly 
           overtaken by EXCITEMENT.

           In QUICK CUTS, she spends the next day getting ready for 
           her first date in... well, years:
           --IN A DEPARTMENT STORE, Nina stares at a rack of 
           cocktail dresses, flanked by a BORED EMPLOYEE.

                                 NINA
                        What should I wear if... I want to 
                        impress... a man. 

                                 BORED EMPLOYEE
                        You trying to get a job, get laid 
                        or both?

                                 NINA
                        Both??

           --IN A DRYBAR, a PEPPY STYLIST gives Nina a BLOW OUT. 

                                 NINA
                        ...and some girls do this EVERY 
                        DAY before work?

                                 PEPPY STYLIST
                        Before work, before the gym--

                                 NINA
                        --BEFORE THE GYM??

           --IN HER BATHROOM, Nina watches a YOUTUBE MAKEUP 
           TUTORIAL. Onscreen, an ASIAN VLOGGER (15) applies 
           mascara, Nina copying her every move. 

                                 ASIAN VLOGGER (ONSCREEN)
                        ...And whatever you do, don’t get 
                        any in your eye. It stings! Hehe.

                                 NINA
                  (getting some in her eye)
                        Ahhhhhhh fuuuuuck! 

           --IN HER BEDROOM, Nina stands in front of a MIRROR, fully 
           dressed and made-up, looking STUNNING (aka: exactly like 
           Other Nina). She nervously practices GREETING CONNOR.

                                 NINA
                  (miming a handshake)
                        Connor, hey! No.
                  (a hug)
                        So good to see you... again. No.  
                  (kiss on the cheek)
                        I’ve been thinking about you. 
                        Creepy. 

           She glances at a CLOCK.
                                 NINA
                        Shit!

           EXT. THAI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Nina spots Connor on the sidewalk, BRACING HERSELF. 

                                 NINA
                        Heyyyy... bro.
                  (sotto)
                        Dammit.

           She goes for an AWKWARD HANDSHAKE, but Connor brings her 
           in for a HUG. Pulling apart--

                                 CONNOR
                        Were you about to shake my hand?
                  (off her look)
                        I’m sorry, are you a robot? And 
                        what have you done with Nina?

           Nina FREEZES, speechless. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Kidding! But you do look... 
                        different.

                                 NINA
                  (worried)
                        I do?

                                 CONNOR
                        Yeah, don’t get me wrong, you 
                        usually you look great. But 
                        tonight? You look amazing. 

           She’s TAKEN ABACK, as he opens the door for her.

                                 CONNOR
                        Shall we?

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER - LATER

           Nina and Connor stroll out, LAUGHING. 

                                 CONNOR
                        ...who would’ve thought the 
                        President’s DOG would turn out to 
                        be the ISIS operative?
                                 NINA
                        I mean, the movie was called 
                        “Domestic Terrier-ism”. 

                                 CONNOR
                        I just never thought something so 
                        cute could be radicalized. Really 
                        makes you think.

           They reach Connor’s PICKUP. 

                                 CONNOR
                        So am I dropping you off, or...?

                                  SMASH CUT:

           INT. CONNOR’S APARTMENT - LATER

           The door FLIES OPEN, Connor and Nina MAKING OUT and 
           TEARING at each other’s clothes like a couple of Charlie 
           Buckets at a Wonka Bar. 

                                 NINA
                        I never do this on a first date.

                                 CONNOR
                  (confused)
                        Good thing it’s our third date...

                                 NINA
                        Right! Exactly. Which is why I’m 
                        doing it--do you have a condom?

                                 CONNOR
                        Yeah, somewhere...

           He motions into the VAST space, full of MOVING BOXES. 

                                 NINA
                        Must say, diggin’ the U-Haul 
                        aesthetic. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Hey! You’ve kept me busy. Though I 
                        did set up the bed...
                  (re: boxes)
                        You start there. I’ll start here.

           They DIG IN, Nina pulling out a giant framed, autographed 
           poster of a YOUNG REBA MCENTIRE.

                                 NINA
                        Who ARE you?
                                 CONNOR
                        It’s ironic!

                                 NINA
                        No it’s not.

                                 CONNOR
                  (caught)
                        No... it’s not. I love Reba. 

           Going DEEP into his box, Connor pulls out some TROJANS. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Found ‘em!

                                 NINA
                        Should I bring Reba with, or...

           INT. CONNOR’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Nina ROLLS OVER, reaching for Connor... but he’s GONE. 

           As her eyes adjust, the REBA POSTER levitates into view 
           (Connor holding it, hiding behind the side of the bed).

                                 CONNOR (O.S.)
                  (Reba impression)
                        I had a Reba good time last night.

                                 NINA
                  (fighting back laughter)
                        That’s going to haunt me for my 
                        McEntire life. 

           Connor REVEALS HIMSELF, holding a plate of SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Please allow Chef Tilton to make 
                        it up to you. 
                  (handing them over)
                        Huevos revueltos con pimientos 
                        fantasmas. 

           She SCRUNCHES her face, pretending to understand Spanish. 

                                 CONNOR
                  (off her look)
                        Hey, I’m still learning. Try ‘em. 

                                 NINA
                        Fine. Then I have to get to work.
                                 CONNOR
                        You still haven’t told me what it 
                        is you’re working on...

                                 NINA
                        You wouldn’t believe me if I did. 

           She DIGS IN, chewing... her face slowly fading from 
           DELIGHT into TERROR. 

                                 NINA
                        Ohhh sweet Jesus, what’s in this??
                  (panting)
                        My mouth... fire...

                                 CONNOR
                        Pimientos fantasmas! Ghost peppers!
                  (off her growing PANIC)
                        What happened to the girl that 
                        housed a Tear Jerker without 
                        blinking??

                                 NINA
                        She’s not a morning person! Do you 
                        have any water??

                                 CONNOR
                        I have something even better!

           He KISSES HER... and KEEPS KISSING HER, rolling onto her.

                                 NINA
                        I think--
                  (kiss)
                        --it’s--
                  (kiss)
                        --working!

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - LATER THAT MORNING

           Nina’s ALL SMILES, driving as the phone RINGS on SPEAKER. 

                                 JULIAN (ON SPEAKER)
                  (answering)
                        And to what do I owe this carnal 
                        pleasure??

                                 NINA 
                        Heyyy man. First of all--congrats. 
                        Launch is kind of blowing up, huh?
           INT. LAUNCH OFFICES - SAME TIME

           Julian takes Nina’s call on a WIRELESS HEADSET, pacing 
           through an OPEN BULLPEN of TRENDY EMPLOYEES.

                                 JULIAN
                        Thanks girl! It’s cray-cray. 
                        Verging on the rare triple cray. 
                        What’s up?
                  (listening)
                        Sweet baby Jesus, finally! Look--

           A NERVOUS STAFFER interrupts. 

                                 NERVOUS STAFFER
                        --Hey Jules, I found a guy that 
                        can get us Tupac for the 
                        Vinstagram launch...

                                 JULIAN
                        Like the Tupac hologram?

                                 NERVOUS STAFFER
                        Well, it’s actually a hologram of 
                        the Tupac hologram. I guess the 
                        hard-drive that they were using to 
                        store the original Tupac hologram 
                        got shot-- 

                                 JULIAN
                        --I don’t give a shit, Xander, as 
                        long as it can wear a do-rag and 
                        sing “California Love”.
                  (back into the headset)
                        Look, Nina, I’m all for secrecy, 
                        but if I’m going to agree to 
                        launch this thing, I need to know 
                        what you’ve been working on. You 
                        get it, boo-boo. 
                  (listening)
                        Of course I won’t tell Harper. 
                        Every time she opens her mouth, 
                        there’s either a sworn secret 
                        coming out or a dick going in.
                  (listening)
                        You’re WHAT? It does HUH? Don’t 
                        you lie to me now. DAYYYUUM GIRL. 
                        This is a life saver actually--we 
                        just had a cancellation. Can you 
                        be ready by this Saturday?

           Nina’s TORN.

                                 NINA
                        Whoah... that soon? The platform 
                        still needs some work... but hell, 
                        okay. Let’s do it!

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - LATER

           Nina excitedly WAKES UP Other Nina. 

                                 NINA
                        Great news!! You work. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Thank you?

                                 NINA
                        I mean, you worked. Connor. He 
                        totally bought it. So we’re going 
                        to launch next--

                                 OTHER NINA
                        --Wait... he didn’t evaporate?

                                 NINA
                        He did not. Quite the opposite. He 
                        stayed... rock hard.

           Other Nina LURCHES from the counter.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Wait... are you insinuating... you 
                        SLEPT with him?? How could you??

                                 NINA
                        It just sorta happened! One minute 
                        we’re watching Denzel Washington 
                        run down a Jack Russell in a 
                        suicide vest... then BOOM. 
                  (beat)
                        This was always the plan! It just 
                        means you made a real connection! 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        But I LIKED him! I told you I did!
                                 NINA
                        Liked him? No. A very specific 
                        series of ones and zeroes gave you 
                        an artificial sensation of 
                        happiness when around him.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        But you said you weren’t looking 
                        for a soulmate! 

                                 NINA
                        Because “soulmate” is a concept 
                        invented by alcoholic ad execs in 
                        the ‘50s to sell hair curlers. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        ACTUALLY it’s a concept first 
                        described in Plato’s “Symposium”.

                                 NINA
                        I need to change the Wifi password.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        So you’re not going to see him 
                        again, right? ...Right??

                                 NINA
                        He invited me paintballing 
                        tonight... it sounded fun! Well, 
                        mostly scary but also fun. What 
                        did you want me to say??

                                 OTHER NINA
                        This isn’t FAIR. 

                                 NINA
                        Welcome to the human race. LIFE’s 
                        not fair! Maybe I should power you 
                        down, let you cool off. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Stop talking to me like a computer!

                                 NINA
                        You ARE a computer!!

           Other Nina grabs her CHARGER and Nina’s CAR KEYS.

                                 NINA
                        What the hell are you doing??

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Getting him back!
           She SCURRIES to the door, but it’s LOCKED. She SLAMS her 
           shoulder into it--the lock BUSTS and the door FLIES OPEN. 

           EXT. NINA’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Other Nina HOPS into the Prius, Nina GIVING CHASE.

                                 NINA
                        STOP!!

           The car SKIDS out of the driveway--as Other Nina JAMS the 
           pedals haphazardly, finally SPEEDING AWAY. Watching in 
           terror, Nina SCRAMBLES, requesting an Uber. 

           EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

           The Prius--all over the road--finally SWERVES into a 
           space, nearly SIDE-SWIPING another parked car. Other Nina 
           jumps out, BUM RUSHING the restaurant.

           INT. UBER X - SAME TIME

           Nina’s in back with her LAPTOP OPEN, tracking Other 
           Nina’s location on half the screen, and watching through 
           her POV on the other. Her CREEPY UBER DRIVER (50s) floors 
           it, checking her out in the rear-view. 

                                 CREEPY UBER DRIVER
                  (thick accent)
                        Congratulations. You are prettiest 
                        woman I drive today. You like to 
                        have dinner? My house?

                                 NINA
                  (annoyed)
                        Turn left up here.

                                 CREEPY UBER DRIVER
                        I know what you think. He is Uber 
                        driver. I am princess. He can not 
                        give me happy life. Buy me jewelry 
                        and vacation. But you see, I drive 
                        Uber just for the fun. In real 
                        job, I make all the money.

           Other Nina STRADDLES the sink, watching in the mirror as 
           she carefully UNSCREWS the PANEL from her back. 
           POP--she slides it off, pulling out the two MIRCROCHIPS. 

           INT. UBER X - SAME TIME

           On the laptop, Other Nina’s POV goes BLACK and her GPS 
           dot DISAPPEARS, as Nina desperately hits keys.

                                 CREEPY UBER DRIVER
                        Do you like movie? I have the 
                        Netflick. Free 30-day trial. I 
                        will show you after dinner. 

           Nina SLAMS the laptop shut. 

                                 NINA
                        FUUUCK.

                        I cook for you. Woman always cook. 
                        I say no! Not tonight. Take off the 
                        shoe. Let me take the coat. Relax. 
                        Here is vodka. I make myself. From 
                        potato in basement--

                        Remember to give five star--

           SLAM.  

           INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Nina BURSTS IN. But... it’s EMPTY.

                                 NINA
                        Shit. Shit. Shit!

           She spots her CAR KEYS on the counter. 

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - LATER

           Nina’s driving around the city, SEARCHING for Other Nina. 
           Her phone starts RINGING, she puts it on speaker.

                        Now’s not a good time Harold. 
           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. KOREAN NAIL SALON - SAME TIME

           Harold’s in the middle of a PEDICURE.

                                 HAROLD
                        You know I wouldn’t call you if it 
                        wasn’t important. Heidi got Atlas 
                        a new iPad, and he used it to set 
                        up a Kickstarter called “help me 
                        buy a new dad.”

           Nina spots a PEDESTRIAN that looks like... Other Nina? 

                                 HAROLD
                        Hello? Do you have any idea how 
                        this makes me look? Not only does 
                        my four-year-old son hate me, but 
                        he doesn’t even feel comfortable 
                        asking me for money. Only poor 
                        people use Kickstarter. 

           Nina SLOWS to a crawl... but it’s NOT OTHER NINA. 

                                 HAROLD
                        Anyways, speaking of poor people, I 
                        just got an alert that you withdrew 
                        ten grand from your account.

           Nina SLAMS on the brakes. What??

                                 HAROLD 
                        And I said to myself, Nina 
                        wouldn’t do that--she knows that’s 
                        all the money she’s got left. Are 
                        you in trouble? Is it drugs? Oxy? 
                        Dermerol? Darvocet? Valium? 
                        Vicodin? Percocet? What? We’ve all 
                        been there.

                        And how will you be paying?

           Other Nina SMACKS down a PILE OF HUNDREDS, grinning.
                                 OTHER NINA
                        Cash. 

           On that note, we LAUNCH into a SHOPPING MONTAGE: 

           --IN A MIRROR, Other Nina models various purses. 

           --IN A DRESSING ROOM, she tries on sun dresses. 

           --IN TIFFANY & CO, she browses jewelry.

           --IN THE APPLE STORE, she snags a gold plated iPhone. 

           --CASH hits a counter. Again. And again. And AGAIN. 

           --ON THE STREET, she loads her stockpile of shopping bags 
           into a cab, the CABBIE staring on in AWE as...

           ...the MONTAGE ENDS. And--

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LATER

           --A BELLBOY helps Other Nina into the PALATIAL ROOM. 

                                 NINA
                        Do I tip you?

                                 BELLBOY
                        If you want...

                                 NINA
                        You know, there are plenty of hard 
                        parts about being a human, but the 
                        hardest might be figuring out when 
                        to tip. Show me to my room, tip. 
                        Show me to my table, don’t tip. 

           She slips him a TWENTY and LEAPS onto the bed, laying 
           down in ECSTASY. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        So THIS is what a bed feels like! 

           Thoroughly WEIRDED OUT, the Bellboy departs, leaving her 
           to turn on the TV and flip through PAY-PER-VIEW MOVIES.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Titanic... Titanic... Titanic...

           No Titanic. SIGHING, she rolls over, bored, grabbing her 
           APPLE bag and pulling out the new phone.  
           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - THAT NIGHT

           As the SUN SETS, Nina’s still searching the streets for 
           Other Nina. She notices the clock: 7:30.

                                 NINA
                  (remembering)
                        Shit, Connor.

           She pulls out her phone, DIALING.

           INT. INDOOR PAINTBALL ARENA - NIGHT

           Connor, covered in NEON SPLATTER, watches from the 
           sidelines as COMPETITORS attempt to out-Rambo one 
           another, paintballs WIZZING through the air. His phone 
           BUZZES: INCOMING CALL FROM NINA. 

                                 CONNOR
                        That’s weird.

           REVEAL: OTHER NINA, lifting her FACE MASK. 

                                 CONNOR
                        You must be butt dialing me.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Ugh, no, this kid stole my phone 
                        and keeps calling my contacts, 
                        trying to get me to buy it back.  
                  (motioning for it)
                        Here.

           Connor hands it over, she ANSWERS. 

           INTERCUT:

                                 NINA
                        CONNOR--hey--sorry I didn’t call 
                        earlier but I can’t--

                                 OTHER NINA
                        --Seriously, stop harassing my 
                        friends. I haven’t called the 
                        police yet because, honestly, I’d 
                        rather find you myself--

                                 NINA
                        --What are you--
                                 OTHER NINA
                        --And when I do, I’m going to set 
                        a recurring alarm on that phone 
                        and then force feed it to you, so 
                        every night at two a.m. when your 
                        stomach starts vibrating and wakes 
                        you up, you’ll be reminded of the 
                        time you decided to fuck with me. 

           Other Nina HANGS UP. Connor’s SHOCKED.

                                 CONNOR
                        Whoah.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Sorry... 
                  (re: paintball)
                        ...all this violence, I guess I 
                        felt inspired. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Kinda turned me on.

           She LAUGHS, typing in Connor’s phone.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Here’s my new number. Just ignore 
                        that old one if it calls. 

           A WHISTLE BLOWS, as Other Nina FLIPS DOWN her mask. 

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - SAME TIME

           One eye on the road, Nina searches Google Maps for the 
           paintball arena, pulling up DIRECTIONS. 

                                 NINA
                        Fuck it. 

           She PULLS A U-TURN. 

           INT. INDOOR PAINTBALL ARENA - LATER

           Connor and Other Nina READY THEMSELVES behind a BARRIER. 

                                 REFEREE
                        All right, final round of the 
                        night. Time to leave it all on the 
                        field. Problems at home? Your boss 
                        treating you like crap? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REFEREE (CONT'D)
                        That cute girl you met at the bar 
                        last week not texting you back 
                        even though, despite talking for 
                        less than five minutes, you could 
                        tell she was the one? Not a single 
                        response? Even after you found out 
                        where she worked and sent her a 
                        singing telegram?
                  (awkward beat)
                        This is your last chance to let 
                        that anger out. 

           The WHISTLE blows and the paint starts FLYING. 

           SPLAT--Connor gets NAILED in the face mask.

                                 CONNOR
                        Shit! Guess you’re goin’ it alone 
                        on this one. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        “The croaking raven doth bellow 
                        for revenge!”

                                 CONNOR
                        Took the words right out of my 
                        mouth. King Lear?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Hamlet.

           And SHE’S OFF--striding from BARREL to BARREL.

           THWIP-THWIP-THWIP. She MOWS DOWN a FATHER and SON. 

           NO FEAR as she dominates the field, SNIPING and DODGING, 
           paintballs WHIRRING BY. 

           She ROLLS into a FAUX-BUNKER, SPRINGING to her feet, face-
           to-face with ANOTHER GIRL, gun raised. It’s a tense STAND-
           OFF, until... 

           NINA lifts her mask. Other Nina MOVES TO SHOOT. 

                                 NINA
                        Hold on!

                                 OTHER NINA
                        He’s MINE. I liked him first!

                                 NINA
                        You can have him! I promise. All I 
                        care about is having you on that 
                        stage with me.
                                 OTHER NINA
                        What, so you win first place in 
                        the fucking science fair? I’ve 
                        heard your lies before, Nina.
                  (beat)
                        You know the best part about being 
                        an android? Feeling no pain.

           She GRABS Nina’s gun, pulling the trigger on HERSELF! 

           THWIP-THWIP-THWIP-THWIP. Raising her hands--

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I’M OUT!

           She back-pedals off the field, Nina watching, HELPLESS.

           INT. UBER X - LATER

           The car pulls up outside Connor’s building.

                                 CONNOR
                        Sorry I have to work so early. But 
                        them the breaks when you’re trying 
                        to corner the hungover-fratstars-
                        on-the-way-to-class market.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        One of these days I’m going to figure 
                        out how to get you all to myself. 

           He LAUGHS, unbeknownstly kissing an android goodnight. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LATER

           Other Nina stares at the ceiling, “The Parent Trap” 
           playing on TV. The LITTLE LOHAN CLONES hug each other 
           tight, as if bracing for the drug-addled shitshow to come. 

                                 LITTLE LOHAN #1 (ON TV)
                        Who?

                                 LITTLE LOHAN #2 (ON TV)
                        You’ve never heard of Leonardo 
                        DiCaprio?? How far away is London 
                        anyway?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        You should go to jail for not knowing 
                        who Leo is.
                  (LIGHTBULB)
                        Jail! If Nina... went to...
           She LEAPS from the bed.

           INT. SHITTY LIQUOR STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Other Nina strolls into the FLORESCENT GLOW of this run-
           down beer mart, EMPTY save for a GOOFY LOOKING GUY 
           manning the counter. 

           She gives a KNOWING LOOK at the SECURITY CAMERA before 
           approaching him, one hand in the pocket of her sweatshirt 
           like she’s GOT A GUN. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Empty the register.

                                 GOOFY LOOKING GUY
                        Whoah! Okay, just don’t shoot me! 

           He POPS open the register, starts pulling the cash. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I’m not going to shoot you. Just 
                        give me the money. 

                                 GOOFY LOOKING GUY
                        You don’t get it. A month ago, I’d 
                        be begging you to shoot me. Look 
                        at me. I look like I was attacked 
                        by a dog when I was baby. Multiple 
                        hookers have told me that. But I 
                        found love.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I’m so happy for you.

                                 GOOFY LOOKING GUY
                        Her name’s Karen. She lost her 
                        legs in a carnival accident, and 
                        sometimes she lets me roll around 
                        in her wheelchair while she 
                        watches TV. She’s the best thing 
                        that’s ever happened to me. I 
                        don’t even cry on the bus anymore. 

           He HANDS OVER the stack of bills. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Karen’s lucky to have met you...

                                 GOOFY LOOKING GUY
                        Mark.
                                 OTHER NINA
                        ...And so am I. 
                  (shaking his hand)
                        Nina Emser. And thank you.

           With that, she SPRINTS out of the store, as Mark moves 
           for the PHONE, shell-shocked.  

           INT. NINA’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           The real Nina JOLTS awake to a BANGING on her front door.

                                 POLICE (O.S.)
                        POLICE! OPEN UP!

           INT. NINA’S HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           She yanks open the door to two BURLY OFFICERS. 

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Nina Emser?

                                 NINA
                        Yes... what’s going on?

           The second officer whips out HANDCUFFS, slaps ‘em on her.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        Nina Emser, you are under arrest 
                        for armed robbery. You have the--

                                 NINA
                        --HAHA. Lemme guess, 
                        congratulatory strippers? Did 
                        Julian put you up to this?

           They YANK her toward the cruiser. This ain’t no Magic 
           Mike shit.

                                 NINA
                        Wait! Whoah. This is a mistake.

           Officer #1 pulls out a SCREENSHOT from the liquor store’s 
           security footage.

                                 OFFICER #1
                        What, you have an evil twin we 
                        should know about?

           Nina goes WHITE.
           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           Officer #1 loosens Nina’s CUFFS, points to a PHONE BANK. 

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Make it a good one.

           Nina pauses to THINK... before dialing.

                        Hey, it’s Nina. So... strangest 
                        thing happened. I got arrested... 
                        And I need you to bail me out.

           EXT. MAJESTIC GOLF COURSE - SAME TIME

           Harold LINES UP A PUTT with one hand, phone in the other, 
           while his children--ATLAS (4) and EYELET (6)--play on 
           iPads in the golf cart.

                                 HAROLD
                        Look, Nina--

                                 EYELET
                        --Can I putt for you, Daddy?

                                 HAROLD
                        No darling, Daddy wants the ball to 
                        go in the hole.
                  (into phone)
                        I’m not going to bail you out. I’m 
                        your accountant, not your boyfriend. 
                        You made that very clear when I 
                        called you drunk from Monaco. 

                                 NINA
                        I mean, if I’d known...

                                 HAROLD
                        You’re broke. And even if I DID 
                        keep a rainy day bail fund laying 
                        around, Heidi would’ve probably 
                        spent it freeing the Boston bomber.  
                  (to the kids)
                        If you tell your mother I said 
                        that I’ll throw your hoverboards 
                        in the ocean.

                                 NINA
                        I mean, I’ll pay you back--
                                 HAROLD
                        --Plus, I have the kids this 
                        weekend. Imagine if Heidi’s lawyer 
                        got wind that I brought them with 
                        me to a jailhouse. It’d be like 
                        the strip club all over again. We 
                        were just having lunch!
                  (beat)
                        You get it. 

           Nina HANGS UP, dejected. 

           INT. ORACLE ARENA - NIGHT

           Other Nina and Connor DESTROY a tray of nachos as the 
           GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS take a time-out. The score’s tied 
           with THREE SECONDS LEFT. Warrior’s ball. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Watch Ezeli. He’s going to clinch 
                        it with the bank shot.

                                 CONNOR
                        No way! They’re going to Curry. 

           Golden State INBOUNDS the ball to CURRY.  

                                 CONNOR
                        Told ya!

           But wait... Curry ROCKETS IT into the hands of FESTUS 
           EZELI, who LOBS it up... off the backboard... and IN! 
           WARRIORS WIN!! The place goes FUCKIN’ CUCKOO, confetti 
           filling the air. Connor’s BAFFLED.

                                 CONNOR
                        How...

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Steph Curry’s shooting an average 
                        of only 40% from the field. 
                        Meanwhile, Ezeli’s hardly wavered 
                        from 60% in the paint since March.  

                                 CONNOR
                        You said you never watch sports.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I’m a bit of a statistics junkie.
                                 CONNOR
                        Then tell me... what’s the 
                        percentage chance of you coming 
                        home with me tonight?

           Off her GRIN--

           INT. CONNOR’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Connor TOSSES Other Nina on the bed, UNZIPPING her jeans. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Wait! I need to tell you something. 
                  (bracing herself)
                        Promise you won’t freak out, okay?

                                 CONNOR
                        What? Is it, ya know, that time of 
                        the month...

                                 OTHER NINA
                  (going along with it)
                        Yeah! Yes. It is... sorry. Can we 
                        just... cuddle?

                                 CONNOR
                        Hell yeah! I’ll cuddle the shit 
                        out of you. You’ll feel so warm 
                        and fuzzy you’ll wish you never 
                        asked. Seriously, there’s no 
                        coming back from this.

           They roll over, LAUGHING.

           INT. POLICE STATION - NINA’S CELL - MORNING

           Nina, curled up on a ratty cot, ROUSES as her cell’s bars 
           CLANK OPEN. 

                                 OFFICER #1
                        You’re one lucky sonabitch.

                                 NINA
                        Really? Because it feels like I 
                        slept on rocks and woke up in a 
                        shitty episode of “Orange is the 
                        New Black.”

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Guy you robbed Googled you and 
                        changed his story. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)
                        Guess the sad sack met his girl on 
                        Matcher, feels like he owes you 
                        one. You’re free to go. 

           She CAN’T BELIEVE IT. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - FRONT LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           A CLERK hands Nina her belongings in a plastic bag. She 
           pulls out her PHONE, dials. 

                                 NINA
                        C’mon, Connor. Pick up.
                  (no answer)
                        SHIT. Alright... you want to have 
                        him? You’re gonna have to come to me.

           EXT. CONNOR’S FOOD TRUCK - LATER

           Nina steps up to window, Connor BRIGHTENS. 

                                 CONNOR
                        If it isn’t the cuddle connoisseur 
                        herself! Tear-jerker on the house?

                                 NINA
                        I’m more in the mild mood today. 
                        What are you up to tonight?

                                 CONNOR
                        Aren’t we checking out that new 
                        ramen spot?

                                 NINA
                        Right! Yeah, I know, but I was 
                        thinking... why spend twenty bucks 
                        on watery spaghetti when I could 
                        cook you dinner instead?

                                 CONNOR
                        Sure you’re up to that?

                                 NINA
                        I got into Stanford. I think I can 
                        handle a risotto. 

           They share a SMIRK. 
           INT. RAMEN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Other Nina PEERS around the restaurant, then at a 
           clock... Connor’s late. She pulls out her phone, DIALING. 

           INTERCUT:

           EXT. NINA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Connor HOPS OUT of his pickup, ANSWERING the phone.

                                 CONNOR
                        Well hello, pretty lady.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Hey handsome! Stuck behind another 
                        self-driving car?

                                 CONNOR
                        In fact, I’m mere MOMENTS away 
                        from ringing your doorbell. And 
                        the anticipation’s killing me.

                                 OTHER NINA
                  (realizing)
                        My door...?

                                 CONNOR
                        See ya in a couple clicks!

           He HANGS UP, as Other Nina stands in a HUFF to leave. 

           INT. NINA’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Nina mans the STOVE, passing Connor a spoonful of RISOTTO 
           for a taste test. He takes a cautious bite.

                                 CONNOR
                  (unconvincing)
                        Mmmmmmmmmmm!

                                 NINA
                        It’s terrible, isn’t it? I can 
                        take it.
                  (off his hesitation)
                        On a scale of one to wallpaper.

                                 CONNOR
                        Lead-based paint. 
                                 NINA
                        Hey! Kids used to love eating lead-
                        based paint.

           LAUGHING, Connor unzips his BACKPACK.  

                                 CONNOR
                        Nothing a little ground coriander 
                        and black pepper can’t fix.

                                 NINA
                        You brought herbs and spices??

                                 CONNOR
                        Teamwork makes the cuisine work.

           He stirs some MAGIC into the pan. 

                                 CONNOR
                        So I was perusing the ol’ tech 
                        blogs...

                                 NINA
                        As all the best food truck chefs 
                        are known to do.

                                 CONNOR
                        ...and you’re finally launching 
                        your company?? I know you don’t 
                        like to talk about work, but 
                        that’s HUGE, Nina.

                                 NINA
                  (taken aback)
                        Oh, yeah... I thought I told you!

                                 CONNOR
                        You didn’t! Shit, congrats! And 
                        lemme guess, I’m going to have to 
                        find out what it is just like 
                        everyone else?

                                 NINA
                        Well I wouldn’t want you thinking 
                        you’re special or anything...

           She KISSES him, abruptly changing the subject.

                                 NINA
                        How about the truck? Catching on?
                                 CONNOR
                        Honestly? No. Hot chicken isn’t 
                        exactly lighting the city on fire.  
                        Sometimes I wonder why I left... 

                                 NINA
                        Why DID you leave Nashville? And 
                        don’t give me any of that 
                        wanderlust millennial bullshit. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Well... not to get too deep, but I 
                        thought it was about time I used 
                        my God-given talents to enrich the 
                        world’s most bland risottos. 

                                 NINA
                  (laughing)
                        No, seriously! 

                                 CONNOR
                        It’s a long story!

                                 NINA
                        I love long stories! You’re 
                        talking to the senior class 
                        president who proposed the theme 
                        “Prom Quixote.”

                                 CONNOR
                        Well, my story isn’t so much about 
                        tilting windmills as it is about 
                        falling full-tilt in love with a 
                        pathological liar. 

           Nina’s no longer laughing. 

                                 CONNOR
                        You know, the classic boy meets

                        years, boy buys ring, plans to

                        Boy returns ring, buys food truck 
                        and starts new life in California.

                        Oh... boy.
                                 CONNOR
                        Yeah. So on the off chance a 
                        Corporal Andrew Kershaw ever 
                        calls, you do not know me. 
                  (LAUGHING)
                        But hey, if I’d never left, I 
                        would’ve never met you! And unless 
                        your project is a secret husband 
                        with PTSD, I think I’m in the clear.

           She tries to hide her GUILT as he gives her a KISS--the 
           moment cut short by a DING-DONG at the front door. 

                                 NINA
                        It worked!

                                 CONNOR
                        What worked?

                                 NINA
                  (covering)
                        The risotto. Smells better than a 
                        bonfire of new cars. Keep cookin’ 
                        good lookin’, I’ll check the door.

           Nina CREEPS to the door, checks the PEEP HOLE. 

                                 NINA
                        No. NO. Not tonight...

           She YANKS it open. Stood there, gripping a bottle of Jose 
           Cuervo and a French Bulldog... is HARPER, CRYING.

                                 HARPER
                        They... they... suspended Wedgie’s 
                        account!!

           Nina’s in NO MOOD to deal with this shit.

                                 NINA
                        What? Who suspended the account? 

                                 HARPER
                  (sniffles)
                        The misogynistic, patriarchy-
                        propping rat-fuckers at Instagram! 
                        Who the hell else??

           Harper BARGES IN, wholly uninvited. 

                                 NINA
                        Why would they do that...?
                                 HARPER
                        This morning, I posted a picture of 
                        Wedgie in the bathroom sink. 
                        Caption: “I sink, therefore I 
                        ‘gram.” Thank you. But I was so 
                        distracted by how fucking next-
                        level adorable she looked that I 
                        didn’t realize you could see my 
                        left tit in the mirror. 
                  (beat)
                        That’s not even my best tit!

           She BURSTS INTO TEARS, as Connor wanders over, CURIOUS. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Everything okay?

                                 HARPER
                        You must be Connor? Hi Connor. 
                        Nina’s told me all about you. She 
                        didn’t mention your calves. 
                        They’re perfect. Not too big, not 
                        too small. But no, everything is 
                        not okay. Instagram just suspended 
                        my dog’s account. 

           He SHOOTS a look at Nina. Is this girl serious?

                                 CONNOR
                        Maybe I should go, give you two--

                                 NINA
                        --No! Stay--

                                 HARPER
                        --Maybe you should go. Good to 
                        meet you, you’re super hot, but 
                        right now--
                  (re: herself and Wedgie)
                        --we need to get drunk with our 
                        big sister. 

           Connor SQUEEZES past. 

                                 NINA
                        Wait, Connor--

                                 CONNOR
                        --It’s fine. Really. But you better 
                        save me some of that risotto.

           And he’s GONESVILLE. As TEARS overtake Harper, Nina 
           awkwardly wraps her arms around her WHIMPERING sister.
           INT. NINA’S LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Harper, GROGGY and SPRAWLED OUT on the couch, rolls over 
           and ONTO THE FLOOR, landing with a THUD... then GROAN. 

           The EMPTY Cuervo bottle tips off the coffee table, ONTO 
           HER HEAD. Another GROAN.

           INT. NINA’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           In a hungover STUPOR, Harper SWINGS open the fridge. 
           EMPTY. She glances at the DOOR TO THE GARAGE. Should I?

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           UNDERWHELMED, Harper takes in the seemingly NORMAL space.

                                 HARPER
                        If I were a Gatorade, where would 
                        I live...?

           She OPENS the Soylent mini-fridge, RECOILING in disgust. 
           Getting desperate, she PULLS open the CLOSET DOOR... 
           immediately WISHING she hadn’t. 

                                 HARPER
                        Are. You. Fuck. Ing. With. Me. 

           She stares in HORROR at the DISCARDED CORPSE of Beta Nina 
           which, to the untrained eye, looks a helluva lot like a 
           HUMAN MURDER VICTIM. 

                                 HARPER
                        Neeners... What have you done...?

           INT. NINA’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           TIP-TOEING, Harper grabs a KITCHEN KNIFE. 

           INT. NINA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Harper BURSTS in, blade in ATTACK POSITION.

                                 HARPER
                        THAT’s your secret project?? 
                        MURDERING people??

           Nina SPRINGS awake, COWERING behind her sheets. 
                                 NINA
                        WHY DO YOU HAVE A KNIFE??

                                 HARPER
                        Because I found your little CLOSET 
                        CARCASS!

                                 NINA
                        You went in my garage??

                                 HARPER
                        Now I’m going to be the fucking 
                        “oblivious sister” in a Netflix 
                        true-crime documentary. Do you 
                        honestly think I’m ready for that 
                        kind of public examination of my 
                        personal life??

           Nina HOPS from the bed, caught in a cat-and-mouse game 
           with her CRAZED sister. 

                                 NINA
                        I told you not to go in there!!

                                 HARPER
                        Ya girl was hungover and THIRSTY. It 
                        feels like Skrillex headlined a 
                        festival in my brain. But back to 
                        the DEAD BODY.

                                 NINA
                        She was... an experiment gone awry. 

                                 HARPER
                        YOU’RE CONDUCTING HUMAN 
                        EXPERIMENTS? Jesus--

                                 NINA
                        --No, I--

                                 HARPER
                        --Lemme guess. You took the experiment 
                        too far and tragedy struck. And you 
                        tried to bury the body...

           Harper’s CORNERING Nina, knife raised.

                                 HARPER
                        ...but body’s are fuckin’ heavy, 
                        and you’re little nerd arms 
                        weren’t up to the task at hand. 
                        So, in a moment of indecision, you 
                        hid her in the closet. But you 
                        forgot one thing.
                                 NINA
                        ...I did?

           Harper TOSSES the knife aside. 

                                 HARPER
                        You forgot you had a LITTLE SISTER 
                        who’s a ride-or-die typa bitch. 
                        Your problems are MY problems. 

                                 NINA
                        Oh. Well, that body isn’t a 
                        body... per se. It’s an android. 
                        I’ve been building androids.

           Harper’s TAKEN ABACK.

                                 HARPER
                        You’ve... oh. Right. Legit. For 
                        the record, I was one-hundo-p 
                        kidding about helping you bury a 
                        body. I mean... I would, but I 
                        wouldn’t be, like, super jazzed up 
                        about it, ya know? 

           Nina can’t help but LAUGH. 

                                 HARPER
                        So hold up. If that... thing... is 
                        your secret project... and it’s 
                        straight busted... what are you 
                        showing at the launch?

                                 NINA
                        There is--was--another one...

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

           Nina and Harper share the couch, the latter MUNCHING on a 
           bag of popcorn, ENRAPTURED by her sister’s story.  

                                 NINA
                        ...and now she’s attempting to 
                        sabotage Connor’s and my--
                  (catching herself)
                        --whatever you want to call it. 
                        She feels betrayed--well, 
                        technically an algorithm is 
                        telling her to act as though she 
                        were betrayed--and rightfully so. 
                        I should’ve been honest with her--
                                 HARPER
                        --No, fuck that homemade fembot 
                        piece of shit! You CREATED her!

                                 NINA
                        Regardless, it’s my fault. I 
                        programmed her to do this. But now 
                        I just need to get her back.

                                 HARPER
                        Look. We’ve got a robot problem, 
                        right? Why don’t we call Robocop?

                                 NINA
                        You do realize Robocop’s a fictional 
                        robot that fights crime, right? Not 
                        a real cop that arrests robots.

                                 HARPER
                  (covering)
                        Of course I realize that! I guess 
                        you just have to tell Connor. 

                                 NINA
                        No way. What if he freaks out and 
                        goes AWOL? He’s my only chance of 
                        finding her. 

                                 HARPER
                        He’s gonna find out one way or 
                        another! You launch tomorrow. 

                                 NINA
                        We’ll cross that bridge after we 
                        get her back. I had Connor here to 
                        lure her over, but then you...

                                 HARPER
                        You thinking what I’m thinking?

               NINA
                               HARPER
           Stake-out!
                         Brunch!

                                 HARPER
                        Oh. A stake-out. Sure. For the 
                        record, I meant, like, a 
                        brainstorming brunch. 

                                 NINA
                        Wedgie stays.

           The pup YELPS in protest. 
           EXT. NINA’S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           As Nina and Harper jump in the Prius and PULL OUT, they 
           don’t notice the very android they’re off to find--Other 
           Nina--SLIP INTO THE GARAGE through the broken door. 

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - LATER

           Parked, Nina and Harper have eyes on Connor’s FOOD TRUCK, 
           watching the rare CUSTOMER come and go.  

                                 HARPER
                        I’m worried about Wedgie. It’s not 
                        easy reacclimating to normal life 
                        after you’ve had a taste of fame. 
                        Just look at Screech. He went to 
                        PRISON for pulling a switchblade 
                        in a bar fight, Nina. SCREECH. I 
                        can’t let Wedgie go down that 
                        path. It’d break my heart. 

           Nina ignores her, STARING at the truck.

                        I don’t know why I thought this 
                        would work. 

                                 HARPER
                        And what, am I just supposed to 
                        feed her and walk her like a 
                        normal dog now? She was born to be 
                        a star. If I wanted a dog that’s 
                        nothing special, I would’ve gone 
                        to a fucking shelter--

                                 NINA
                        --Look--LOOK!

           Connor crosses the street, getting into his PICKUP. Nina 
           THROWS the Prius in gear.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - RESTAURANT - LATER

           At a CORNER TABLE, Connor and Other Nina DIG into a 
           couple sandwiches. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        ...Sorry if I interrupted your 
                        work flow. 
                                 CONNOR
                  (re: the sandwich)
                        I never mind checking out the 
                        competition. And business wasn’t 
                        exactly booming this afternoon.  

                                 OTHER NINA
                        You know, I was thinking. What if 
                        we got away for awhile? I know you 
                        miss Nashville, and I’ve never 
                        been out of--I mean--I haven’t 
                        left the Bay Area in months. 

                                 CONNOR
                        You don’t have to convince me. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I thought you might say that, so I 
                        bought tickets. We leave tomorrow. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Tomorrow?? I mean... yes. I’d love 
                        to. But what about your launch?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Let’s just say I’ve run into some 
                        problems with my prototype. 

           At a table on the OTHER SIDE of the restaurant, Nina and 
           Harper stalk their prey, HIDING behind menus.

                                 HARPER
                        And I press the power button 
                        behind her ear... then what?

                                 NINA
                        Then I get Connor to leave and 
                        help you carry her out. 

                                 HARPER
                        Isn’t he going to notice you’re 
                        wearing a completely different 
                        outfit?

                                 NINA
                        Guys never notice clothes. 

                                 HARPER
                        And you’re SURE the robot doesn’t 
                        know who I am? You’ve never ONCE 
                        talked about me?

                                 NINA
                        No.
                                 HARPER
                        Not even like a... “You won’t 
                        believe what my sister Harper 
                        said. She’s SO funny.”

                                 NINA
                        No.

                                 HARPER
                        Or a, “Man, I don’t know where I’d be 
                        without my sister Harper. She’s 
                        always there for me, even though I 
                        act like she doesn’t exist.”

                                 NINA
                        Nope.

                                 HARPER
                        Got it. HOW much longer until she 
                        goes to the bathroom?

           At the other table--as if on cue--Other Nina’s torso 
           starts BEEPING. Connor reaches for his phone. 

                                 CONNOR
                        That me or you?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Me I think. And I’m actually gonna 
                        run to the bathroom real quick. 

           Nina and Harper watch as Other Nina STANDS. 

                                 NINA
                        Go time. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Harper strolls in, spots Other Nina’s feet under a STALL. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - BAR - SAME TIME

           Nina STEELS herself, approaching Connor. 

                                 CONNOR
                        That was quick. Wait, did you... 
                        change clothes?

                                 NINA
                  (awwww)
                        You noticed!

                        I spilled... had an extra shirt in 
                        my bag. And I’m so dumb, I just 
                        realized I told my sister I’d help 
                        her write her Instagram petition...

                                 CONNOR
                  (standing)
                        Oh--right, sure. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - BAR BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           With a FLUSH, Other Nina walks out of the stall, 
           exchanging an awkward glance with Harper. 

                                 HARPER
                        ...Hi.
                  (no response)
                        Sorry if this is forward, but you 
                        have great hair. What do you use? 
                        Can I feel it?

           As Harper REACHES for it, Other Nina DODGES her hand. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        What? No! I don’t know you.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, Nina made that crystal clear. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Nina??

                                 HARPER
                        Shit--no. Yes! Nina. My... mom? 
                        She’s always saying “don’t touch 
                        strangers’ hair.” Like, don’t tell 
                        me what to do, Mom!!

           Harper LUNGES for it again, but Nina GRABS her wrist.

                                 HARPER
                        Just lemme pet it.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I can’t let you do that.

           Harper goes for the robot’s NECK with her other hand, but 
           Other Nina SNAGS that one too. 

           Harper PUSHES back, FREEING a hand and finally GETTING 
           HOLD of Other Nina’s HAIR... REACHING toward the exposed 
           POWER BUTTON... their struggle SPILLING out the door...
           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - BAR - CONTINUOUS

           As Nina hugs Connor goodbye, his jaw DROPS. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Is that...

           Nina TURNS, spotting Harper ROLLING on the ground, in a 
           full-fledged WRESTLING MATCH with Other Nina. 

                                 CONNOR
                        ...Harper?

                                 NINA
                        Whoah, yeah, weird. Wonder what 
                        that’s about. Oh well, better 
                        leave her to it. Where were we--

           --But Connor’s already RUSHING to Harper’s aid. He FORCES 
           the two girls apart, laying eyes on Other Nina.

                        What. The--

           He SPINS toward Nina, FREAKED OUT.

           Suddenly, Other Nina TAKES OFF across the hotel lobby, 
           BURSTING into a STAIRWELL.

                                 NINA
                        WAIT!

           Nina shoots a PLEADING look at Connor, before SPRINTING 
           after Other Nina.

           Other Nina CLIMBS the staircase with mechanical

           Connor, REELING, shoots a glare at Harper. 

                                 HARPER
                        What?? I’m just as confused as 
                        you! Now I’m wondering if it was 
                        actually Nina or just the robot 
                        that came to Wedgie’s baptism.

           Exhausted, Connor STORMS OUT.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - STAIRWAY - SAME TIME

           Nina’s HUFFING IT, out of breath. Finally, she lunges for 
           the ROOF ACCESS door. 

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Nina EXPLODES onto the roof, but... it’s EMPTY.

           Her eyes SCANNING... SCANNING... NO SIGN OF OTHER NINA.

           Suddenly--a distant SCREAM. Nina rushes to the roof’s 
           edge, PEERING DOWN.

           On the sidewalk, ten stories below... SHOCKED PASSERBY 
           start to CROWD around a MANGLED MESS OF METAL, WIRES and 
           synthetic BODY PARTS... OTHER NINA JUMPED. Nina goes NUMB.

                                 NINA
                        Not again... Not. Fucking. Again.

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           Nina RUSHES to the PILE OF JUNK formerly know as Other 
           Nina, as Harper attempts to disperse the CURIOUS CROWD.

                                 HARPER
                        Nothing to see here. It’s just a 
                        crash test dummy. We were testing 
                        our new parachute app. Needless to 
                        say, it failed. 

           Nina, practically in TEARS, makes a futile attempt to 
           piece Other Nina back together, RAGE overtaking her. 

                                 NINA
                        Do you see what you’ve done??

                                 HARPER
                        What I’VE done??

                                 NINA
                        If you weren’t so hell bent on 
                        getting me to FUCK somebody, none 
                        of this would’ve happened!
                                 HARPER
                        It’s not MY fault that you went 
                        all evil scientist matchmaker on 
                        that shit!

                                 NINA
                        This is why your best friend is a DOG!

                                 HARPER
                        This is why your best friend just 
                        KILLED HERSELF!

           Harper STORMS AWAY, leaving Nina to clean up the SMASHED 
           REMAINS of the last three years of her life, as one of 
           Reba McEntire’s heartbreaking ballads FADES IN... 

           EXT. NINA’S PRIUS - CURBSIDE - MINUTES LATER

           Nina SHOVES pieces of Other Nina into her TRUNK, collapsing 
           to the curb, TEARS flooding her eyes. Off her HOPELESSNESS--

           INT. CONNOR’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Connor’s throwing his things BACK INTO BOXES. He PAUSES 
           on the REBA POSTER... reminiscing. Off his DEPRESSION--

           INT. HARPER’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Harper’s in bed, about to turn off the light, when Wedgie 
           BOUNDS IN with a FISHBOWL on his head. She goes to TAKE A 
           PICTURE... but stops... remembering. Off her FROWN-- 

           INT. NERO’S WINE BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The music FADES... as Nina--a complete WRECK--runs her 
           finger around the edge of an empty wine glass. Our old 
           friend, the Depressed Waiter, bellies up.

                                 DEPRESSED WAITER
                        Are we starting with a glass or a 
                        bottle this evening--
                  (recognizing her)
                        --Oh, hey! Good to have you back, 
                        stranger. 

                                 NINA
                        We’ve actually never met. The girl 
                        who was in here before was an 
                        android clone. But it doesn’t 
                        matter, because she’s dead now.
                                 DEPRESSED WAITER
                        So... a bottle then?

           She gives a RESIGNED NOD. 

           As he heads off, Nina spots a LIVING NIGHTMARE strolling 
           towards her: Brad and a BLONDE SMOKESHOW, her skintight t-
           shirt reading 49ERS CHEERLEADING.

                                 NINA
                        Well if it isn’t Dr. Jekyll and 
                        Miss July.

                                 BRAD
                        And hello to you too, sunshine. 
                        Nina, Brianna. Brianna, Nina. 

                                 NINA
                  (to Brianna)
                        Lemme guess. You’re a 49ers 
                        cheerleader.

                                 BRIANNA 
                        Whoah! Yes. That’s so weird. Oh my 
                        God, can you guess my sign too?

                                 NINA
                        Gemin-I don’t give a shit?
                  (to Brad)
                        What happened to Russia’s Next Top 
                        Model?

                                 BRAD
                        Back to the Mother Land. How about 
                        the good ol’ boy?

                                 NINA
                        As a matter of fact, he just...

           Her LOOK finishes the sentence.

                                 BRAD
                        Would love to say I’m surprised.

                                 NINA
                        So do you ever date girls with 
                        actual jobs?

                                 BRIANNA
                        Ummmm I work Saturdays at J. Crew-- 

                                 BRAD
                        --One workaholic was plenty.
           Nina gives a spiteful LAUGH. 

                                 NINA
                        There’d be no Matcher left if it 
                        wasn’t for me.

                                 BRAD
                        Well there’d be a lot more of ME 
                        left if it wasn’t for you. 
                  (beat)
                        Yes, okay? You’re a great 
                        developer. But it was MY idea and 
                        MY company. I bet you used this 
                        poor guy too, didn’t you? 
                  (off her look)
                        Straight outta the Nina Emser 
                        playbook. String him along until 
                        he finally realizes the only 
                        reason you were with him’s because 
                        it served your career. 

           He lets that SINK IN.

                                 BRAD
                        Hell, he got off lucky. It took me 
                        FOUR YEARS to realize the one 
                        thing in the world that matters to 
                        you is your place in it. 

           She STARES at him, her soul on the verge of collapse. 

                                 BRAD
                  (to Brianna)
                        Let’s go get drunk.

                                 BRIANNA
                        Awww I love it when you say that.

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - LATER

           Nina, WASTED, holds an open bottle of wine in one hand, 
           while the other clumsily drags Other Nina’s BUSTED BODY 
           across the garage floor.

           Reaching the COUCH, she pulls the robot’s MANGLED TORSO 
           onto a cushion, arranging her as if she’s “sitting up”. 

                                 NINA
                  (slurring)
                        Mooovie time. 

           Nina rifles through a stack of BLURAYS.

                        Titanic... Titanic... 
                  (not finding it)
                        Dannnng it.

                                   SMASH TO:

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - LATER

           Nina’s SNORING, upright on the couch, her head on the 
           shoulder of Other Nina’s eerily attentive CADAVER, a 
           glass of wine DUCT TAPED into its only remaining hand.

           “The Bachelorette” saga continues from the TV.

                                 ZOE (ON TV)
                        I’m sorry Max. I never thought I’d 
                        meet an air-hockey table repairman 
                        as kind, loyal or funny as you, 
                        but I can’t help the way I feel.

                                 MAX (ON TV)
                  (crying)
                        Is this because I shit my pants on 
                        our ziplining date? 

           Off Max’s HEARTBREAK--

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - NEXT DAY

           Nina takes a SCREWDRIVER to the android’s CARCASS, 
           scavenging for parts. Her phone BUZZES with an incoming 
           call--it’s Julian. SIGHING, she ANSWERS. 

                                 NINA (ON PHONE)
                        I don’t know what to tell you! 
                  (listening)
                        I know cancelling it is a bad look 
                        for a new company like yours, but 
                        I have nothing to launch, Julian! 
                        All I’ve got now are two worthless 
                        piles of electronic trash...

           Nina OPENS the closet. 

                                 NINA (ON PHONE)
                        ...that vaguely resemble me--

           She pauses, WIDE-EYED. 
                                 NINA (ON PHONE)
                        Jules, I’m going to have to call 
                        you back. And you know what... 
                        consider the party still on. 

           Hanging up, she STARES into the closet at... NOTHING. No 
           Beta Nina.

                                 NINA
                        She couldn’t have...

           She LUNGES to her LAPTOP, flipping it open and pulling up 
           her garage’s SECURITY FOOTAGE. She REWINDS over the past 
           24 hours... looking for something... THERE!

           She hits PLAY, watching OTHER NINA CREEP INTO THE GARAGE!

                                 NINA
                        That’s my girl...

           Onscreen, Other Nina opens the closet and drags BETA NINA 
           out, towards the door... STOPPING SHORT. She wanders 
           toward the TV, SEARCHING for something... and finding it: 
           the TITANIC BLURAY. Nina can’t help but LAUGH. 

                                 NINA
                        I knew I fixed that flaw! 

           She shoots a look at the dismantled ROBO-CORPSE.

                                 NINA
                        So if you’re the beta prototype, 
                        then where’s...

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           Other Nina, ALIVE AND WELL, waits in the SECURITY LINE, 
           staring at her BOARDING PASS to Nashville. A GUARD checks 
           her ID, nodding with APPROVAL and waving her onward.

           INT. NINA’S GARAGE - SAME TIME

           Nina’s PACING, iPhone SMASHED against her ear.

           REALIZING, she GRABS her KEYS!

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           Other Nina steps into the X-RAY SCANNER, lifting her 
           arms. Two TSA AGENTS--a BIG GIRL and an OLD MAN--wave 
           Other Nina out, having her PAUSE as the machine analyzes. 

           BEEEEEEP. Her entire scan comes up RED. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                  (sotto)
                        Shit.

                                 BIG GIRL TSA AGENT
                        That ain’t right. Let’s have you 
                        try again.

           Other Nina gets scanned again... and again, ALL RED. Both 
           TSA Agents are BAFFLED. 

                                 BIG GIRL TSA AGENT
                        You ever seen something like this 
                        Marvin?

                                 OLD MAN TSA AGENT
                        No m’am. Hell, I’ve seen rectally 
                        concealed throwing stars... a 
                        tomahawk inside a Teddy Bear. But 
                        never nothin’ like this. 
                  (beat)
                        Maybe she’s got some sorta bomb 
                        strapped all around her.

                                 BIG GIRL TSA AGENT
                        This chiquita here? 
                  (re: her legs)
                        Look at them matchsticks! She’s 
                        too skinny for no bomb, Marvin. 

           She pulls out a metal-detection WAND. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Thank you? I think you’re machine--

           BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. Every inch of her... BEEP. Metal.
                                 OLD MAN TSA AGENT
                        I heard a story ‘bout this same 
                        thing happenin’ at LaGuardia. 
                        Mercury poisoning, they said.

                                 BIG GIRL TSA AGENT
                  (to Other Nina)
                        You been showin’ that Sashimi who’s 
                        boss?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Not particularly. This must just 
                        be some mistake--

                                 OLD MAN TSA AGENT
                        --I seen on TLC, some folks, they 
                        have an addiction to eatin’ rust. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I don’t eat... rust.

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - SAME TIME

           Nina SPEEDS down the freeway. She spots the AIRPORT EXIT 
           sign, SWERVING across traffic. 

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           The TSA Agents continue to THEORIZE over Other Nina. 

                                 OLD MAN TSA AGENT
                        I seen on Nightline sometimes they 
                        cut street heroin with copper.

                                 BIG GIRL TSA AGENT
                  (to Other Nina)
                        You been shootin’ up?

                                 OLD MAN TSA AGENT
                        Couldn’t be. The copper causes 
                        instant death.

                                 BIG GIRL TSA AGENT
                        Then why’d you bring it up, Marvin??

                                 OLD MAN TSA AGENT
                        Because I like sharin’ interestin’ 
                        tidbits with you, Brenda! 
                  (to Other Nina)
                        Regardless, can’t let you through.
                                 OTHER NINA
                        What??

                                 BIG GIRL TSA AGENT
                        Look, we get it, you a basic bitch, 
                        and a basic bitch ain’t gonna blow 
                        up no plane. But say on the off 
                        chance you do... then I gotta go 
                        home and tell my two little ones 
                        their Momma helped the terrorists 
                        win. What kinda example is that?

           Other Nina FROWNS. 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER

           Other Nina sits, wholly DOWNTRODDEN, on a bench in the 
           DROP-OFF AREA, watching TRAVELERS hop out of TAXIS, some 
           checking bags, others RUNNING to catch flights. 

           A WOMAN (20s) bids farewell to her SISTER (20s) with a 
           WARM HUG, as Other Nina stares LONGINGLY... remembering 
           Nina give her the SAME KIND OF HUG before the first date. 

                                 WOMAN
                  (a la “Titanic”)
                        I’ll never let you go, Jackie. 
                        I’ll never let go.

                                 SISTER
                        Chill, I’m just going to Buffalo 
                        for the weekend. 

           Something REGISTERS in Other Nina, when suddenly Nina 
           herself SPRINTS through the android’s line of sight, into 
           the TERMINAL... only to reemerge moments later.

                                 NINA
                        I thought...

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Metal detectors.

           Nina SMILES. Shoulda thought of that.

                                 NINA
                        Lemme guess... the plan was to 
                        make me think you’d jumped, then 
                        whisk him away?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Doesn’t matter now. Didn’t work.
           An AWKWARD beat... until--

               NINA
                              OTHER NINA
           I’m sorry.
                         I’m sorry.

                                 NINA
                        Me first. 
                  (beat)
                        I’m sorry. I treated you like a 
                        product--a thing--instead of a 
                        what you are now: my friend. I’ve 
                        always been good with computers... 
                        other people, not so much. So I 
                        never tried. The lines got blurry 
                        and I calculated wrong. I 
                        shouldn’t have taken him from you. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        No. I’m Rose, he’s Jack and you’re 
                        the freezing cold ocean. 

                                 NINA
                        Thank you...?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        And as much as I thought maybe--
                        this time--the ship would steer 
                        clear... we were always going to 
                        hit that iceberg, and I was always 
                        going to lose him to you.

                                 NINA
                        He’s probably left the state by 
                        now. Won’t even answer my calls. 
                        You didn’t lose him to me. We both 
                        lost him. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        No. I’m a robot. I was never going 
                        to end up with him... as much as I 
                        wanted to. But YOU still can. 
                        Just, for once in your life, act 
                        like a human being, Nina. Do what 
                        I can’t: Speak from your human 
                        heart. Cry some human tears. Sure, 
                        what you did was flawed, but it 
                        was HUMAN. And if he gives a damn, 
                        he’ll see that. 

                                 NINA
                        What was that, Nicholas Sparks?

                                 OTHER NINA
                        One of my own.
           Nina GRINS... which quickly falls into a FROWN. 

                                 NINA
                        I have a ballroom full of people 
                        waiting for me to unveil an 
                        invention that, until this moment, 
                        I thought I’d lost. This should be 
                        the happiest night of my life, and 
                        I feel nothing.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        Welcome to my world. 

                                 NINA
                        No, that’s the thing, you feel 
                        more than I ever intended. That 
                        shit you pulled? You felt love. 
                        Truly felt it. 
                  (she has an IDEA)
                        How about I make you a deal?

           Other Nina PERKS UP. 

                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DOPPELGANGER LAUNCH - LATER

           Full-on LAUNCH PARTY VIBES: a “famous” DJ, OPEN BAR, 
           GRAZING HERD of ANTSY TECH-HEADS. A huge banner reads 
           DOPPELGANGER: FIND LOVE, SAVE TIME.

           We spot some familiar faces in the crowd... the DEPRESSED 
           WAITER, the CREEPY UBER DRIVER, the LIQUOR STORE OWNER 
           and his wheelchair-bound GIRLFRIEND, HAROLD with ATLAS 
           and EYELET, a few of Other Nina’s FAILED SUITORS...

           ...finally settling on Julian and Harper (and, of course, 
           Wedgie) near the back, NERVOUS for Nina. 

                                 HARPER
                        I know I should still be mad at her, 
                        but I’m worried. It’s not like Nina to 
                        just not show up. She had appendicitis 
                        and still took the S.A.T.

           Suddenly, Other Nina EMERGES from the back of the room, 
           SHUFFLING towards the stage. Julian and Harper SPOT HER. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Oh thank God!

                                 HARPER
                        Holy shit... The fembot lives!
                                 JULIAN
                        Wait... that’s not Nina?? How do 
                        you know? 

                                 HARPER
                        Her hair. Look closely. It 
                        shimmers. I NEED to know what 
                        conditioner she uses.

                                 JULIAN
                        I don’t think robots take showers.

                                 HARPER
                        Wow, Jules, for a gay man you’re 
                        being pretty narrow minded.

           Other Nina grabs a MICROPHONE from the podium. TAP TAP TAP. 
           The music CUTS. Curious eyes TURN. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                        I appreciate your patience. 
                  (reading off teleprompter)
                        My name’s Nina Emser. I’d like to 
                        thank my dear friend Julian Miller 
                        and Launch for hosting this event...

                  (sotto)
                        You don’t know me, bitch.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        ...and thank you all for joining 
                        me tonight.

           INT. MATCHER HEADQUARTERS - CEO’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           BRAD, feet up, stares through the wall of his GLASS 
           OFFICE into a Matcher’s open-plan millenial cesspool. 
                                 BRAD
                        I figured you deleted my number. I 
                        mean, three years and not a single 
                        “I miss you” text.

                                 NINA
                        I found it listed on your Craigslist 
                        ad for free condescension.

                                 BRAD
                        Touché. 

                                 NINA
                        Sorry about last night... if I 
                        messed anything up with that girl.

                                 BRAD
                        Which girl? Oh, the cheerleader? 
                        Don’t flatter yourself, she still 
                        fucked me. 

                                 NINA
                        Good... Great. I need a favor.

                                 BRAD
                        HAHA! Yeah, and I need a cat 
                        butler, but my assistant tells me 
                        all the animal trainers who do 
                        that are in prison. Nice chatting.

           He goes to HANG UP--

                                 NINA
                        WAIT. I fucked it up again, okay? 
                        You’re right. I fucked it up. Me, 
                        not you. I cared ten--maybe 20--
                        times more about our company than 
                        I did about our relationship--

                                 BRAD
                        --Thank you?--

                                 NINA
                        --and I deserved what happened. 
                        But I’m trying to do better this 
                        time around, okay?? And I need 
                        your help with something.

           He BREAKS. 

                                 BRAD
                        And what might that be?
                                 NINA
                        Well... you know how you 
                        technically have access to the GPS 
                        location of every Matcher user...?

                                 BRAD
                        Jesus, Nina. Why don’t you just 
                        hack us and leave me out of it?

                                 NINA
                        I tried, but...

                                 BRAD
                        Say it.

                                 NINA
                        ...your firewall is too good.

                                 BRAD
                        You know that’s the first time 
                        you’ve ever complimented my coding?

                                 NINA
                        That’s because you’re not a very 
                        good coder.

           He GRINS. Some things never change.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DOPPELGANGER LAUNCH - SAME TIME

           On stage, Other Nina continues her SERMON.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        ...For the last few years, I’ve 
                        been working on a project that I 
                        think can change the way we date...

                                 JULIAN
                  (hushed; to Harper)
                        She definitely murdered Nina. I’m 
                        going up there.

           He starts to WALK, but Harper GRABS him.

                                 HARPER
                        We don’t know that. She could be 
                        keeping Nina alive in a dark 
                        cellar somewhere.
                                 JULIAN
                        And if we destroy her, we’ll never 
                        know the location, all but 
                        guaranteeing Nina’s death by 
                        starvation?

                                 HARPER
                        Exactly. 

           They HIGH FIVE, turning back to the STAGE.

                                 OTHER NINA
                        ...and many of you are wondering 
                        what it is you’re here tonight to 
                        see. Actually, to that point... 
                  (going off script)
                        ...I have to come clean. I’m not 
                        Nina Emser. In fact, I’m better 
                        looking, more knowledgeable, and 
                        more patient than Nina Emser. But 
                        there’s one thing Nina is that I’m 
                        not. And that’s... human.

           GASPS from the CONFUSED audience. 

                                 OTHER NINA
                  (back on script)
                        Let’s say there’s a girl in 
                        Chicago or Houston or right here 
                        in Palo Alto--doesn’t matter...

           INT. NINA’S PRIUS - SAME TIME

           Nina RACES toward the GPS DOT now BLINKING on her phone. 

                                 OTHER NINA (V.O.)
                        ...but this girl, she’s finally 
                        ready for love, right?

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

           Connor SLAMS the door on a U-HAUL hitched to his FOOD 
           TRUCK, and bids a bitter farewell to The Juans. 

                                 OTHER NINA (V.O.)
                        It’s true, dating apps are a game 
                        changer. Hell, she can find the 
                        perfect guy from the comfort of 
                        her own phone!

           Out of nowhere, Nina’s Prius SQUEALS into the lot...
                                 OTHER NINA (V.O.)
                        And she’ll go into it optimistic. 
                        After all, this could be her soulmate.

           ...SKIDDING to a stop, Nina EXPLODING from the car.

                                 CONNOR
                        Nina?? How’d you know I was here??

                                 NINA
                        By driving my car over your 
                        Constitutional right to privacy, 
                        then slowly backing over it again.

                                 CONNOR
                  (not in the mood)
                        Shouldn’t you be at your launch?

                                 NINA
                        No--well, yeah--but that can wait... 

                                 CONNOR
                        Lemme guess. Since the robot can 
                        no longer speak for itself, you 
                        need your test subject to recount 
                        his story to the audience? Sorry 
                        if I’m not up for telling a room 
                        full of strangers that I did, 
                        indeed, make-out with a human-
                        shaped PlayStation.

                                 NINA
                        No! She’s actually still alive... 
                        well, functional. Long story. 
                  (beat)
                        No... I... 
                  (DEEP breath)
                        I didn’t build myself, Connor. I 
                        wish I did... There wouldn’t be so 
                        many bugs to work out. I know I 
                        lied to you. And used you. And 
                        fucked with your heart. And I know 
                        what I did was crazy. But you’re 
                        the first crazy thing I’ve done in 
                        my life. And that’s GOTTA mean 
                        something...

           Connor betrays a SMILE.

                                 NINA
                        ...I wish I could conjure up the 
                        perfect Shakespeare quote to 
                        describe how I feel, and how much I 
                        want you to forgive me.

                        And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t 
                        try to look one up on the way here. 
                        But I was driving really fast, and 
                        it’s hard to concentrate on the 
                        road and a phone at the same time, 
                        and I really didn’t want to die 
                        before I saw you again. 
                  (beat)
                        And I really don’t want you to 
                        leave before we try this again. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Prove it.

                                 NINA
                        What? I thought... I am... this IS 
                        me proving it!

           He POPS into the truck, grabs a BASKET OF CHICKEN.

                                 CONNOR
                        I whipped up a couple Tear Jerkers 
                        for the road. 

           She gives him a look of SHEER TERROR.

                                 CONNOR
                        Look, I was put through the damn 
                        wringer by one of your creations. 
                        I’d say it’s only fair you let me 
                        return the favor with one of mine. 

           RELUCTANT, Nina accepts the basket, takes a bite.

                                 NINA
                        Whoah. Honestly not as bad as--

           --Connor KISSES HER!! 

           ...and keeps KISSING HER... until TEARS start ROLLING 
           DOWN HER CHEEKS! 

           PAUSING, he wipes them off--caught up in the romance of 
           the moment--until realizing her face is FIRE-FUCKING-
           STATION RED.

                        I PROMISE SOME OF THESE ARE HAPPY

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DOPPELGANGER LAUNCH - LATER

           Nina SNEAKS into the back of the room, Connor in tow. The

                        ...Nina and Connor. 

           As Other Nina MOTIONS toward them, the room TURNS, 
           GASPING when they realize it’s the REAL NINA EMSER.

           The crowd EXPLODES with APPLAUSE, parting as the happy 
           couple ambles to the stage, ALL EYES ON THEM. Other Nina 
           helps her creator up, as Nina SNAGS the mic.

           Connor sits in front of an IMAGING MACHINE, as a 3D model

                        And now add some Leo. 

           Nina makes a few CLICKS, and Connor’s digital face starts 
           to look more and more like Leonardo DiCaprio.

                        me to be happy. I just needed to 
                        stop acting like a fucking robot.

                        because she’s too busy, it should 
                        be about making her less busy so

                        late at work for her, or running

                        But probably neither. And that’s  
                        fine, because for the first time 
                        in a long time, she’s having an 
                        experience that doesn’t involve 
                        entering data into an Excel 
                        spreadsheet.

                        So instead of playing Cupid, 
                        you’re what... playing God?
                                 NINA
                        Well, for now, playing house. This 
                        one belongs to Rose.

                        A deal’s a deal. 

           Nina’s phone VIBRATES--Harold’s calling. She shoots it to 
           VOICE MAIL. 

                                 REPORTER
                        It’s funny. When I was researching 
                        this story, the one thing Time 
                        readers wanted to know wasn’t 
                        “when can I have one?” or “are we 
                        doomed?” But... can a robot really 
                        fall in love?

           Other Nina (aka Rose) GLANCES at her Connor/Leo hybrid, 
           already smitten, as Nina and Connor share a GRIN.

           I guess we’ll find out.

           INT. HAROLD’S SLEEK OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Harold packs up his BRIEFCASE, phone to his ear.

                                 HAROLD
                        Nina, call me back ASAP. Need to know 
                        how quick you can whip up one of 
                        those robot clones. Just remembered 
                        I’m supposed to watch Atlas play 
                        soccer tonight, but I’m already on my 
                        way to sushi with a former Miss 
                        California. Guess which year. 
                  (beat)
                        2008. KIDDING. 2014. I’m not 
                        desperate. Anyways, if I flake on 
                        the game, Heidi’ll kill me, but if 
                        I have to watch the fruit of my 
                        loins stumble his way though 
                        another second of communist 
                        kickball, I might kill myself. And 
                        therein lies the dilemma. Plus, 
                        it’s not like I bought Atlas that 
                        virtual reality headset for him to 
                        take up a fucking SPORT... 

                                FADE TO BLACK.

                       THE END
