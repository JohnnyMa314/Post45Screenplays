           EXT. GROTE MARKT - NIGHT

           Superimpose: Haarlem, Netherlands. 1945.

           The normally bustling market square sits quiet. Businesses 
           closed for the night. The beautiful St. Bavo Church providing 
           the only light. Its Gothic bell tower dominating the skyline. 

           By a sewer drain, a MOUSE picks at food scraps, unaware of 
           the STRAY CAT eyeing it from a few feet away. Suddenly--

           The cat pounces. The mouse scurries away. The chase turns 
           into an--

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           And past HANNIE SCHAFT (24). Studious but with an intensity 
           in her eyes only a few possess. Her focus on a FIGURE, 
           donning an overcoat and hat, standing on the street corner 
           fifty yards away. Then--

           The Figure tugs their hat three times. A signal.

           Hannie then slides a pistol from the pocket of her cardigan. 
           A long beat--

           And WILLEM ZIRKZEE (47) turns the corner, heads towards 
           Hannie. A Hakenkreuz (swastika) pin on his jacket.

           Hannie slips into the shadows, listens as Zirkzee’s footsteps 
           near. She brushes her jet black hair from the lenses of her 
           horned rimmed glasses. She’s calm. As if she’s done this 
           before. Then--

           Zirkzee enters the alley, oblivious to Hannie’s whereabouts. 
           As he passes, Hannie quietly steps from the shadows. She aims 
           at the back of Zirkzee’s head and pulls the trigger--

           But her pistol jams! 

           The “click” catches Zirkzee’s attention. He turns, startled 
           to see Hannie. He hastily grabs his own pistol and takes off, 
           firing wildly as he does. Bullets ricochet off the pavement! 

           Hannie ducks behind a nearby dumpster for cover but not 
           before she’s hit in the leg! She cringes with pain.

           His clip emptied, Zirkzee turns to flee just as Hannie 
           corrects the malfunction. She stands and fires--
           Her first bullet hits Zirkzee in the back. He drops to his 
           knees, his pistol falling from his hand. Hannie fires again 
           and again hits her mark. Zirkzee falls forward. Dead. Silence 
           follows. Then--

           A clamoring of German voices nearing. Urgency in their tone.

           Off Hannie, sensing the impending danger--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Superimpose: Seven Years Earlier. Haarlem. 

           Amongst the sea of TRAVELERS is Hannie (now 18 and who for 
           the time being will be known by her birth name, JOHANNA). 

           What stands out immediately is the absence of glasses and the 
           fact her jet black hair is its natural color: Red.

           A final boarding call for the train to Amsterdam sounds.

                                 JOHANNA
                        That’s me.

           She turns to her parents, PIETER (53) and AAFJE (53). Both 
           intellectuals dreading the fact their child has grown up. 
           Aafje fusses with Johanna’s cardigan, making sure it’s snug.

                                 AAFJE
                        Call in every night, Johanna. And 
                        familiarize yourself with all 
                        doctor’s offices and hospitals in 
                        the city. The moment you feel even 
                        the slightest touch of illness--

           Johanna takes her mother’s hands. 

                                 JOHANNA
                        I’ll be okay. I promise.

           Aafje’s eyes well as she looks over her little girl.

                                 AAFJE
                        We are very proud of you. 
                             (then)
                        And I know she is as well.

           That last sentiment clearly meant a lot to Johanna. They 
           embrace. Johanna then turns to Pieter.
                                 PIETER
                        Give ‘em hell, Jo.

           Johanna clutches her father tightly. Whether she admits it or 
           not, leaving is just as hard on her as it is them. Johanna 
           then boards-- 

           INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           She takes her seat and immediately finds her parents on the 
           platform. Johanna kisses her hand and presses it against the 
           window. The train releases its brakes. Steam fills the air. 
           The Schafts hold their looks on each other until it’s no 
           longer possible to do so. Johanna then turns from the window. 
           Blinks back her emotions. The rest of her life begins now.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM (UVA) - LIBRARY - NIGHT 

           Superimpose: University of Amsterdam. Four months later.

           Johanna sits at a table surrounded by notes. Her work ethic 
           tenacious. When her eyes finally break from her work, she 
           spots a FEMALE STUDENT a few tables away. The only other body 
           in the library.

           The Female Student looks up, then smiles and waves. As 
           Johanna is about to wave back, three FEMALE STUDENTS walk 
           past her. They meet the single Student. Hugs exchanged. 

           Johanna masks her embarrassment. She watches as the group of 
           friends walk out, a touch of jealousy to her look. 

           Now alone in the cavernous room, Johanna returns to her work.

           EXT. UVA - LATER

           Books in her arms, Johanna weaves through pockets of socially 
           adept STUDENTS. She passes a building, notices a large banner 
           hanging above the entrance: (subtitled in English) The 
           Amsterdam Female Students Association  

           Johanna nervously kneads her cardigan in her hands as she  
           watches FEMALE STUDENTS enter the building. A beat--

           And she starts towards the building’s entrance.

           INT. UVA BUILDING - LECTURE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Johanna sits towards the back, still unsure with her 
           decision. The other STUDENTS all seemingly paired up.
           Johanna then spots a GIRL sitting by herself, eating a 
           pastry. She drops some on her blouse. Two PRETTY STUDENTS see 
           this. They whisper and laugh. The Girl becomes embarrassed. 

           Johanna feels for her. But rather than do nothing, Johanna 
           acts. She crosses towards the trio like a protective parent.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Was something funny?
                             (off Pretty Students)
                        I saw you laughing so I figured 
                        there must be something amusing 
                        about my friend here. So please. 
                        Enlighten me.

           Busted, the Pretty Students move seats. After they’re gone--

                                 GIRL
                        Thanks. Would you like to sit?

           Johanna does so.

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        I’m Sarah Feldt.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Johanna Schaft.

           They shake hands. SARAH FELDT (18) is a quick talker. Cute 
           and slightly overweight. She offers Johanna a piece of 
           pastry. Johanna happily accepts.

                                 SARAH
                        I love your hair. 

           Johanna self consciously tucks her red hair behind her ears. 

                                 JOHANNA
                        I’ve never been that fond of it.

                                 SARAH
                        And I’ve never been that fond of my 
                        weight but it’s who I am. You know 
                        the Russians say that women with 
                        red hair are either violent or 
                        false.
                             (then/playful)
                        Which one are you, Johanna Schaft?

           The two exchange smiles. A FEMALE STUDENT takes the podium. 

                                 FEMALE STUDENT
                        Welcome to this year’s first 
                        meeting of the AVSV!
           The crowd applauds. 

                                 FEMALE STUDENT (CONT’D)
                        You can do better than that!

           The crowd applauds louder. Sarah whistles. Johanna works up 
           to a shout. The girls laugh. At ease with each other already.

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sarah peruses Johanna’s bookshelves. They overflow with texts 
           in Dutch, German, English, French. Law the dominant subject.

                                 SARAH
                        So I take it you’re studying law?

                                 JOHANNA (O.S.)
                        International law.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m linguistics. I’ve always liked 
                        talking so I figured what the hell? 
                        I’ll make a career out of it. But 
                        do you know what chapter we’re on 
                        now? Sign language. Go figure.

           Sarah pulls a book from the shelf: Frederick Pollack’s “The 
           League of Nations.” It’s worn, the pages littered with 
           handwritten notes. On the title page, written in the left 
           hand corner, the name “A. Schaft.”

           Johanna emerges with two cups of tea. Hands one to Sarah. 

                                 JOHANNA
                             (re: book)
                        That’s my favorite of them all.

           She takes the book, smiles fondly. This book means something.

                                 JOHANNA (CONT’D)
                        And it’s where I hope to work one 
                        day. If I’m lucky enough.

                                 SARAH
                        Really? Politics?
                             (off Johanna)
                        Come on, Johanna. After everything 
                        that’s happened and with Adolf and 
                        his ugly little mustache running 
                        around, you’re going to tell me 
                        world peace is a reality?
                                 JOHANNA
                        I believe it is. 

                                 SARAH
                        And I say you’re crazy.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I do. I believe that just because 
                        you’re Jewish and I’m not does not 
                        mean we must hate each other and go 
                        to war. 
                             (then)
                        The League is fighting for what is 
                        right. And that’s what I want to be 
                        a part of. 

           Sarah sees firsthand the convictions Johanna holds. She 
           grins. Impressed.

                                 SARAH
                        I think you’re going to do great 
                        things, Johanna Schaft.

           She raises her cup to Johanna. They toast.

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Superimpose: March 1939.

           Johanna and Sarah once again toast, but this time their 
           glasses filled with champagne. A box sits on the table.

                                 SARAH
                        Well! Open it already!

           Johanna grins and tears into the box like an excited child on 
           Christmas. She pulls out a pamphlet: (subtitled) Make Your 
           Voice Heard! Join ‘Gemma’ Today! Gemmare e minoribus 
           appentinus!

           Johanna turns the page and what she sees renders her 
           speechless. CLOSE ON pamphlet: (subtitled) President- Johanna 
           Schaft.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Gemmare e minoribus appentinus.

                                 JOHANNA
                        From small things we aspire towards 
                        the great.

           Johanna’s sense of pride is unmistakable. Sarah then places a 
           festive headdress atop Johanna’s red hair.
                                 SARAH
                        Now we celebrate!

                                 JOHANNA
                        What is this?

                                 SARAH
                        It’s Purim! 

           Sarah playfully dances around the room.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                             (off Johanna)
                        Don’t make me beg.

           She drops to her knees and theatrically begins to beg--

                                 JOHANNA
                        Alright!

                                 SARAH
                        Wonderful! Let’s get dressed!

           INT. AMSTERDAM APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A festive Purim celebration in full swing. GUESTS donning 
           costumes, some more elaborate than others, dance and sing 
           traditional Jewish songs. A good time had by all.

           Johanna sits off to the side, her foot tapping along to the 
           music. Her attention drawn to two YOUNG SISTERS. The eldest 
           playfully spins the youngest around. It’s sweet. Tender. 
           Johanna smiles. Her mind taken back--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Johanna (5) plays with her older sister ANNIE (12). Studious. 
           Her brown hair and fair skin resembles her parents. 

           The two girls mimic each other’s mannerisms. A tongue stuck 
           out. Eyes crossed. A funny face. Annie then grabs Johanna and 
           tickles her. Johanna giggles uncontrollably.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Jo!

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. AMSTERDAM APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - BACK IN SCENE

           Johanna is pulled from her daze by Sarah tugging at her arm. 
           Resistance is futile. Johanna joins the dance circle and 
           despite herself, lets loose. The crowd cheers her on. She and 
           Sarah link arms, swing around. Johanna howls with delight. 
           And in this moment, all is right within Johanna’s world...

                                 BBC BROADCASTER (O.S.)

                        BBC news alert for the tenth of 
                        May, nineteen-forty. The German 
                        army invaded Holland early this 
                        morning by land and by landings 
                        from paratroops...

           EXT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - ROOF - NIGHT

           Johanna and Sarah watch, their faces wrought with fear and 
           confusion, as the distant horizon lights up with flashes from 
           German bombs. The delayed rumblings of each explosion follow.  

                                 SARAH
                        We were neutral. But he invaded 
                        anyway.

           Off Johanna, unsure of the future that awaits--

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - DAY

           Johanna (20) rides her bike. The occupation in full swing. 
           Nazi flags hang in store windows. GERMAN SOLDIERS loiter on 
           corners. Supply trucks rumble down the street. 

           Johanna stops at an intersection. Her eyes drawn to a LITTLE 
           BOY proudly saluting a passing truck. Johanna watches in 
           disbelief before a car beeps at her and she peddles off-- 

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           And ends up on a street lined with cafes. Johanna comes to a 
           stop when she notices a group of Weerafdeling (WA) (Dutch 
           Nazi police) and GRÜNE POLIZEI (Green Police) hanging signs 
           in display windows. The signs read: No Jews Allowed.

           A CAFE OWNER cuts off a Green Police Officer as he goes to 
           hang a sign. A heated argument ensues. Other DUTCH MEN come 
           to the Cafe Owner’s defense. More Green Police join in. Then--

           A WA Officer throws a rock through the window of the cafe! 
           And in a flash, a brawl ensues.
           The WA and Green Police show no mercy. The Cafe Owner and his 
           supporters are hit with clubs. Kicked. Stomped on. 

           Johanna’s appalled by the brutality. She steps off her bike 
           and starts towards the melee but another RESIDENT grabs her 
           arm. His look says, “You don’t want to do that.”

           Johanna can only watch helplessly as the WA and Green Police 
           continue their beating. The cafes looted. Windows smashed. 
           The environment in Amsterdam quickly deteriorating.

           EXT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LATER

           As Johanna approaches, she finds Sarah sitting on the front 
           step. Her eyes red from crying.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Sarah? What’s wrong? Are you hurt?

           Sarah hands Johanna her ID card. On it, a large black “J” 
           predominately stamped. Sarah has been branded. 

                                 JOHANNA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get inside. 

           As Johanna helps Sarah up, she spots her ELDERLY NEIGHBOR 
           watching from his doorstep. As if he doesn’t approve of 
           Johanna’s kindness to this Jew. 

           Unsettled by the Elderly Neighbor’s judgemental look, Johanna 
           hurries Sarah inside and shuts the door.

           INT. UVA BUILDING - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Johanna addresses Gemma Members. A somber tone to her voice.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Last night the Germans abducted 
                        four hundred and twenty five Jewish 
                        men from their homes. 

           EXT. JEWISH QUARTER - NIGHT

           SS Soldiers and Green Police barge through apartment doors, 
           pull JEWISH MEN from their homes. NSB (Dutch Nazis) applaud 
           the raid. Some spit and throw trash on the frightened Jewish 
           Men as they’re hoarded onto trucks headed for imminent death. 
           INT. UVA BUILDING - CLASSROOM - BACK IN SCENE

           One GEMMA MEMBER cries, is consoled by another. Johanna then 
           holds up a flier. On it: a Hakenkreuz crossed out. Below that 
           reads: (subtitled) Strike! Strike! 

                                 JOHANNA
                        There’s been a call to shut down 
                        Amsterdam and I for one, applaud 
                        it. It’s time we, as proud Dutch 
                        citizens, stood up and showed the 
                        Germans that we will no longer 
                        tolerate their injustice. We will 
                        no longer tolerate their savagery.
                             (then)
                        Let’s go make our voices heard.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - DAY

           Superimpose: February 1941.

           THOUSANDS pack the streets for the first mass protest of anti-
           German measures by an occupied territory. There’s TRAM 
           DRIVERS. FACTORY WORKERS. DOCK WORKERS. BUSINESSMEN. 
           STUDENTS. JEWS. NON-JEWS. All united in defiance.

           In the midst of it all is Johanna and her Gemma Members. 
           Johanna leads chants. Holds an anti-Nazi banner with Sarah. 
           Johanna’s convictions on full display.

           As the crowd continues their demonstration-- 

           Three German trucks approach. SS SOLDIERS spill out and 
           position themselves in every direction. They shout commands 
           through megaphones. Attempt to break up clusters of 
           Protestors, but they’re drastically outnumbered.

           Verbal confrontations escalate to physical ones. A Protester 
           waves a sign in a Soldier’s face and is thrown to the ground. 
           This draws more Protesters. Then more Soldiers. Pushing and 
           shoving. Insults hurled in both directions.

           Similar skirmishes follow. The peaceful rally quickly 
           deteriorating. Fear and confusion spread amongst the crowd. 
           Some retreat. Others instigate. But Johanna stays.

           More SS arrive. Brawls in every direction. It’s chaos. A 
           Soldier hits a Protester in the head with his rifle. The 
           Protester drops to his knees. A gash opened on his forehead.

           Another Protester then body checks the Soldier to the ground. 
           Enraged, the Soldier fires--
           The pop of the rifle startles everyone. The Protester looks 
           to his chest, sees blood seeping through his white button 
           down shirt. He collapses. Blood pools around his body.

           All hell breaks loose. Protestors charge Soldiers who 
           retaliate by firing wildly. A Protester is hit. Then another. 

           People run for their lives. Screams of terror and panic fill 
           the air. A Soldier is knocked out. Another Protestor hit.

                                 SARAH
                        We have to leave!

           Johanna looks to the Protestor’s lifeless body before taking 
           off with Sarah. The sounds of gun fire erupting around them.

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Distraught, Sarah paces back and forth. Johanna’s attention 
           out the window, watching the same Elderly Neighbor talk with 
           another MAN. The Elderly Neighbor adamant with his points. 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s only a matter of time before 
                        they take me.
                             (then)
                        When they come, I want you to kill 
                        me. 

                                 JOHANNA
                        Sarah--

                                 SARAH
                        I can’t go to the camps, Jo. I’ll 
                        never survive.

                                 JOHANNA
                        No one is going to take you away. 
                        Do you understand me? I won’t let 
                        anything happen to you.

           Sarah’s eyes well. Johanna brings her friend close, 
           frightened for the both of them.

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sarah’s asleep. Her head resting on Johanna’s lap. Johanna 
           eyes Sarah’s ID card on the table. The large black “J” 
           staring back at her. The difference between life and death. 

           Johanna then covers the “J” with her hand. A beat. And it 
           suddenly dawns on her what she must do...
           INT. INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           SWIMMERS do laps. WOMEN gossip on lounge chairs. CHILDREN 
           horseplay. The war seemingly an afterthought here. 

           Johanna enters, head down, and crosses towards a room in the 
           rear. A sign on the door reads: (subtitled) Women. A sign 
           below that: (subtitled) No Jews Allowed.

           INT. INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - CHANGING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           It resembles a locker room. The back wall lined with 
           “changing stalls,” similar to bathroom stalls.

           What’s immediately evident is the absence of lockers or 
           attendant. Belongings are simply left out in the open 
           unguarded. (No doubt a much more trustworthy time.)

           Johanna takes a towel and sits on the edge of a bench. She 
           slowly unbuttons her cardigan, but has no real intent to 
           remove it. Her attention on a group of CHATTY WOMEN by the 
           changing stalls. The room’s only other occupants.

           They leave their belongings on a bench and head for the pool. 
           Johanna casually shields her face from view as they pass. 
           Once the women leave, Johanna hurries to their belongings. 

           She rifles through the nearest purse. Her heart beating 
           through her chest. Eyes darting to the entrance every few 
           seconds. The ramifications of being caught are drastic.

           The purse’s main compartment yields no results. She quickly 
           tries a side pocket. There, she finds an ID card. Then--

           Two voices near. Johanna stuffs the ID card into her cardigan 
           pocket. She feigns tying her shoes as two YOUNG WOMEN enter. 
           They walk towards the stalls, paying no attention to Johanna. 

           Once the stall doors close, Johanna speed walks out-- 

           INT. INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS

           And never sees the ELDERLY WOMAN entering the changing room. 
           They bump into each other. The card drops. The actual woman’s 
           photo lying face up for all to see.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        I apologize, dear. Allow me.

           Before Johanna can protest, the Elderly Woman reaches down 
           for the card. Johanna maps out the quickest escape route in 
           her head. Ready to literally run for her life. However--
                                 ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m as blind as a bat without my 
                        glasses.

           She hands the card to Johanna, ignorant to the fact it’s not 
           hers. Johanna can’t believe her luck. She smiles, allows the 
           Elderly Woman to pass and then hurries out.

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Johanna works on a new Gemma flier. Sarah’s on the sofa, 
           marveling at the craftsmanship of her new ID card. Sans 
           branding.

                                 SARAH
                        The forger did wonderful work. 
                        How’d you find him?

                                 JOHANNA
                        Bribing bartenders goes a long way 
                        in this city.

                                 SARAH
                        Hello. My name is Perle Abelen. 
                             (then)
                        Do you think that’s what Perle 
                        would sound like?

           Johanna smiles. It’s nice to hear a joke again. There’s a 
           knock at the door. A knowing look comes over Sarah. 

           Johanna opens the door and finds two FEMALE STUDENTS. They 
           look tired. Unkempt. They’ve no doubt been in hiding.

                                 FEMALE STUDENT 1
                        Johanna Schaft?

                                 JOHANNA
                        Yes?

                                 FEMALE STUDENT 2
                        Is it true you get new ID cards for 
                        Jewish students?

           Johanna glances back to Sarah. Sarah’s look says, “They need 
           you.” And Johanna realizes that. 

           She turns back to the Female Students with a welcoming smile.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Please. Come in.
           INT. INDOOR SWIMMING POOL - CHANGING STALL - DAY

           Johanna sits on a small bench. A purse on her lap. 

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        The way this works is simple. I’ll 
                        be acquiring the IDs from my 
                        various sources...

           She pulls out an ID card from the side pocket.

           INT. THEATER - CHANGING ROOM - DAY

           Similar to the pool.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        Sources that are better left 
                        unknown to you...

           Johanna lifts cards from multiple bags.

           INT. CONCERT HALL - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

           Johanna casually lingers by a stall. 

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        But ones you can trust will always 
                        deliver...

           A WOMAN exits and leaves her purse behind. Johanna makes her 
           move and skillfully swipes the ID card.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREET - NIGHT

           Johanna waits by an open door. A STUDENT approaches.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        Once I have the card, I’ll send 
                        word for you to meet me...

           The two head into--

           INT. ART STUDIO - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Johanna’s now with a SECOND STUDENT. Amongst the paint, 
           canvases and brushes are tools of forgery. A forger, KLAUS 
           (30), takes the Second Student’s photo.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        You’ll have your photo taken...
           The bulb flashes--

           INT. ART STUDIO - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           A THIRD STUDENT places his finger in some ink.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        Apply your own fingerprint...

           The Third Student carefully leaves his fingerprint on the 
           back of his photo. Klaus then takes the photo to his desk--

           INT. ART STUDIO - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Klaus finishes a forgery. Satisfied, he walks it from his 
           desk and over to a FOURTH STUDENT.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        And receive your new identity... 

           The Fourth Student’s overcome with gratitude. She embraces 
           Johanna--

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREET - GERMAN CHECKPOINT - DAY

           A FIFTH and SIXTH STUDENT approach an SS Soldier.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        Now I don’t want you to worry. The 
                        forger’s work is undetectable... 

           The Fifth and Sixth Students gladly hand over their papers. 
           The Soldier inspects them.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        The SS won’t suspect a thing...

           Satisfied, the Soldier hands the papers back. The Fifth and 
           Sixth Students continue on their way--

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Johanna sits on the sofa. Her eyes closed. A SEVENTH, EIGHTH 
           and NINTH STUDENT emerge from the kitchen with a cake. The 
           best ‘thank you’ they could muster under the circumstances.

                                 JOHANNA (V.O.)
                        Now I know these cards won’t end 
                        your suffering, but they’ll keep 
                        you alive.
           Johanna opens her eyes and is truly touched by the gesture.

           INT. ART STUDIO - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Johanna watches Klaus as he meticulously works on an ID card. 
           A TENTH STUDENT observes paintings nearby.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I wanted to thank you, Klaus.

                                 KLAUS
                        It’s no bother. Besides...

           He skillfully removes the original photo.

                                 KLAUS (CONT’D)
                        I think I’m pretty good at it. 

                                 JOHANNA
                        The best.

           Klaus gets to work placing the Tenth Student’s photo onto the 
           card. He motions for Johanna to hand him a tool. She does.

                                 KLAUS
                        By the way, how much you getting?

                                 JOHANNA
                        Excuse me?

                                 KLAUS
                        Per card. 
                             (off Johanna)
                        You’re charging them, aren’t you? 
                        Forgery’s a lucrative racket.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Charging? No. How could you even--

                                 KLAUS
                        Just wanted to make sure.

           A test. Klaus then pulls a letter from his desk drawer.

                                 KLAUS (CONT’D)
                        You’re from Haarlem?

                                 JOHANNA
                        Yes. Why do you ask?

           Klaus hands the letter to Johanna. 
                                 KLAUS
                        I could make an introduction.

           Johanna looks to the letter. It’s an underground, resistance 
           newsletter. The title: (subtitled) The Truth. Printed by: 
           (subtitled) The Council of Resistance.

                                 JOHANNA
                        A communist group? I’m not--

                                 KLAUS
                        This ain’t about political 
                        allegiance. It’s about action. 
                        They’re one of the only groups 
                        offering an armed resistance. The 
                        only ones doing something. They 
                        could use someone like you, Jo.

           Off Johanna, her interest clearly piqued--

           EXT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Superimpose: Spring 1943.

           Tulips in full bloom. Johanna parks her bike against the 
           fence. She notices an envelope addressed to her in the 
           mailbox. The official Reich Commissioner’s seal stamped 
           prominently, dwarfing the UVA seal. 

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A worked up Johanna stands before Sarah.

                                 JOHANNA
                             (reading from letter)
                        “Any student who does not fullfil 
                        his obligation to declare loyalty 
                        to the Third Reich will face 
                        immediate expulsion. Furthermore, 
                        it is the obligation of all 
                        graduating students to accept 
                        relocation to Germany for work in 
                        their related field for a period of 
                        five years.”
                             (then)
                        BASTARDS! How can they expect--

           She quickly realizes who she’s talking to.

                                 JOHANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m being selfish.
                                 SARAH
                        It’s okay, Jo.

           Johanna sits. She takes her copy of “The League of Nations” 
           in her hands. The harsh realization of what refusing loyalty 
           means for her has already sunk in.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I used to dream about the moment I 
                        was handed my degree. How it’d 
                        signify that I was one step closer 
                        to the League. 

           She opens to the title page, runs her hand over the name “A. 
           Schaft.” Sensing her friend’s vulnerability, Sarah takes 
           Johanna’s hand.

                                 SARAH
                        You’d have made a hell of a lawyer.

           They lean their foreheads together. The truest of friends. 
           Their lives forever linked by the consequences of war. 

                                 JOHANNA
                        Come with me back to Haarlem. You 
                        could stay in my parents home until 
                        we made arrangements to move you to 
                        the countryside. 

           Touched by the gesture, Sarah embraces her friend.  

                                 SARAH
                             (re: letter)
                        What’re you going to do with that?

           Johanna notices a lit candle on the coffee table. She dips 
           the corner of the letter into the flame, then drops it into 
           an empty waste bucket.

           She and Sarah watch as the flames quickly spread. The entire 
           letter disintegrating and with it, any loyalty Johanna would 
           ever declare to the Nazis.

           INT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sarah packs up her belongings. Johanna emerges from her 
           bedroom.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I have to drop off the key with the 
                        landlord. You’ll be okay here?
                                 SARAH
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I won’t be long.

           EXT. JOHANNA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Johanna unchains her bike from the fence. As she rides off, 
           she passes the Elderly Neighbor’s home. No sign of him. 
           Johanna continues on down the street.

           Off the Elderly Neighbor’s home, ominous--

           INT./EXT. OFFICE - LATER

           Johanna shakes hands with her LANDLORD then exits the office. 
           As she crosses towards her bike, a German truck races by. 
           Three SS SOLDIERS aboard.

           The urgency with which the truck races by unsettles Johanna. 
           She quickly mans her bike and peddles in the same direction.

           EXT. JOHANNA’S STREET - LATER

           As Johanna turns onto her street, she spots a crowd of 
           ONLOOKERS. Her fears confirmed when she sees the German truck 
           parked in front of her apartment.

           She picks up her pace. A COUPLE sees her coming. The WIFE 
           breaks away from the crowd, stops Johanna.

                                 WIFE
                        Don’t come any further, dear.

           Johanna cranes her neck to see the activity. Her heart breaks 
           when she sees Sarah being led away by SS Soldiers.

           WITH SARAH

           Her fear palpable. Her eyes fixated on the truck, realizing 
           each step she takes brings her closer to the camps. 

           Unable to accept this fate, she panics--

           And pushes free from the Soldiers and takes off!

           WITH JOHANNA

           Sees this. She goes to scream out for Sarah, but the Wife 
           covers her mouth. 
                                 WIFE (CONT’D)
                        They’re looking for you too.

           WITH SARAH

           Running for her life, tears streaming down her face. 

           Behind her, one of the Soldiers steps forward and 
           nonchalantly aims his pistol. Fires--

           The bullet rips through Sarah’s back. She drops instantly.

           WITH JOHANNA

           As if she were shot herself. Her legs give out. Face glazes 
           over. The Wife turns to her HUSBAND.

                                 WIFE (CONT’D)
                        Help me get her inside.

           As the Couple covertly helps Johanna into their home, the 
           Elderly Neighbor’s house comes into Johanna’s view--

           And she sees a Nazi flag now proudly displayed out front.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Pieter and Aafje scan the faces of each PASSENGER 
           disembarking the train from Amsterdam. Finally--

           Johanna emerges. She finds her parents and crosses towards 
           them. Her emotions then take hold. She dissolves into tears 
           as Aafje takes her in her arms.

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - JOHANNA’S ROOM - LATER

           Johanna sits on the edge of her bed, a photo of her and Sarah 
           in her hands. Both smiling wide, arms wrapped around each 
           other. A Gemma banner behind them: From small things we 
           aspire towards the great. 

           A beat--

           And Johanna comes to a conclusion. She crosses to her 
           dresser, rummages through her clothes until she finds-- 

           The resistance newsletter from Klaus.
           INT. SCHAFT HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Johanna quietly descends the stairs. Finds her parents in the 
           living room, listening to a radio broadcast. 

           She then carefully heads back up. She looks to Klaus’ number 
           on the newsletter and dials on the hallway phone.

                                 JOHANNA
                             (hushed/into phone)
                        Klaus? It’s Jo.
                             (then)
                        Make the introduction.

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - JOHANNA’S ROOM - EVENING

           Johanna looks to a scrap of paper in her hand, an address 
           written on it. She then looks to her reflection in the 
           mirror, exhales heavily. 

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As Johanna makes her way towards the stairs, she passes a 
           bedroom door. She stops. Slowly opens the door to--

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - ANNIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           And takes a cautious step inside. Quite possibly the first 
           time she’s been here in years. 

           An impressive display of academic accolades hang on the wall. 
           All displaying the name Annie Schaft. 

           Johanna crosses towards a bookshelf. She takes a book down, 
           opens the title page and sees “A. Schaft” handwritten in the 
           left hand corner. 

           As she places the book back, something catches her eye--

           An empty space where a single book once sat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - ANNIE’S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

           Johanna (7) helps Annie (14) stack the same bookshelf. 
           Johanna grabs the next book to be put up: Frederick Pollack’s 
           “The League of Nations.”
                                 YOUNG JOHANNA
                        Annie? Is this where you want to 
                        work when you’re older?

                                 ANNIE
                        It is. Do you know why?
                             (off Johanna)
                        Because they’re fighting for what 
                        is right. Just like you should 
                        always do, Jo. Can you promise me 
                        you’ll do that?

                                 YOUNG JOHANNA
                        I promise.

           Annie smiles. Johanna returns it. The admiration Johanna has 
           for her big sister is palpable. She idolizes her.  

           Annie then places the book onto her shelf and as she does, 
           she coughs. It’s painful. 

           Not wanting to alarm Johanna, Annie shakes it off and forces 
           a smile. But something isn’t right... 

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - ANNIE’S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

           A new day. Johanna races in, a paper in her hand. She’s 
           stopped by the sight of Pieter and Aafje standing over Annie 
           in bed. Their concern written on their faces. 

                                 YOUNG JOHANNA
                        Mama? What’s wrong?

           Pieter and Aafje share a heavy look. Pieter kneels to 
           Johanna’s level. 

                                 PIETER
                        Annie’s not feeling well. Why don’t 
                        you give her some rest?

           Johanna looks towards her sister. Unsure of what’s happening. 

                                 YOUNG JOHANNA
                             (re: paper)
                        I got the highest grades in class.

                                 PIETER
                        That’s wonderful, Jo. You can tell 
                        your sister all about it later.

           He gives Johanna an encouraging smile, but it’s forced. 
           Johanna reluctantly leaves.
           INT. SCHAFT HOME - LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Another day. Johanna watches her parents talk with a DOCTOR 
           in the dining room. Their voices hushed, but audible.

                                 DOCTOR
                        The diphtheria has spread to her 
                        heart, leading to myocarditis.
                             (then/somber)
                        Her organs are failing.

           Aafje loses herself to tears. Johanna jumps off her chair and 
           races up the stairs--

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - ANNIE’S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

           And bursts in. Annie lies on the bed. Her skin pale. Lips 
           blue. Nostrils stained with blood.

                                 YOUNG JOHANNA
                        Wake up, Annie!

           She shakes the mattress with everything she has.

                                 YOUNG JOHANNA (CONT’D)
                        WAKE UP! You’re scaring Mama!

           She shakes harder, trying to will her big sister awake. Her 
           face streaked with tears--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - ANNIE’S BEDROOM - BACK IN SCENE

           Johanna’s snapped from her trance by Pieter.

                                 PIETER
                        Supper’s ready.

           Johanna holds her look on the empty space on the bookshelf a 
           moment longer before exiting.

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Johanna and Pieter join Aafje at the table. Aafje fills a 
           bowl with stew, hands it to Johanna.

                                 AAFJE
                        I was thinking that you and I could 
                        knit later. Like we used to. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AAFJE (CONT'D)
                        It might help to take your mind off 
                        everything. 

           Johanna stirs her stew idly for a moment.

                                 AAFJE (CONT’D)
                        Jo?

                                 JOHANNA
                        I can’t...
                             (off Aafje)
                        I’m seeing a friend from 
                        University.

           Aafje throws a look towards Pieter.

                                 AAFJE
                        You’ve only been back a few days. 
                        Don’t you think it’d be better for 
                        you to stay in?

                                 JOHANNA
                        It’s just that we were very close. 
                        And I think it’d be good for me.

           Aafje doesn’t like this. Pieter then takes her hand as if to 
           say, “It’s okay.” Aafje reluctantly relents.

                                 AAFJE
                        Don’t be out too late. And don’t 
                        forget your cardigan. It’s still 
                        getting cool at night.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I know, Mama.

           She puts on a good face, but lying to her parents kills her. 

           EXT. ABANDONED BARN - NIGHT

           Secluded. Johanna and Klaus wait by their bicycles. Johanna’s 
           nerves getting the best of her.

                                 KLAUS
                        Will you relax? You’re making me 
                        nervous. Just be yourself.
                             (then)
                        I did tell’m your name was Hannie.
                             (off Johanna)
                        It’s better you don’t use real 
                        names. Don’t you like Hannie?
                                 JOHANNA
                             (not wanting to admit)
                        It’s fine.

           The sound of a motorcycle approaches. Johanna readies 
           herself. The motorcycle emerges from the shadows. JAN BRASSER 
           (35) steps off. A clean cut man. Diplomatic. 

                                 BRASSER
                        Were you followed?

                                 KLAUS
                        No. We were careful. Jan Brasser, I 
                        present Hannie Schaft.

           Brasser looks her over. Her red hair. Unstylish wardrobe. 
           Innocent face. More librarian than resistance fighter.

                                 BRASSER
                        Klaus tells me you did fine work in 
                        Amsterdam.

           A beat.

                                 JOHANNA
                        I could have done more. 

                                 BRASSER
                        Is that why you’re here? To do 
                        more?

                                 JOHANNA
                        I’m here for the same reason you 
                        are, Mr. Brasser. Resistance.

           Brasser gives Johanna another once over. Contemplating. He 
           then hands her a small piece of paper.

                                 BRASSER
                        In the office upstairs is a list of 
                        prominent NSB. You’ll steal it on 
                        Tuesday.
                             (off Johanna)
                        This is what you wanted, isn’t it?

                                 JOHANNA
                        Yes.

                                 BRASSER
                        Good. The apartment is only empty 
                        from eight to nine at night. If 
                        you’re caught... don’t get caught.

           And with that, he rides off. Klaus takes Johanna’s hand.
                                 KLAUS
                        It’s just like taking IDs. And 
                        you’re damn good at that.
                             (off Johanna’s smile)
                        I’m needed back in Amsterdam. You 
                        take care of yourself. Hannie.

           They share a sincere embrace. Klaus then rides off. Johanna 
           stands alone. Her life never to be the same. (Note: Johanna 
           will now be referred to as Hannie in all scenes.)

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - JOHANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A worried Aafje watches Hannie pack text books into her bag.

                                 HANNIE
                        And while I was buying groceries, I 
                        struck up a conversation with the 
                        store owner. He told me that his 
                        daughter was part of a group of 
                        students who have been meeting in 
                        cafes to continue their studies. He 
                        asked if I’d like to join. 

           Aafje remains unsure. Hannie pours it on.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        My studies are important to me.

                                 AAFJE
                             (reluctant)
                        Well, if you must. Just don’t--

                                 HANNIE
                        Forget my cardigan. I won’t.

           She kisses Aafje and hurries out, leaving Aafje to worry. 

           EXT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Nondescript. Hannie checks the street. No witnesses. She 
           takes a book from her bag and with the spine, covertly breaks 
           the glass pane on the door. She checks for witnesses again. 
           Clear. She then slides her hand in and unlocks the door-- 

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Dark. Quiet. Hannie’s pulse quickens, unsure of what lies 
           around each corner. She heads--
           INT. APARTMENT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Three doors. The first a bedroom. Second a bathroom. Hannie 
           quietly nears the final door. She turns the knob and enters--

           INT. APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           She turns the light on and is startled to find a GIRL behind 
           the desk! Hannie shrieks! She turns to run but a YOUNGER GIRL 
           is behind her and shuts the door! Hannie’s trapped! But then--

                                 YOUNGER GIRL
                        I knew she’d show up! You owe me 
                        five guilders! 

           Hannie’s panic is quickly replaced by confusion. The older 
           girl looks out the window for an approaching ambush. Clear. 
           She then produces a pistol from her pocket, clicks the safety 
           on. 

                                 OLDER GIRL
                        I’m not paying you anything.

           This is TRUUS OVERSTEEGEN (20) and her sister FREDDIE (18). 
           Both a little rough around the edges. Truus is taller than 
           most girls. Her hair a light blonde. Braided. Freddie’s more 
           slender. Her hair a dark brown.

           Truus crosses towards a confused Hannie and grabs her bag. 
           She searches it and finds the books.

                                 HANNIE
                        They’re from University...

                                 TRUUS
                        This isn’t University.

           She pushes Hannie’s belongings back into her chest.

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        Follow us.

                                 HANNIE
                        Are you going to kill me?

                                 TRUUS
                        Not unless you give me a reason to, 
                        Hannie Schaft. Now follow us. I 
                        know you can understand what that 
                        means. You went to University.

           She walks out. Hannie then notices Freddie eyeing her with a 
           sense of awe.
                                 FREDDIE
                        Did you really go to University?

           Hannie nods. Freddie lights up. Extends her hand.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Freddie. That was my sister 
                        Truus. Welcome to the Council.

           And then it dawns on Hannie. The theft was a test.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - LATER

           As the girls enter, a small bell over the door rings. The 
           BUTCHER pays them no mind as he continues slicing meat. 

           Truus eyes Hannie with a particular sense of judgement. Who 
           is this red headed intellectual wanting to join her ranks? 
           The girls enter--

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - MEAT LOCKER - CONTINUOUS

           Bloody slabs of meat hang on hooks. Truus opens a hidden 
           panel in the floor and turns to Hannie.

                                 TRUUS
                        After you, professor.

           Hannie descends the hidden staircase to--

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

           The makeshift headquarters of the Council of Resistance. 
           MEMBERS tend to various tasks. One works a printing press. 
           Another forges papers. A third builds illegal radios while a 
           fourth sorts weapons and ammunition.

           Maps hang on walls. Shelves stacked with equipment and food. 
           A photo of QUEEN WILHELMINA proudly displayed. 

           Hannie’s overwhelmed. Dorothy seeing Oz for the first time. 

           Through an open door leading to a smaller room, Hannie spots  
           Brasser and another man, JAN BONEKAMP (30). A cigarette rests 
           between his lips. His thick brown hair and chiseled features 
           seem better suited for the silver screen.

                                 FREDDIE
                        That’s Jan Bonekamp. He’s been with 
                        the Council since the start.
           Hannie watches the two men discuss plans of some sort. They 
           seem urgent. Intense.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        They’re deciding who dies next.

           The gravity of Hannie’s situation sets in. This is much more 
           than lifting ID cards from unattended changing rooms.

           Feeling Hannie’s gaze, Jan looks up. Their eyes meet. Jan 
           nods a hello. Hannie blushes. The moment is cut short by 
           Brasser shutting the meeting room door.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        This way. I’ll introduce you to 
                        Helena.

           Hannie holds her look on the door for a beat before joining 
           Freddie. On a table she sees a baby doll wrapped in blankets 
           and a large rounded cushion connected to suspenders.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        We distribute supplies across the 
                        city. But if the Jimmies saw us 
                        they’d shoot us where we stood.
                             (re: doll)
                        That’s where Helena comes in.

           She pops a latch inside the stroller and reveals a hidden 
           compartment. Freddie then places a stack of newsletters 
           inside. She then closes it up and places the doll on top. 

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Or you could be expecting.

           Freddie places the suspenders over Hannie’s shoulders so the 
           cushion is situated over her stomach. She looks pregnant. 

           Freddie then unzips a compartment on the cushion and inserts 
           supplies. Hannie grins at the ingenious of it all. 

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        They were Truus’ idea. She likes 
                        making things.

                                 HANNIE
                        They’re very good, Truus.

           But Truus has no time for niceties or compliments.

                                 TRUUS
                        We have a run.

           She brushes past Hannie. 
                                 FREDDIE
                             (to Hannie)
                        Come. I’ll help you get ready.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREET - LATER

           Truus and Freddie push the stroller. Hannie walks along side, 
           the fake belly protruding from underneath her cardigan.

                                 HANNIE
                        You were thirteen?

                                 FREDDIE
                        Uh-huh. Truus was fifteen.

                                 HANNIE
                        And your parents allowed you to 
                        join the resistance that young?

                                 FREDDIE
                        Are you kidding? Our mother got us 
                        started. We’d house refugees from 
                        Germany. Distribute food and 
                        supplies. One big happy family. 
                        Right, Truus?

                                 TRUUS
                        Will you two shut your mouths. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Don’t mind her, Hannie. She’s just 
                        jealous you can read. 

           Truus hits her younger sister in the arm. Freddie retaliates. 

                                 TRUUS
                             (to Hannie/defensive)
                        I can read. I just think there’s 
                        better ways to spend your time than 
                        going to University.

                                 HANNIE
                        Academics are a good thing, Truus.

                                 TRUUS
                        They don’t feed your family.

                                 FREDDIE
                        You can stay and work. I’m going to 
                        learn. Travel. Move to Paris! 

                                 TRUUS
                        So I’ve heard.
                                 FREDDIE
                        I will! So have fun slaving away in 
                        the fields while I’m sipping 
                        champagne with my French lover.

                                 TRUUS
                        You can’t even speak French.

                                 HANNIE
                        I speak French.

                                 TRUUS
                        Of course you do.

                                 HANNIE
                             (in French/subtitled)
                        I could insult you and you wouldn’t 
                        even know it, skank.

                          FREDDIE
                                                          TRUUS
           That’s beautiful!
                                              What did that mean?

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I could help you learn if you’d 
                        like, Freddie.

                                 FREDDIE
                        That’d be swell!
                             (to Truus)
                        See? She’s not a stuck up rag like 
                        you said she’d be.

           The revelation puts a touch of awkwardness in the air. The 
           three continue their journey in silence for a moment. Then--

                                 HANNIE
                        Who does the Council kill? SS?

                                 FREDDIE
                        Some. But mostly it’s Dutch NSB. 
                        Traitors. They make deals with the 
                        Jimmies for profit.
                             (then)
                        So Jan puts a bullet in their 
                        heads. 

           And in this moment, Hannie knows this is the place she needs 
           to be.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of Jimmies...

           Up ahead, a group of SS OFFICERS chat with a group of PRETTY 
           WOMEN outside of a bar. Hannie tenses.
                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Just relax. And remember you’re 
                        pregnant.

           As the girls approach the Officers, Hannie readies for 
           questioning. But to her astonishment, they walk right by 
           without even a glance from the Officers.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Jimmies hate anything with a 
                        stroller or a big belly. Pigs.

           Hannie watches as the Officers and Women flirt. A seductive 
           touch. A whisper exchanged in close quarters. 

           Hannie takes mental note of it all.

           With their attention on the group of Officers, the three 
           girls never see the SS Soldier smoking on a bench. 

                                 SS SOLDIER
                        Good evening, ladies.

           He catches the girls off guard. They politely smile. Their 
           pace quickened a bit. But the Soldier follows.

                                 SS SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Boy or girl? 

                                 TRUUS
                        Girl. 

                                 SS SOLDIER
                        Do you mind if I hold her? 

                                 TRUUS
                        She’s sleeping.

                                 SS SOLDIER
                        I’ll be gentle. I have a newborn in 
                        Germany. I miss their smell.

           At discovery Helena is simply a doll they’re all dead. Truus 
           eyes the pistol taped to the inside of the stroller. The last 
           option. Then-- 

           Hannie doubles over in “pain.”

                                 SS SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Are you alright? Do you need help?

                                 HANNIE
                        Just a rough kick but I think it’s 
                        time we got home.
                                 FREDDIE
                        I knew you shouldn’t have come.

           A quick glance towards Truus.

                                 TRUUS
                        Yes. We told you it was a bad idea.

                                 HANNIE
                        You know me. I love my walks.

                                 SS SOLDIER
                        I could drive you where you needed 
                        to go.

                                 HANNIE
                        You’re too kind. But we’re just up 
                        the block. I can manage from here. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Don’t take her rejection the wrong 
                        way. She’s always this stubborn.

                                 HANNIE
                        Have a lovely night.

           The girls walk on. Once they’re clear, Truus and Hannie catch 
           eyes. Truus gives her a nod of appreciation. Maybe this red 
           head isn’t so bad after all...

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - NIGHT

           Hannie, Truus and Freddie prepare small supply bags 
           consisting of fruit, crackers and other similar items.

                                 HANNIE
                             (in French/subtitled)
                        What is your name?

                                 FREDDIE
                             (in French/subtitled)
                        My name is Freddie.

                                 HANNIE
                        Very good.

           Freddie smiles proudly. As the girls continue their prep 
           work, Hannie glances towards Brasser and Jan in the smaller 
           meeting room. Hannie’s schoolgirl crush on Jan is evident. 
           Jan looks towards her and embarrassed, Hannie quickly averts 
           her attention back to the supply bags. Jan smiles to himself.

           EXT. ABANDONED BARN - LATER

           Hannie, Truus and Freddie help guide a truck as it slowly 
           backs up towards the barn. The girls open the barn doors and 
           usher a group of JEWISH CHILDREN onto the truck, giving each 
           a small supply bag.

           Hannie hands the TRUCK DRIVER a stack of forged ID cards.

                                 HANNIE
                        Phone when you’ve reached the safe 
                        house.

           The Driver nods. Truus and Freddie help the remaining 
           children aboard. Truus then hits the side of the truck and 
           the Driver pulls away. As the truck drives off, a little 
           JEWISH GIRL waves goodbye. Then--

           The distinct sound of gun shots takes us to--

           EXT. HAARLEM STREET - DAY

           The colors of fall evident in the city’s foliage. On his 
           bike, Pieter comes upon a crime scene. A MAN’s lifeless body 
           in a pool of blood. A group of aggravated SS Officers try to 
           piece together what happened. In one of their hands, a copy 
           of “The Truth.” 

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - LATER

           Hannie descends the stairs and notices her fellow Council 
           members huddled around a radio. Freddie motions to her.

                                 FREDDIE
                        The Queen’s broadcasting from 
                        London.

                                 VOICE
                             (on radio)
                        Dear listeners, her majesty the 
                        Queen...

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA 
                             (on radio)
                        We must be aware that this war will 
                        reveal its true character and will 
                        be, in essence, a fight between 
                        good and evil...
           Jan then descends the stairs. Hannie watches as he heads for 
           the smaller room and meets with Brasser. 

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (CONT’D)
                             (on radio)
                        Although the enemy has occupied the 
                        ground of our fatherland, the Dutch 
                        will fight and establish a free and 
                        happy future once again...

           Brasser then draws a large black line through a MAN’s photo. 
           The same Man Pieter saw dead in the streets. 

           Hannie watches this all with great interest. She crosses 
           towards the meeting room. Eavesdrops on the conversation.

                                 JAN (O.S.)
                        I want Ragut next.

                                 BRASSER (O.S.)
                        We’ve talked about this, Jan. He’s 
                        too dangerous a target. I won’t 
                        sign off.

           Hannie furrows her brow. Who is Ragut? 

           Suddenly, Jan comes storming out of the room. Hannie looks 
           inside. Brasser sees her and shuts the door in her face.

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Aafje and Pieter seem in the midst of a serious discussion 
           when Hannie enters and heads up the stairs. 

                                 AAFJE
                        Jo? Could you come in here for a 
                        moment?

                                 HANNIE
                        Yes, Mama?

                                 AAFJE
                        I don’t want you meeting with your 
                        study group any longer.

                                 HANNIE
                        What? Why not?

                                 AAFJE
                        It’s just no longer safe. 

                                 HANNIE
                        But they depend on me.
                                 AAFJE
                        They’ll understand.

                                 HANNIE
                        Why are you doing this? You gave me 
                        your blessing.

                                 AAFJE
                        That was before communist 
                        resistance groups started killing 
                        Germans and NSB in Haarlem.

                                 HANNIE
                        Perhaps they’re doing it because no 
                        one else will.

                                 AAFJE
                        Don’t be ridiculous, Jo. All 
                        they’re going to do is provoke the 
                        SS into more violence. And you of 
                        all people should know what that 
                        violence can lead to. You’re not to 
                        go out anymore. You can continue 
                        your lessons here with us.

                                 HANNIE
                        You can’t force me to stay in.

                                 AAFJE
                        I am your mother. That is exactly 
                        what I can do. 

                                 HANNIE
                        I’m almost twenty-three years old. 
                        I’m not a little girl anymore!

                                 AAFJE
                        I am not going to lose another 
                        daughter!

                                 PIETER
                        Enough.
                             (then)
                        We will not let this war rip this 
                        family apart.

                                 AAFJE
                        It’s too dangerous, Jo.

                                 HANNIE
                             (towards Pieter)
                        I can take care of myself.

           Pieter senses something different about his daughter. A beat--
                                 PIETER
                        The moment there’s trouble you come 
                        home.

                                 AAFJE
                        You’re letting her go?

           Aafje can’t believe it, but Pieter’s decision is final. Aafje 
           stalks out of the room.

                                 HANNIE
                        Thank you, Papa.

           She gives him a kiss on the cheek and exits. Pieter watches 
           her with pride yet concern. Does he know of her resistance 
           work?

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - NIGHT

           Superimpose: October 1943.

           Hannie (23) gets her makeup and hair done by Freddie. 

                                 TRUUS
                        Focus on officers. They’ve got the 
                        most information. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Give ‘em the impression you’re 
                        interested. Laugh at their jokes. 
                        And no matter what spews from their 
                        pig mouths, just nod and smile.

                                 HANNIE
                        Nod and smile. Sounds easy enough.

           Freddie adds a final touch to Hannie’s hair and nods to 
           Truus. Truus then holds a mirror up to Hannie.

                                 TRUUS
                        What do you think?

           Hannie’s taken aback by what she sees. Her red hair 
           beautifully styled with curls. Lipstick. Blush. Eye shadow. 
           She looks gorgeous. 

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        Remember. It’s just an act.

                                 FREDDIE
                             (in French/subtitled)
                        Good luck.
           Hannie gives Truus and Freddie an embrace. As Hannie crosses 
           towards the stairs, other MEMBERS wish her good luck as well. 
           Except one. 

           A man working on a radio, NIELS (30), eyes her with 
           judgement.

                                 NIELS
                        You best shower before you come 
                        back here.

           The comment throws Hannie for a moment. Niels holds his look 
           of contempt before taking his radio and walking off. 

           Hannie decides to let it go. For now. She ascends the stairs--

           EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - BACK - MOMENTS LATER

           And finds Jan loading his truck with a few suitcases.

                                 HANNIE
                        Running away?

           Jan turns and is rendered speechless by Hannie’s new look.

                                 JAN
                        Hannie... you look beautiful.

           A moment. Jan catches himself staring. 

                                 JAN (CONT’D)
                             (re: suitcases)
                        I’m heading north on a supply run.

                                 HANNIE
                        I didn’t know you went on runs.

                                 JAN
                        I promised someone I would.

           There’s clearly more there, but Hannie doesn’t push.

                                 HANNIE
                        My train departs for Amsterdam 
                        soon. I should go.

                                 JAN
                        Of course. Good luck.

           There’s a bit of an awkward beat before Hannie walks off. Jan 
           watches her turn the corner then shakes his head at himself. 
           He tosses the last suitcase into the truck and drives off.
           INT. AMSTERDAM NIGHTCLUB - LATER

           Filled to capacity with a clientele that could only be 
           brought together by war. NSB. SS OFFICERS. SOLDIERS. 
           BUSINESSMEN. LOCALS. WOMEN. All drink and socialize.

           In the midst of this all is Hannie. It’s not only her red 
           hair that causes her to stick out, but also her clear 
           indifference to the debauchery around her.

           She idles up to the bar. Spots a WOMAN flirting with an SS 
           OFFICER. Hannie studies how the Woman sits. How she moves her 
           hands. Bites her lip. Hannie emulates the Woman’s mannerisms 
           for a moment but quickly becomes self conscious.  

           She tries to get the BARTENDER’S attention, but fails. Then--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Allow me.

           Hannie turns to see an SS OFFICER standing by her side. 
           Overweight and balding, his collar badges label him as 
           STURMBANNFÜHRER (Major) KNOPF (51). He snaps his fingers and 
           the Bartender hustles over. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yes, sir. What can I get you?

           Knopf looks towards Hannie, “Go ahead.”

                                 HANNIE
                        Champagne. 

                                 KNOPF
                        No. No. A fine woman deserves a 
                        fine drink. Two cognacs. 

           The Bartender gets to work. Hannie feels Knopf’s eyes all 
           over her.

                                 KNOPF (CONT’D)
                        Before I arrived here, I heard this 
                        vicious rumor that Dutch women were 
                        more beautiful than German.

           He lightly brushes Hannie’s red hair from her shoulder.

                                 KNOPF (CONT’D)
                        But now I must admit that rumor is 
                        true.

                                 HANNIE
                        You mean you doubted it?
           Knopf grins. The Bartender places their drinks down. Knopf 
           raises his glass for a toast.

                                 KNOPF
                        To the Führer.

           Those words are nails on a chalkboard to Hannie, but she  
           does the only thing she can do. Nod and smile.

           INT. AMSTERDAM NIGHTCLUB - LATER

           Hannie and Knopf have moved to a private booth. Knopf shovels 
           oysters into his mouth as if he hadn’t eaten in months. 

                                 KNOPF
                        Your Dutch forces are fine but the 
                        SS... the SS is the future.

           He sips another cognac, clearly intoxicated. His ogling of 
           Hannie confirms as such. He slides closer to her. 

                                 KNOPF (CONT’D)
                        Do you like jewelry? Who am I 
                        kidding? You’re a woman! Of course 
                        you do! Always blabbering with your 
                        friends about whose collections are 
                        the prettiest.

                                 HANNIE
                        Yes. Yes that’s true.

                                 KNOPF
                        I will see to it that our next 
                        shipment contains the finest jewels 
                        from around Europe. A gift for my 
                        cherry headed fräulein.   

           He laughs, polishes off his cognac and extravagantly motions 
           for another. The word “shipment” catches Hannie’s attention.

                                 HANNIE
                        You’re too kind. When will that be? 
                        I would love to model them for you.

           But Knopf is too busy cheering on the new musical act that 
           has taken the stage. A WAITER drops off another cognac. Knopf 
           takes a hefty pull. 

           Hannie realizes she needs to remove him from this 
           environment. She leans in and whispers into Knopf’s ear. Her 
           words immediately grab his attention. 
           INT. KNOPF’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Hannie sits on the sofa. Her hands clammy with nervous sweat. 
           As Knopf pours two drinks, he sways from intoxication.

                                 KNOPF
                             (re: apartment)
                        What do you think?

                                 HANNIE
                        It’s lovely.

                                 KNOPF
                        Its previous owner had a one way 
                        ticket to Auschwitz.

           He chuckles at the thought of this. It turns Hannie’s 
           stomach. Knopf then crosses to her, hands her a drink. Takes 
           a long pull from his own. 

           His eyes undress Hannie. It’s impersonal. Hannie’s glass 
           trembles in her hands.

                                 KNOPF (CONT’D)
                        You’ve no reason to fear me.

           Knopf takes Hannie’s drink from her hands and places it onto 
           the table. He then slides his arm around her. Smells a 
           handful of her red hair. Her body stiffens.

           Knopf’s other hand then slides her dress up her thigh. She 
           can only withstand it for a short moment before rising. 

                                 HANNIE
                        Allow me to freshen up first.

           Annoyed, Knopf motions towards the bathroom. 

           INT. KNOPF’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Hannie locks the door and fights off her tears. She looks to 
           her reflection in the mirror. Gathers herself.

                                 HANNIE
                        It’s just an act. 

           Something on the sink then catches her attention. Knopf’s 
           razor. A quick slit of his throat would do the trick. She 
           looks back to her reflection. Into the eyes of a woman 
           capable of much more than she ever thought possible. Then--

           The sound of glass breaking comes from the living room--
           INT. KNOPF’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Hannie finds Knopf passed out on the sofa. His glass of 
           cognac broken on the floor. Hannie waves her hand in front of 
           his face. Nothing. Only his loud snoring. He’s out. 

           Hannie takes the opportunity to rummage through the 
           apartment. She looks through bookcases. Drawers. Cabinets. 

           She then notices an official looking note pad by the liquor. 
           As she scans through it, her face lights up. Jackpot. She 
           quickly transcribes the information into her own note pad.

           As she turns to leave, she notices Knopf’s Hakenkreuz pin on 
           the label of his jacket. A beat. 

           Then Hannie crosses over and defiantly rips the pin off. As 
           she exits--

           The popular love song “Lili Marlene” begins playing...

                                 SINGER (O.S.)
                        Outside the barracks/By the corner 
                        light/I'll always stand and wait 
                        for you at night...

           INT. AMSTERDAM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           A beautiful SINGER stands on stage under spotlight. Amidst 
           the packed dance floor is Hannie and an SS OFFICER.

                                 SINGER
                        We will create a world for two/I'll 
                        wait for you the whole night 
                        through/For you Lili Marlene, for 
                        you Lili Marlene... 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Jan sets spike strips in the road, then fades into the woods 
           just as a German supply truck approaches. It’s followed by a 
           staff car holding the SS Officer Hannie was just dancing 
           with.

                                 SINGER (O.S.)
                        Bugler tonight, don't play the call 
                        to arms/I want another evening with 
                        her charms...

           The truck can’t avoid the spikes. The tires pop! The truck 
           veers into a ditch. Supplies spill out onto the road. Ruined. 
           The staff car pulls over. The SS Officer furious.
           INT. AMSTERDAM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Hannie dances with a SECOND SS OFFICER. 

                                 SINGER
                        Then we will say goodbye and 
                        part/I'll always keep you in my 
                        heart/With me Lili Marlene, with me 
                        Lili Marlene...

           INT. HOME - OFFICE - DAY

           Jan inserts the combination to a safe. A photo of the Second 
           SS Officer on the desk behind him.

                                 SINGER (O.S.)
                        Give me a rose to show how much you 
                        care/Tie to the stem a lock of 
                        golden hair...

           The safe opens. Among Nazi paraphernalia are stacks of cash. 
           Jan takes them all.

           INT. AMSTERDAM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Hannie’s with a THIRD SS OFFICER.

                                 SINGER
                        Surely tomorrow you'll feel 
                        blue/But then will come a love 
                        that's new/For you Lili Marlene, 
                        for you Lili Marlene...

           He whispers something. She laughs. If we didn’t know better 
           we’d think she were a Nazi.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - DAY

           Hannie gives her new information over to Brasser and Jan.

                                 SINGER (O.S.)
                        When we are marching in the mud and 
                        cold/And when my pack seems more 
                        than I can hold...

           From across the room, Niels eyes Hannie with great disdain.

           INT. AMSTERDAM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Hannie’s with a FOURTH SS OFFICER. He eyes her tenderly.
                                 SINGER
                        I'll long for you, and use my 
                        might/I'm warm again, my pack feels 
                        light...

           And then something unexpected happens...

                                 SINGER (CONT’D)
                        It's you Lili Marlene, it's you 
                        Lili Marlene...

           The Fourth SS Officer kisses Hannie. She recoils. Horrified. 
           Until now she’s been able to avoid this.

                                 SINGER (CONT’D)
                        My love for you renews my might/I’m 
                        warm again, my pack is light...

           Unable to stand it, Hannie runs off. 

                                 SINGER (CONT’D)
                        It's you Lili Marlene, it's you 
                        Lili Marlene.

           The band plays out the melody. The crowd breaks into 
           enthusiastic applause. The Fourth SS Officer left wondering 
           what went wrong.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - DAY

           Hannie descends the stairs. A look of determination on her 
           face. She heads straight for Brasser and Jan in the meeting 
           room when-- 

                                 NIELS (O.S.)
                        Hannie!

           The room falls uncomfortably silent. Hannie turns to Niels. 

                                 NIELS (CONT’D)
                        You don’t belong here.

           He slowly makes his way towards her.

                                 NIELS (CONT’D)
                        How does it make you all feel that 
                        while you fight she’s spreadin’ her 
                        legs like a red headed Jimmy whore.

                                 BRASSER
                        Niels--
                                 HANNIE
                        Let him talk.

                                 NIELS
                        She’s not one of us. 

           The two are now inches apart.

                                 NIELS (CONT’D)
                        She thinks she’s better than we 
                        are. Looks down on us. But she’s 
                        nothin’ more than a well read 
                        traitor. And all traitors should 
                        hang.

           Hannie’s words are concise, but coated with rage.

                                 HANNIE
                        I want you to listen to me 
                        carefully. Everything I do is for 
                        the resistance. Every distribution 
                        run. Every surveillance mission. 
                        Every lie I tell my parents. It’s 
                        all for the resistance same as you. 
                        So you can call me a whore. A snob. 
                        But the one thing you will not call 
                        me is a traitor. And the next time 
                        you do, I promise those’ll be the 
                        last words you ever speak.

           The tension in the room is palpable. Hannie’s new found 
           intensity a shock to the others. Except Jan. He’s impressed.

                                 BRASSER
                        Come on, Niels. Why don’t you step 
                        out for some air. 

           As two other Members lead Niels away, he never breaks from 
           Hannie, nor she from him.

                                 NIELS
                        She’s goin’ to get us all killed!

           As Niels disappears up the stairs, Hannie finally lets out a 
           breath. She looks towards Truus and Freddie, “I’m okay.”

                                 BRASSER
                             (to Hannie)
                        Come with me.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Brasser shuts the door once Hannie and Jan enter.
                                 BRASSER
                        Christ, Hannie! What in the hell 
                        was that?

                                 HANNIE
                        He hurls accusations and I don’t 
                        have the right to defend myself?

                                 BRASSER
                        You threatened to kill him.

                                 HANNIE
                        Because no one calls me a traitor. 
                        Now if we can move past this, I’d 
                        like to discuss my role within the 
                        Council.

                                 BRASSER
                        Your role? Your role is defined.

                                 HANNIE
                        By you. But I can be much more than 
                        just a woman pretending to be 
                        pregnant or some “Jimmy whore” as 
                        Niels so eloquently put it.  

                                 BRASSER
                        What are you talking about?

                                 HANNIE
                        Liquidations.

           Brasser and Jan exchange a weighty look. 

                                 BRASSER
                        Hannie--

                                 HANNIE
                        How much more do I need to prove 
                        myself to you?
                             (then)
                        Do you know how many different 
                        career paths there are in the field 
                        of linguistics? Dozens. I wasn’t 
                        aware of that until I met Sarah 
                        Feldt. She was deciding between 
                        translator or speech therapist. I 
                        always told her that she’d be great 
                        at either one. But she never got 
                        the chance to make that choice 
                        because she was murdered after a 
                        traitor gave her up. After I 
                        promised I’d keep her safe.
                             (to Brasser)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANNIE (CONT'D)
                        You asked me if I was here to do 
                        more. So let me do more.

           Brasser remains unsure. But Jan’s seeing Hannie in a whole 
           new light. He eyes her with respect and adoration. Then--

                                 JAN
                        Krauts would never suspect a woman 
                        assassin. 

                                 BRASSER
                        You think this is a good idea?

           Jan looks to Hannie. This fierce. Devoted. Intelligent. 
           Beautiful red headed woman. He smiles.

                                 JAN
                        Yeah. I do.

           And with that, there is no more debate. 

           EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Hannie heads for her bike. Jan catches up to her.

                                 JAN
                        You showed a lot of guts back 
                        there.

                                 HANNIE
                        I don’t think Brasser likes the 
                        idea very much.

                                 JAN
                        He’s a father. I think he’s just 
                        protective of you girls. He’ll get 
                        over it. And if not, I’ll set him 
                        straight for you. 

           They exchange smiles. A beat. Then--

                                 JAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to have a drink with 
                        me, Hannie Schaft?

           Hannie blushes, pins her red hair behind her ears.

                                 HANNIE
                        I’d love to. 
           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Hannie and Jan sit on a blanket underneath the star filled 
           Netherlands sky. A bottle of wine rests between them as does 
           a comfortable silence.

                                 JAN
                        I used to sit and listen like this 
                        as a child. I thought the sounds of 
                        nature protected me. If I focused 
                        on them I’d be safe.

           This softer side of Jan surprises Hannie. But she admires it.

                                 JAN (CONT’D)
                        Try it.

           Hannie closes her eyes and listens. Slowly, the sounds of 
           nature amplify. A cricket. A frog. An owl. The leaves 
           rustling in the breeze. It all comes together to form a 
           beautiful symphony.

                                 HANNIE
                        Yes. I hear it...

           She smiles, lost in the serenity of it all. Jan watches her. 
           Completely taken. She turns towards him and catches him 
           looking at her. A beat. Then Jan readjusts.

                                 JAN
                        I spent most of my childhood doing 
                        that.

                                 HANNIE
                        I spent most of mine in my room 
                        studying.

                                 JAN
                        You think we would have gotten 
                        along as kids?

                                 HANNIE
                        I don’t think you would have even 
                        knew I existed.

                                 JAN
                        Why do you say that?

                                 HANNIE
                        Because no one ever did. 

           Hannie feels Jan’s gaze and turns towards him. But this time 
           he doesn’t look away.
                                 JAN
                        I see you now.

                                 HANNIE
                        What do you see?

                                 JAN
                        A leader.

           A charged moment. Sparks. Jan brings his hand to Hannie’s 
           cheek. She turns into it, feels his touch. 

           They kiss. It’s passionate. Meaningful.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        Today, we have to admit that no 
                        happiness can be expected in this 
                        world...

           EXT. AMSTERDAM GHETTO - DAY

           Surrounded by barbed wire. Now the “home” for every Jew in 
           the Netherlands. Squads of SS Soldiers force FAMILIES, now 
           branded with Star of David patches, into trucks.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        If those who are solely responsible 
                        for the present situation are not 
                        stopped in their course of 
                        unscrupulous destruction...

           A JEWISH MAN breaks towards his SON. He’s gunned down.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Hannie, Truus and Freddie watch a train filled with JEWISH 
           PRISONERS roar past them.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        And disregard of law and the most 
                        elementary principles of 
                        morality...

           Brief glimpses of FACES herded together in cattle cars.
           EXT. POWER PLANT - VELSEN-NOORD - NIGHT

           Each carrying a bag, Hannie and Jan sneak towards the outer 
           fence of the large facility. A GERMAN GUARD stands watch by 
           the entrance a hundred yards away.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        This war is world wide to ensure 
                        that those who are willing to do 
                        good will not be obstructed...

           Jan climbs over the fence. Then Hannie. The pair then 
           cautiously enter the power plant unseen. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Hannie takes aim at a half dozen targets set up on a fallen 
           tree trunk. Jan observes from behind. Hannie fires--

           But misses every target.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        Brute force is not able to take 
                        away the conviction of a people...

           Jan places his hands over hers. Instructing. Hannie soaks it 
           in with great focus.

           EXT. HOME - ATTIC - NIGHT

           A FAMILY assists their JEWISH REFUGEES in lighting a menorah.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        Just as weapons and fire, poverty 
                        and suffering could not exterminate 
                        our freedom of conscience and our 
                        freedom of religion...

           Feeling a wave of emotion, the JEWISH FATHER brings his 
           family together in his arms. 

           INT. POWER PLANT - VELSEN-NOORD - NIGHT

           Conveyor belts feed coal into boilers that glow red and 
           orange. 

           Hannie and Jan remove explosives from their bags.
                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        It is a fight that is necessary for 
                        me to say will happen on a 
                        spiritual level and be fought deep 
                        in the heart of the people...

           Quickly, the pair set their explosives on the conveyor belts. 
           Wires connected. Fuses inserted and lit.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Amidst a steady rain, Hannie aims her pistol at her targets. 
           Jan watches. She takes a deep breath and fires--

           And hits three of six. 

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        So I feel convinced that we as a 
                        people will emerge stronger from 
                        this...

           Hannie reloads. She brushes her wet red hair from her eyes, 
           takes aim again. Jan gives a last piece of instruction.

           EXT. GERMAN GARAGE - NIGHT

           Moving through the shadows, Hannie and Jan make their way to 
           a line of supply trucks. 

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        That for this noble goal, for which 
                        thousands of courageous people have 
                        already given their lives, was not 
                        in vain...

           They slash tires. Damage fuel tanks. Cut brake lines.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Hannie aims her pistol. She’s relaxed. Confident. She fires--

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        I pray that our allied cause be 
                        blessed...

           And hits all six targets. Full of excitement, she races 
           towards Jan. They kiss.
           INT. POWER PLANT - VELSEN-NOORD - NIGHT

           The lit fuses on each explosive grow shorter.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        And that the dawn of the day...

           EXT. POWER PLANT - VELSEN-NOORD - CONTINUOUS

           Hannie and Jan climb back over the fence. They hurry into the 
           back of a waiting truck. It drives off.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        When freedom will be restored in 
                        the Netherlands...

           INT. POWER PLANT - VELSEN-NOORD - CONTINUOUS

           The fuses dwindle.

                                 QUEEN WILHELMINA (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        And to all other victims of German 
                        aggression be near.

           AN EXPLOSION!

           The conveyor belts ripped apart, collapsing inward. Support 
           beams buckle. Fire engulfs the entire plant. German Soldiers 
           and workers frantically try to contain the blaze.

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Hannie interlocks her fingers with Jan’s, rests her head on 
           his shoulder. They watch until the flames fade from view.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Brasser circles the table, handing intelligence to Hannie and 
           Jan. Jan looks exhausted, but he’d never admit it. 

                                 BRASSER
                        This is Pieter Faber. 

                                 JAN
                        Why not give us Ragut? He’s killing 
                        more resistance fighters every day.
                                 BRASSER
                        This is Pieter Faber. A Dutch 
                        businessman who’s made a small 
                        fortune aiding the SS.

           Jan shakes his head at Brasser’s unwillingness to okay the 
           hit on this Ragut. 

           Hannie looks to the photo of PIETER FABER (53).

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Faber shares a list of names with an SS OFFICER. Pleased, the 
           Officer returns the favor with a stack of cash.

           INT. HOME - ATTIC - NIGHT

           A MAN helps JEWISH REFUGEES settle in. Suddenly, a group of 
           SS Soldiers burst in and forcefully take them all away.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - MEETING ROOM - BACK IN 
           SCENE

           Hannie burns Faber’s face into her memory. Brasser drops 
           another photo onto the table. This one of a proud Faber in 
           front of a Nazi flag. His arms around two YOUNG SS SOLDIERS. 

                                 BRASSER
                        Those are his sons.

           Another photo drops. This one a home.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        He’s taken precaution for his 
                        safety and he’s renting this home 
                        in Heemstede. He cycles the same 
                        route every day before work.

           Brasser opens a map. A route highlighted.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        This road here. Lombokstraat. It’s 
                        the least populated. This is where 
                        you’ll kill him.

           The severity of the situation hits Hannie hard, but this was 
           what she wanted.

                                 JAN
                             (points to map)
                        I can wait here with the truck.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAN (CONT'D)
                             (to Hannie)
                        Once you fire, don’t stop peddling 
                        until you reach me.

           Brasser places a single cyanide capsule in front of Hannie.

                                 BRASSER
                        If you’re caught just bite down.

           If there was ever a time to back out, now is it. A beat. 

           And Hannie slips the capsule into her bra. She catches eyes 
           with Jan. He gives her an encouraging nod.

           The meeting is then interrupted by a loud banging on the 
           door. Brasser opens it to a COUNCIL MEMBER--

                                 COUNCIL MEMBER
                        You must come and listen!

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

           The three join the others huddled around a radio.

                                 BBC BROADCASTER
                             (on radio)
                        I repeat. Under the command of 
                        General Eisenhower, Allied naval 
                        forces supported by strong air 
                        forces, began landing Allied armies 
                        this morning on the northern coast 
                        of France...

           A cautious optimism fills the room. A MAN breaks from the 
           group, turns to the photo of Queen Wilhelmina and starts 
           singing the Dutch national anthem, “Wilhelmus.”

                                 MAN
                             (singing)
                        William of Nassau, am I, of Dutch 
                        blood. Loyal to the fatherland, I 
                        will remain until I die...

           Hannie, her arms linked with Truus and Freddie, sings along 
           with her countrymen at full volume. Jan joins them. 

                                 GROUP
                             (singing)
                        A prince of Orange, am I, free and 
                        fearless...

           The entire room bursts with pride. They will not go quietly.   
           INT. SCHAFT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Superimpose: June 8th, 1944.

           Hannie watches Aafje wash dishes from the doorway. Knowing 
           these could be the final moments she has with her mother, 
           Hannie crosses towards Aafje and wraps her arms around her. 

                                 HANNIE
                        I love you.

                                 AAFJE
                        I love you too, Jo.

           INT. TRUCK - LATER

           Jan drives. A cigarette between his lips. In the passenger 
           seat, the ball of nervous energy that is Hannie. Suddenly--

                                 HANNIE
                        Pull over.

           Jan does so. Hannie opens the door and vomits onto the road. 
           When she’s done, Jan hands her a canteen. She chugs it down.

                                 JAN
                        Just think of what this man has 
                        done. He deserves to die.
                             (takes Hannie’s hand)
                        This is for Sarah.

           Off Hannie, knowing Jan is right--

           EXT. HEEMSTEDE - LATER

           Superimpose: Heemstede.

           Narrow, tree lined streets. Rows of similar looking homes 
           attached to one another. Tranquil.

           Faber exits his home. A Nazi flag proudly displayed out 
           front. He mans his bicycle and peddles away-- 

           WITH HANNIE

           A good fifty yards away. She pursues--

           WITH FABER

           Enjoying his ride. The warm sun on his face. He nods to 
           NEIGHBORS as he passes. Turns right onto Timorstraat--
           WITH HANNIE

           Turns onto Timorstraat. Keeps her distance--

           WITH FABER

           Turns onto Lombokstraat. Passes a GARDNER pruning some 
           bushes. The Gardner nods hello, then continues his work. He 
           kneels and becomes obstructed by the wall of bushes--

           WITH HANNIE

           Turning onto Lombokstraat. Picks up her pace. As she passes 
           the Gardner’s home, he stands. She did not see him.

           Hannie removes her pistol. Her pulse quickens. The gap 
           between she and Faber continues to shrink. Fifty feet... 
           forty... thirty... twenty... ten... five...

           IN SLOW MOTION:

           Hannie comes along Faber’s left side. Sensing her, he glances 
           over. His eyes land on the pistol in her hand. A split second 
           of realization. Then--

           IN REAL TIME:

           Hannie pulls the trigger three times!

           Faber slumps forward. The bike careens left. Its front tire 
           catches the curb and sends Faber crashing to the pavement.

           WITH THE GARDNER

           Hearing the shots, he races into the street. Sees Faber lying 
           dead on the ground and a woman with red hair peddling away.

           WITH HANNIE

           White knuckling the handlebars. She turns a corner and finds 
           Jan waiting by the truck.

           INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Jan speeds through the narrow streets. With her adrenaline 
           pumping, Hannie grabs Jan. They kiss hard.

           EXT. THE BROWN HOUSE - DAY

           Superimpose: Berlin.

           The headquarters of the Nazi Party. 
           INT. THE BROWN HOUSE - SECRETARIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Typewriter keys punching at paper. Dozens of SECRETARIES 
           write memos on official Nazi letterhead. 

           A BLONDE SECRETARY finishes one such memo. She places it into 
           an envelope and stamps it: (subtitled) Chancellery of the 
           Führer of the Nazi Party

           She walks it over to a COURIER. He hurries off.

           INT. EL-DE HAUS - DAY

           Superimpose: Cologne.

           The headquarters and prison for the Gestapo.

           INT. EL-DE HAUS - INTERROGATION CELL - CONTINUOUS

           An ominous 30x30 cell. A PRISONER, face bludgeoned, sits tied 
           to a chair. A GESTAPO OFFICER beside him. 

           Across from them sits OBERSTURMBANNFÜHRER (Lieutenant 
           Colonel) CARVER (40) of the SD. Impeccably groomed and 
           dressed. A man that loves the sound of his own voice.  

                                 CARVER
                        You hold the power to end this. 

           The Prisoner remains silent. Carver’s eyes shift to the 
           Gestapo Officer. Heavy punches then rain down upon the 
           Prisoner. Blood spatters onto the floor. 

           As the brutality continues, Carver takes a sip of coffee. 
           Flinches as he burns his tongue.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                             (mumbled)
                        God damn it...

           He dabs his mouth with a handkerchief. There’s no rush to end 
           the punishment. Finally, almost as an afterthought--

           Carver nods. The Gestapo Officer stops. Blood pours from the 
           Prisoner’s mouth. He spits out a tooth. Then another.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Where are your accomplices?

           Silence. Before Carver can give another signal, loud banging 
           comes from outside the cell door. 
           Irritated that someone would bother him during his work, 
           Carver reluctantly opens the door. The Courier from earlier 
           hands him the envelope. Snaps his heels together and salutes.

                                 COURIER
                        Heil Hitler!

           He exits. Carver sees the stamp on the outside of the 
           envelope. This is important. He opens it, pulls out the memo. 
           The contents coming as a surprise. 

           While still reading, he crosses back towards the Prisoner. 
           Calmly removes his pistol from its holder. He places the 
           barrel to the Prisoner’s forehead and pulls the trigger.

           The Prisoner’s body goes limp. Blood spills onto the ground. 
           Carver sits back down and has another sip of coffee. The 
           Gestapo Officer stands awkwardly by the dead Prisoner. Unsure 
           of what to do. Carver finishes reading. Then--  

                                 CARVER
                        A woman with red hair?

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Schaft family spends a rare night together. Pieter reads 
           while Hannie and Aafje knit. There’s a knock at the door. 

                                 HANNIE
                             (to Aafje)
                        Sit. I’ll get it.

           She crosses to the front door. Her heart jumps to her throat 
           when she sees Jan. 

           She instantly knows something isn’t right.

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The mood is tense.

                                 PIETER
                        You’re sure of this?

                                 JAN
                        We have a contact within the Dutch 
                        police. He caught word of it. 
                        Hitler has tasked the SD with 
                        finding the woman with red hair.

           Aafje silently weeps. Pieter processes this news. Nothing any 
           parent wants to hear.
                                 JAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry but it’s no longer safe 
                        for Hannie in Haarlem.

           Unable to hear more, Aafje hastily leaves the room. Hannie’s 
           heart breaks. Eyes welling, Pieter embraces his daughter. 

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - JOHANNA’S ROOM - LATER

           Aafje sits on the bed. A photo of Annie and Hannie in her 
           hands. A heartsick mother longing for simpler times. 

           Hannie emerges in the doorway, then joins Aafje on the bed.

                                 AAFJE
                        I see so much of her in you. 
                             (then)
                        You really did those things?

                                 HANNIE
                        Yes.

           It hurts Aafje in more ways than one to hear that. 

                                 AAFJE
                        You took a man’s life, Jo. 

                                 HANNIE
                        A traitor. Liquidation is the only 
                        way to stop them. The only way to 
                        prevent what happened to Sarah 
                        happening to someone else.

           She takes Aafje’s hand in hers. Emotions run high.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t your fault. You are a 
                        wonderful mother. You showed me 
                        what it was to be compassionate to 
                        others. Raised me to see the good 
                        in people. You encouraged me. You 
                        taught me. You protected me.  

           Aafje weeps. Hannie squeezes her hands tighter.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I want to make sure every child has 
                        the chance to experience the same 
                        love from their mothers as I’ve 
                        felt from mine. 

           Aafje pulls Hannie close, tears flowing. An embrace neither 
           of them wants to end. 
           There’s a timid knock on the door and Pieter enters.

                                 PIETER
                        Jan wants to get you on the road.

           The women separate. Hannie then crosses to her father. It’s a 
           moment that mirrors when Hannie left for University. Only the 
           stakes are much higher. Still, Pieter has the same advice-- 

                                 PIETER (CONT’D)
                        You give ‘em hell.

           Hannie buries her head into Pieter’s chest. He kisses her 
           forehead. Face wrecked with emotion.

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - ANNIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hannie steps in, the copy of “The League of Nations” in her 
           hand. She crosses towards the bookshelf and slides the book 
           into the empty space. Its original home.

           Her eyes then land on a photo of Annie. A beat--

                                 HANNIE
                        I promise I won’t stop fighting.

           EXT. DE WITT HOME - LATER

           Superimpose: Limmen.

           A modest farm home. Isolated. ISA DE WITT (62), maternal, 
           awaits out front along with Brasser. 

           Jan’s truck travels up the long dirt road. Comes to a stop in 
           front of the house. Isa meets Hannie with a warm smile.

                                 ISA
                        Welcome. Let’s get you cleaned up.

           She leads Hannie inside. Brasser and Jan stand in silence. 
           Jan lights a cigarette, takes a long drag. Then--

                                 JAN
                        What?

                                 BRASSER
                        I met with the Council.

                                 JAN
                        Did you now?
                                 BRASSER
                        We all agreed that it’d be best if 
                        you laid low for the time being.

                                 JAN
                        Laid low? Is that a joke?

                                                           JAN
                                              It’s not happening.
                          BRASSER
           You’ve been putting in a lot 
           of work--

                                 BRASSER
                        Look at yourself for Christ sake. 
                        You look like shit, Jan.

                                 JAN
                        Appreciate your concern. But if 
                        Hannie isn’t stopping, I’m not 
                        stopping. End of discussion. 

                                 BRASSER
                        No one is denying the importance of 
                        what you two do but there comes a 
                        time when we have to be smart.

                                 JAN
                        And this is smart to you? Hiding?

                                 BRASSER
                        Think about it. They’ve known who 
                        you were for a while and now they 
                        know Hannie.

                                 JAN
                        They have the color of her hair.

                                 BRASSER
                        Damnit, Jan! This is bigger than 
                        you. We have to think about the 
                        resistance.

                                 JAN
                        We are the resistance!

           INT. DE WITT HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The argument outside can be heard. Hannie strains to listen. 
           Isa unpacks a hair dye kit.

                                 ISA
                        Come. Come.

           She gently leans Hannie’s head under the faucet.
           EXT. DE WITT HOME - CONTINUOUS

                                 JAN
                        If we lie low, people die. Families 
                        are destroyed. I can’t live with 
                        that. So tell the Council that 
                        Hannie and I will stop the moment 
                        Hitler’s hung by his God damn neck. 
                        Not a second sooner. 

                                 BRASSER
                        Jan--

                                 JAN
                        So in the meantime, you can go back 
                        to Haarlem, talk to whoever you 
                        need to talk to and okay the 
                        fucking Ragut hit.

           He flicks his cigarette away and walks back to the house.

                                 BRASSER
                        She looks up to you. She’d do 
                        anything you tell her to.  

           Jan pauses. 

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        It’s not just your life you have to 
                        worry about anymore.

           A beat. Without looking back--

                                 JAN
                        You’re wrong. I look up to her.

           And with that he heads inside.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           Jan sits on the bed. The photo of Hannie and Sarah hung on 
           the wall behind him.

                                 HANNIE (O.S.)
                        Are you ready?

                                 JAN
                        On the edge of my seat.

           The door to the bathroom opens. Hannie steps out. 

           Her signature red hair now jet black. A pair of horn rimmed 
           glasses on her face. She playfully spins.
                                 HANNIE
                        Well? 

                                 JAN
                        Like a starlet.

           Hannie smiles. The two fall onto the bed, lips interlocking.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           Hannie’s awoken by the sound of a car engine outside. She 
           soon realizes Jan’s not in the room. 

           She crosses to the window and sees Jan loading the truck. He 
           drives off, leaving Hannie puzzled by his secrecy.

           INT. GERMAN STAFF CAR - DAY

           Carver sits in the back, observing the passing scenery with a 
           curiosity which resembles that of a tourist on vacation. The 
           car comes to a stop. He exits to--

           EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           A squad of SS Soldiers await his arrival. They salute. Carver 
           straightens his uniform jacket and heads inside.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Three Soldiers surround the nervous Butcher as Carver peruses 
           the shop. He samples a piece of sausage. Shrugs. “Not bad.” 
           Then--

                                 CARVER
                        I don’t want to have to hurt you.

           He calmly walks to the counter and holds his look on the 
           trembling Butcher. He knows he has him.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Just tell me where.

           The Butcher’s eyes shift to the meat locker-- 

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - MEAT LOCKER - CONTINUOUS

           The Soldiers ready their rifles. Carver gives the signal and 
           the panel in the floor is opened--
           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

           Cleaned out. A Soldier checks the meeting room. Empty. 
           Carver’s attention falls on the only items left behind. 

           Knopf’s Hakenkreuz pin that Hannie ripped off and a single 
           piece of paper. On it: (subtitled) Hang all traitors.

           Carver smirks. He appreciates a challenge.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           The Butcher watches Carver and the Soldiers reemerge. Carver 
           gives the slightest of looks to one Soldier then politely 
           smiles towards the Butcher. 

                                 CARVER
                        Thank you for your time.

           The Butcher relaxes, believing this ordeal to be finished. 

           But then the Soldier Carver looked to steps to him, 
           unholsters his pistol and coldly shoots the Butcher in the 
           heart.

           The bell on the door then rings as Carver walks out.

           EXT. DE WITT HOME - DAY

           Hannie and Isa harvest potatoes from the garden while Jan 
           partakes in target practice in the field.

                                 HANNIE
                        I wanted to thank you, Isa, for 
                        allowing me to stay here.

                                 ISA
                        You’re welcome, dear. But you 
                        aren’t the first in need of refuge 
                        to walk through these doors.
                             (towards Jan)
                        He’s spent many a nights in this 
                        very house for the same reason. So 
                        is life in the resistance, yes?

           So is life in the resistance.

                                 ISA (CONT’D)
                        You know he speaks about you often. 
                        He’s very fond of you.

           Hannie looks to Jan warmly. Yet, there’s still one issue--
                                 HANNIE
                        Do you know where he goes on his 
                        supply runs? Why the secrecy?

           Isa clearly does know, but knows it’s not her place to 
           discuss it. She quickly changes the subject.

                                 ISA
                        I need to get these cleaned if 
                        we’re to eat on time. Could you get 
                        some carrots?

           She heads inside with the potatoes, leaving Hannie still 
           searching for answers. The pop of Jan’s pistol echoing in the 
           distance.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Isa takes Hannie and Jan’s plates to the sink.

                                 JAN
                        You’ve done it again.

                                 ISA
                        You’d eat anything.

           Jan lights up a cigarette. Through the window he spots the 
           approaching headlights of a car traveling up the dirt path. 
           He looks towards the clock.

                                 JAN
                        Brasser’s early.

           EXT. DE WITT HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jan steps from the house and quickly realizes it’s not 
           Brasser. In a way, this is far worse for him. 

           The car comes to a stop. The door opens and a pretty young 
           woman, EMILY (29), steps out. 

                                 EMILY
                        Hello, Jan.

           Before Jan can respond, Hannie emerges. She and Emily regard 
           each other. Which is exactly what Jan was trying to avoid.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        I thought she’d be older.

                                 HANNIE
                        I’m sorry? Who are you?
                                 EMILY
                        Jesus. The least you could have 
                        done was tell her. I was his wife.

           And in an instant, Jan’s “supply runs” make perfect sense to 
           Hannie. Isa steps onto the front porch.

                                 ISA
                        Come inside, Hannie.

           Hannie does so, giving Jan a hurtful look as she passes. Once 
           she and Isa are inside--

                                 EMILY
                        She’s pretty.

                                 JAN
                        Don’t. Why are you here, Emily?

                                 EMILY
                        I came to tell you that Henry and I 
                        are moving up north to his family’s 
                        farm in Drachten. We won’t need 
                        your supplies any longer.

                                 JAN
                        You couldn’t have written a letter?

                                 EMILY
                        Trust me I wanted to. But Henry 
                        thought you deserved to hear it 
                        face to face. We’ll pay you as soon 
                        as we have the money.

                                 JAN
                        Keep it. Safe travels.

           He starts into the house--

                                 EMILY
                        You aren’t a soldier, Jan. Even if 
                        you view yourself as one.

           Jan stops. Turns back.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think you’ll 
                        accomplish? You can’t defeat the 
                        Germans. They own all of Europe.

                                 JAN
                        I know. You’d have me adapt like 
                        your precious Henry.
                                 EMILY
                        Don’t bring him into this.

                                 JAN
                        You ran to him first.

                                 EMILY
                        Because you were never there! You 
                        had these illusions that you could 
                        single-handedly win the war and be 
                        hailed a hero. It’s been four 
                        years, Jan, and the Germans are 
                        still here. What have you done? 

                                 JAN
                        I’ve done something! And that’s 
                        what you never understood. I was 
                        never okay just surviving. This is 
                        my country God damn it!

           A heavy beat. 

                                 EMILY
                        That’s where you’re wrong. It’s 
                        theirs now. We just live in it.
                             (then)
                        Goodbye, Jan.

           She gets back into her car and drives off. As Jan turns to 
           head inside, he notices Hannie in the upstairs window. She 
           heard everything.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           Hannie lies on her side. She senses Jan in the doorway. 

                                 HANNIE
                        Your wife?

                                 JAN
                        I should have told you. I’m sorry.

                                 HANNIE
                        So what am I? Just you’re own Jimmy 
                        whore to play with.

                                 JAN
                        No. Not at all.

           Jan crosses to the bed. 
                                 HANNIE
                        Tell me what happened between you 
                        and her. I think you owe me that.

                                 JAN
                        You’re right.
                             (then)
                        We got married young because we 
                        thought that’s what we were meant 
                        to do. We were happy for a time. 
                        And then the Germans came.

           He takes a moment. The memory still an open wound.

                                 JAN (CONT’D)
                        They destroyed everything. Built 
                        barracks and supply depots where 
                        schools and churches had been. Made 
                        an entire population homeless.
                             (then)
                        After that Emily and I weren’t the 
                        same. We fought every night. She 
                        didn’t want me to join the Council 
                        but I had to. So I left for Haarlem 
                        and she went to stay with her 
                        mother. I helped with supplies but 
                        we both knew our marriage was over.

           Jan’s hand finds Hannie’s.

                                 JAN (CONT'D)
                        You’re the one I want to be with.

           A beat. And Hannie pulls her hand away.

                                 HANNIE
                        You still lied to me, Jan.

           She gets up to leave.

                                 JAN
                        I fell in love with you, Hannie.

           Hannie stops. Jan crosses towards her.

                                 JAN (CONT’D)
                        You were different. I could see it 
                        in your eyes. You knew what needed 
                        to be done just like I did and you 
                        were willing to do it.

           He places his hands on her shoulders. She sinks into his 
           touch. These two love each other deeply. 
           But Hannie’s too proud to allow herself to forgive so 
           quickly. She steps from his arms.

                                 HANNIE
                        Brasser will be here soon.

           She exits, leaving Jan to lick his wounds.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Isa welcomes Brasser inside. Hannie greets him with a hug.

                                 BRASSER
                             (re: hair)
                        It suits you. 

           Hannie smiles graciously. 

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        I come bearing gifts.

           He pulls a letter from his bag, hands it to Hannie.

                                 HANNIE
                        From my father!
                             (reads from page)
                        “Your mother sends her love. She 
                        wanted me to ask you if you’ve been 
                        wearing your cardigans.” 

           Hannie’s eyes well. Reminded that letters are now her only 
           contact with her parents. Brasser and Jan give her a moment.

                                 BRASSER
                        If you wish to write a response I 
                        can take it to them.

                                 HANNIE
                        Thank you. 

                                 BRASSER
                        Shall we?

           INT. DE WITT HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The three of them sit around the table. Isa makes tea. With a 
           touch of hesitation, Brasser hands a photo of WILLEM RAGUT 
           (51) to Hannie.

                                 BRASSER
                        Captain Willem Ragut of Zaandam.
                                 JAN
                        He’s killed more resistance 
                        fighters than any other NSB.

           EXT. DUNES - DAY

           Ragut, in police uniform, stands before a group of MEN. Their 
           faces hidden by cloth hoods. Shallow graves behind each one. 
           A group of SS Officers watch from afar. 

           Ragut gives the signal and two WA Officers gun down the group 
           of Men. Their bodies crumbling into the graves. Ragut then 
           fires a shot from his own pistol into each one of the Men’s 
           bodies.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - KITCHEN - BACK IN SCENE

           Isa shudders at the thought as she places tea on the table.

                                 BRASSER
                        Two other groups have already tried 
                        to liquidate him and have failed. 
                        Their operatives were tortured for 
                        information and then executed.

           Hannie and Jan share a heavy look. Brasser’s reluctance to 
           sign off now clear.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        That’s why you need to be precise.

           EXT. VINKENSTRAAT - ZAANDAM - DAY

           Ragut’s WIFE hands him his lunch. He’s then met by two WA 
           Officers. His escorts. They ride off on their bicycles.

                                 BRASSER (V.O.)
                        You must learn all you can...

           Hannie watches from across the street. Concealed within her 
           newspaper is a note pad. She jots down Ragut’s movement.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Ragut prays alongside fellow NSB. 

                                 BRASSER (V.O.)
                        His comings and goings...

           Jan documents the action from a pew in the back.
           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Ragut chums it up over drinks with another NSB OFFICIAL. 
           Hannie and Jan observe from a table across the room.

                                 BRASSER (V.O.)
                        His habits and tendencies...

           The pair spot two pistols holstered on Ragut’s person. A 
           weighted look passes between them.

           EXT. ZANDAAM POLICE STATION - EVENING

           Ragut converses with two SS Officers.

                                 BRASSER (V.O.)
                        Who his friends are...

           Jan rides by on his bike and clocks the interaction.

           EXT. BOTENMAKERSSTRAAT - ZAANDAM - DAY

           A popular street for PEDESTRIANS. Ragut rides alone. The only 
           time he has been. Hannie tails.

                                 BRASSER (V.O.)
                        And what secrets he has...

           Ragut stops outside a home and is met by his YOUNG MISTRESS. 
           He crudely grabs her backside as they disappear inside.

                                 BRASSER (V.O.)
                        You never know what could be used 
                        to your advantage.

           Hannie’s attention is then drawn to a squad of German bomber 
           planes passing directly over the Mistress’ home. 

           INT. DE WITT HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Surveillance notes strewn across the room. Maps marked with 
           locations and times. Routes highlighted. Hannie and Jan pour 
           over it all.

                                 JAN
                        He’s a cautious son of a bitch I’ll 
                        give him that.

           Hannie remains focused. Jan rubs the fatigue from his eyes. 
                                 JAN (CONT’D)
                        I need coffee. 

           He exits. Hannie looks to the map. Scans a page of notes. 
           Compares it with another. Back to the map. Nothing seems to 
           fit. She sits on the edge of the bed, pondering. 

           Her mind sifts through the mountains of information in front 
           of her. This street. That location. This time. Her brain 
           working at full capacity, connecting the dots. Then--

                                 HANNIE
                        The bombers...

           She quickly searches pages of notes until she finds the one 
           she’s looking for. She scans the information and checks it 
           with the map. The same with another page. Then a third. A 
           fourth. Her eyes go wide. She’s discovered something.

           Jan then enters with two cups of coffee.

                                 JAN
                             (off Hannie)
                        What?

           INT. DE WITT HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hannie paces with excitement. Jan looks through the notes. 
           He’s yet to see what she does. 

                                 HANNIE
                        He ends up on Botenmakersstraat to 
                        see his mistress every Wednesday at 
                        the same time. It’s the only time 
                        he’s without escorts.

                                 JAN
                        Because Botenmakersstraat’s always 
                        flooded with witnesses. And he 
                        knows that. We wouldn’t get ten 
                        feet after we pulled the trigger. 

                                 HANNIE
                        You’re right. But what if no one 
                        ever knew we fired?

                                 JAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 HANNIE
                        The bombers, Jan. There’s flights 
                        every Wednesday at the same time 
                        Ragut’s there. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANNIE (CONT'D)
                        And their flight path takes them 
                        directly over Botenmakersstraat. 

           A beat. And Jan finally catches on--

                                 JAN
                        They’ll drowned out our shots.

                                 HANNIE
                        They’ll drowned out our shots! 

           Jan kisses Hannie hard on the lips. They lock eyes. Jan leans 
           in for another kiss... but Hannie turns away. Not ready to 
           forgive just yet.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        We need to make sure this succeeds. 

           Jan masks his disappointment and nods in agreement. 

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll shoot first. And then you 
                        finish it.

           Jan looks to the map and points to a location.

                                 JAN
                        Ride straight here and wait for me. 
                             (then)
                        Now let’s go kill the bastard.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

           Superimpose: June 21, 1944.

           Hannie prepares for liquidation. Cyanide capsule tucked 
           inside her bra. Blouse adjusted. Knee length A-line skirt 
           pulled to her waist, then buttoned and zipped. Feet slipped 
           into ankle high socks, then flat shoes. Laces tied. Black 
           hair pinned back. Fake glasses positioned. As her arm slides 
           through the sleeve of her cardigan, she stops. Suddenly 
           reminded of something--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - JOHANNA’S ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Aafje dresses Hannie (7) in a cardigan. Hannie fights it. 

                                 YOUNG HANNIE
                        Mama. Why do I have to wear this? 
                        It’s warm outside.
                                 AAFJE
                        It’s so you never catch a cold.

                                 YOUNG HANNIE
                        Like Annie?

           Aafje collects her thoughts. Annie’s death still fresh. She 
           looks Hannie in the eyes. Caring. Loving.

                                 AAFJE
                        As long as you wear this, nothing 
                        will ever be able to hurt you. 

           Hannie considers this. Accepts. Aafje kisses her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DE WITT HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - BACK IN SCENE

           Hannie pulls the cardigan on and considers herself in the 
           mirror. She’s certainly come a long way. She loads her pistol 
           and slides it into her cardigan pocket. She’s ready.

           EXT. VINKENSTRAAT - ZAANDAM - LATER

           A bright summer day. RESIDENTS go about their business. A 
           cafe bustles with PATRONS. CHILDREN play. Hannie stands by 
           her bike. Jan awaits a block away. Inconspicuous. Then--

           Ragut exits the front door of his home. He says goodbye to 
           his unsuspecting Wife and peddles off.

           Hannie follows. A beat-- 

           And Jan follows suit.

           WITH RAGUT

           A leisurely pace. He turns left onto Zeemansstraat--

           WITH HANNIE

           Keeping her distance. She follows onto Zeemansstraat--

           WITH JAN

           Fifty yards behind Hannie. He glances to the sky for the 
           bombers. No sign of them. He turns onto Zeemansstraat--

           WITH RAGUT

           Unaware of what’s lurking. Mind on his upcoming rendezvous. 
           He comes to a busy intersection. Maneuvers around a delivery 
           truck, then banks another left onto Stationsstraat--

           WITH HANNIE

           Peddles around the activity. Follows onto Stationsstraat--

           WITH JAN

           Approaches the truck. The DELIVERY MEN lose their grip on 
           their crate. Fruits and vegetables spill onto the road, 
           blocking Jan’s path. Then--

           The faint roar of the bombers approaching in the distance--

           WITH HANNIE

           Hears them too. She tosses a look back to Jan. Notices he’s 
           caught up. 

           He emphatically motions for her to push ahead. She picks up 
           her pace-- 

           WITH JAN

           Finally manages to get around the debris. Now further back 
           than he’d like to be. The bombers closing fast--

           WITH RAGUT

           Continuing on Stationsstraat. Over his shoulder, Hannie 
           closes in--

           The bombers come into view. The roar growing louder. Ragut 
           hangs a right onto Herenstraat--

           WITH HANNIE

           Closing the distance. She turns onto Herenstraat. The bombers 
           approaching. RESIDENTS look to the skies in anticipation--

           WITH RAGUT

           Turning right onto busy Botenmakersstraat--

           WITH HANNIE

           Peddling with a purpose. Turns onto Botenmakersstraat. She 
           pulls her pistol from her cardigan.

           The bombers directly overhead. Their roar resounding. 
           CHILDREN cover their ears.

           Hannie pulls along side an unsuspecting Ragut and fires!
           It’s muted by the bombers but effective. Ragut slumps to his 
           right and drifts into a wall. 

           Hannie speeds off. 

           No one notices the fallen Ragut. Their attention on the 
           bombers above--

           WITH JAN

           Just now turning onto Botenmakersstraat. He sees Ragut lying 
           against the wall and picks up his pace. The cover sound from 
           the bombers fading. RESIDENTS begin to look away.

           Jan nears Ragut’s fallen body. Aims his pistol--

           JUST AS RAGUT TURNS WITH HIS OWN PISTOL!

           They both fire! Ragut is hit again. Dies instantly.

           BUT HIS SHOT HITS JAN IN THE STOMACH!

           Jan tries desperately to maintain control but can’t. He slams 
           into a mailbox with a sickening thud. He’s thrown from his 
           bike and into a flower bed.

           RESIDENTS hear the shots. Unsure if they came from the 
           bombers. Panic ensues-- 

           WITH HANNIE

           Peddling like the wind. Unaware of the events unfolding 
           behind her--

           WITH JAN

           Struggling for air. Stomach bleeding profusely. He stumbles 
           through a small gate and staggers towards the back entrance 
           of a home-- 

           INT. HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           An ELDERLY COUPLE enjoy lunch. Suddenly--

           Jan’s blood soaked body crashes through the door! The Elderly 
           Woman shrieks! 

           Jan collapses, his pistol skidding across the floor. His 
           cyanide capsule falling from his pocket. 

           As the Elderly Man rushes to Jan’s aide, he unknowingly kicks 
           the capsule under the refrigerator. 
           EXT. VALKSTRAAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bordering a canal. Hannie comes to a stop. Breathing hard. 
           Drenched in sweat. She looks to the direction she just came, 
           anticipating Jan’s arrival at any moment...

           INT. HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jan’s breathing is labored. The Elderly Man attempts to 
           control the bleeding but has little success.  

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        He needs help! Get the police!

           His Wife hurries out--

           EXT. HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Residents now swarm Ragut’s lifeless body. Did you see 
           anything? Did you? The Elderly Woman notices a POLICEMAN.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Officer!

           The Policeman senses her urgency. He follows.

           INT. HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jan reaches towards the capsule. Unaware of Jan’s intention, 
           the Elderly Man holds his arm down.

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        Don’t strain yourself. 

           The Elderly Woman enters with the Policeman in tow. He’s 
           shocked by the sight of Jan’s bleeding body.

                                 ELDERLY MAN (CONT’D)
                        He needs medical attention right 
                        away.

           The Policeman spots the pistol and puts the pieces together. 
           Jan grabs the Elderly Man’s shirt with his blood covered 
           hand. He tries to speak, but the words don’t come.

                                 ELDERLY MAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to get you help, son.

           Jan does not want to be taken in, but there’s nothing he can 
           do to prevent it. He looks helplessly at the capsule.
           EXT. VALKSTRAAT - LATER

           Hannie waits... and waits... and waits. The loneliness is 
           unsettling, but the dread of not knowing Jan’s fate is worse. 

           She knows she can’t wait forever. It wasn’t the plan. She 
           finally peddles off against everything telling her to stay.

           EXT. DE WITT HOME - LATER

           The sun sets, drenching the sky in a brilliant shade of pink. 
           Isa waters her garden. Then--

                                 HANNIE (O.S.)
                        ISA!

           Isa spots Hannie peddling hard up the dirt road. Dust 
           sticking to her sweat covered face. Isa instantly knows. 
           Something went wrong. 

           She drops her watering pot and races to meet Hannie. Hannie 
           jumps off her bike. It careens unmanned into the house. 

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Has Jan arrived? JAN?!

           She races around the house. Into the field. Frantic. Eyes 
           darting in every direction in hopes Jan will appear.

                                 ISA
                        He’s not here, Hannie. What 
                        happened?

                                 HANNIE
                        I don’t know! I fired and rode off. 
                        I waited for him by the canal but 
                        he never showed.

           Concern fills Isa. Jan wouldn’t deviate from a plan.

                                 ISA
                        I’ll phone Brasser. 

                                 HANNIE
                        I’m going back for him. 

           Isa grabs her arm.

                                 ISA
                        You can’t.

                                 HANNIE
                        Let go of me!
           Hannie rips her arm free. She boards her bike. Isa steps in 
           front and grabs the handlebars. She’s strong for her age.

                                 ISA
                        Listen to me! I know you’re upset. 
                        But you can’t go back, Hannie.

           Hannie knows this to be true, even if she doesn’t want it to 
           be. She reluctantly drops her hands from the handlebars.

           INT. ZAANDAM POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - LATER

           Flanked by two SS Soldiers, Carver strides purposefully 
           towards a DOCTOR.

                                 CARVER
                        Where is Bonekamp? Is he conscious?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes. However, his injuries are too 
                        severe to be treated here. He needs 
                        a hospital.

                                 CARVER
                        Done. Thank you, doctor.

           The Doctor knows better than to linger. He walks off. Carver 
           steps into the doorway of a room. Inside, Jan lies in bed. A 
           NURSE dabbing his forehead with a wash cloth. 

           A pleased look comes over Carver. He knows the importance Jan 
           has in his quest for the woman with red hair.

           Down the hallway, a DUTCH POLICEMAN observes this all with 
           great concern.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Amidst an anxiety filled silence, Hannie waits with Truus, 
           Freddie and Isa. A long beat. Then--

           The room’s illuminated by the headlights of an approaching 
           car. Hannie darts for the front door--

           EXT. DE WITT HOME - CONTINUOUS

           As Brasser exits the car Hannie’s there to meet him.

                                 HANNIE
                        Where is he?
           Truus, Freddie and Isa emerge from the house.

                                 BRASSER
                        He was taken to Amsterdam.

                                 HANNIE
                        He’s alive?

                                 BRASSER
                        Yes...

           Tears of relief. Hannie quickly gathers herself. There’s work 
           to be done.

                                 HANNIE
                        We must go to Amsterdam at once.

                                 BRASSER
                        We can’t, Hannie. 

                                 HANNIE
                        Why not?

                                 BRASSER
                        He was shot. The SD have him.

           All oxygen leaves Hannie’s body. Isa, Truus and Freddie hear 
           the devastating news. 

           Hannie drifts away. Dazed. She leans against Brasser’s car 
           for support, trying to comprehend what she just heard. She’s 
           unable to accept it. 

                                 HANNIE
                        You’re wrong. He’s hiding 
                        somewhere. Waiting for us to come 
                        and get him and we’re wasting time.

                                 BRASSER
                        No he’s not.

                                 HANNIE
                        How can you be certain? Did you see 
                        the SD take him with your own eyes?

                                 BRASSER
                        I was told by our contact in the 
                        Dutch police.

           Hannie absorbs this. Another blow. 

                                 HANNIE
                             (determined)
                        Then we must go back for him.
           Her nonacceptance is difficult to take. Hannie clocks the 
           somber looks of those around her.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        We can rescue him, can’t we?
                             (through tears)
                        Tell me we can bring him back.

           Her sobbing grows more intense. As if she herself is finally 
           realizing the reality of the situation.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        TELL ME!

           But Brasser can’t tell her that. Because it’s not true.

                                 BRASSER
                        He’s gone, Hannie.

           Hannie breaks completely. She drops to her knees, sobbing 
           uncontrollably. Truus and Freddie rush to her side but 
           Hannie’s beyond consoling. Her world has been shattered.

           EXT. WILHELMINA HOSPITAL - LATER

           SS and WA GUARDS stand watch. Security on high alert.

           INT. WILHELMINA HOSPITAL - ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jan lies in bed. His chest rising up and down slowly. 
           Labored. Carver sits in the corner, reveling in this 
           serendipitous turn of events. 

                                 CARVER
                        Are you a philosophical man, Mr. 
                        Bonekamp? I am. I often find myself 
                        pondering my own existence. How my 
                        life could have been altered by one 
                        decision or moment that happened or 
                        did not. Like this moment here. If 
                        it were not for the war, I would 
                        not be in this chair nor you that 
                        bed. Neither of us would have ever 
                        known the other existed. And in 
                        that scenario, the absence of war 
                        would have been very beneficial to 
                        you and your future.

           He walks closer to the bed.
                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        But the absence of war would have 
                        also prevented you from ever 
                        crossing paths with the woman with 
                        red hair. Someone who I can tell 
                        you care very much for. Perhaps 
                        even love.

           Jan blinks away a tear. Carver leans even closer.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        So the question I pose to you is 
                        this, Mr. Bonekamp. Which existence 
                        would you choose? No war? And save 
                        thousands of lives but deny 
                        yourself love. Or would you choose 
                        war and your woman with red hair? 
                        Knowing all the death and 
                        destruction it brings.

           A tense stare down. Despite Jan’s current state, his face 
           fills with defiance. Carver’s eyes glisten maniacally. 

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        I’d choose war too.

           INT. WILHELMINA HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Carver approaches a DOCTOR.

                                 CARVER
                        Jan Bonekamp is to be transferred 
                        to prison immediately.

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s not possible.

           Carver’s taken aback by the perceived insubordination. He’s 
           shot men for less. The Doctor clears his throat. Readjusts.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        There is massive internal bleeding. 
                        He will die within hours. 

           Off Carver, processing this undesirable news--

           INT. WILHELMINA HOSPITAL - ROOM - LATER

           The door to the room slowly opens, bathing Jan with light 
           from the hallway. He sees a NURSE quietly entering. She locks 
           the door behind her and crosses to the bed.
                                 NURSE
                        Jan Bonekamp?

           Jan nods. The Nurse speaks in hushed tones.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        My name is Laura Peters. I’m a 
                        supporter of the resistance.

           A smattering of voices in the hallway. Laura throws a look 
           towards the door and waits until the voices fade.

                                 LAURA
                        We don’t have much time. Are there 
                        any loved ones you wish for me to 
                        contact for you? So you could relay 
                        a proper goodbye.

           Laura senses Jan’s skepticism. She takes his hand and smiles 
           warmly. There’s sincerity behind her eyes.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        You can trust me. 

           Jan takes a moment before confidingly nodding his head. Laura 
           leans in. Jan then whispers in her ear. We don’t hear all of 
           what’s said but what we do hear is: Hannie Schaft. 

           When he’s finished, Jan leans his head back. A look of relief 
           on his face. Laura holds her look for a beat, her face 
           suddenly not as warm or approachable. Then--

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           Jan furrows his brow and a sickening realization settles over 
           him. He angrily reaches for Laura but she easily side steps 
           his grasp. She then pulls a syringe from her pocket and 
           crosses towards Jan’s IV hook up. 

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        This will stop your heart.

           Jan’s breathing increases as he helplessly watches Laura 
           inject the poison into his IV. 

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Schaft will suffer the same 
                        thanks to your cooperation.
                             (then)
                        Heil Hitler.

           She exits, leaving Jan to die knowing he just named Hannie...
           INT. SCHAFT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           All traces of Hannie have been removed. Aafje pours tea for 
           herself and Pieter. A knock at the door. Aafje opens it to--

                                 CARVER
                        Good afternoon, Mrs. Schaft.

           INT. SCHAFT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Pieter and Aafje sit side by side, hands clenched tightly 
           together. Overwhelmed with fear of the situation. Carver sips 
           a cup of tea. Observes the room like a welcomed guest.

                                 CARVER
                        You have a lovely home.

           His pleasantries only add to the tension. A Soldier enters.

                                 SS SOLDIER 
                        Clear, Obersturmbannführer.

           Carver nods. The Soldier salutes then exits. Carver helps 
           himself to more tea. The Schafts are on his time. Not the 
           other way around.

                                 CARVER
                        When I received the orders tasking 
                        me with finding your daughter, I 
                        thought my career was over. I 
                        thought I had disappointed the 
                        Führer somehow so as punishment he 
                        banished me to the Netherlands in 
                        search of a rumor. A fairy tale. 
                        But then I arrived in your 
                        beautiful country and not only did 
                        I discover that the woman with red 
                        hair was real, but so were the 
                        unspeakable acts of terrorism of 
                        which she was accused. And I was 
                        then hit by this overwhelming sense 
                        of pride. The Führer was not 
                        banishing me. He was not punishing 
                        me. He had chosen me.

           Carver unholsters his pistol and places it on the table.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        I knew then that I had to do 
                        whatever it took to find your 
                        daughter. 

           His officer’s dagger is next.
                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        And reward the Führer’s trust that 
                        he had so graciously placed upon 
                        me.

           Pieter shifts his body in front of Aafje. Carver lets the 
           moment hang there. His weapons laying inches from the 
           frightened couple. The message is clear: I could kill you at 
           any moment I wish.

                                 PIETER
                        We don’t know where--

           Carver pounds his fist onto the table. Tea spills onto the 
           floor. The unexpected outburst startles Aafje. Carver 
           unclenches his fist. Readjusts his uniform. 

                                 CARVER
                        She is a fugitive of the Third 
                        Reich. Wanted for the murder of two 
                        loyal men.

                                 PIETER
                        Loyal to a dictator. 

           Carver smirks. The Schafts refusal to cooperate is clear. But 
           killing them would only incite Hannie. He’s got other plans. 

                                 CARVER
                        Very well, Mr. Schaft. We shall see 
                        if your daughter’s loyalty for you 
                        is as strong as yours is for her.

           As he holsters his weapons, two Soldiers emerge. They 
           handcuff Pieter and Aafje and force them from the home. 

           EXT. SCHAFT HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Pieter and Aafje are led into the back of a truck.

                                 CARVER
                        Burn it.

           Two Soldiers light torches and throw them through the window. 
           From the back of the truck, Pieter and Aafje watch helplessly 
           as the flames engulf their beloved home.

           INT. DE WITT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Hannie stares out the window. A blank look on her face. 
           Truus, Freddie, Isa and Brasser fill the room with her.
                                 BRASSER
                        They were taken to the camp in 
                        Westerbork.

           Hannie remains still. Her attention on a flock of birds 
           outside.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        Hannie?

           Her attention remains on the birds. They continually shift 
           directions in unison. It’s beautiful to watch. Finally--

                                 HANNIE
                        Take me to Westerbork.

           The others exchange looks.

                                 BRASSER
                        That’s not an option.

                                 HANNIE
                        Excuse me? Do not presume to tell 
                        me what is or isn’t an option when 
                        regarding my family.

                                 BRASSER
                        You can’t--

                                 HANNIE
                        They are my parents! It’s my fault 
                        that they were taken. It’s not them 
                        who the Jimmies want. It’s me.

                                 BRASSER
                        And that’s exactly the point. It’s 
                        a trap. Your surrender won’t save 
                        them. If you walk up to the gates 
                        of Westerbork you will die along 
                        with your parents.

                                 HANNIE
                        It’s better they die with me than 
                        alone for something I did.

                                 BRASSER
                        They won’t die. 

                                 HANNIE
                        And how are you so certain?

                                 BRASSER
                        If the SD wanted them dead they’d 
                        already be dead.

                                 BRASSER (CONT'D)
                        But they have to keep them alive 
                        because they know it’s the only way 
                        to get to you. 

                                 HANNIE
                        So what would you have me do, Jan? 
                        Allow my parents to rot in a 
                        concentration camp? What if it were 
                        your parents? Would your reasoning 
                        be the same then?

                                 TRUUS
                        Hannie.

           Truus’ harsh tone immediately has Hannie’s attention. 

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        I know this is hard, but Jan is 
                        right. And you know he is.

                                 FREDDIE
                        You can’t go, Hannie. 

           Hearing it from these two strikes a nerve. Hannie softens.

                                 HANNIE
                        I’m sorry. I...

           She fades off. Her mind a mess of emotions.

                                 ISA
                        Come help me put on some tea, dear.

           Isa guides the fragile Hannie from the room. Brasser waits 
           until she’s out of earshot. 

                                 BRASSER
                        If Jan gave up Hannie’s name, 
                        there’s no telling what else the SD 
                        may know.

           A frightening uncertainty.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        Keep communications to a minimum. 
                        Work from our homes until we can 
                        centralize somewhere safe.

                                 TRUUS
                        What about Hannie? 

           Brasser looks sadly towards Hannie.
                                 BRASSER
                        I’ve made arrangements for her.

           EXT. MULDER HOME - LATER

           Superimpose: Amsterdam.

           Subtle. Quiet. MRS. MULDER (60) helps Hannie inside. Brasser 
           shakes the hand of MR. MULDER (65).

                                 MR. MULDER
                        We’ll take care of her as if she 
                        were our own. 

                                 FREDDIE
                             (in French/subtitled)
                        We love you, Hannie.

           Hannie doesn’t respond as she disappears inside the Mulder’s 
           home. A cloud of concern settles over Brasser, Truus and 
           Freddie. Unsure of what’s to become of their friend.

           INT. MULDER HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

           Hannie’s sound asleep when she’s suddenly awoken by-- 

           The sound of bombers. She races to the window but soon 
           realizes the sounds come from the hallway. 

           Confused, she slowly makes her way towards the door. She 
           turns the knob and is suddenly standing in the middle of--

           EXT. BOTENMAKERSSTRAAT

           She sees Ragut lying on the ground ahead of her. A beat. 

           And Jan zips by on his bike.

                                 HANNIE
                        No...

           She takes off running. Jan and Ragut both fire. Jan falls 
           from his bike. Hannie reaches him and presses hard onto his 
           wound. Blood quickly covers her arms and nightgown. Tears 
           cascade down her face.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           Life escapes Jan’s eyes. Hannie looks down the street.
                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        SOMEONE HELP!

           When she looks back, the body in her arms changes into 
           Sarah... then Pieter... then Aafje... and finally Annie--

                                 ANNIE
                        You killed them, Jo. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MULDER HOME - BEDROOM - BACK IN SCENE

           Hannie awakes in a panic. Drenched in sweat. Mr. and Mrs. 
           Mulder come into the room.

                                 MRS. MULDER
                        Hannie? What’s wrong?

                                 HANNIE
                        I have to save them all!

           She springs from the bed and races towards the door. Mr. 
           Mulder grabs her by the waist.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        LET ME GO!

           Hannie struggles to get free. Arms swinging. Feet kicking.

                                 MR. MULDER
                        Get the sedative.

           Mrs. Mulder hurries from the room. Hannie strains to break 
           free from Mr. Mulder’s grip.

                                 HANNIE
                        THEY NEED MY HELP!

                                 MR. MULDER
                        They’re already gone, Hannie!

           Mrs. Mulder returns with the sedatives. Hannie continues to 
           struggle. Mr. Mulder manages to hold her head steady while 
           Mrs. Mulder pries her mouth open and inserts a sedative. She 
           then cups her hand over Hannie’s mouth.

                                 MRS. MULDER
                        Swallow. 

           Hannie continues to fight. Face red with expended energy. 
           Cheeks shining with tears. With her free hand, Mrs. Mulder 
           calmly strokes Hannie’s hair and begins singing a lullaby.
                                 MRS. MULDER (CONT’D)
                        Sleep, baby sleep/Outside there 
                        walks a sheep/A sheep with white 
                        feet/Who drinks his milk so 
                        sweet/Sleep, baby sleep...

           Slowly, Hannie’s struggling ceases. Mrs. Mulder removes her 
           hand from Hannie’s mouth. Hannie drops her head into Mr. 
           Mulder’s chest and dissolves into heavy sobbing.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. MULDER HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Truus and Freddie, faces wrought with concern, sit with the 
           Mulders. 

                                 MRS. MULDER
                        She doesn’t talk much. She won’t 
                        eat. She has nightmares nearly 
                        every night.

                                 MR. MULDER
                        It might do her good to see some 
                        familiar faces. 

           INT. MULDER HOME - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Truus and Freddie enter. Truus carries a tray of food, 
           Freddie a bag. Hannie lies in the fetal position on the bed. 
           Her red roots growing in. Cheek bones sunken from weight 
           loss. Dark circles under her eyes from insufficient sleep. A 
           permanent state of depression.

                                 TRUUS
                        Hannie? It’s Truus and Freddie.

           Silence. Truus sits on the bed with the tray of food.

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Mulder said you weren’t 
                        eating. You need to try. It’ll make 
                        you feel better.

           She extends a spoonful of soup towards Hannie but it goes 
           unclaimed. At a loss, Truus sets the tray down and changes 
           the subject.

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        The Jimmies surrendered Marseilles. 
                        Brasser thinks the war might end in 
                        the coming months.
           Ignored again. Freddie then tries to lighten the mood.

                                 FREDDIE
                        Look at this hair! How about we re-
                        dye it for you?

           Freddie pulls a pack of dye from the bag. Hannie remains 
           motionless. Freddie’s enthusiastic smile fades. She places 
           the dye on the night stand. 

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        We brought some of your things from 
                        Isa’s house.

           She places the bag next to the dye. Seeing Hannie like this 
           gets to the tough nosed Truus. She swallows her tears. 

                                 TRUUS
                        Okay, Hannie. We don’t have to talk 
                        if you don’t want to.

           She takes Hannie’s hand and the three sit in total silence. 

           INT. MULDER HOME - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Hannie peers out the window and spots the Mulders mulling 
           about their garden. She’s alone. What she’s been waiting for. 

           She locks the bedroom door then hurries to her night stand. 
           She drops to her knees and rummages through the drawer, 
           causing the bag Truus and Freddie left for her to tip over. 
           Its contents sliding onto the night stand. 

           But Hannie doesn’t notice. Her attention instead on her 
           cyanide capsule. 

           Her breathing quickens as she eyes the capsule in her hand. 
           Then-- 

           She inserts it into her mouth. Tears flow as she tries to 
           convince herself she can bite down and finish the job. Bring 
           release from this pain and anguish. 

           And it seems that she will...

           Until she notices the photo of her and Sarah on the night 
           stand, having slid out of the bag. 

           Seeing Sarah’s warm smile once again gets to Hannie. She 
           weeps and--

           Spits the capsule onto the floor. She falls back against the 
           bed, emotionally and physically wrecked.
           INT. MULDER HOME - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hannie lies in bed, photo of her and Sarah in her arms. 
           Remembering better days. As her attention falls on the Gemma 
           banner in the photo--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        From small things we aspire towards 
                        the great.

           Hannie looks up, but the room is empty. She looks back to the 
           photo. She can’t give up. She must continue on for Sarah. Her 
           eyes then land on the hair dye. And her resolve returns-- 

           INT. MULDER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mr. Mulder reads a book while Mrs. Mulder prepares supper. A 
           noise catches their attention. In the doorway they see--

           Hannie. Cardigan and glasses on. Hair freshly dyed jet black.

                                 HANNIE
                        May I join you?

           Mrs. Mulder smiles. Mr. Mulder pulls out a chair.

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Moderately busy. What’s evident right away is the absence of 
           any SS or NSB. This is a friendly establishment. 

           Hannie (24) scans the faces around her and finds Truus and 
           Freddie sitting at a corner table. They spot Hannie and the 
           trio exchange smiles from across the room.

           INT. CAFE - CELLAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The new headquarters of the Council of Resistance. Much 
           smaller in scale, but still a flurry of activity. Members 
           welcome back Hannie with exuberance. Niels then steps 
           forward. The former adversaries face off for a beat. Then-- 

                                 NIELS
                        Welcome back.

           His face says, “I was wrong about you.” 

                                 HANNIE
                        Thank you, Niels.

           She then spots Brasser waiting for her across the room. 
           INT. CAFE - CELLAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Hannie and Brasser sit at a table pushed into the corner. The 
           de facto meeting room. Brasser slides an ID card towards her.

                                 BRASSER
                        A gift from Klaus.

           CLOSE ON card: Hannie’s photo (black hair and glasses) above 
           the name: Johanna Elderkamp. Birthplace: Geneva, Switzerland.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        He wanted me to tell you that he’s 
                        not charging you.

           Hannie laughs to herself. Still the same old Klaus.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        Hannie. I wanted to apologize. 
                             (then)
                        If I never okay’d the Ragut hit... 
                        Jan might still...

                                 HANNIE
                        Don’t do that. Ragut needed to go. 
                        What happened isn’t your fault.

           She takes Brasser’s hand with compassion. The forgiveness he 
           needed. He readjusts. There’s business to attend to.

                                 BRASSER
                        A lot’s happened since you’ve been 
                        away. Prince Bernhard called for 
                        all underground groups to unite.

                                 HANNIE
                        Ambitious. And it’s worked?

                                 BRASSER
                        There were some leadership issues, 
                        but it’s come together lately.

           Brasser unfolds a map and points to a location.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        A group just north of Haarlem. 
                        Truus and Freddie have been 
                        assisting them with supply runs. 

           Hannie’s eyes shift to Truus and Freddie. Proud.

                                 HANNIE
                        I’ll do it.
           Brasser smiles. As if that were ever in doubt. He crosses to 
           a small safe and removes a bundle wrapped in cloth.

                                 BRASSER
                        That belongs with you. 

           A beat. Hannie removes the cloth, revealing her pistol. She 
           runs her hands over the barrel. Feels the steel against her 
           skin once again. She’s now whole.

           INT. CAFE - WOMEN’S WASHROOM - LATER

           Hannie, Truus and Freddie ready themselves for their run. 
           Hannie stops and looks to their reflection in the mirror. 
           Being with these two is home to her. She smiles and links her 
           arms with theirs. Sisters reunited.

           INT. FLOWER SHOP - LATER

           Varied arrangements decorate the shop. The girls are led 
           through them by MAARTEN KLINE(40). 

                                 MAARTEN
                        The sisters have told me much about 
                        you, Hannie. Allow me to extend my 
                        gratitude for your help in 
                        continuing our cause here.

                                 HANNIE
                        No need.

           Hannie takes in the details of this man. Slicked back hair. 
           Gold pinky ring. Gold watch. Pressed suit. Not the customary 
           underground resistance fighter’s uniform.

           INT. FLOWER SHOP - CELLAR - MOMENTS LATER

           No printing presses. No forging equipment. Only a handful of 
           MEN packaging parcels for delivery. Hannie finds this odd, 
           but Truus and Freddie don’t seem to mind or notice. Maarten 
           walks the girls over to a pair of strollers. 

                                 MAARTEN
                        They’ve been loaded. These parcels 
                        are very important. A timely 
                        delivery on your part will result 
                        in a handsome compensation.

                                 HANNIE
                        Compensation?
                                 MAARTEN
                        For a job well done of course.
                             (off Hannie)
                        Do you have a problem with our 
                        practices, Ms. Schaft?

           Hannie holds her look on Maarten. Something seems off. Truus 
           then takes Hannie by the arm.

                                 TRUUS
                        No problem.

           She leads Hannie to the strollers. Then, quietly--

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        This is how it is now.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREET - LATER

           A clear, cool night. The girls push their strollers along in 
           silence, until Hannie can no longer hold it in--

                                 HANNIE
                        Do you know what we’re delivering?

           Truus and Freddie share a look. They don’t. A beat. Then--

           Hannie pops open the hidden compartment in her stroller and 
           removes the package. Stunned at what’s inside. Gold jewelry.

           Truus and Freddie open their package. Tobacco. 

           Off Hannie, enraged--

           INT. FLOWER SHOP - CELLAR - OFFICE - LATER

           Focused on counting his money, Maarten never sees the girls 
           enter. They dump the jewelry and tobacco onto his desk. It 
           spills onto the floor and into his lap. Now he sees them.

                                 HANNIE
                        Dutch are being betrayed. Jews 
                        slaughtered. And you’re profiting. 

           Maarten clocks the girl’s pistols. He raises his hands.

                                 MAARTEN
                        I’m a businessman. 

                                 HANNIE
                        You’re a leech.
                                 MAARTEN
                        Don’t be so naive, Ms. Schaft. 
                        War’s the greatest job market on 
                        Earth.

           His eyes shift to his own pistol in his desk drawer. Hannie 
           notices and in a flash, has her pistol trained on Maarten. 
           Truus and Freddie follow suit.

                                 HANNIE
                        I’ve killed men more dangerous than 
                        you could ever dream of being, Mr. 
                        Kline. You do not want to test me.

           Hannie steps forward with a menace we’ve not seen before.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Your “business” ends effective 
                        immediately. Understood?

           Her subtext is clear: We’ll kill you if you don’t stop. 
           Petrified, Maarten can only manage a weak nod. The girls walk 
           out. The sister’s lips slowly turning up into a smile.

           INT. CAFE - CELLAR - DAY

           Hannie sits across from a distraught Brasser.

                                 BRASSER
                        I thought he was an honest man.

                                 HANNIE
                        Maybe once upon a time he was.

                                 BRASSER
                        This God damn war. I just want it 
                        to end so life can go back to 
                        normal. Or what’s left of normal.

                                 HANNIE
                        We all want that. But until that 
                        time comes we have work to do...

           Brasser immediately knows what she’s getting at. 

                                 BRASSER
                        You’re sure?

                                 HANNIE
                        Jan never stopped. Why should I?
           Brasser knows her mind’s made up. He removes a folder from 
           the safe and slides it to her. She removes a photo of WILLEM 
           ZIRKZEE, the man from our opening scene. 

                                 BRASSER
                        Willem Zirkzee. Dutch police.

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Zirkzee watches an SS OFFICER peel bills from a wad of cash.  

                                 BRASSER (V.O.)
                        He’s paid fifty guilders for each 
                        Jew he leads the SS to.

           The Officer then slides the bills to Zirkzee.

           INT. HOME - ATTIC - NIGHT

           A JEWISH FAMILY in hiding. Frightened faces. Suddenly, the 
           door’s kicked in and a squad of SS Soldiers barge in. The 
           family’s dragged away.

           INT. CAFE - CELLAR - BACK IN SCENE

                                 HANNIE
                        It’ll be done. 

           She starts off.

                                 BRASSER
                        Truus can accompany you.
                             (off Hannie)
                        She’s proved herself more than 
                        capable since you’ve been away. 

           Hannie processes this. She looks to Truus, cleaning her own 
           pistol across the room. 

           INT. CAFE - WOMEN’S WASHROOM - LATER

           Truus and Hannie prepare. Hannie applies makeup. Styles her 
           hair. Truus on the other hand dons an overcoat. Her hair in a 
           bun, covered by a hat.

                                 HANNIE
                        How many?

           Truus continues perfecting her outfit for a moment.
                                 TRUUS
                        One more than I ever thought I’d 
                        kill. 

           Hannie knows the feeling. She takes Truus’ hand.

                                 HANNIE
                        I wanted to thank you. For 
                        everything. 

                                 TRUUS
                        It’s what sisters do.

           They exchange smiles. A beat.

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        What’d you say to me in French on 
                        our first mission together?

                                 HANNIE
                        That I could insult you and you 
                        wouldn’t know it. And then I called 
                        you a skank to prove my point.

           Truus processes this. 

                                 TRUUS
                        I guess I was cold to you.
                             (then/in French/subtitled)
                        But I’m not a skank.

           Hannie’s eyes go wide. Her grin from ear to ear.

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        Freddie’s taught me some. Shut up.

                                 HANNIE
                        It’s very good!

           Truus shies away from the compliment. She’s still tough and 
           academics are still dumb after all. 

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                             (re: hat)
                        You’re very convincing by the way.

           Truus playfully hits Hannie in the arm. They laugh. A rare 
           moment of lightheartedness in an otherwise dark world. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Truus stands inconspicuously on the corner, her eyes fixated 
           on an office building.
           The door opens and Zirkzee emerges. He shakes hands with an 
           SS OFFICER and starts off in Truus’ direction. 

           Truus turns towards Hannie waiting in the alley and tugs on 
           her hat three times. 

           Zirkzee continues on, politely nodding towards Truus as he 
           passes. He then turns the corner, heading towards Hannie.

           Truus waits and we wait with her...

           Then--

           Gun fire erupts.

           But the amount of shots unsettles Truus. Something went 
           wrong. But just as she’s about to take off towards the alley--

           SS SOLDIERS emerge from the building Zirkzee was in. Commands 
           are shouted, rifles gathered. A hunt is about to take place.

           Truus knows she can’t be seen. She scans the street for a way 
           out and reluctantly takes off in the opposite direction--

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Different than the one the Zirkzee hit took place. Hannie 
           runs down the darkened alley, clutching her pistol. 
           Adrenaline pumping.

           The German voices grow closer. Then--

           A German truck slowly passes by, search light blazing. A half 
           dozen SS SOLDIERS walk behind, eyes shifting from side to 
           side. Hunting. Rifles ready to fire.

           Hannie quickly ducks into the shadows, narrowly escaping the 
           search light. As she waits, a dripping sound catches her 
           attention. She looks down-- 

           And realizes the drip-drip-drip is her own blood hitting the 
           pavement. She swallows the pain. 

           She looks back towards the street and sees the last of the 
           Soldiers pass. Hannie then quietly heads towards the opposite 
           end of the alley--

           Only to stop at the sound of approaching footsteps.

           Hannie backs up, shields herself behind a group of trash 
           bins. The footsteps round the far corner, head down the alley 
           towards her.
           Hannie calms her breathing. She slides her finger over the 
           trigger of her pistol, ready to go out fighting--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (hushed)
                        Hannie?

           The familiar tone causes Hannie to perk up. She slowly gets 
           to her feet, looks around the trash bins and sees--

           Truus standing in the alley. Her hat gone. Hair down. Hannie 
           lets out a sigh of relief.

                                 TRUUS
                        You didn’t think I was going to 
                        leave you here, did you?

           She slides Hannie’s arm over her shoulders and the two girls 
           slink away in the shadows.

           INT. MULDER HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

           Hannie lies in bed, her leg wrapped in bandages. There’s a 
           quiet knock on the door and Brasser enters.

                                 BRASSER
                        How’s the leg?

                                 HANNIE
                        I’ll live.

           Brasser smiles, but his body language tells a different 
           story. Hannie senses it.

                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

                                 BRASSER
                        The Germans retaliated.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREET - NIGHT

           As a crowd of HAARLEM RESIDENTS watch, five MEN, all 
           handcuffed together, are led from the back of a truck. 
           They’re then lined up in the middle of the street as three SS 
           SOLDIERS stand before them, rifles drawn.

           Carver makes his way behind the line of Soldiers. He eyes the 
           handcuffed Men, who to their credit, stand tall. A beat.

                                 CARVER
                        Fire.
           The Soldiers obey. The five Men drop instantly. A RESIDENT 
           screams. Carver then flicks his hand--

           And five more handcuffed Men are pulled from the truck. 
           They’re stood over their dead comrades.

           Carver then turns towards the crowd of frightened Residents, 
           as if wanting to make sure they’re all watching--

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Fire.

           The rifles explode once more--

           INT. MULDER HOME - BEDROOM - BACK IN SCENE

                                 BRASSER
                        There were fifteen in total. All 
                        captured resistance fighters.

           The news hits Hannie hard.

                                 BRASSER (CONT’D)
                        A meeting was called to discuss any 
                        further liquidations.
                             (then)
                        We’re not to stop.

           Hannie holds Brasser’s look. A beat.

                                 HANNIE
                        Then we won’t.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREET - NIGHT

           Superimpose: March 15, 1945.

           A German staff car pulls up to a crime scene. Carver steps 
           out. Slumped against a wall he finds KO LANGENDIJK (35). 

           Carver inspects the body, notices Langendijk’s Hakenkreuz pin 
           spotted with blood. 

                                 SS SOLDIER
                        Local barber Ko Langendijk. NSB. A 
                        man and a woman were seen fleeing.

                                 CARVER
                        A woman? And you weren’t able to 
                        apprehend her?

           The Soldier looks away sheepishly. Carver snaps.
                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        A woman is making a mockery of your 
                        Führer! Have you no pride?!
                             (re: Langendijk’s body)
                        She is spitting in the face of the 
                        Third Reich!

           The Soldiers avert their eyes from Carver’s wrath. His rage 
           slowly subsides. He brushes his hair back into place. Smooths 
           his jacket. Dabs saliva from his chin with his handkerchief.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Double the number of checkpoints. I 
                        want every woman inspected from 
                        here forth. If they resist, shoot 
                        them. If they run, shoot them. And 
                        any woman with red hair should be 
                        brought to me immediately.  

                                 SS SOLDIER
                        Yes, Obersturmbannführer. 

           The Soldier salutes and walks off. Carver runs his thumb 
           across Langendijk’s Hakenkreuz pin, wiping away the blood. 

           His inability to catch the woman with red hair has gotten 
           under his skin. And for the first time, his self confidence 
           is questioned. 

           INT. CAFE - CELLAR - DAY

           Superimpose: March 21, 1945.

           Hannie loads a stack of newsletters into her bag.

                                 TRUUS
                        Where’re you off to?

                                 HANNIE
                        Velserbroek.

                                 TRUUS
                        That’s a long trip, Hannie. Even by 
                        bike. I’ll go with you. 

                                 HANNIE
                        No. It’s alright.

           Hannie loads her pistol into her purse. 
                                 HANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be fine.
                             (off Truus)
                        I’ll be fine.

           Truus lets it go. If anyone would be fine, it’d be Hannie.

                                 TRUUS
                        Just avoid any main roads.

                                 HANNIE
                        I know.

                                 TRUUS
                        You’re almost ready for a touch up 
                        on that hair of yours.

           Hannie playfully brushes her hair back.

                                 HANNIE
                        When I return, darling. 

           She gives Truus a kiss on the cheek on her way out.

           EXT. SPAARNWOUDERSTRAAT - HAARLEM - LATER

           Hannie rides. She hangs a right onto the--

           EXT. TORENSLUIS BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           And discovers a German checkpoint. This was unexpected. 
           Hannie slowly turns her bike around, cautious not to draw 
           attention to herself when--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        To the right.

           Hannie looks back and sees an SS SOLDIER motioning at her.

                                 SS SOLDIER
                        To the right.

           If Hannie runs, she’s dead. Her only move is to comply. She 
           waves in acknowledgment and gets in line behind other 
           RESIDENTS.

           The Soldier walks to her, eyes her suspiciously. Hannie 
           avoids eye contact. A tense beat. And the Soldier moves on.

           The first resident, an ELDERLY MAN, walks through the 
           checkpoint. He’s patted down, his papers inspected by another 
           SOLIDER. Once cleared, he’s allowed to continue. 
           A second ELDERLY MAN goes through the same procedure. Once he 
           moves on, the Solider motions Hannie forward.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Arms.

           Hannie spread her arms as the Soldier frisks her. He takes 
           her ID, compares the photo to Hannie. A beat. And he smiles.

                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        My Grandmother was from Geneva.

           He hands Hannie back her ID. A sense of relief washes over 
           her. She smiles.

                                 HANNIE
                        A fine woman I’m sure.

           She starts forward--

                                 SOLDIER
                        I’ll need to see your bag, Ms. 
                        Elderkamp.
                             (off Hannie)
                        New protocol.

           The Soldier senses Hannie’s reluctance. He grips his rifle. 
           He’s going to see her bag one way or another. 

           She reluctantly hands her bag over. The Soldier opens it, 
           immediately spotting the newsletters.

           The Soldier then dumps the remaining contents onto to the 
           pavement. The pistol hits the ground with a thud. 

           It takes the Soldier a moment to realize what he’s looking 
           at. But when he does--

                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        DOWN! 

           He trains his rifle at Hannie. Another Soldier quickly moves 
           in and forces Hannie to the ground. Handcuffs her.

           EXT. HAARLEM PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION - LATER

           An intimidating dome structure dominating the city’s skyline.

           INT. HAARLEM PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION - CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Hannie sits on the small metal cot. The sound of footsteps 
           approach. The door opens revealing Carver. 
           He’s flanked by an SS Soldier and a DUTCH POLICEMAN. The same 
           one who took concern with Jan’s capture.

                                 CARVER
                        Ms. Elderkamp, is it? From Geneva.

           Silence. Carver then produces the newsletters, pistol and 
           cyanide capsule, taken when Hannie was searched upon arrival.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Do you care to explain these? 

           Hannie gives him nothing. Carver takes her in. Her jet black 
           hair. Glasses. He knows there’s more here.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Very well, Ms. Elderkamp. Perhaps 
                        another night or two in your cell 
                        will jog your memory.

           He walks off. The familiar Policeman, DIEDERICK ZEELEN (33), 
           connects eyes with Hannie before shutting the cell door. 

           EXT. CAFE - LATER

           Freddie parks her bike outside. She enters-- 

           INT. CAFE - CELLAR - MOMENTS LATER

           And is immediately hit with the somberness in the air. All 
           eyes glued to Brasser as he speaks with Diederick.

           WITH BRASSER

                                 BRASSER
                        You’re sure?

                                 DIEDERICK
                        From the description you gave me, 
                        yes. It’s her.

           WITH OTHERS

           Truus notices Brasser’s shoulders drop. It tells her 
           everything she needs to know.

                                 TRUUS
                        They’ve caught Hannie.
           INT. CAFE - CELLAR - LATER

           Truus, Freddie, Brasser and Diederick sit around the corner 
           table. Truus and Freddie keeping their emotions in check as 
           best they can. 

                                 DIEDERICK
                        I can’t get close to her. SS are 
                        with us at all times. But nurses...

           Truus perks up.

                                 DIEDERICK (CONT’D)
                        Nurses administer shots and 
                        checkups to all prisoners. Alone.
                             (to Truus)
                        I could get you a uniform. 

                                 TRUUS
                        Yes.

                                 DIEDERICK
                        The infirmary is located on the 
                        lower floor. There’s a window. You 
                        could climb down and have transport 
                        waiting. 

                                 TRUUS
                        When?

                                 DIEDERICK
                        If we hurry we can get you there 
                        tonight.

                                 BRASSER
                        Are you sure about this, Truus?

                                 TRUUS
                        She’d come for us. 

           And Brasser knows that’s the case.

                                 BRASSER
                        Be careful.

           Truus and Diederick start out. Freddie grabs her sister’s 
           hand, her eyes welling.

                                 FREDDIE
                        Bring her back, Truus. 

           Truus nods. Determined.
           EXT. HAARLEM PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION - LATER

           Truus, donning a nurses uniform, crosses to the entrance. She 
           hands her ID to the GUARD. He looks it over. Hands it back. 
           Motions for the gate to be opened. 

           Truus walks through, immediately struck by the scale of the 
           massive structure.

           INT. HAARLEM PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION - RECEPTION - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           The area swarms with SS, SD, WA, Green Police. Truus is in 
           the hornet’s nest. She calmly walks to the OFFICER behind the 
           front desk and salutes--  

                                 TRUUS
                        Heil Hitler.

           The Officer salutes in return.

                                 TRUUS (CONT’D)
                        I’m here to administer tests on new 
                        inmates.

                                 OFFICER
                        Names?

                                 TRUUS
                        Elderkamp.

           The Officer pulls the inmate log from its holding area. Flips 
           a page. Another. Another. Shakes his head.

                                 OFFICER
                        No Elderkamp.

                                 TRUUS
                        It was a woman. Black hair. 
                        Glasses. Brought in earlier today. 
                        It’s urgent that she be checked. 
                        She’s at risk of spreading disease. 

           The Officer gives another look through the logs. Nothing.

                                 OFFICER
                        No Elderkamp. 

           And then Truus realizes what’s happening. They’ve erased 
           Hannie from the records. She forces a smile.

                                 TRUUS
                        Thank you.
           EXT. HAARLEM PENITENTIARY INSTITUTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Truus hastily walks out the gate. She turns a corner--

           And immediately breaks down. Her patented toughness gives way 
           to tears. She knows her friend is gone.

           INT. GERMAN TRUCK - NIGHT

           Hannie looks out the window at the fortress-like Amsterdam 
           House of Detention.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dimly lit. Hannie is led past cells. The shadowy inhabitants 
           of which hidden in corners. The Soldier pushes her into--

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - CELL - CONTINUOUS

           And locks the gate behind her. Only a water bucket and waste 
           bucket. No windows. Claustrophobic is being generous. Hannie 
           curls up in the corner. The devastating reality she’s facing 
           becomes too much to bare. Her face cracks with tears.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - CELL - DAY

           Hannie lies in the corner. Her cardigan draped over her body 
           for warmth. Her face covered in grime. 

           A Soldier opens the gate and places her refilled water bucket 
           into her cell.

           Hannie maneuvers towards the bucket, closer to the light from 
           the hallway. As she does this, the Soldier notices something 
           and reenters the cell. 

           Hannie scrambles back to the corner, fearing violence.

           The Soldier pulls her into the light. His eyes go wide when 
           his suspicions are confirmed.

           Hannie’s red roots are growing in.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           A Soldier holds Hannie’s head under a faucet while a second 
           forcefully washes her hair with a bar of soap. She struggles. 
           The Soldier grips the back of her neck tighter.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Another washing. The Soldier’s scrub hard. Rough. Black dye 
           trickles down the drain.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           A third washing. The Soldiers scrub strenuously. Blood 
           dribbles down Hannie’s face, mixing in with the black dye and 
           water swirling down the drain.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - INFIRMARY - LATER

           Carver enters, grins when he gazes upon what waits for him.

                                 CARVER
                        I was beginning to think you may 
                        have been a ghost.

           We then see Hannie. Her hands tied to a chair and-- 

           Vibrant red hair returned.

           Carver then breaks into laughter.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        I must admit I’m a bit nervous. 
                        Here she is. The woman with red 
                        hair sitting before me. 

           He claps his hands together like an excited child. 

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        The stories of your escapades made 
                        you out to be a giant. Ten feet 
                        tall. I have to say that I’m a bit 
                        disappointed that you are not. What 
                        a wonderful story that would have 
                        made for my grandchildren.

           Hannie keeps silent. Carver’s smile slowly fades.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        But now it’s time you told me a 
                        story, Ms. Schaft. You can spare 
                        yourself a lot of pain and 
                        suffering if you give me the names 
                        of your co-conspirators right now.
           A tense beat. Hannie turns her head away. As if she’s saying, 
           “Do your worst.” Carver laughs to himself. Knowingly.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        No. I didn’t suspect you’d make it 
                        that easy on me.

           He snaps his fingers. A Soldier unties Hannie and forces her 
           out of the room. Carver follows.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - INTERROGATION ROOM - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Hannie watches fearfully as a Soldier fills a large tub with 
           ice water. A second Soldier then violently strips her nude. 

           Carver sits in a chair, pours himself a cup of tea. Hannie 
           stands vulnerable. Arms covering her private parts.

                                 CARVER
                        Give me their names.

           Hannie says nothing. Carver drops a sugar cube into his cup. 
           He looks to Hannie as if to say, “Are you sure?”

           She stands firm. Carver shrugs. He nods to the Soldier who 
           then drags Hannie into the tub. She shrieks! The freezing 
           water piercing her skin like a thousand knives.

           Carver takes a sip of tea and nods again.

           The Soldier then plunges Hannie’s head under water! Her arms 
           and legs thrash about. Water spills over the edges.

           And Carver flicks his hand. The Soldier pulls Hannie up. She 
           gasps for air. Lips turning purple.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Names, Ms. Schaft.

           Her teeth chattering, Hannie refuses to speak. Carver gives 
           another signal. The Soldier dunks Hannie back under. She 
           fights for the surface, but the Soldier’s too strong.

           Carver watches... and waits... and waits... and waits. 
           Allowing Hannie’s oxygen level to hit critical levels. As her 
           struggling begins to slow, Carver nods. 

           The Soldier pulls Hannie up. She coughs. Sucking oxygen in as 
           fast as she can. Carver crosses closer to her.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what I want to know.
           Hannie’s entire body shivers. Her muscles lock up. She looks 
           Carver square in the eyes... and readies herself for more. 
           Irritated, Carver nods and Hannie is forced under again.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - CELL - LATER

           Hannie is thrown into her cell. Her nude body still shaking. 
           She curls up into the corner, trying to find warmth. A long 
           silence. Then--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey. Are you alive?

           Hannie’s eyes scan the cell. Did she really hear that?

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Are you?

                                 HANNIE
                        Who are you...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        My name is Edwin.

           A tap-tap-tap on the bars from the cell next to Hannie. EDWIN 
           is a prisoner.

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        So. Is it really you? Are you 
                        really the woman with red hair?

                                 HANNIE
                        Yes...

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        I knew it! We’ve heard stories 
                        about you. It’s an honor. Here. 
                        Take this.

           A small blanket lands in front of Hannie’s cell. 

                                 EDWIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’ll keep you warm.

           Hannie quickly grabs the blanket. She hurries back to the 
           corner and wraps herself up. It may not be much but to Hannie 
           it feels like a bear skin blanket.

                                 HANNIE
                        Thank you.

           She closes her eyes, trying to find sleep--
           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - CELL - NIGHT

           Hannie, now wearing prison clothing, is awoken by a Soldier 
           entering her cell. He forcibly removes her.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - INTERROGATION ROOM - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Hannie’s strapped to a chair. Her eyes glued to the two 
           Soldiers in the room. One heats an iron poker in fire. The 
           other holds a leather whip. 

           Carver slowly walks around her, like a predator stalking its 
           prey. He truly does enjoy this.

                                 CARVER
                        Have you ever smelled burning 
                        flesh, Ms. Schaft?

           Hannie says nothing. Instead, she’s preparing mentally for 
           the pain that’s about to be felt. 

           Carver nods and the Soldiers move in. The first Soldier 
           presses the red hot iron into Hannie’s palm! Her skin 
           sizzles! She screams in agony.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Who are your superiors?! 

           Remarkably, Hannie still refuses to talk. The second Soldier 
           then whips Hannie’s shins! Her skin welts and then tears.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        NAMES!

           The whipping continues. Flesh torn from the bone. Hannie’s 
           hysterical from the pain but still doesn’t talk.

           Enraged, Carver grabs the poker and brings it close to 
           Hannie’s face, illuminating her skin with its glow.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Tell me. 

           Tears pour down Hannie’s face. Her breathing labored. Body 
           consumed with pain. She turns to Carver... and spits into his 
           face. Furious, Carver presses the poker onto Hannie’s palm.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Hannie’s screams echo off the walls. One after another. Each 
           one seemingly louder and more painful than the last.
           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - CELL - NIGHT

           Hannie lies in the corner, wrapped in Edwin’s blanket. Her 
           shins raw, bloodied. Burn marks covering her hands and arms.

                                 HANNIE
                        Edwin...

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        Yes, Hannie?

                                 HANNIE
                        Where are you from?

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        Rotterdam.

                                 HANNIE
                        Do you have a family?

           A beat.

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        They were killed in the air raids 
                        during the invasion. 

                                 HANNIE
                        I’m sorry. 
                             (then)
                        What were their names?

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        Margreet was my wife. We had a 
                        daughter. Paulien.

                                 HANNIE
                        Those are lovely names.

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        Did you have a family?

           Hannie contemplates that question. Her mind drifts--

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - BOMB SHELTER - DAY

           The entire Council together. Hannie, Jan, Truus, Freddie, 
           Brasser. There’s togetherness. Sisterhood. Love. Camaraderie. 
           They were, in the truest sense of the word, family. 

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - CELL - BACK IN SCENE

           Hannie manages a smile.
                                 HANNIE
                        Yes. I did.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Hannie sits in the middle of the room. No restraints. No 
           whips. No tubs. Carver enters and sets his chair across from 
           her.

                                 CARVER
                        You knew Jan Bonekamp, yes?

           Hannie shifts slightly.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Of course you did. Tell me. Was it 
                        love? 

           Silence.  

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        He also refused to answer that 
                        question.
                             (then)
                        Right before he named you.

           Hannie refuses to let the mind games work. 

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        He looked me in the eyes and made a 
                        deal with me. In exchange for your 
                        name, he was to be released. A free 
                        man and a man who would declare his 
                        loyalty to the Third Reich. But as 
                        we both know, his wounds were too 
                        severe and sadly, he did not live 
                        to see that freedom. 

           Hannie’s mind races. Was that true?

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        How does that make you feel, 
                        Hannie? Angry? Revengeful? Knowing 
                        that the man you loved valued his 
                        life more than he did yours. Jan 
                        Bonekamp is the reason your parents 
                        were arrested. Jan Bonekamp is the 
                        reason you are here now. He 
                        betrayed you. You owe him nothing. 
                        You owe the resistance nothing. 
                             (then)
                        But you can make it right.

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        You can make them suffer as they 
                        have made you suffer. Just give me 
                        their names and this all goes away.

           A beat. Hannie coming to a conclusion. Carver can sense it. 

                                 CARVER (CONT’D)
                        Tell me... 

            Then--

                                 HANNIE
                        Pieter Faber. Willem Ragut. Willem 
                        Zirkzee. Ko Langendijk. Those are 
                        the men I killed. They are the real 
                        betrayers. 

           Carver exhales. He’s fighting a losing battle and knows it.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - CELL - NIGHT

           Hannie lies under her blanket. Her eyes land on a small piece 
           of rock broken off from the wall. Its edge pointed. She picks 
           it up, barely able to hold it tight enough. 

           She then scratches it against the masonry wall, as if using a 
           pencil.

           INT. AMSTERDAM HOUSE OF DETENTION - HALLWAY - DAY

           Carver and a Soldier walk towards Hannie’s cell. But this 
           isn’t for torture. This has a feel of finality. The Soldier 
           removes Hannie. Carver then notices something and steps into 
           the cell--

           WITH HANNIE

           She glances towards Edwin’s cell, catching a glimpse of him 
           for the first time. Skinny. Beard overgrown. Caked in dirt. 
           They lock eyes. Two patriots paying the ultimate price.

           The Soldier leads Hannie away. As he does, Edwin begins 
           banging on his cell bars. Other PRISONERS follow suit as 
           Hannie passes their cells. A send off for one of their own--

           WITH CARVER

           Standing in Hannie’s cell. The commotion in the hall growing 
           louder and louder. He stares in disbelief at what Hannie had 
           written on the wall the night prior:

           From small things we aspire towards the great.
           INT. TRANSPORT TRUCK - LATER

           Hannie sits flanked by two Soldiers. Carver faces her. The 
           only sounds coming from the truck’s engine.

           Hannie keeps her eyes on Carver and he on her. It’s tense. 
           Two heavyweights squaring off one final time. Hannie’s 
           courage, fight, resolve never more evident than in this 
           moment. 

           There’s no hint of fear. No panic. Then, it happens...

           Despite his power, ruthlessness and intimidation, this red 
           headed woman got the best of Carver. She may be heading 
           towards her death, but she defeated him. And he knows it. So 
           like a dog running off with its tail between its legs--

           Carver looks away first. 

           Hannie manages a smile to herself. One final victory.

           EXT. SAND DUNES - LATER

           The truck comes to a stop. Carver steps out. The Soldiers 
           follow with Hannie. The group walks towards the sea.

           As they get further into the dunes, Hannie closes her eyes 
           and listens. Slowly, the sounds of the men behind her fade. 
           No longer can she hear their boots in the sand. The rustling 
           of their uniforms. The straps of their rifles. 

           All she can hear is the music of the sea. The waves crashing. 
           Breeze blowing. Seagulls squawking. 

           She lifts her head towards the sky, allowing the warm 
           sunlight to cascade over her freckled skin. Her vibrant red 
           hair gently rustling in the breeze.

           Carver and the Soldiers stop walking. Carver then aims his 
           pistol at the back of Hannie’s head.

           But she doesn’t notice. She’s lost in the symphony of nature. 
           As she feels the sunlight on her freckled skin for the final 
           time, the corner of her lips turn up into a smile. 

           She’s safe.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           The distinct pop of a pistol.
          Johanna “Hannie” Schaft was executed on April 17th, 1945. 
          Three weeks before the end of the war.

          She was 24 years old.

          Her body was one of 422, many resistance fighters, found 
          in shallow graves at the dunes of Overveen.

          Of those, she was the only woman.

          After realizing their trap had failed, the Nazis released 
          Hannie’s parents after nine months in captivity.

          On November 27th, 1945, Hannie was reburied in a ceremony 
          overseen by Queen Wilhelmina in which the Queen referred 
          to Hannie as “the symbol of resistance.”

          Hannie also received a posthumous Medal of Freedom from 
          General Eisenhower.

          On May 3rd, 1982, a bronze statue was erected in Kenaupark 
          in Haarlem to memorialize Hannie’s efforts.

          The statue was designed by Truus Oversteegen.
