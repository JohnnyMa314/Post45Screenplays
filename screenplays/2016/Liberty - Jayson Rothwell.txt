           LIBERTY

           By Jayson Rothwell

           EXT. COLMAR, FRENCH BORDER - DAY

           A forest overlooking rutted fields, and the distant 
           sleepy village of Colmar. A morning mist hangs over the 
           whole scene. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The year is 1870. Here we are in the 
                        sleepy French border village of Colmar, 
                        famous for absolutely nothing. Not even a 
                        cheese. France has declared War on 
                        Germany over some bullshit or other. 
                        Nobody really remembers. 

           Two KIDS hunt RABBITS with CATAPULTS. We’ll call them 
           PATRICE and THIERRY but these names have no historical 
           accuracy.

           BAM! Patrice kills a rabbit. Hoists it up by its hind 
           legs. Really happy with himself for a whole second. Then -

           He sees movement at the treeline of the forest. And the 
           smile leaves his face. His friend Thierry, doing nothing 
           to dispel our assumptions about French bravery, is 
           already RUNNING back to the village.

           We turn to see what is making Patrice look so horrified.

           A LINE of GERMAN CAVALRY appears at the treeline. Over a 
           hundred Hussars with LANCES and SWORDS and fantastic 
           uniforms, astride huge Hanoverian war-horses.

           An ARTILLERY TEAM brings forward a GUN CARRIAGE and 
           prepares the terrifying weapon for imminent use.

           Patrice looks at the ARTILLERY CANNON. Then back to his 
           sleepy little village of Colmar that never did anything 
           wrong except being built right here on the damned border. 
           He drops the rabbit. And RACES back home, screaming...

                                 PATRICE
                        Maman! Maman! The Germans! The Germans 
                        are here!

           We hold on the German OFFICER IN CHARGE, grim faced, 
           confident. He lights a cigar. Looks over to his gun crew. 
                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        Wake them up.

           BOOM! Patrice hits the dirt as a CANNON SHELL hurtles 
           overhead and KABLAM! - destroys a CHICKEN COOP. Really 
           annihilates that thing. Feathers, beaks, eggs. SPLAT.

           EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, COLMAR - DAY

           Mist cloaked streets. A definite sense of DREAD. Men 
           gather with whatever WEAPONS they possess. 

           These are no soldiers. They are farmers, butchers, 
           builders, accountants - armed with rifles, pistols, 
           scythes, meat cleavers, garlic breath.

           All are MOUNTED on a range of ragtag horses of various 
           provenance and size. The best of them is tired old nag.

           Riding down this line of unimpressive “military” might is 
           BERTRAND, leader of the LOCAL MILITIA.

                                 BERTRAND
                        Gentlemen, the enemy is upon us. Let us 
                        show these German invaders what we are 
                        made of: steel, determination, passion. 
                        You ride to glory. Farewell.

           A BUTCHER with a heavy moustache and heavier belly asks -

                                 BUTCHER
                        Farewell? Are you not coming with us?

                                 BERTRAND
                        I must take important information on the 
                        enemy to the Militia Headquarters in the 
                        next town, 20 miles away. I put you under 
                        the command of...

           He looks down the line and his gaze alights upon a TALL 
           MAN in a greatcoat with a rifle over his shoulder and a 
           SWORD in his hand. 

           Handsome, he carries himself with the bravado of a man 
           who has yet to face a speeding cannonball. This is...

                                 BERTRAND (CONT’D)
                        Frederic Bartholdi.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Frederic Auguste Bartholdi. History will 
                        not record his military exploits. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But this is his story, nonetheless. And 
                        it is absolutely incredible.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS, COLMAR - DAY

           The Horsemen Militia rides through narrow cobbled 
           streets.

           Elderly women shutter their windows. A PRIEST crosses 
           himself. Frederic leads the militia with a mixture of 
           pride, determination, and abject terror.

                                 FREDERIC
                        When they see we mean business, they will 
                        run all the way back to Berlin. 

                                 BUTCHER
                        I don’t think so.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Frankfurt then.

                                 BUTCHER
                        Rumor is the Germans are winning.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Strasbourg. They will definitely run as 
                        far as Strasbourg. If not further.

           Unknown to Frederic, as the militia ride through the 
           village, several of the men PEEL OFF down alleyways in 
           the mist and ABANDON the unit.

           By the time Frederic leads them to the remains of the 
           Chicken Coop on the edge of town -

           It’s just him and the Butcher.

                                 BUTCHER
                        We should surrender.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Never. My father’s motto was never give 
                        up, no matter what the obstacle. Never 
                        underestimate the power of the human 
                        spirit. We have freedom, liberty, and 
                        fraternity on our side.

                                 BUTCHER
                        They have a cannon.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Are you with me?
                                 BUTCHER
                        You’re an artist. A sculptor. You don’t 
                        know how to fight.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I said are you with me?

                                 BUTCHER
                        No. You’re on your own.
                                (A beat)
                        Your mother always says what a fool you 
                        are. She wishes you could be smart. Like 
                        your brother. So long, Frederic.

           He turns and rides back into the village. The mist 
           swallows him.

           Frederic sees the rutted field before him. Then the 
           forest. And the line of German Hussars. The morning sun 
           glints off their swords.

           Frederic raises his own sword. Kicks his horse onwards. 
           And bellows like a madman...

                                 FREDERIC
                        ATTACK!!! ATTACK!!!

           Alone, Frederic CHARGES towards the German line, where -

           The German Officer In Charge turns to his Gun Crew. They 
           share a look. He shrugs.

                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        Fire.

           They adjust the aim of the Cannon. And fire. BOOM!

           The shell SCREEEEEEAMS towards Frederic and -

           EXPLODES ten yards IN FRONT. His horse STUMBLES and 
           THROWS Frederic from the saddle. 

           He FLIES through the cloud of MUD and dirt kicked up by 
           the exploding shell and LANDS face down in a pool of 
           filthy water. Dead.

           The German Officer In Charge LAUGHS. And all his men 
           laugh with him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        This would not be the most humiliating 
                        moment of Frederic’s life. Far worse had 
                        already happened.
           EXT. PARIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Establishing. The silvery swathe of the Seine, choked 
           with river traffic, cuts through the city just like it 
           has for the past 12,000 years.

           The city is much the same as we know it now except for 
           the lack of its most famous monument. It will be another 
           29 years till Monsieur EIFFEL builds his tower.

           We drop down to the bustle of street level merchants and 
           carters. Here, we find...

           Frederic driving a cart. Sitting beside him is his much 
           older friend and assistant, SIMON (56).

           Simon has the air of a human Bassett Hound. Grey hair, 
           grey clothes, grey skin; he would probably drink grey 
           brandy if he could find it.

           They have a SCULPTURE draped in a TARP standing upright 
           on the back of the cart. Over twelve feet tall, it draws 
           the attention of everyone they pass.

                                 SIMON
                        This is the most important exhibition in 
                        Paris. It’s an honor just to be invited.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I’m not going there to just make up the 
                        numbers. The critics will marvel at my 
                        sculpture, and award me the Medal of 
                        Excellence.

                                 SIMON
                        Best just to treat it as a showcase, it 
                        being your first time.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I won’t hear that defeatist talk, Simon. 
                        It’s glory or goodbye.

                                 SIMON
                        I’d rather get a buyer than a medal. All 
                        your money is tied up in this statue.

                                 FREDERIC
                        No. No. No. Artistic validation and 
                        appreciation first. Money second.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m just a humble, somewhat cynical, 
                        artist’s assistant. I can’t buy a bottle 
                        of brandy with appreciation.
                                 FREDERIC
                        Appreciation will attract a higher level 
                        of client, richer commissions, and buy 
                        you a whole barrel of brandy. 

           He gestures over his shoulder to their cargo.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT'D)
                        When they see my bronze of General Rapp, 
                        everything will fall into place. Trust 
                        me. I have invested everything in a  
                        future I have planned with a very high 
                        degree of precision.

           EXT. SALON DES ARTS, PARIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A wooden CRANE and PULLEY system LOWERS the covered 
           statue onto a LOW TROLLEY for transport INTO the 
           EXHIBITION HALL.

           A crowd surrounds Frederic, eager to see his work. 
           Critics and fellow artists gather, hoping they will have 
           something to ridicule. They will not be disappointed.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, please be patient. 
                        My patriotic masterpiece will be revealed 
                        inside.

           The PORTERS haul the heavy covered statue, on its plinth, 
           on the low trolley - to the massive double doors of the 
           Exhibition Hall where -

           A gasp rises from the crowd. 

           Frederic looks up at his creation, and the doorway, with 
           growing horror.

                                 SIMON
                        Planned with a very high degree of 
                        precision, you said?

           The twelve foot statue is TOO TALL to fit through the ten 
           foot doorway. Two feet too tall.

                                 CRITIC
                        What a pity that nobody will see your 
                        work, Bartholdi. It’s probably a 
                        blessing. I hear your style is 
                        unoriginal, predictable and populist.

           Simon turns to Frederic. In urgent whispers...
                                 SIMON
                        I can take it back to the workshop and 
                        cut two feet off the plinth.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Then it won’t be a plinth. It’ll be a 
                        coaster. I’m dying here, Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        You’re not. But your career is.

           Frederic heads to the Crane operators...

                                 FREDERIC
                        I need you to lift it back onto the cart.

                                 CRANE OPERATOR
                        I need you to pay me.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I don’t have the money right now.

                                 CRANE OPERATOR
                        Then you don’t have the crane right now.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I didn’t expect to be taking the statue 
                        away today. I can pay tomorrow.

                                 CRANE OPERATOR
                        Sounds good. I’ll move it tomorrow.

           As the crowd and critics LAUGH at Frederic’s disaster, 
           the Porters demand an answer...

                                 PORTERS
                        Where do you want it?

           Frederic reluctantly points to a spot in the Square.

           EXT. SALON DES ARTS, PARIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           No crowd. No critics. Nobody at all.

           Frederic sits at the bottom of his statue, drinking the 
           last of the brandy with Simon. 

           Frederic looks up at his tarp covered statue. Then has an 
           idea. He UNTIES the ropes that secure the tarp and -

           REVEALS his BRONZE SCULPTURE of Napoleonic War Hero 
           General Rapp. It’s really rather good. Not spectacular. 
           But certainly not awful. He salutes the statue.
                                 FREDERIC
                        There you are, a hero of France, a hero 
                        of the Revolution. And here I am, the 
                        idiot who didn’t measure the size of the 
                        doorway. You fought for liberty. I fight 
                        for a decent review in the newspaper. 
                        Someone to like my work. To like me.

           A stray dog arrives. And takes a leak on the statue.

                                 SIMON
                        Everyone’s a bloody critic.

           Frederic gathers the tarpaulin, hoists it over his 
           shoulder, and heads off into the night with Simon. 

           EXT. VICTOR HUGO’S HOUSE, PARIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           An elegant row of imposing Townhouses.

           Frederic pauses.

                                 SIMON
                        You can’t knock on his door. This is home 
                        of the Victor Hugo. The greatest writer 
                        in France. The Hunchback of Notre Dame. 
                        He’ll have you arrested.

                                 FREDERIC
                        If he says he likes the statue, I’m 
                        golden.

                                 SIMON
                        He’s a miserable old misery. His face is 
                        miserable. His life is miserable. His 
                        books are miserable. He won’t like your 
                        statue because he doesn’t like anything. 

           Frederic has STUFFED the tarpaulin up the back of his 
           jacket to create a HUNCHBACK. He lopes up the steps to 
           Victor Hugo’s door. And rings the doorbell.

           Frederic turns to Simon and pretends to be the monster. 
           In a “Hunchback” voice -

                                 FREDERIC
                        The bells! The bells!

           Off Simon’s aghast look... Frederic turns. The door is 
           open. A very small and miserable Victor Hugo stands there 
           in his dressing gown. Frederic offers his hand...
                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Frederic Bartholdi, artist, sculptor, big 
                        big fan. I wondered if you might...

                                 VICTOR HUGO
                        No. I absolutely won’t. But if you come 
                        near me or my home again I will have you 
                        arrested, and shot.

           He slams the door in Frederic’s face.

           EXT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A rundown old building. One side is the studio, one side 
           is an attached house. He works in the studio, lives in 
           the house with his long-widowed, long-suffering MOTHER. 

           Simon opens the door for Frederic. Pushes him inside. 
           Then continues down the street.

           We hold on the building as night turns to day.

           EXT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A very dapper gentleman arrives carrying breakfast. This 
           is CHARLES BARTHOLDI, older brother, successful lawyer, 
           definitely not the fuck-up of the family. 

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           We follow Charles through the chaos of the studio - a 
           large open space divided by curtains into separate areas. 
           Sunlight streams in through skylight windows. 

           Charles pauses to admire sketches pinned to the wall - 
           NUDES of beautiful women. He takes one. Rolls it up. And 
           slips it into his jacket pocket.

           He follows the sound of snoring to where Frederic has 
           collapsed on a divan, one shoe on, one shoe off.

           He pushes drawing materials and clay aside and lays out 
           breakfast on a long work-table. Then sprinkles PEPPER on 
           Frederic’s sleeping face. Frederic wakes - sneezing.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Charles? Charles!

                                 CHARLES
                        You missed breakfast. By half a day.
                                 FREDERIC
                        If you’ve come to tell me I’m a disaster 
                        I am already aware. Has Mother heard?

                                 CHARLES
                        Unfortunately.

           Frederic groans.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        There’s probably a limit to how much 
                        disappointment she can take, Frederic.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Did you bring Brandy?

                                 CHARLES
                        Baguettes. And a reluctant offer. 

           Frederic sits up with his head in his hands.

                                 FREDERIC
                        My head hurts.

                                 CHARLES
                        Your finances are in a good deal more 
                        pain, little brother. Everything Father 
                        left you is gone.
                                (A beat...)
                        There’s a position, at my law practice. A 
                        very junior position with a miniscule 
                        salary. Think about it.

           LATER...

           Frederic sits huddled in the bath, smoking, drinking. He 
           lowers his head UNDER the water. And keeps it there. Eyes 
           open. Watching SMOKE bubbles leave his mouth. 

           A shadowy figure appears above him. A hand reaches down 
           into the water, GRABS him by his beard, and yanks him up.

           It’s Simon. 

                                 SIMON
                        Get dressed.

           EXT. SALON DES ARTS, PARIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Simon leads Frederic through the crowd. They PASS the 
           open doors to the Salon, and head to the Square where -
           Hundreds of people are gathered around Frederic’s grand 
           new bronze statue of General Rapp. The crowd sings 
           patriotic songs. 

                                 SIMON
                        Here he is. Here’s the artist. Here’s 
                        Bartholdi.

           The crowd turns to welcome Frederic and switches its 
           chant to -

                                 CROWD
                        Bartholdi! Bartholdi!

           Frederic is scooped up onto the shoulders of men and 
           taken on a short tour around General Rapp. 

           A very distinguished older gentleman approaches Frederic. 

           Lowered to the ground amid more congratulations, the 
           older man offers his hand. This is LABOULAYE.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Monsieur Bartholdi?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Please, Frederic.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        I am Laboulaye. A lawyer, and Government 
                        Advisor. I knew your father. This is a 
                        fine work, Frederic.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Thank you.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        In hard times, people need a symbol of 
                        something good, something great. An 
                        ideal. A rallying point. There will never 
                        be a Frenchman as great as General Rapp.

                                 FREDERIC
                        If only the Arts Commission gave medals 
                        for works outside of the Salon.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        You don’t need a medal. You have this.

           He hands Frederic an envelope sealed with wax.

                                 LABOULAYE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you at seven. 
           Laboulaye leaves. Frederic OPENS the envelope. INSIDE, 
           it’s an INVITATION to...

                                 FREDERIC
                        A Dinner for Artists and Intellectuals.

                                 SIMON
                        And you.

           EXT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Frederic smartens the line of his clothes, and takes the 
           steps up to the front door of this imposing villa. A 
           BUTLER ushers him inside.

           INT. PARLOUR, LABOULAYE MANSION - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Patriotic paintings adorn the walls. Sombre portraits.

           Cigar smoke hangs heavy around a table laid with canapes 
           and fine wines. A centerpiece of roses is decorated with 
           the FLAGS of France and the USA.

           There are twenty or more men gathered here in LOUD and 
           animated conversation. Laboulaye welcomes Frederic to the 
           gathering and makes introductions. 

           Frederic joins a card table where Laboulaye holds court 
           with intellectuals including the US AMBASSADOR to FRANCE.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Mr. Ambassador, we are impressed with how 
                        your Civil War has brought an end to 
                        oppression in your country.

                                 US AMBASSADOR
                        Now we can look forward to a long period 
                        of stability, growth, and prosperity.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        France has much to learn from the success 
                        of your great Republic.

                                 US AMBASSADOR
                        We owe our nationhood to France. We held 
                        firm against the British. But it was our 
                        Gallic ally who pushed us on to victory.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        The Government has asked me to find ways 
                        to bring our nations closer together 
                        again.
                                 US AMBASSADOR
                        What do you have in mind?

                                 LABOULAYE
                        I open it to the table for suggestions.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        Perhaps a Parade of French Culture in 
                        Washington?

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        Or a special flag for public buildings, 
                        where one side is the Stars and Stripes, 
                        and the other side is the Tricolor?

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        We could commission a new symphony from 
                        Bizet, or Berlioz, or Chopin?

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        Chopin is Polish.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        He sounds French and so does his music.

                                 FREDERIC
                        The greater challenge is that Chopin is 
                        dead. I think we should build a statue, a 
                        lasting monument to our long friendship, 
                        mutual admiration, and freedom.

           Everyone turns to him, and considers the proposal for the 
           most fleeting of moments before...

                                 ALL
                        That’s a terrible idea.

                                 US AMBASSADOR
                        Agreed. It’ll never take off. 
                                (A beat...)
                        But the flag could work.

           EXT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Frederic uses his artist charm on a SERVANT GIRL on the 
           rear terrace. He strokes her face, tracing the light from 
           the parlor window on her skin.

                                 FREDERIC
                        You have a wonderful profile. You must 
                        sit for me. Soon. Tonight.
                                 LABOULAYE (O.S.)
                        Run along, Emilie.

           Frederic and the Servant Girl, EMILIE, turn to see 
           Laboulaye exit the Parlor French Windows.

           She curtsies and scurries away. Frederic pours himself 
           another glass of wine, all the way to the brim.

                                 LABOULAYE (CONT’D)
                        You may want to cast your eye somewhere 
                        other than Emilie. She has a history.

                                 FREDERIC
                        What would be the fun if she didn’t?

                                 LABOULAYE
                        She has been arrested. She’s an activist 
                        in the Women’s Movement. She is literally 
                        unemployable. Only here as a favor to her 
                        poor father, an old friend.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I like strong women. They can catch me 
                        when I fall, from drink or boredom.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        They’re still discussing ideas. Each one 
                        progressively worse than the last.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Perhaps a new Symphony from a dead Chopin 
                        is the best of them after all.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        No. Your monument is the best. It has 
                        gravitas, presence, longevity.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It has no chance of getting funded. Who 
                        am I? So new to the scene. So lacking in 
                        weight and commissions. 

                                 LABOULAYE
                        This will change. I have a proposal.

           We hold on Frederic’s intrigue...

           EXT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           In the garden, Frederic sketches the portrait of 
           Laboulaye as he sits stoic and composed.
           In the background, Frederic is amused by the flirtatious 
           to and fro of the servant girl Emilie. She waves. He 
           waves. Laboulaye turns but...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Eyes front, sir, please. You must not 
                        break the pose.

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, BACK STREET - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           We move past a BUST of Laboulaye, carved from clay, and 
           fairly expertly at that. Pinned to boards around the bust 
           are many sketches of the man made by Frederic.

           Beyond this bust...

           Emilie, the Servant Girl, poses on the divan, loosely 
           draped in velvet. Frederic stands at an easel, sketching, 
           drinking, smoking, and striking heroic artist poses. He’s 
           having FUN. 

                                 EMILIE
                        Can I see?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Not yet. I’m working on the nose. It’s 
                        the hardest part. A nose completes the 
                        face like no other detail.

                                 EMILIE
                        They say I have a pretty nose.

                                 FREDERIC
                        They say a lot of things about you.

                                 EMILIE
                        It’s no shame to be arrested for what you 
                        believe is right. Laws are often wrong.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Not surprising when they’re written by 
                        men.

           She smiles. She likes this artist.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        And you do have a pretty nose, fine lips, 
                        intoxicating eyes, and splendid tits. I 
                        can’t wait to play with them.

                                 EMILIE
                        You’re a very naughty boy.
           An ice-cold sobering female VOICE from the shadows wipes 
           the smile from Frederic’s face. This is his MOTHER...

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, he’s much more than that, dear. He’s 
                        debauched, a drunk, a debtor, and a drain 
                        on his Mother’s spirits and finances.

           Emilie blushes and covers herself.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Emilie, might I introduce my dear Mother. 
                        Mother, this is Emilie, my muse.

                                 MOTHER
                        Goodbye, dear.

           Emilie gathers her clothes and bustles out. Frederic’s 
           Mother replaces her on the divan. Perched. Not sprawled. 
           She carries a small paper bag of pastries.

                                 FREDERIC
                        They smell wonderful.

                                 MOTHER
                        Madelines, for your brother.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I love Madelines.

                                 MOTHER
                        You love Madelines, and Virginies, and 
                        Clarices, and Emilies, and oh, I lose 
                        track of all your... muses.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Have you seen my General Rapp?

                                 MOTHER
                        I saw him in real life. Charles tells me 
                        you have earned some commissions from it?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Starting with a bust of Laboulaye. He’s a 
                        very important Government Advisor. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I hope you’ll be responsible with your 
                        earnings, like your brother Charles. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        I will spend my good fortune on fine wine 
                        and fine women. The rest, I admit, I will 
                        probably squander.
                                 MOTHER
                        This is no time for jokes. There’s talk 
                        of War with Germany.

                                 FREDERIC
                        There’s always talk of War with Germany.

                                 MOTHER
                        I forbid you to enlist. You are not 
                        suited to a fight, Frederic. You lack the 
                        necessary backbone.

           EXT. COLMAR, FRENCH BORDER - DAY (NOW)

           We’re back in that field outside the village. 

           Frederic is FACE DOWN in MUD, dead. His horse BOLTS back 
           to the village. At the treeline, the German Hussars are 
           still laughing. Then...

           Frederic lifts himself from death, from the mud, from the 
           humiliation of his disastrous solo battle charge. He 
           stands on unsteady feet, retrieves his BROKEN SWORD from 
           the dirt, and sets off towards the Germans.

           Defiant. Delusional. He stops, exhausted, smack bang in 
           front of the German Field Cannon.

                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        What the Hell are you doing?

                                 FREDERIC
                        I’ve come to accept your surrender.

           The Gun Crew look to their Officer, smirking. He gives 
           them the nod. They LIGHT THE FUSE on the cannon. This is 
           going to get very messy, very soon.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Leave now and I will not pursue you. 

                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        You won’t chase us away?

                                 FREDERIC
                        You have my word.

                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        Why do you risk your life like this? What 
                        are you fighting for?

           The cannon fuse burns lower. The end is nigh.
                                 FREDERIC
                        For my village. For Liberty, Fraternity, 
                        and the other one. For the weak against 
                        the strong. For my awful friend Claude, 
                        the Butcher. For my perfect brother, 
                        Charles. For my Mother, in our summer 
                        cottage, baking Madelines.

           The Officer In Charge steps forward on his horse, and 
           SLASHES down with his sword -

           Cutting the fuse just before it can light the gunpowder. 
           There’s visible disappointment form the Gun Crew.

           EXT. COLMAR, FRENCH BORDER - DAY

           The morning mist rises to reveal a village wrapped in 
           silent terror. 

           Frederic, wrists tied before him, marches at the head of 
           the German Hussars. Frightened villagers watch from 
           behind closed shutters, too scared to show their faces.

           Frederic KNOCKS on the door of a quaint painted cottage. 
           His Mother’s stern face appears as it opens.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I made a deal with the Germans.

                                 MOTHER
                        What kind of deal?

                                 FREDERIC
                        They won’t kill anybody and they won’t 
                        destroy our village. However...

           INT. BARTHOLDI COTTAGE, COLMAR - DAY

           The German Officer In Charge sits at the kitchen table 
           with Frederic. His Mother brings a plate of freshly baked 
           Madelines. The German savors the sweet vanilla cake.

           Frederic reaches for one too, but his Mother SLAPS his 
           hand away.

                        The War ends quickly with an absolute 
                        German victory. They kick French ass. Eat 
                        French cakes. Steal French cash. And take 
                        French land. This little French village 
                        becomes a little German village. France 
                        plunges into economic crisis.

                        A new Republic is formed. And Frederic 
                        returns to Paris to continue his 
                        unspectacular sculptor career.

           EXT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - DAY

           A loud and passionate debate spills out of an open 
           window. We enter into...

           INT. PARLOUR, LABOULAYE MANSION - DAY

           The same gathering of artists and intellectuals. Only now 
           they all have drawings and plans of their various 
           ridiculous ideas.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        France is on its knees. Now, more than 
                        ever, we need American support, American 
                        friendship, American trade.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        Except the Americans are back in bed with 
                        the stinking British.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        They kiss the backside of the Industrial 
                        Revolution, they adore all those British 
                        inventions, British machines, and those 
                        filthy British factories.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        We need to invent something. Americans go 
                        crazy for new things.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        We invent many things. Photography, 
                        pasteurization, the Metric System...

                                 LABOULAYE
                        They hate the Metric System.

                                 FREDERIC
                        We need to excite them in French way, 
                        with passion, with spirit, with elan. We 
                        need a symbol of...

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        If you suggest a bloody statue again I 
                        will punch you in the face.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        I liked the idea.
                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        The only thing a little statue will 
                        excite is the pigeon who shits on it. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        I don’t want to build a little statue.
                                (A beat)
                        I want to build a big one.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        How big?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Twenty or maybe even thirty feet high.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        And who will this statue be of? George 
                        Washington, I presume?

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        It should be Lafayette. Without 
                        Lafayette, there would be no America.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        Washington AND Lafayette together.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        Shaking hands.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        A symbol of French and American unity.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        Thirty feet high.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        We should make Lafayette taller. Thirty 
                        one feet high.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        Lafayette was not a tall man.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        It’s a symbol. Accuracy is not important.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Frederic? You are the sculptor.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I have a better idea. 

           He lays out some sketches from a portfolio. The sketches 
           show a SLAVE WOMAN with one hand outstretched above her, 
           and RAYS OF LIGHT coming out of her TIARA.
                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        What in God’s name is this excremental 
                        mess?

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s a Fellah, an Egyptian slave. It was 
                        a proposal I designed for Egypt, to place 
                        at the head of the Suez Canal.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        And what has an Egyptian slave got to do 
                        with France, with America?

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        More to the point, what the actual heck 
                        is coming out of her face?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Light. It’s a lighthouse AND a statue. 
                        She’s a symbol of the oppressed who...

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Slaves are not a good symbol for America. 

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        They want to forget they had slaves and 
                        did terrible terrible things to them for 
                        hundreds of years.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        Yes. How is a thirty foot high reminder 
                        of American slavery ever a good idea?

                                 FREDERIC
                        It needs some work, I admit.

                        It needs throwing on the fire.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        A statue, a monument, is a shit idea. 

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        An expensive shit idea.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        How would you pay for this giant turd of 
                        a statue?

                                 FREDERIC
                        The usual way, with donations from 
                        wealthy patrons.
                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        We chopped most of their heads off a 
                        hundred years ago. The wealthy are broke. 
                        The whole country is broke. We can’t 
                        afford bread, never mind statues.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I’ll make drawings. I’ll inspire people.

           The group mulls over his words, considering the options. 
           Lots of meaningful looks, then...

                                 INTELLECTUAL #2
                        I still like the flag idea.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #3
                        Flags are cheap.

                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        I have a cousin with a sewing factory.

           EXT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - DAY

           Alone on the back terrace, Frederic downs his wine in 
           one. Laboulaye joins him.

                                 FREDERIC
                        A novelty flag? That’s the best we can 
                        come up with? 

           Laboulaye holds one of Frederic’s sketches.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        How much will this statue cost to build?

                                 FREDERIC
                        A hundred thousand Francs. Maybe more. 
                        Probably more. It’s usually more.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        I’ll make the first donation. 100 Francs.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Great. We have enough to build a very 
                        impressive gnome.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        The great Parisians will believe in the 
                        power of this monument. It will bring 
                        America closer to France. And bring her 
                        wealth with it.
           INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic visits influential men and women to rustle up 
           donations for his statue. He gets the same answer...

                                 RICH AND FAMOUS
                        Non. Non. Non. Non. Non.

           EXT. VICTOR HUGO’S HOUSE, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic KNOCKS on Victor Hugo’s door. The future author 
           of Les Miserables watches him from an upstairs window. 

           A BURLY MAN answers the door.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        Yes?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Frederic Bartholdi, here to discuss 
                        important business with Mr. Hugo.

           He hands the Burly Man a card.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        He’s not at home.

           Frederic looks up at a second floor window, where Victor 
           Hugo stares imperiously down upon him. Their eyes meet. 
           Victor Hugo turns away first. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        He’s upstairs. I just saw him.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        He’s not at home to you. Good night, sir.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Would you pass on a message. Tell Mr. 
                        Hugo that his books are very overrated.

           The Burly Man closes the door in Frederic’s face.

           EXT. PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic heads back to the studio, deflated.

           He passes a ONE ARMED MAN, with no legs, perched in a 
           wheelchair, and rattling a COLLECTION BUCKET.
                                 ONE ARMED MAN
                        Coins for heroes. Help the veterans. 
                        Coins for heroes. 

           Frederic tosses a coin in his bucket and walks on. Then 
           stops in his tracks. And heads back to the One Armed Man.

                                 FREDERIC
                        How long have you been collecting coins?

                                 ONE ARMED MAN
                        Since I got my legs shot off by a 
                        cannonball. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        Today.

                                 ONE ARMED MAN
                        Six hours. 

           His Collection Bucket is a quarter full of small change.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Is that a good amount?

                                 ONE ARMED MAN
                        A bad day, I get five Francs. A good day, 
                        ten.

                                 FREDERIC
                        And if I wanted to collect money, like 
                        this, what would I need?

                                 ONE ARMED MAN
                        Some sort of injury or disfigurement 
                        helps. Other than that, there’s only 
                        three basic requirements: a slogan, a 
                        bucket, and another part of town to 
                        rattle the bucket in. Don’t want you 
                        stepping on my toes.

                                 FREDERIC
                        A slogan. Like Francs for Freedom?

                                 ONE ARMED MAN
                        No. Not like Francs for Freedom. Too 
                        vague. You get nothing for being vague.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Francs for France.
                                 ONE ARMED MAN
                        We’ve got France. It’s all around us. And 
                        nobody gives Francs. It’s coins, mate. 
                        Coins for this. Coins for that. 

           Frederic gives him another coin.

           EXT. PARIS - NEXT DAY

           Various shots around the city with attractive female 
           COLLECTORS who we recognize as models from Frederic’s 
           studio. They call out the mantra...

                                 COLLECTORS
                        Coins for victory. Help France Beat the 
                        British. Coins for victory.

           Frederic and Simon watch as a DISTINGUISHED OLDER MAN 
           approaches the pretty YOUNG LADY Collector.

                                 DISTINGUISHED OLDER MAN
                        Are we at war again?

                                 YOUNG LADY
                        Sort of. A trade war. Fighting for 
                        American business. Winner takes all.

           He drops several coins in her collection bucket. She 
           makes his day with a smile.

           With Frederic...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Imagine this happening, all over Paris, 
                        all over France. 

                                 SIMON
                        I admit, I never had you down as the 
                        patriotic hero of our times. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        I’m not. This isn’t for France. It’s for 
                        Frederic Bartholdi. Think of the 
                        commissions I’ll get if I pull this off?

                                 SIMON
                        Ah, order is restored. Back to good old  
                        self-centred delusion. You work on the 
                        statue. I’ll get to work on the buckets.
           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic sketches several different NUDE MODELS in a 
           range of classical poses. Each drawing is a variation on 
           the idea of a woman holding aloft a LIGHT.

           We see Emilie pose several times, clearly his favorite.

                                 EMILIE
                        What are you going to call this statue?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Liberty Enlightening the World.

           She screws up her face.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        You don’t like it?

                                 EMILIE
                        The thought is right, a woman bringing 
                        understanding and reason to the chaos of 
                        men. But I prefer short names.

                                 FREDERIC
                        A big statue needs a big name.

                                 EMILIE
                        I’d go with Liberty. Just Liberty. And 
                        you might want to rethink the nudity. 

           Off his look...

                                 EMILIE (CONT’D)
                        America is a land of Puritans. The men 
                        don’t like sex. They fear breasts. 
                        Especially big naked ones. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        I have an idea. And I absolutely hate it.

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER...

           We move down from the torch, held aloft by Emilie, to her 
           head ringed by a spiked crown, to her face and that ever 
           so pretty nose, down to the naked sweep of her shoulder, 
           and lower to her breasts...

           Now DRAPED in a Roman-style toga of flowing fabric.

                                 EMILIE
                        Better?
                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s a sacrilege to cover you in anything 
                        but kisses.

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic and Emilie sprawl naked, drunk and asleep, 
           across the studio divan. 

           We approach Frederic from the perspective of his Mother’s 
           shoes, walking up to the divan. 

           She walks on early drawings of the Statue Of Liberty.

           She plucks the burning cigar from his fingers. Then taps 
           the still glowing end against his hand. He JOLTS awake.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Maman!

           She curls a finger to beckon him. He wraps a sheet around 
           himself, covers the sleeping Emilie, and follows his 
           Mother OUT of the Studio - into the ATTACHED HOUSE.

           INT. ATTACHED HOUSE, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic’s Mother stands by the fireplace and gazes up at 
           a stern family portrait.

           In it, she poses with her late husband, her older son 
           Charles as a 4 yr old, and an infant Frederic in her 
           arms. She’s happy in the picture. Happy and loving.

                                 MOTHER
                        That’s how you spend your Laboulaye 
                        commission? On debauchery? Drunken 
                        debauchery?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Is there any other kind?

           Frederic takes a seat at the table.

                                 MOTHER
                        Why can’t you be more like your brother?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Don’t be greedy Mother. You are only 
                        allowed one perfect son. Besides, I 
                        wasn’t born to be a lawyer.
                                 MOTHER
                        You weren’t born to be a failure.

                                 FREDERIC
                        When my Statue of Liberty is built...

                                 MOTHER
                        When. If. Big plans. Big ideas. Meanwhile 
                        your brother builds his fortune with 
                        diligence, sobriety, reality, hard work.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I work hard.

                                 MOTHER
                        You drink hard.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Because it helps me sculpt all the 
                        beauty, bravery, and love into shape.

                                 MOTHER
                        I had high hopes for you, Frederic. Your 
                        father and I had such very high hopes. 

           The anger sags from her little body. She heads to the 
           stairs with an oil lamp. Pauses at the bottom step...

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Today’s dreams are just tomorrow’s 
                        disappointments.

           Frederic looks at the painting, at his Mother holding him 
           as a baby, at how happy she is in the picture.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Look how much you loved me as a baby.

                                 MOTHER
                        That isn’t you. Good night, Frederic.

           Frederic watches her climb the stairs, her lamp 
           disappearing into darkness. He’s hurting inside.

           EXT. PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic, dressed, marches along swigging the dregs of a 
           brandy bottle. Emilie scurries behind, trying to keep up.

                                 EMILIE
                        Where are we going?
                                 FREDERIC
                        To see my brother.

                                 EMILIE
                        But Charles lives in the other direction, 
                        with all the other rich bourgeoisie 
                        fools.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Not that brother.

           Frederic enters a GRAVEYARD. A fog closes in.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic weaves between the headstones. Emilie LOSES him 
           in the fog. We stay with Emilie - searching.

                                 EMILIE
                        Frederic? Wait. You’ll get scared on your 
                        own in here.

           She finds him lying down on top of an ornate SARCOPHAGUS.

                                 EMILIE (CONT’D)
                        You know it’s bad luck to lie on someone 
                        else’s grave.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Then I’m the luckiest man alive. 

           He rolls off. She sees the NAME carved onto the top...

                                 EMILIE
                        Frederic Auguste Bartholdi?

                                 FREDERIC
                        The critics accuse me of not being 
                        original and they’re right. I’m not. 
                        Everyone else is unique. Except me. I 
                        have already been here. 

                                 EMILIE
                        I don’t understand.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I have two older brothers. Charles the 
                        prodigy. And Frederic, the tragedy. He 
                        died aged one. When I was born the next 
                        year, Mother gave me his name. She wanted 
                        me to be everything she hoped the first 
                        Frederic would be. Such very high hopes.
           Emilie wraps her arms around Frederic. Silent tears fall 
           down his face.

                                 EMILIE
                        That’s just really creepy. And unfair. 
                        It’s like she gave you a curse.

                                 FREDERIC
                        No, Emilie. Don’t you see? 

           He strokes the carved letters of his brother’s name...

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be the best of two men. Two 
                        Frederics. It’s not a curse. It’s a 
                        blessing. I’ve already died. What’s the 
                        worst that can happen now? Nothing can 
                        keep Frederic Bartholdi from success.

           He locks Emilie in a long and passionate embrace. We rise 
           from the foggy graveyard...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        As usual, Frederic was about to discover 
                        how very very wrong he could be.

           EXT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic, washed, groomed, and in a clean suit, springs 
           up the steps and raps on the door.

           INT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - DAY

           Laboulaye pours two glasses of wine. As they drink...

                                 LABOULAYE
                        I hear the coin collection is going well. 
                        That you have expanded all across Paris?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Well. But not well enough. Thirty Francs 
                        a day has become twenty, has become ten. 
                        Simon calculates it will take seventeen 
                        years to raise all the money.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        I sense you may have a new plan?

                                 FREDERIC
                        America. It’s rich. It’s the land of big 
                        ideas. I’ll use the money we’ve collected 
                        to buy passage to America. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FREDERIC (CONT'D)
                        There, I’ll find our rich donors. There, 
                        our dream of Liberty will rise. In weeks, 
                        not years.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Frederic, you have all the daring I 
                        sorely wish I could muster. I like this 
                        plan. I know many wealthy Americans. I 
                        shall write you a letter of introduction.

           EXT. CROSS-ATLANTIC STEAMSHIP - DAY

           Frederic and Simon on board a SHIP bound for America. 
           It’s RAINING. And cold. And miserable.

                                 SIMON
                        I hope this weather isn’t an omen.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Of course it’s an omen. It’s a sign we 
                        are sailing to a better place, where the 
                        sun glitters on streets paved with gold.

           Simon does not share Frederic’s enthusiasm. Not one bit.

           INT. CABIN, CROSS-ATLANTIC STEAMSHIP - DAY

           Frederic continues to draft new versions of his Liberty 
           design. He’s not happy with them.

           EXT. CROSS-ATLANTIC STEAMSHIP - DUSK

           Frederic tosses the drawings into the ocean, one by one. 
           Simon approaches...

                                 SIMON
                        Land.

           Frederic gets his first glimpse of America. He holds his 
           remaining drawing up to the setting sun on the horizon.

           He sees a woman holding her baby in the crook of her arm.

           He sees the little islands in the harbor as they approach 
           New York - the abandoned fort on Bedloe’s Island - the 
           tall church spires of Manhattan.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Look at all this space. Look at the size 
                        of it, this America. This... This is 
                        where you dream the biggest of all.
           He turns over a drawing, and starts to sketch on the 
           reverse. Even with these rough lines, we recognize the 
           unforgettable future outline of -

           Liberty.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           Frederic and Simon exit a CHEAP HOTEL, buy pretzels, and 
           join the bustle of the street.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Can you smell it?

                                 SIMON
                        I can smell a lot of things.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Inhale, my friend. Breathe deep. Today, 
                        we fill our lungs with success.

           Simon consults a list of wealthy New Yorkers drafted by 
           Laboulaye.

                                 SIMON
                        First on Laboulaye’s list: JP Morgan.

           INT. JP MORGAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Distinguished. Wealthy. 

           JP MORGAN casts his millionaire eyes over the letter from 
           Laboulaye, and Frederic’s latest sketch of Liberty.

                                 JP MORGAN
                        Love it. How tall did you say?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Forty feet.

                                 JP MORGAN
                        Could she be fifty?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Oh yes.

                                 JP MORGAN
                        Love it even more. Make it a fifty foot 
                        statue and you’ll get a buyer. No doubt 
                        about it. Plenty of rich fellas here.
                                 FREDERIC
                        What about you, sir?

                                 JP MORGAN
                        Don’t love it that much. If I’m going to 
                        build a fifty foot statue, it better have 
                        my face on it. Good luck.

           Frederic looks at the next name on the list: WILLIAM 
           BUCKHOUSE ASTOR.

           INT. ASTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Distinguished. Wealthier.

           WILLIAM ASTOR nods approvingly at the introductory letter 
           and the drawing.

                                 WILLIAM ASTOR
                        I think you should aim higher. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        Sixty feet?

                                 WILLIAM ASTOR
                        Exactly. That kind of ambition gets you 
                        noticed. What’s she holding in the air?

                                 FREDERIC
                        A torch. A symbol of hope.

                                 WILLIAM ASTOR
                        Hope? Hope’s not what this country’s 
                        about. I don’t hope things will turn out 
                        well. I fight like Hell. Astor idea. What 
                        if, picture this, and I think it’s a 
                        significant improvement, what if she’s 
                        holding aloft a musket?

           Off Frederic’s look...

                                 WILLIAM ASTOR (CONT’D)
                        A musket, you’re seeing it too, I can 
                        tell. And here, another Astor idea. She’s 
                        not got a book in her arm.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s a tablet. Like Moses.

                                 WILLIAM ASTOR
                        Book, tablet. Picture instead, she’s got 
                        a chokehold on an Indian. Suddenly, you 
                        get the idea of America.

                        We see what we want, we take it. We take 
                        it all. That’s a statue. Draw me that, 
                        you sonofabitch, and I’ll write you a 
                        sixty foot check. 

           Frederic looks at his list.

           We see Astor’s name being crossed out, along with EVERY 
           other NAME on the list, one by one, until he comes to the 
           final name - VANDERBILT.

           INT. VANDERBILT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Distinguished. Wealthiest.

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Fine idea. Fine fine idea. Fine idea. 
                        Financial disaster. I don’t get richer by 
                        investing in disasters. Tell you what 
                        I’ll do. I’ll give you exactly the same 
                        donation as JP Morgan, not a cent more.

                                 FREDERIC
                        You couldn’t give a cent less.

                                 VANDERBILT
                        As I suspected. It’s the phobia of the 
                        super-rich. When you have nothing, you 
                        risk everything. When you have it all, 
                        you risk nothing. This is a fine drawing, 
                        sir. A fine fine drawing. 

           Vanderbilt peels forty dollars from his billfold and 
           slides them across the table to Frederic.

                                 VANDERBILT (CONT'D)
                        Come back tomorrow and draw my darling 
                        granddaughter’s portrait. That’s how you 
                        make money here. Vanity. Follow the 
                        rainbow of a rich man’s vanity and you’ll

                        America is a beautiful woman. But she’s 
                        chewing tobacco.

                                 SIMON

                        Grover Cleveland, Governor of New York.

                        Not a hope.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Sir, Liberty will grace your harbor. 
                        She’ll be seen by everyone who comes to 
                        your beautiful city. She will be a symbol 
                        of the great bond between our nations. 

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        She would be a symbol of gross stupidity 
                        if I gave you a dime of State funds. If 
                        it’s a bond between nations you want to 
                        symbolize, go shake a tree in Washington 
                        for Federal money. Pass the salt.

           A carriage deposits Frederic and his drawing materials at 
           the steps. A BUTLER ushers him inside.

                        elite were only too happy to welcome the 
                        dashing French artist into their parlors.

           INT. PARLOR, VANDERBILT MANSION - DAY

           The SOUND of a Young Lady in the throes of a passionate 
           embrace. We move from an easel that carries her portrait -

           To a sofa where she enthusiastically RIDES Frederic raw.

           Sated, she collapses against his chest.
                                 YOUNG LADY
                        Did you finish?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Yes. 

                                 YOUNG LADY
                        No. You need to come again tomorrow.

           EXT. HOTEL, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           An undeserving 3 star. Establishing.

           INT. FREDERIC’S ROOM, HOTEL - NIGHT

           Twin beds. A wardrobe. An open window where Simon smokes 
           a pipe. And a desk. 

           There’s something LARGE, about three feet high, on the 
           desk that Simon has covered with a sheet.

           Frederic enters with his drawing materials, and a handful 
           of cash.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Another forty dollars.

                                 SIMON
                        Excellent. Just another 2,493 high 
                        society ladies to lay and you’ll have the 
                        money to build the statue.

           Frederic dumps his gear and the cash on the bed.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I can’t do any more. It’s like they have 
                        never had their portrait drawn before.

                                 SIMON
                        Your poor pencil must be exhausted.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It is being worn into a tiny stub.

                                 SIMON
                        You know New York isn’t the only rich 
                        city. There’s Boston, Philadelphia, 
                        Washington. There’s San Francisco.

                                 FREDERIC
                        And everywhere I show my drawing of 
                        Liberty the rich will say “No”.
                                 SIMON
                        You’re not going to show them a drawing.

           Simon goes to the “something” on the desk, and removes 
           the sheet to reveal -

           A 3 foot high LUMP OF CLAY.

           INT. FREDERIC’S ROOM, HOTEL - DAY

           Frederic works night and day, carving Liberty in clay.

           The face is a perfect likeness of Emilie.

                                 SIMON
                        She’s beautiful.

                                 FREDERIC
                        The most beautiful.

           EXT. STEAM TRAIN, MOVING - DAY

           We move in on a First Class carriage where -

           INT. FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE, STEAM TRAIN - DAY

           The Statue SITS next to Simon, wrapped in a sheet. He has 
           his arm around it.

           Across the table, Frederic writes a letter...

                                 FREDERIC (V.O.)
                        My dear Emilie, How I miss you more each 
                        day. Liberty takes shape. The people of 
                        America are very generous with donations. 
                        I go now to Boston, where I think we will 
                        meet even greater success. Your loving 
                        Frederic.

                                 SIMON
                        Who are you writing to?

                                 FREDERIC
                        My Mother.

                                 SIMON
                        You should write to Laboulaye.

           Frederic seals his letter to Emilie in an envelope with 
           wax and a stamp. Then begins another...
                                 FREDERIC (V.O.)
                        Dear Laboulaye, How I miss you more each 
                        day. Liberty takes shape. The people of 
                        America are very generous with donations.

           EXT. MERCHANT HOUSE, BOSTON - DAY

           Establishing.

                                 FREDERIC (V.O.)
                        The Statue of Liberty will stand sixty 
                        feet high. 

           INT. MERCHANT HOUSE, BOSTON - DAY

           We’re in the office of RICHARD BUTLER, prominent RUBBER 
           BARON. The walls are adorned with enlarged ADVERTISEMENTS 
           for the WONDERS of rubber.

           Shelves heave under his collection of rubber products. 
           This is a proud man. Proud as fuck of rubber.

           But pride of place right now goes to the CLAY MAQUETTE of 
           Liberty standing upon his desk.

                                 SIMON
                        With a pedestal in proportion, Liberty 
                        will be perhaps as much as one hundred 
                        feet tall in total.

           Butler circles the model.

                                 RICHARD BUTLER
                        She’s magnificent. I have several pieces 
                        by French artists in my collection. Not 
                        all the connoisseurs live on Park Avenue, 
                        you know. You say the New Yorkers are 
                        going crazy for this?

                                 FREDERIC
                        They have shown great enthusiasm.

                                 RICHARD BUTLER
                        They should. It’s a work of genius, is 
                        what it is. Artistic genius. You’re a 
                        talented man, sir. I bet your Momma is 
                        proud to have a son like you.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Thank you.
                                 RICHARD BUTLER
                        I don’t piss around the pot, Frederic. I 
                        piss in the pot. I want in on this art, 
                        this monument.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Pardon me? What exactly are you saying?

                                 RICHARD BUTLER
                        I’m saying it clear as can be. I want in. 
                        I want to invest. I’ll put money in. Did 
                        JP put in? Vanderbilt? How much did that 
                        old dog pony up? Five hundred dollars? A 
                        thousand? I’ll give you two.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Two thousand dollars? That’s the most 
                        generous offer we have received so far.

                                 RICHARD BUTLER
                        I knew I’d beat JP. Goddam tightwad is 
                        what he is. And don’t get me started on 
                        Astor. Sixty feet high. Goddam. I have 
                        one question, Frederic, sir.

           Frederic shudders to think what it might be...

                                 RICHARD BUTLER (CONT’D)
                        Have you considered what material you’re 
                        going to make it out of.

           Butler, Frederic, and Simon glance around the room at the 
           overwhelming display of RUBBER...

                                 RICHARD BUTLER (CONT’D)
                        I’m thinking bronze.

           Relief floods Frederic’s face. Butler laughs LOUD and 
           hard. Slaps Frederic on the back.

                                 RICHARD BUTLER (CONT’D)
                        You should have seen your face. A picture 
                        is what it was. 

           He hands out cigars.

                                 RICHARD BUTLER (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, we’re in business. My money is 
                        good. You go challenge the rest of this 
                        great nation to beat it. You’ll get every 
                        damn dollar you need for this beauty. As 
                        God is my witness.
           EXT. STEAM TRAIN, MOVING - NIGHT

           We see CHECKS of various amounts overlaid across the 
           landscape, forming great plains, clouds, and mountains.

           But not many checks. Only eight, to be exact.

           $100, $200, $50. And nothing to match the $2,000 check 
           from Richard Butler, Rubber Baron of Boston.

           INT. DINING CAR, STEAM TRAIN - DAY

           Frederic and Simon dine and drink fine wine. They are 
           overawed by the incredible splendor of America passing by 
           their window.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Everything about America is bigger than I 
                        imagined. The distances. The prairies. 
                        The trees. The mountains.

           He looks down at his plate...

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Even the peas are bigger.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY

           A GOLD BARON points out across a harbor awash with boats, 
           and stabs his finger at an island. His fingers are 
           covered in GOLD RINGS. His waistcoat has GOLD BUTTONS. 
           His teeth are capped in GOLD. He is the Donald Trump of 
           his time.

                                 GOLD BARON
                        That’s Alcatraz Island. Nothing on it 
                        ‘cept birds and bird shit. I look at your 
                        little model of Liberty, and all I see is 
                        grey. I’m not a lover of grey. This is 
                        the city of gold. I make money out of the 
                        desire of poor stupid men to dig my dirt 
                        and search for gold. I’ll build your 
                        statue. I pay for the whole damn thing. 
                        You can give your Boston cheapskate his 
                        money back. I don’t want it. You build 
                        your statue there, on Alcatraz. And you 
                        build it bigger. I want it 75 feet high. 
                        And I want it plated in gold from top to 
                        toe. This statue will be the golden gate 
                        to San Francisco, a symbol of how goddam 
                        rich your life can be if you think like 
                        me and do like me.
                                 SIMON
                        So many people coming to San Francisco.

                                 GOLD BARON
                        We got all creeds here. We got a ship 
                        loaded with hookers from Paris pulled in 
                        just yesterday. You’re going to love it 
                        here. Love it.

                                 FREDERIC
                        A golden statue?

                                 GOLD BARON
                        Top to toe. No other way. Nothing says 
                        success like a giant golden goddess. 

           INT. STEAM TRAIN, MOVING - DAY

           Passing the Rockies again, but in the opposite direction.

           Frederic stares across the table at Simon. Simon stares 
           at Frederic.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Hit me. Slap me. Hard. I want to feel 
                        something.

                                 SIMON
                        I can’t do it.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Please.

           WHAM!

           Simon hits him, hard. Then again with a left. Right, 
           left. Right, left, left.

           Then leans over the table and really starts to PUMMEL 
           Frederic.

           The TICKET INSPECTOR appears by their table and coughs 
           politely for their attention.

                                 INSPECTOR
                        Tickets please.

           Simon stops hitting Frederic. They both straighten their 
           clothing, and show their tickets. 

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, gentlemen.
           He continues down the train. To the unspoken gesture of 
           another passenger he replies...

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT’D)
                        French.

           WITH FREDERIC:

                                 FREDERIC
                        Thank you.

                                 SIMON
                        I enjoyed it.

                                 FREDERIC
                        How much have we raised?

                                 SIMON
                        Minus expenses, $3,216.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Governor Cleveland said the Federal 
                        Government has money for monuments such 
                        as Liberty. 

                                 SIMON
                        Who do you know in the American 
                        Government?

                                 FREDERIC
                        President Grant. Not personally. I know 
                        he’s the President.

           A beat.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        You want to hit me again, don’t you?

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON - DAY

           Rain. Lots of rain.

           Frederic runs through the rain to the GUARD HOUSE.

           Soaked, he knocks on the door.

           A reluctant GUARD slides a panel open.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I have a letter for The President.

                                 GUARD
                        Leave it with me.
                                 FREDERIC
                        Not a letter letter, a letter of 
                        introduction. So that I can talk to him. 
                        I have important news from France.

                                 GUARD
                        He’s not here. You’ll have to come back.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I can wait.

                                 GUARD
                        Very well, sir. It’s the 19th of July 
                        now, and The President is due back on the 
                        1st of September. 

           He slides the panel shut.

           Frederic knocks again. The guard slides the panel open.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Where did he go?

           EXT. VIRGINIA COAST - DAY

           An idyllic SUMMER HOUSE sits high on a bluff overlooking 
           the ocean. A white picket fence surrounds the property.

           On the covered porch, PRESIDENT ULYSSES S GRANT sits in a 
           rocker wearing a fine summer suit and smoking a cigar. 

           Several MILITARY MEN keep him company. A SERVANT pours 
           lemonade. There’s laughter and anecdotes. One man has a 
           cherished RIFLE. There are NICKS along the barrel.

                                 MILITARY MAN
                        Every mark is a Johnny Reb, whistling 
                        Dixie in Hell.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                        Now now, sir. The dead on both sides gave 
                        their lives for the greater glory of God 
                        and the United States.

                                 MILITARY MAN
                        Amen, Mr. President.

           Something catches President Grant’s eye - a MAN climbing 
           the fence at the bottom of the bluff, and waving his HAT.

           It’s Frederic.
                                 SERVANT
                        Are you expecting visitors, sir?

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                        None that don’t know how to use a gate.

           The Military Man lines up a shot...

                                 MILITARY MAN
                        Permission to wish him a warm welcome, 
                        sir?

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                        Permission granted.

           The Military Man SHOOTS. The HAT flies out of Frederic’s 
           grasp. He retrieves it. Puts it on his head. And 
           advances, hands HELD HIGH. 

           As he nears the covered porch...

                                 MILITARY MAN
                        That’s close enough. State your name and 
                        your business, sir.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Frederic Bartholdi, artist, sculptor, 
                        Ambassador of France. I come with an 
                        important message for President Grant.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                        Are you carrying a weapon?

                                 FREDERIC
                        My only weapons are determination, and an 
                        incredible idea.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                        The determination I’ve seen. What’s this 
                        idea?

           LATER...

           Cigar ASH drops onto the drawing of Liberty. Grant 
           brushes it off.

           Wider, President Grant and Frederic drink brandy together 
           on the porch.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Passing a Bill to pay for this will take 
                        a sight more than determination. Years 
                        will go by. Presidents will go by. Stand.
           Frederic stands with the President. Grant SALUTES a 
           passing SHIP. The ship returns the salute by FIRING a 
           cannon.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT (CONT’D)
                        I like a house that faces the ships as 
                        they go by. Coffee from Brazil. Lumber 
                        from Panama. Cotton from Georgia. 

           They sit back down.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what I can do for you...

           EXT. DOCKS, NEW YORK - DAY

           Frederic and Simon SHAKE HANDS with Rubber Baron Richard 
           Butler, and a new character - architect RICHARD HUNT. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s 1871. The United States has over 40 
                        million people. And how many of these 
                        wonderful Americans have donated towards 
                        the Statue of Liberty? Eight. Eight 
                        people in the entire United States.

           Frederic and Simon head on up the gangplank to their 
           waiting cross-atlantic Steam Ship.

                                 RICHARD BUTLER
                        Bon voyage, mes amis!

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That’s Richard Butler, aka Mr. Rubber, 
                        saying goodbye, with society architect 
                        Dick Hunt. Not a made up name. Dick has 
                        agreed to design the plinth that Liberty 
                        will stand on. And Butler will collect 
                        donations to pay for said plinth. Yes. 
                        Good luck with that.

           EXT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - NIGHT

           Laboulaye greets Frederic on the steps like a long lost 
           son. They embrace warmly.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Any sane person would describe Frederic’s 
                        fund-raising trip to America as a 
                        disaster. Frederic, however, has a 
                        different spin on events.
                                 FREDERIC
                        Big success!

                                 LABOULAYE
                        How big?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Bigger than you can imagine.

           INT. LABOULAYE MANSION, PARIS - NIGHT

           Over dinner, Frederic recounts his biggest victory...

                                 FREDERIC
                        That’s when it came to me. We don’t just 
                        build a big statue. We build the biggest. 
                        The biggest statue in the World.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        What did he say?

                                 FREDERIC
                        He said fantastic. He gave his personal 
                        approval to my designs - and this...

           Frederic hands Laboulaye a letter...

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        The official support of The United States 
                        Government. And the use of an island in 
                        New York Harbor. The perfect location. 
                        Perfect. I went to find benefactors in 
                        America, I return with President Ulysses 
                        S. Grant, Bedloe’s Island, and thousands 
                        of dollars.

           Off Laboulaye’s inquiring look...

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Well, three and a bit thousand dollars. 

                                 LABOULAYE
                        We have far more than that. We have been 
                        collecting coins from Calais to Cannes. 
                        The tide turns, my visionary friend.

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, BACK STREET, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic and Simon light oil lamps to reveal -

           BUCKETS FULL OF COINS all over his studio floor.
                                 SIMON
                        How much do we have?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Enough to begin.

           EXT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           A dour factory in an industrialized area, by the river.

                                 FREDERIC (PRELAP)
                        Gentlemen of Gaget Gauthier...

           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           A VAST hangar-like space. There are casts for BELLS, 
           church steeples, bridge pieces, a park fountain, and huge 
           municipal ornaments. Big stuff. Big heavy stuff.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I’m proud to contract this esteemed 
                        company to build the greatest statue ever 
                        conceived.

           Frederic paces before a gathering of tough-looking 
           artisans. Craftsmen with gnarled faces, gnarled hands, 
           and biceps of steel. These men eat nails for breakfast. 
           They could not be less impressed.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Liberty stands just three feet tall 
                        at the moment. 

           His only props are enthusiasm, and his clay maquette of 
           Liberty. The model looks like an insignificant miniature.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        But when we are done, she will rise above 
                        the rooftops. She will gaze proudly from 
                        her full height of 111 feet, with her 
                        torch held aloft a further 40 feet.

           The craftsmen seem more like a line of rugby players. 
           Their foreman is HENRI LEBOEUF. 

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        150 feet of bronze? 

           He starts to laugh. And his men laugh with him. 
           It’s the same ridicule Frederic got in that muddy field, 
           facing down the German War Machine alone with nothing 
           more than a broken sword.

                                 FREDERIC
                        We’ll use a repoussee technique. Thin 
                        copper sheets riveted onto a skeletal 
                        frame of iron. I predict we will need 
                        three or four interim scale models to 
                        work from. Eventually creating a full 
                        scale plaster mould, from which we can 
                        shape the copper skin. This will then be 
                        riveted onto a rigid iron support 
                        skeleton, strong enough to withstand the 
                        force of a hurricane.

           The laughing has been replaced by a modicum of respect.

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        There’s only one man capable of designing 
                        such an iron skeleton.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Yes, Eugene Viollet-Du-Lac.

           Frederic produces a ROLLED UP BLUEPRINT of Liberty AND 
           its iron skeleton which he lays out - a highly developed 
           design for the framework.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        As you can see, he has included an 
                        ingenious pier in his initial design. The 
                        arm is proving a challenge, wind 
                        pressure, load bearing, compression and 
                        expansion in heat and cold. But Mr. Du 
                        Lac assures me he will have the solution 
                        within days.

           Now the craftsmen are impressed.

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        You seem to have thought of everything.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Concerning the construction of Liberty, 
                        there is nothing I have not considered.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        You’re probably noticing a recurring 
                        theme in this story. Just when Frederic 
                        appears to have the whole thing worked 
                        out...
           INT. DU-LAC’S BEDROOM, PARIS - DAY

           Complex technical drawings cover the walls.

           A PRIEST and some DOUR FAMILY MEMBERS stand by the bed, 
           mournful. DU-LAC lies on the bed, eyes closed. Pale. Very 
           pale. And not breathing.

           We HEAR the SOUND of FEET RUSHING UP THE STAIRS. Frederic 
           enters, out of breath. Off his look...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Is he asleep? 

                                 PRIEST
                        No. Mr Du-Lac is dead.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Are you sure?

           A Dour Family Member offers Frederic a DRAWING.

                                 DOUR FAMILY MEMBER
                        He left you this.

           Frederic checks the drawing, eager for good news.

           The drawing has a BLANK SPACE and a QUESTION MARK where 
           the framework for the raised arm of Liberty should be.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Thank you. My deepest condolences.

           He exits. Through the closed door, the Priest and the 
           Dour Family Members HEAR Frederic YELL to vent his pain.

           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic admires the first “upscaled” maquette of Liberty 
           the artisans have crafted. It stands eight feet tall.

                                 FREDERIC
                        She’s beautiful.

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        Yes. Every man here wants to fuck her.

                                 FREDERIC
                        What? Wait. This is Liberty. You can’t 
                        fuck Liberty.
                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        But that face. She looks like she just 
                        got fucked. Very sexy.

           His artisans murmur their approval.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Sexy is a problem.

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        Sexy is not the problem. No engineering 
                        plans for the framework is the problem. 
                        Bad enough you want to build the biggest 
                        monument in the world. Worse that you 
                        have her with this arm - all out of 
                        balance. 

           On cue, the ARM of the 8ft maquette - FALLS OFF. Simon 
           raises an eyebrow. Nothing need be said.

           A small EARNEST YOUNG MAN circles the maquette. Frederic 
           and Henri share a look - who is this? He introduces 
           himself in a very socially awkward manner. He exudes 
           incompetence.

                                 EIFFEL
                        Gustave Eiffel. I heard you were looking 
                        for an engineer.

           Shakes hands in a limp and unsettling way with Frederic.

                                 EIFFEL (CONT’D)
                        I design bridges.

           EXT. EIFFEL’S STUDIO, PARIS - NIGHT

           Gaslamps. Fog. 

           Lights on inside a rooftop GARRET - Eiffel’s Studio.

           Simon stands on the street outside, smoking a pipe, 
           reading a newspaper.

           INT. EIFFEL’S STUDIO, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic admires some of Eiffel’s SPEC designs pinned to 
           the walls. Intricate and highly detailed drawings with 
           all kinds of measurements scribbled around them to 
           explain various load bearing abilities and pressures.

                                 FREDERIC
                        What’s this?
           He’s looking at a drawing of what will one day become THE 
           EIFFEL TOWER.

                                 EIFFEL
                        An idea. A monument for Paris. I can 
                        build it. I just have to convince 
                        everybody else it’s possible.

                                 FREDERIC
                        And what of Liberty, holding her torch 
                        aloft to enlighten the world. Every other 
                        engineer in Paris says it’s impossible.

                                 EIFFEL
                        That’s what they all say about my Tower. 
                        And they’re right. Till I make it 
                        possible. Then they’re wrong. 

           He smiles. Frederic smiles. A kindred spirit.

                                 EIFFEL (CONT’D)
                        The question isn’t how so much as why? 
                        Why put yourself through the pain, the 
                        negativity, the ridicule? Why subject 
                        yourself to the constant judgement and 
                        dismissal of others? It starts off as 
                        ego, I know. I’ve been through that. But 
                        now it’s at another stage. Are you OK 
                        with heights? You’re building a 150ft 
                        statue, of course you’re OK with heights. 
                        Come on.

           Eiffel leads Frederic to rickety STAIRS, and climbs up 
           through a skylight to...

           EXT. ROOF, EIFFEL’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           A far reaching view of the blanket of fog.

                                 EIFFEL
                        I come up here and imagine it’s like 
                        heaven. And what do we see of the work of 
                        all those men and women below? Nothing. 
                        My Tower is just the beginning. A proof 
                        of concept. One day, all buildings will 
                        be built this way. Upwards. To heaven. 
                        But first, I must show how to do it. How 
                        to reach heaven. Some men want to get 
                        there with prayers. We, my friend, will 
                        get there with our monuments.

           They embrace.
                                 FREDERIC
                        I leave the arm of Liberty in your 
                        trusted hands. I must save her face.

           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - NIGHT

           By moonlight, Frederic stands atop a step-ladder and uses 
           a CHEESEWIRE to SEVER the head from the 8ft maquette of 
           Liberty. He DROPS the incredibly heavy head. It face-
           plants into the floor. Simon raises another eyebrow.

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic resculpts the head of Liberty.

           But he’s struggling for inspiration.

           Simon brings drawings Frederic has made of various 
           models. But they all have one thing in common - beauty.

           Frederic tears the drawings into pieces and throws them 
           in the air. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        No. No. No. No. No. No to Marie. No to 
                        Virginie. No to Colette, to Agnes, to 
                        Agathe, to all the beautiful girls I have 
                        known. No. No. No. 

           The paper pieces fall like snow. And reveal his Mother, 
           standing in the darkened doorway. She shakes her head, 
           judging him, and finding him wanting. She leaves.

           And Frederic has his inspiration...

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Liberty is freedom. And freedom comes at 
                        a price, with sacrifice, with pain. She’s 
                        not a lover. Freedom is a bitch.

           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Angle from behind Frederic at the top of the ladder as he 
           SECURES the new HEAD of Liberty in place.

           The artisans gather below, and murmur their disapproval 
           of the new design.

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        No way do I want sex with her.
                                 FREDERIC
                        Good. Then she is perfect.

           We reveal that Liberty now has the face of Frederic’s 
           MOTHER.

           We HOLD on this 8ft model with Frederic alongside it as 
           it becomes a 30ft model -

           Then a 60ft model -

           Then a FULL SIZED FOOT of Liberty.

           The foot is made of PLASTER, with a wooden frame for 
           support.

           EXT. RIVER SEINE, PARIS - DAY

           Summer. Frederic sails a little boat with Emilie as his 
           delighted passenger. They picnic on the water: wine, 
           grapes, bread, cheese, kisses, and more.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Of course, all this took time. All the 
                        coins being collected around the country 
                        went to a building fund to pay for 
                        construction. And Frederic earned his own 
                        crust with commissions. Many from 
                        American admirers.

                        Usually covered in pigeons. And shit.

                        A magnificent monument to the one and

                        Germans.
           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           The ENTIRE vast workshop is filled with FULL-SIZE PIECES 
           of Liberty, each with a group of artisans crafting her 
           shape according to Frederic’s design and direction.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Building the World’s biggest statue takes 
                        a lot of money, a lot time, a lot of 
                        people, and a lot of money. Did I mention 
                        the money? You need a lot of it. 

           The torch over here.

           The tablet over there.

           Giants fold of Liberty’s dress.

           And over in the corner...

           Liberty’s HEAD - huge and regal and utterly magnificent.

           We note that everyone is covered in white plaster. 
           Frederic and the artisans look like GHOSTS.

           Emilie WHEELS a trolley through the workshop, piled with 
           PIES and bottles of BEER. She is an angel of respite.

           Frederic PHOTOGRAPHS her with different sections of the 
           statue. She enters an office and exits in workman’s 
           overalls.

           She helps Frederic carving a finger, her finger made the 
           size of a giant’s.

           EXT. COURTYARD, GAGET GAUTHIER & CO - DAY

           Frederic and Emilie exit the workshop and head into the 
           open courtyard behind.

           This backs onto the river. The city crowds around on all 
           sides with tenement blocks of four or five floors.

           The Courtyard is strewn with IRON GIRDERS.

           Where the artisans inside are uniformly WHITE, out here, 
           the men are black from grease and iron dust.

           Under the direction of the awkward Eiffel, they are 
           bolting together the incredible internal iron skeleton of 
           Liberty.

           Already, the framework rises over 60 feet high -
           Higher than any surrounding rooftop.

                                 EMILIE
                        Have you reached Heaven yet?

                                 EIFFEL
                        Half way.

           Together, they CLIMB the skeleton of Liberty, and stand 
           on the highest crossbeam for a spectacular view of the 
           industrial area below.

           Frederic realizes he can see one house in particular.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Look, over there. Follow my finger. The 
                        third window from the end. Do you know 
                        whose window that is?

           INT. ROOF WINDOW, VICTOR HUGO’S HOUSE - DAY

           Victor Hugo looks out towards the river, and the 
           workshops beyond it. He sees the strange iron-girder 
           framework rising above the rooftops.

           And three figures upon the crossbeam.

           He reaches for his TELESCOPE.

           HIS POV: Through the telescope...

           Of Frederic and Emilie and Eiffel bending over - BARING 
           THEIR BACKSIDES at him.

           BACK TO THE SCENE:

           Hugo snaps his telescope shut. And draws the curtains.

           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic and Simon inspect all the work in progress. The 
           workshop is a hive of activity with almost 100 men busy 
           building some aspect of the full-size model.

           Plaster mixers, gauze wrappers, bucket haulers, master 
           plasterers, buffers, carpenters, riggers.

           A calendar marks off the weeks, the months, the years of 
           toil and craft. Laboulaye has a little table with a CASH 
           BOX and pays the workers’ wages.
           We see Frederic astride the HAND of Liberty, giving her a 
           giant manicure. Even when everyone else has gone home, 
           Frederic stays. And mostly, Simon stays too.

           Drinking with the workmen in the local tavern. Singing 
           songs around the piano. 

           Carving the detail of an EYE.

           Laboulaye pays the wages.

           Frederic works on a high scaffold - carving the SPIKES of 
           Liberty’s crown. The scaffold COLLAPSES. Frederic crashes 
           to the workshop floor.

           Frederic sits in a clawfoot bath whilst Emilie bathes the 
           cuts and bruises of his hands and body. Liberty is taking 
           her toll upon him, her pound of flesh.

           Bandaged, he helps the men chisel the inscription on 
           Liberty’s tablet.

           Forming a CHAIN on her foot. Emilie poses for some ankle 
           details. Frederic presents her with a bouquet of delicate 
           PLASTER ROSES.

           The mood is buoyant and happy. So happy. A palpable sense 
           they are making something VERY SIGNIFICANT. 

           Frederic tours the various pieces - now all fully formed 
           and PERFECT in every way. Henri wraps a big bear arm 
           around his shoulders.

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        The crazy dream comes true my friend. The 
                        craziest dream comes true.

           INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

           CAN CAN DANCERS on stage, bawdy atmosphere, beer and 
           wine, music and song, Frederic and Simon and all these 
           amazing artisans at the end of another great week.

           Everybody LOVES Frederic. 

           He wants to stay and bask in this moment forever but -

           Laboulaye wants a word. Hard to read his expression. 
           Somewhere between concern and dread would be a good 
           guess. He follows Laboulaye and Simon outside...
           EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

           Away from the music...

                                 FREDERIC
                        I know that face. My uncle wore it when 
                        he told me my father had died. Is it my 
                        Mother?

                                 LABOULAYE
                        No. Your Mother is fine.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Then what?

                                 LABOULAYE
                        We have a problem. A cash-flow problem.

           Off Frederic’s look...

                                 SIMON
                        The cash has stopped flowing.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Donations towards the build costs have 
                        dropped, considerably.

                                 SIMON
                        Stopped would be more accurate.

                                 FREDERIC
                        But we’ve finished the full-scale model. 
                        And Eiffel has completed the frame. We 
                        only have to add the copper skin.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        It’s the most expensive part.

                                 SIMON
                        One hundred tons of copper.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        At a thousand Francs per ton.

                                 SIMON
                        A hundred thousand Francs.

                                 FREDERIC
                        How much do we have left?

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Twenty thousand Francs.
                                 SIMON
                        We could take her as far as the knees, I 
                        would think.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        I hoped we wouldn’t fall quite so short. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        Such high hopes.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        It’s difficult to maintain public 
                        interest when there was so little to 
                        begin with.

                                 FREDERIC
                        What do we do?

                                 LABOULAYE
                        There is nothing more we can do.

                                 SIMON
                        You dreamed big, Frederic. Perhaps too 
                        big.

                                 FREDERIC
                        If you don’t dream big, there’s no point 
                        in dreaming.

           Frederic, covered in white plaster, a ghost of a man - 
           slowly walks away into the night.

           EXT. PARIS - NIGHT

           We watch Frederic walk home in a daze of disappointment.

           He is a spectral figure. Alone, and broken.

           EXT. VICTOR HUGO’S HOUSE, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic pauses in front of Victor Hugo’s house.

           He sees the old man pacing in his parlor, to and fro, to 
           and fro.

           Hugo, inside, senses Frederic, outside.

           He turns. And their eyes meet.

           Exhausted, Frederic just stands there holding Hugo’s gaze 
           as it starts to rain. 
           The rain washes the plaster away from Frederic’s face and 
           hair and clothes. 

           Hugo closes his drapes. Frederic continues home...

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic takes a walking stick and ATTACKS the 8ft clay 
           maquette of Liberty.

           He SCREAMS abuse at her, vents his rage and frustration.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Four years! Four years! Four years! I 
                        give you everything! I want it back! You 
                        kill me. 

           The clay maquette is blitzed to pieces.

           Frederic collapses in the debris.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        You kill me.

           In the doorway, his Mother watches. Impassive. Unmoved.

           She turns from his pain. It’s enough to break a heart of 
           stone. But not hers. 

           INT. MOTHER’S PRIVATE QUARTERS, ATTACHED HOUSE - NIGHT

           His Mother composes a letter. We hear her thoughts and 
           concerns as she writes...

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        My darling Charles, I fear for the sanity 
                        of your brother. This ridiculous statue 
                        he builds drains his finances, his time, 
                        his chances of finding a decent wife, and 
                        his mental stability. As I write, he lies 
                        drunk in his studio, crying like a baby, 
                        and wailing to a broken statue. It might 
                        be time to have the doctors commit him to 
                        the asylum. Lord knows it would be a 
                        blessed relief to the poor tortured man. 
                        Of course, there will be social 
                        embarrassment. But we shall endure. We 
                        have that strength. I shouldn’t burden 
                        you. I know you are busy. You continue to 
                        be the only sunshine in my life. Your 
                        devoted Mother.
           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic sleeps on the floor amid the debris of his 
           attack on the 8ft maquette of Liberty.

           Wider, we see his brother Charles, looking down on him. 
           Charles seems unwell. Dark eyes. Gaunt. He prods Frederic 
           with his boot.

           Frederic wakes. He sees the dismembered HAND of Liberty 
           before him, holding the torch.

                                 CHARLES
                        Mother’s worried about you.

                                 FREDERIC
                        She hides it well.

                                 CHARLES
                        I’m worried about you.

                                 FREDERIC
                        You don’t look so good.

                                 CHARLES
                        Too much work. Too little sleep.

           He reaches down to help Frederic up from the floor.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Here. Take my hand.

           Frederic stares at that dismembered hand of Liberty. And 
           takes a hold of that instead.

                                 FREDERIC
                        No. I won’t take your hand. I’ll take 
                        hers.

           He gets up. And RUSHES for the door.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take hers.

           Charles turns to the darkened door that leads to the 
           Attached House, where their Mother watches from the 
           shadows, as is her creepy modus operandi.

                                 CHARLES
                        Mad as a brush.

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh Charles, he is lost to us.
           EXT. ST GERMAIN, PARIS - DAY

           A poorer district. Row houses. This is where the workers 
           and immigrants live.

           Frederic RAPS on a door. Henri Leboeuf, the foreman of 
           the artisans who were building Liberty, answers.

           His face has the scowl of thunder. A small child hugs his 
           legs. Small and hungry.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I have an idea.

                                 HENRI LEBOEUF
                        Your last one didn’t work out so good.

           He shows Henri the severed hand of Liberty holding the 
           torch.

                                 FREDERIC
                        What do you think?

           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Henri has gathered a core group of artisans. Laboulaye, 
           Simon, and Emilie watch Frederic explain his idea.

                                 FREDERIC
                        We cannot afford to build Liberty without 
                        more donations. We cannot get more 
                        donations without igniting public 
                        excitement once again. We have enough 
                        money left to build her as far as the 
                        knees, but the lower half of a lady’s 
                        dress is hardly the stuff of dreams, of 
                        imagination, of inspiration. If we can 
                        only afford to build one part, let it be 
                        this.

           He holds the hand of Liberty aloft.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        And it will be a beacon of what is to 
                        come. 

           Simon whispers to Emilie...

                                 SIMON
                        I think his Mother might be right.

           Emilie kicks him in the ankle.
           EXT. MERCHANT SHIP, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           A massive tarpaulin shrouded shape sits on deck amid 
           container crates and other goods.

           EXT. EXPO GARDENS, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

           A morning mist across the Expo Gardens.

           Exhibitors prepare their stalls and displays.

           But most of the attention is being drawn by the 
           remarkable and surreal object seemingly thrusting from 
           the very lawns of the park -

           A HUGE COPPER HAND - almost 30ft high.

           The hand of Liberty, holding her beacon of light proudly 
           aloft for all to see, far and wide.

           We move closer and see Frederic is INSIDE the torch, high 
           above the gathering crowd.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, the opportunity of 
                        a lifetime, your chance to view the 
                        wonders of this Philadelphia Expo from 
                        the privileged perch of Liberty’s torch. 
                        All for the very reasonable admission 
                        price of just 50 cents.

           An increasing flurry of hands deposit COINS into the slot 
           of a collection bucket. We follow one hand onwards and -

           INTO Liberty’s hand -

           Up a dark spiral staircase with other paying customers -

           Higher, higher, higher -

           Then OUT to the light of the VIEWING GALLERY at the top 
           of the torch to see -

           The huge crowds pushing to climb up to this place -

           The SUN climbing over the Expo Gardens -

           The SMILE widening across Frederic’s face.
           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic opens a suitcase of CASH to LOUD APPLAUSE from 
           all the artisans. Emilie throws wads of bank notes in the 
           air and makes it rain cash. 

           Laboulaye claps him on the back. Henri shakes his hand. 
           Simon nods, knowing he was wrong to doubt his friend.

           LATER...

           The craftsmen create the HEAD of Liberty.

           EXT. EXPO, PARIS - DAY

           We now move in through the ENTRANCE for the Paris Expo -

           Following excited children as they run to where -

           The GIANT COPPER HEAD of Liberty rises from the lawns -

           Surrounded by amazed patrons to the Expo.

           A PHOTOGRAPHER, covered by a black cloth, takes pictures 
           of members of the public standing and smiling, dwarfed by 
           Liberty’s unsmiling face.

           His SIGN offers a photograph for TEN FRANCS. There is an 
           ENDLESS LINE of people waiting for their shot.

           The FLASH-BULB pops. The photographer throws back the 
           black cloth and ushers the next paying poser forward.

           We reveal that the Photographer is Frederic.

           More shots. Even his brother Charles has his picture 
           taken. Then Frederic takes the Ten Franc note from 
           another man we recognize...

           The now former President Grant.

           Grant ADMIRES the incredible Head of Liberty, the 
           pristine copper construction gleaming in the sunlight.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                        I thought you were crazy before. Now that 
                        I see how big this lady is going to be, I 
                        have to admit - I was wrong. You are much 
                        crazier than I could ever have imagined. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        Thank you, I think.
                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                        This is quite the memorial.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I don’t make a memorial, sir. I make an 
                        unforgettable.

           Frederic hands over photography duties to Simon.

           LATER...

           At an outdoor cafe with a view of Liberty’s head...

           Frederic wines and dines with Laboulaye. Nearby, Emilie 
           mixes with friends, and STOUT MAN.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Do you know Emilie’s friends? I hear they 
                        are political. Some, I have heard, are 
                        prostitutes. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        You’ve heard, or you know for sure?

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Frederic, please, at my age? The only 
                        part of my body with any rigidity is my 
                        walking stick.

                                 FREDERIC
                        They want to vote. They want equal pay. 
                        They want the right to decide their own 
                        future, not men.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        It must be difficult, having two such 
                        beautiful strong ladies in your life.

                                 FREDERIC
                        You can say what you’re thinking.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        You’ve been together many years. A woman 
                        thinks of marriage after much less time.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Not this one. She has bigger things on 
                        her mind than bouquets. Besides, I’m 
                        trying to find the right moment to 
                        discuss it with my Mother.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        When would be the right moment?
                                 FREDERIC
                        When she’s dead, would make sense. I have 
                        enough money saved to rent a nice house, 
                        or buy more copper.

                                 LABOULAYE
                        Emilie gives. Liberty takes.

                                 FREDERIC
                        We’ll raise the money. We’ll finish this. 
                        Then Emilie will have me all to herself. 

                                 LABOULAYE
                        By the end of the Expo we will have 
                        enough to complete over half of Liberty.

                                 FREDERIC
                        And there’s another Expo in London next 
                        month. Then Brussels. And...

           They are interrupted by Emilie as she brings over the 
           STOUT and serious man. He has a bulldog face and a too-
           tight collar. He’s carrying a small, but heavy, BOX.

                                 EMILIE
                        Frederic, might I introduce Mr Eugene 
                        Secretan. He’s a “friend” of a friend.

           Laboulaye and Frederic share a look.

                                 EMILIE (CONT’D)
                        We were just discussing business and it 
                        seems Mr Secretan has a very interesting 
                        surplus to discuss.

                                 SECRETAN
                        I’m not a fancy man, Mr Bartholdi. Not 
                        one for Paris Balls or haute cuisine. I 
                        buy nice things with my money. Paintings. 
                        I like paintings. And I like what you’ve 
                        made, over there, Liberty.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Partially made.

                                 SECRETAN
                        Yes. Partially. So I’ll get to the point. 

           He opens the box to reveal a CUBE of SOLID COPPER.

                                 SECRETAN (CONT’D)
                        I came here looking for you. I make 
                        copper. I make money making copper. A lot 
                        of copper. A lot of money. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SECRETAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s a kilo there. It’s yours. But it’s 
                        not much good for building the rest of 
                        your Ladyship, is it? No. So where that 
                        kilo came from, there’s another 60,000.

                                 FREDERIC
                        We don’t have the money to buy 60,000 
                        kilos of your copper, sir.

                                 SECRETAN
                        I don’t want your money.

           Off Frederic’s stunned look...

                                 SECRETAN (CONT’D)
                        I want your address.

                                 EMILIE
                        You can kiss him. I’ll allow it.

           Frederic showers kisses upon Mr Secretan. So very happy.

           EXT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Delivery carts pulled by huge Drayhorses arrive at the 
           yard hauling carts heavy laden with COPPER.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Never underestimate the potential of a 
                        Fairy Godmother to suddenly appear...

           The sides of the carts bear the name of SECRETAN. 
           Frederic kisses each and every Drayhorse on the muzzle.

           In the b/g, we can see the towering internal iron 
           skeleton of Liberty, built by Eiffel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And get you that new dress you always 
                        wanted for the party.

           INT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           We see the thin copper SKIN of Liberty being shaped 
           against all those incredible full-size plaster molds. 

           EXT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Time-lapse of those copper skin pieces being attached to 
           the iron skeleton over the course of the next few weeks.
           Slowly, the shape and figure of Liberty becomes clear as 
           the copper skin rises from her feet -

           Up the folds of her dress to her waist -

           And beyond to her arm that cradles the tablet -

           All the way up to shoulder height.

           She’s already TALLER than any building in Paris. 

           And as day turns to night, little lights form a PATH 
           through the yard to the foot of Liberty.

           WAITERS carry silver trays of food and wine to where -

           A doorway leads INSIDE the statue.

           INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY, PARIS - NIGHT

           We can HEAR a PARTY in progress. 

           We climb with the waiter up hundreds of steps to a WIDE 
           PLATFORM where there’s a long dining table with forty 
           seated GUESTS, food, wine and laughter.

           Frederic and Emilie hold court. Many of her “female 
           friends” mingle with the wealthy male guests.

           The views of Paris from this astonishing height are to 
           die for. Those lucky enough to have been invited gaze out 
           over the incomplete shoulders of Liberty.

           We recognize several of the guests as men who rebuffed 
           the initial request for donations from Frederic many 
           years ago, several of the intellectuals who mocked his 
           idea, and many of the MODELS who graced his studio.

           Simon feels fifty years younger thanks to the gorgeous 
           young lady adorning his lap.

           There are entertainers, musicians, a lady on stilts 
           dressed as Liberty. Frederic knows how to throw a party.

           Emilie taps her knife against her glass for attention...

                                 EMILIE
                        Gentlemen, we gather here to celebrate 
                        this great achievement so far, and ensure 
                        its completion. Yes, this is the part of 
                        the evening where you realize there is no 
                        such thing as a free dinner.
                                 INTELLECTUAL #1
                        They hold us to ransom.

                                 FREDERIC
                        We cannot hold you to ransom. Instead, we 
                        offer two ways down from the party.

           Emilie points to the stairs...

                                 EMILIE
                        The expensive interior route.

           Frederic points over the side of Liberty’s shoulders...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Or the cheap way down, on the exterior.

           Laughter from their guests.

                                 EMILIE
                        Not joking. We need 50,000 more.

           A Waiter approaches Frederic and whispers in his ear. 

           Emilie sees the concern spread over Frederic’s face.

           Frederic rushes to the stairs. Emilie runs after him.

           EXT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic races to a waiting carriage. Calls up to the 
           driver...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Place du Libertine.

           And jumps into the cabin. The driver whips the horses. 
           The carriage speeds off. Frederic hauls Emilie inside the 
           moving carriage.

           EXT. PLACE DU LIBERTINE, PARIS - NIGHT

           Charles is dragged from his house by a pair of burly 
           hospital PORTERS. He’s naked apart from the rouge on his 
           cheeks, a corset, and a pair of ladies’ stockings.

           A Porter covers Charles’ man-parts with his CAP. His poor 
           WIFE sobs on the step. His children sob into her dress.

           A carriage arrives. Frederic and Emilie jump out...
                                 FREDERIC
                        Charles!

                                 CHARLES
                        Let them eat cake! Let them eat cake!

                                 FREDERIC
                        Stop! 

                                 EMILIE
                        What are you doing with him?

           The Porters bustle Charles towards an AMBULANCE

                                 PORTERS
                        Doctor’s orders, Miss. It’s the Asylum 
                        for Mr Bartholdi. And don’t worry sir, 
                        plenty of room for you too.

           The laughing Porters bundle Charles into shackles and a 
           straight-jacket, then into the ambulance.

           Frederic and Emilie follow Charles’ wife indoors.

           INT. CHARLES’ HOUSE, PLACE DU LIBERTINE - NIGHT

           Frederic and Emilie pause at the threshold. It’s dark 
           inside. Dark and uninviting.

                                 EMILIE
                        I thought it would be much nicer.

                                 FREDERIC
                        The last time I came here it was.

                                 EMILIE
                        How long ago?

                                 FREDERIC
                        Ten years.

           As they are drawn slowly to the sound of sobbing inside, 
           they find the house is almost completely EMPTY of 
           material possessions. No carpets. No paintings. No 
           furniture. No ornaments. Nothing.

                                 EMILIE
                        Isn’t he supposed to be rich and 
                        successful?

                                 FREDERIC
                        I don’t understand it.
           They find Charles’ wife huddled by the fire in the back 
           parlor. This is a scene of despair.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

                                 WIFE
                        Opium happened. And whores. Lots of 
                        whores. And gambling. There’s nothing 
                        left. It’s all gone. God help us.

           INT. ATTACHED HOUSE, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic sits with his Mother, Emilie, and two BAILIFFS 
           at the kitchen table.

                                 BAILIFF
                        Charles owes tens of thousands of Francs 
                        in gambling debts. Though he’s been 
                        locked in an asylum, those debts don’t 
                        just disappear. They remain with the 
                        family. They’re all yours. And you have 
                        thirty days to pay.

                                 FREDERIC
                        That’s insane. 

                                 BAILIFF
                        That’s the Law.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Then put the Law in an asylum too.

           The Bailiffs leave a sheaf of official documents on the 
           table and exit.

                                 MOTHER
                        I don’t have the money to pay.

           Emilie urges Frederic to speak up...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Unfortunately, I do. I’ve saved enough 
                        from my commissions. I was going to buy a 
                        small house for Emilie and I.

           Emilie reaches for his hand. Comforts him.

                                 MOTHER
                        You save the family name, and honor. Your 
                        father would be proud.
           He gets up and stands before the family portrait hanging 
           above the fire.

                                 FREDERIC
                        My father didn’t know me. He died when I 
                        was two. I’m not part of the picture, 
                        remember. That’s not me. I don’t exist. 

                                 EMILIE
                        Who would have thought crazy Frederic 
                        would turn out to be the great achiever 
                        in the family?

           Frederic takes the painting down.

           And SMASHES it over a chair.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Let’s try to remember which of your 
                        darling sons has managed to stay clear of 
                        the whorehouses and opium dens and 
                        racetracks, shall we?

           With a charred lump of wood, he SKETCHES his own portrait 
           on the wall above the fire - with a “Liberty” spiked 
           crown on his head. 

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        And by the way, Mother, I intend to marry 
                        Emilie at my earliest opportunity. I 
                        trust you have no reservations?

           His Mother scowls at Emilie. 

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - NIGHT

           Lying naked in each others’ arms on the studio divan...

                                 EMILIE
                        Do you really want to marry me?

                                 FREDERIC
                        With all my heart and several other parts 
                        of my anatomy. Alas, thanks to Charles, I 
                        no longer have money for a house, or a 
                        ring, or much of anything.

                                 EMILIE
                        I don’t need fancy things. I need you to 
                        finish with this other woman. I can’t 
                        share you forever.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        History will record that the greatest 
                        woman in Frederic’s life stood over 300ft 
                        tall. In truth, though, she stood a 
                        little over 5 foot, on her tiptoes.

           The sun rises. Daylight floods into the studio from the 
           skylights above.

                                 EMILIE
                        Go to work, Frederic.

           He kisses her. So in love. And leaves.

           EXT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           Time-lapse of the REST OF LIBERTY being built.

           Her shoulders -

           Her head -

           And every section of that defiantly raised arm until the 
           torch itself is complete.

           EXT. PARIS - DAY

           We see views of Liberty standing tall above the rooftops 
           from many different streets.

           Crowds gather to gaze in AWE.

           Gently pushing to the front of one group of admirers -

           Frederic’s Mother.

           All the regrets she ever had slowly fade from her face.

           And she smiles. A small but significant smile.

           EXT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - NIGHT

           Eiffel, Simon, and Henri, drunk, bid farewell to 
           Frederic. He sits himself on a crate, and basks in the 
           moonlit beauty of his behemoth creation.

           Brandy. Cigar.

           And Liberty.

           Finished.
           A towering copper goddess.

           There’s a tear in his eye.

           We notice an old man has entered the yard behind him, a 
           visitor, an admirer.

           He coughs politely to gain Frederic’s attention. Without 
           turning to see who it is...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Come, join me. Have a drink. It’s too 
                        cold to be out without Brandy.

           The old man sits next to Frederic on the crate. Still, 
           Frederic can’ take his eyes off Liberty. He hands the old 
           man the brandy. He drinks. And drinks. And drinks.

           Now Frederic turns.

           The old man is Victor Hugo.

                                 VICTOR HUGO
                        I can only see the back of her head from 
                        my window. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s her prettiest side.

                                 VICTOR HUGO
                        My daughter died in the river. Just 
                        beyond your statue. She drowned. Her 
                        heavy dress dragged her down. Whenever I 
                        see the river, I’m sad. I should live 
                        somewhere else. But the house has happier 
                        memories inside. I wanted to thank you, 
                        Mr. Bartholdi, for giving the river some 
                        meaning other than her death. When I look 
                        at Liberty, I see hope.

           He shakes hands with Frederic. And embraces him. Then 
           unfolds a piece of paper from his pocket...

                                 VICTOR HUGO (CONT’D)
                        It’s just a couple of lines. I wrote them 
                        for you. And for Liberty. They don’t 
                        congratulate your achievement. They don’t 
                        speak to what is outside you. They speak 
                        to what is inside.

           He gives the lines to an overwhelmed Frederic, tips his 
           hat, and pauses before he leaves... 
                                 VICTOR HUGO (CONT’D)
                        I’m writing a new novel, Les Miserables. 
                        My publisher loves it. I worry it might 
                        be over-rated. Perhaps you could give it 
                        a review?

                                 FREDERIC
                        I have high hopes.

           They smile. Hugo leaves. Frederic reads the lines.

           But we don’t see them. Or hear them. 

           Snow FALLS.

           EXT. PARIS - NIGHT

           Frederic walks home through the snow.

           It’s a long and laborious journey thanks to every 
           Parisian he meets insisting on shaking his hand, and 
           pointing to Liberty, over the rooftops, with her snow 
           dusted crown.

                                 PARISIAN #1
                        You have made Paris even more magical.

                                 PARISIAN #2
                        You make us so proud.

                                 PARISIAN #3
                        We love you.

                                 PARISIAN #4
                        You can’t take her away. She is Paris.

                                 PARISIAN #5
                        The Americans don’t deserve her.

                                 PARISIAN #6
                        Promise she will stay.

           Mostly, people just hug him. And love him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Paris fell in love with Liberty and 
                        Frederic but the love affair was doomed 
                        from the start. 
           EXT. PARIS - DAY

           Spring. People crying. Public mourning. It’s the 1885 
           version of the Beatles breaking up.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Winter turned to Spring, and despite the 
                        protests and broken hearts of Parisians, 
                        Lady Liberty had to places to go.

           EXT. GAGET GAUTHIER & CO WORKSHOP, PARIS - DAY

           A huge Merchant Ship pulls into the dock behind Liberty.

           Big grown men cry as they disassemble Liberty, number 
           each piece, wrap it, crate it, and transfer it to the 
           ship.

           EXT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - DAY

           A crowd gathers outside. 

           The One Armed Man is making a killing selling little 
           flags for them all to wave. One side is the Tricolor, the 
           other side is the Stars & Stripes.

           They sing patriotic songs.

           There’s a waiting carriage.

           INT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic and Emilie watch Porters carry out their 
           LUGGAGE. Simon embraces his boss. 

                                 SIMON
                        You knew nothing when we started working 
                        together.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Alas, there has been so little 
                        improvement on my part.

                                 SIMON
                        America is a long journey for my old 
                        bones. I’ll rest them here till you 
                        return. I’m sure you’ll have plenty of 
                        help over there.

           As ever, his Mother lingers in the doorway that leads to 
           the Attached House.
                                 FREDERIC
                        Come into the light, Mother. Let me say 
                        goodbye with the sun on your face.

           She comes to him. She’s crying.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        No tears, Mama. The work is almost done. 
                        When we return, I think we’ll move back 
                        to the countryside. The air will be 
                        better for you.

           He kisses her. Emilie kisses her.

                                 MOTHER
                        You are lucky to have a woman who 
                        understands who you are. I would love to 
                        have a daughter, one day, soon.

           She gives Frederic a small PAPER BAG.

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        For the journey.

           He looks inside - freshly baked Madelines.

                                 FREDERIC
                        The journey? These won’t last as far as 
                        the front door.

           He EATS one right away. Fuck that tastes good.

                                 MOTHER
                        Go. Your other woman is waiting.

           EXT. FREDERIC’S STUDIO, PARIS - DAY

           Frederic and Emilie push through the CHEERING CROWD to 
           the waiting carriage.

           INT. CARRIAGE, PARIS - DAY

           Closing the door to the crowd, they settle back into 
           their seats, and the carriage sets off.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s all plain sailing now.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Do I actually need to comment by this 
                        point?
           EXT. MERCHANT SHIP, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           A HORRIFIC raging STORM -

           LASHES the ship from every angle.

           Crashing fifty foot waves. Thunder and lightning. 

           Torrential rain. Wrath of the Gods stuff.

           INT. CABIN, MERCHANT SHIP - NIGHT

           Cramped. Basic. 

           There are sounds of SHOUTING and PANIC from other parts 
           of the ship. The constant POUNDING of the waves and 
           CRASHING of things on board creates a cacophony like the 
           middle of a battlefield.

           The weak light comes from a storm lantern hung from the 
           ceiling. It mostly illuminates TERROR on the faces of 
           Emilie and Frederic.

                                 EMILIE
                        We’re going to die. We’re going to sink, 
                        and drown, and die.

                                 FREDERIC
                        These ships are designed for worse 
                        weather than this. I’ll talk to the crew.

           INT. CORRIDOR, MERCHANT SHIP - NIGHT

           Frederic stumbles out -

           Lurches past a CRYING CREWMAN -

           And stops by the GALLEY.

           Inside, he can HEAR the CREW discuss SURVIVAL.

                                 CREWMAN#1
                        We’re sailing too low. We need to lighten 
                        the ship.

                                 CREWMAN#2
                        Throw that damned statue overboard, or 
                        we’re all going down.

           Frederic’s world shifts with the sudden realization that 
           his GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT is about to be LOST.
           He heads away from the Galley, braves the downpour coming 
           through a hatch, and climbs the steps to -

           EXT. OPEN DECK, MERCHANT SHIP - DAY

           Frederic enters the MAELSTROM of a Mid-Atlantic storm.

           SEA SPRAY smashes into his face like a block of ice.

           The wind WHIPS his body. The ship PLUNGES into a trough 
           between the waves.

           And up ahead, he can see huge CRATES marked LIBERTY, 
           straining at the ROPES that lash them to the deck.

           The NOISE is off the scale.

           A CREWMAN tries to push past him. The Crewman has a 
           MACHETE. Frederic knows this is the end for Liberty. 
           Unless...

           He grabs the Crewman, and pulls him back. Frederic FIGHTS 
           him for the machete. This is a guy who never gives up. A 
           man possessed. He grapples the machete off the Crewman.

           Holding onto a rope rail that runs alongside the outer 
           cabins, he HAULS himself to the crates.

           Then uses loose ropes to SECURE himself to Liberty’s 
           crates. He has tied himself to her fate.

           He looks back towards the hatch, where the crewmen have 
           gathered to look at this crazy guy waving a machete at 
           the raging thunderstorm.

                                 FREDERIC
                        You’re fighting the wrong man. I am 
                        Frederic Auguste Bartholdi. I have died 
                        once already. And I’m still here. So come 
                        on. Give me all you’ve got. And when 
                        you’re done, let’s see who’s still here.

           The crewmen cross themselves, retreat, and secure the 
           hatch. Frederic is locked out.

           And as the STORM GETS WORSE - he laughs in its face. 
           Laughs hard. Till he sees the wave gathering to the 
           starboard side of the ship.

           A wave that’s a hundred feet tall -

           Rolling, cresting, and crashing down upon him with the 
           force of a toppling skyscraper.
           Frederic, the crates, and the ship -

           Disappear beneath the wave.

           The wave clears.

           The ship surges upwards.

           We hold on Frederic - still lashed to the crates.

           But he’s not laughing now. He’s hanging, tethered by his 
           wrist. He has the look of the drowned - the dead.

           EXT. MID-ATLANTIC - DAY

           Calm sea. Clear sky.

           The Merchant Ship has survived the storm.

           EXT. MERCHANT SHIP, ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           The hatch door opens.

           A crewman ushers Emilie out onto the deck.

           She sees the body of Frederic, slumped against the 
           crates, exhausted, battered, drenched, and rushes to him.

           She wipes the sodden hair from his face.

                                 EMILIE
                        Frederic? My love. My crazy love.

           He blinks awake.

           The sun is behind her and creates a halo of light - the 
           rays of Liberty’s crown. She’s smiling. She looks so 
           beautiful, so perfect.

                                 FREDERIC
                        My angel. I was wrong. I should have kept 
                        your face.

           She kisses him. The crewman CUTS him free.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Have I missed breakfast?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Chances are he didn’t say anything so 
                        flippant. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And we might be stretching the absolute 
                        truth with the whole lashing himself to 
                        the crates thing. Who knows? I wasn’t 
                        there. You weren’t there. Just trying to 
                        sell a story here. Go with it.

           EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

           The Merchant Ship docks at Bedloe’s Island, the proposed 
           site for the Statue Of Liberty.

           Frederic jumps down onto dry land, and is greeted by 
           workmen and the plinth architect, DICK HUNT, a nervous 
           man, with good reason.

                                 DICK HUNT
                        Richard Hunt, Dick, architect, designer 
                        of the plinth for Lady Liberty. How was 
                        your journey?

                                 FREDERIC
                        It passed without incident. However, I 
                        cannot promise the same for the next five 
                        minutes. Let me ask you this, because I’m 
                        a little confused.

           Frederic makes a show of scanning the tiny island.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Where is the plinth?

                                 DICK HUNT
                        Ah, yes, I was coming to that. Certain, 
                        assumptions have been made that have 
                        delayed progress beyond excavating the 
                        foundations.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Wait. Wait there. I have built the 
                        world’s tallest and greatest statue, by 
                        far, and correct me if I didn’t quite 
                        hear you - you have dug a hole?

                                 DICK HUNT
                        Let me explain.

                                 FREDERIC
                        No. Let me kill you.

           Frederic takes a SWING at Hunt. 

           Hunt DUCKS and RUNS.
           His workmen GRAB Frederic but he squirms free and CHASES 
           AFTER Smith.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        It’s a tiny island. You can’t get away.

           WITH EMILIE:

           Being helped from the ship.

                                 EMILIE
                        Frederic? Frederic?

           We see he cresting a small hill on the island to find 
           Frederic sitting astride Hunt, STRANGLING him.

                                 EMILIE (CONT’D)
                        Frederic! Unhand that man immediately. 

           Hunt’s workmen rush over to pull Frederic away.

           Frederic falls back onto the grass next to a distraught 
           Hunt, and stares up at a blue and empty sky.

                                 FREDERIC
                        They’ve done nothing. We have nothing to 
                        put her on. All this time.

                                 EMILIE
                        Mr. Smith, explain yourself.

                                 DICK HUNT
                        I was trying to do just that.

                                 EMILIE
                        Then try harder.

                                 DICK HUNT
                        We never thought you’d raise the money 
                        for the statue, never mind build her. It 
                        all seemed so, expensive. And impossible. 
                        So we’re running behind schedule.

                                 EMILIE
                        How far behind?

                                 DICK HUNT
                        Six months. Perhaps more. Depends how 
                        quickly we can get the money to continue.

                                 EMILIE
                        Exactly how much have you raised here in 
                        America for this magnificent gift from 
                        the people of France?
                                 DICK HUNT
                        Just enough...
                                (A beat)
                        ...to dig the hole.

           Emilie shares a look with Frederic.

           Then she KICKS Dick Hunt in the ribs. Oof.

           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - DAY

           Later, all of the crates containing the numbered parts of 
           Liberty have been UNLOADED from the ship and stand idly 
           stacked by the dock.

           The ship casts off. Frederic and Emilie wave it goodbye.

           A sheepish and bruised Dick Hunt offers them a ride to 
           the city in his boat.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           Frederic and Emilie look out across the harbor towards 
           tiny Bedloe’s Island.

           The wind BLOWS a NEWSPAPER against his legs. He peels it 
           away. It’s the FRONT PAGE of the THE NEW YORK WORLD.

           There’s a story about new PRESIDENT, Grover Cleveland.

           He smiles.

                                 EMILIE
                        What is it?

                                 FREDERIC
                        An old friend just got a very important 
                        new job. It comes with the keys to the 
                        Federal budget for building monuments.

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON - DAY

           Establishing.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND (V.O.)
                        Mr Bartholdi, I can spare you the time it 
                        takes to eat my dinner, but I warn you - 
                        I eat fast.
           INT. STATE ROOM, THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           The Oval Office hasn’t been built yet, but the usual 
           symbols and paraphernalia of high office are all in 
           attendance.

           President Cleveland dines at his desk. Frederic stands 
           before him...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Liberty is built. The foundations are 
                        dug. 

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        Congratulations. I never thought you’d 
                        get it done. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        The American side of the bargain, though, 
                        has not been fulfilled. We have no plinth 
                        to stand her upon.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        That’s a damn shame.

                                 FREDERIC
                        When you were the Governor of New York, 
                        you told me to go to the President for 
                        the funds. So here I am.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        And this statue is going to stand in New 
                        York? Pass the salt.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Bedloe’s Island. In the harbor.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        That’s going to be a problem.

           Off Frederic’s look...

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND (CONT’D)
                        As President, I can’t be seen to favor 
                        the State where I was Governor. It looks 
                        bad. Real bad. Have you tried folks like 
                        JP Morgan? Astor? That Vanderbilt fella?

           INT. STEAM TRAIN, MOVING - NIGHT

           Frederic drinks. Emilie sleeps against his shoulder.
           EXT. HOTEL, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           A solid four star establishment.

           INT. HOTEL, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Frederic and Emilie enter their suite.

           There’s a TELEGRAM on the table.

           Frederic flops on the bed.

                                 EMILIE
                        Shall I read it?

           He makes an artistic gesture of compliance.

           Emilie reads the telegram. She looks to Frederic, upset. 
           She has to sit. Frederic takes note.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Emilie?

                                 EMILIE
                        It’s from Simon. 

           INSERT SHOT:

           Simon, Laboulaye, frail and old, and others at the 
           graveside of Frederic’s Mother.

           And now Simon, and the others at the graveside of 
           Laboulaye.

           BACK TO THE SCENE:

                                 EMILIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Don’t be. I got to taste the Madelines.

                                 EMILIE
                        Simon says the funerals will be over 
                        before you can sail home.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s all over whether I stay or whether I 
                        go. All over.

           He buries his head in a pillow. And sleeps.
           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - DAY

           Gulls roost on the packing crates containing the numbered 
           parts of Liberty.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And so Liberty sat there, for months, 
                        waiting for a hero. Just one damn guy or 
                        gal in the whole United States of America 
                        who would step up to the plate and say, 
                        “Bartholdi, I’m here to help.” Meanwhile, 
                        Liberty rotted on Bedloe’s Island. And 
                        Frederic, sick and exhausted, rotted on 
                        Manhattan.

           INT. SUITE, HOTEL - DAY

           Frederic is ILL in bed. Emilie throws the drapes open. 
           She’s dressed. And determined.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Stop.

                                 EMILIE
                        We’re leaving.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I can’t leave. I can’t leave her.

                                 EMILIE
                        We’re getting out of this city. It’s 
                        making you sick. It’s just full of 
                        diseases, and yes men who like to say no. 
                        You need to find Frederic again. The one 
                        who fights when everyone else runs away.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Where is he? Where’s this Frederic.

                                 EMILIE
                        He’s in Rhode Island. With my friend. 

           EXT. CHURCH, RHODE ISLAND - DAY

           Frederic and Emilie emerge with friends - MARRIED.

                                 EMILIE (V.O.)
                        He’s a minister.
           INT. MINISTER’S HOUSE, RHODE ISLAND - NIGHT

           A big PARTY of friends, locals, musicians, artists. 

           For once, Frederic relaxes among his own kind of people.

           There’s wine, and song, and dance, and so much love for 
           his new wife Emilie.

           Choristers from the church sing them a beautiful aria.

           The MINISTER says a few words...

                                 MINISTER
                        I want to welcome the new Mr and Mrs 
                        Batholdi to our Rhode Island sanctuary 
                        for disaffected artists.

           Cheers from the guests.

                                 MINISTER (CONT'D)
                        One thing that’s clear in this community 
                        of love and art and creativity, is that 
                        before you can build anything of note, 
                        you must have a strong foundation. 

           Frederic stands up and expresses his own heartfelt 
           emotions. We sense he’s finding strength here. Strength 
           to continue the journey.

                                 FREDERIC
                        The rock I build my life upon is love. 
                        And the love has a name. And her name is 
                        Emilie. And without her, I am just broken 
                        pieces in boxes, sitting out in the rain.

           Emilie and Frederic kiss, and dance, and love some more.

           EXT. MINISTER’S HOUSE, RHODE ISLAND - NIGHT

           At the end of the evening, they smoke cigars and drink 
           fine brandy out on the porch.

           The MINISTER hands Frederic a business card.

                                 MINISTER
                        What you need is someone who can reach 
                        the regular folks, the real New Yorkers. 
                        Not the hoity-toits. Regular human beings 
                        with heart and soul and a need for 
                        something more than what they got.

           Reading the card...
                                 FREDERIC
                        Who is this Mr Pulitzer?

                                 MINISTER
                        He runs a newspaper. Dreadful rag. But he 
                        knows people. What have you got to lose?

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           A carriage drops Frederic outside the offices of THE 
           WORLD NEWSPAPER.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Dreadful rag indeed. I should sue.

           INT. THE WORLD, MANHATTAN - DAY

           Frederic is guided through a labyrinthine arrangements of 
           desks and journalists by an UNDER-SECRETARY. Finally, he 
           is ushered into the smoke-filled office of JOSEPH 
           PULITZER. 

           Pulitzer sits in a high-back swivel chair facing the 
           window, where he has a distant view of the harbor.

                                 UNDER-SECRETARY
                        Mr Frederic Bartholdi, sir.

           Pulitzer turns to meet Frederic. He has that sort of 
           wickedly infectious charm that you can’t help but adore. 
           He’s a Victorian Tom Hanks or Robert Downey. And when he 
           speaks, we realize something else...

                                 PULITZER
                        Frederic, I hear you got quite a story?

           Pulitzer is our NARRATOR. It’s HIS voice we’ve been 
           hearing pass comment throughout the movie so far.`

           EXT. BATTERY PARK, MANHATTAN - DAY

           Pulitzer and Frederic gaze across the harbor to Bedloe’s 
           Island. Next to them, a BOY throws breadcrumbs for the 
           gulls, whilst his GRANDMOTHER reads a NEWSPAPER.

                                 PULITZER
                        A newspaper is a very powerful tool. I 
                        can use it to support or condemn, to 
                        inform or misinform. One hundred thousand 
                        people read my newspaper every morning. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PULITZER (CONT'D)
                        They want to read good stories, uplifting 
                        stories. What’s that you’re reading 
                        there, young lady?

           The GRANDMOTHER shows him her copy of THE NEW YORK 
           JOURNAL. Pulitzer grimaces...

                                 PULITZER (CONT’D)
                        May I?

           He takes it from her.

                                 PULITZER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll need a bath after touching this 
                        filth, obviously. This is the drivel 
                        spewed out by Randolph Hearst. Here.

           He opens the paper at a CARTOON.

           The cartoon MOCKS the lack of progress made in erecting 
           the Statue Of Liberty. It shows her as an aged crone with 
           a walking stick.

                                 PULITZER (CONT’D)
                        See that? Sensationalist negativity. He 
                        can’t build anything other than fear and 
                        loathing. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        The fund to build the plinth is empty. No  
                        money, no plinth. Nobody wants to help.

           The BOY tugs on Frederic’s trousers.

                                 BOY
                        I’ll help.

                                 FREDERIC
                        That’s very kind. But you’re a boy. We 
                        need men with money. Lots of money.

                                 BOY
                        I’ve got money. I’ve got two jobs. I make 
                        almost a dollar a week.

                                 PULITZER
                        Wow. You’re exactly the kind of kid 
                        that’s going to make this country great. 
                        How old are you?

                                 BOY
                        Ten.
                                 PULITZER
                        Come see me when you’re fourteen. I’ll 
                        give you a job pays five dollars week.

           The kid spits on his hand and holds it out to shake.

                                 BOY
                        Got yourself a sweet deal, sir.

           Pulitzer shakes his hand. The Boy digs in his pocket and 
           pulls out a NICKEL. Hands it to Frederic.

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        This is for you. Put it in your fund. Get 
                        enough of those, you can build anything 
                        you want.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I can’t take it.

                                 BOY
                        Take it. I’d only spend it on candy or 
                        cigarettes or a kiss from Maisy-Sue at 
                        the market.

                                 PULITZER
                        What’s your name, kid.

                                 BOY
                        Brendan P Maloney, sir.

                                 PULITZER
                        That’s generous positivity you just 
                        displayed, Brendan P Maloney. You should 
                        be rewarded. What can I get you?

                                 BOY
                        Don’t seem much point me giving you a 
                        nickel if you’re going to spend it giving 
                        me a reward.

                                 PULITZER
                        There has to be something I can do.

                                 BOY
                        What’s this job you were talking about 
                        for when I’m thirteen.

                                 PULITZER
                        I said fourteen, but I like your 
                        negotiating skills. I got a newspaper. 
                        The New York World.
                                 BOY
                        Best damn newspaper in New York.

           To the Grandmother...

                                 PULITZER
                        Is this kid up for adoption?

           To the Boy...

                                 PULITZER (CONT’D)
                        How about you get a free newspaper every 
                        day?

           The Boy thinks about it...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Tell me, Brendan P Maloney, have you ever 
                        seen your name in a newspaper. Printed, 
                        so all your friends can see it too?

           The Boy’s eyes LIGHT UP.

                                 BOY
                        That would be awesome.

                                 PULITZER
                        Then that’s what I’m going to do. And you 
                        tell everyone you know. You give us a 
                        nickel, a dime, two cents, whatever you 
                        have in your pocket for Liberty, I’ll 
                        print your name in my newspaper. How 
                        about that?

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           The Boy picks up the next edition of The New York World 
           and sure enough, his NAME is right there as a DONOR in 
           bold letters beneath a CALL TO ACTION for the LIBERTY 
           FUND. Brendan P Maloney is the happiest kid on Earth.

           We see further days -

           And more people picking up The New York World to read 
           their own name in print as a DONOR to the Liberty Fund.

           The LIST of DONOR NAMES grows longer every day.

           Soon, it fills half a page. Excitement BUILDS among the 
           people of New York.
           INT. OFFICES, THE NEW YORK WORLD - DAY

           Pulitzer and Frederic have created a FUND METER in the 
           LOBBY. It’s a growing statue of Liberty built from 
           DONATED COPPER COINS.

           We see Liberty rise - first the plinth itself -

           Then the feet -

           The lower parts of the dress -

           Up over the waist -

           And onwards, higher, her left arm holding the tablet.

           Frederic stands on a ladder to add more coins to the 
           sculpture. Pulitzer looks on, delighted.

           EXT. STREET, MANHATTAN - DAY

           The Boy, Brendan P Maloney, shows his friends his name in 
           the newspaper.

                                 BOY
                        That’s six times I’ve been in the news. 
                        They write more about me than they do 
                        rich folks like Vanderbilt.

           He gets a free kiss from Maisy-Sue.

           EXT. RESTAURANT, LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT

           Italian music drifts out.

           INT. RESTAURANT, LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT

           Frederic and Emilie dine with Pulitzer and his wife. This 
           is a “straight off the boat” Sicilian place. There’s even 
           a shrine in the corner with figurines of the VIRGIN MARY 
           and a gang of pertinent SAINTS.

                                 EMILIE
                        I hear there is a movement here for the 
                        emancipation of women, like in Europe.

                                 WIFE OF PULITZER
                        Emancipation is a long long way off for 
                        American women, darling. The menfolk here 
                        have just got over the shock of giving 
                        the blacks a whiff of freedom.

                                 WIFE OF PULITZER (CONT'D)
                        Lord knows what would happen if us ladies 
                        had such things as rights, votes, equal 
                        pay.

                                 EMILIE
                        Nothing is impossible.

                                 WIFE OF PULITZER
                        Impossible, no. Improbable, yes.

                                 PULITZER
                        What made you want to undertake such an 
                        improbable task as building Liberty?

                                 FREDERIC
                        In all honesty, at first, I thought this 
                        Statue Of Liberty will be great for me. 
                        Make me famous. Earn me commissions from 
                        the wealthy people of America. 

           INSERT SHOT: Frederic puts on his military uniform and 
           rides alone through the fog shrouded streets of Colmar. 
           He wears a red, white, and blue sash.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT'D)
                        But it doesn’t make me famous. It makes 
                        me ill. And broke. And stupid. And 
                        laughed at. A lot. Building Liberty was 
                        not about me any more. 

           INSERT SHOT: Frederic is joined by Emilie, and Laboulaye, 
           wearing the same uniform.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT'D)
                        It was about the struggle, the fight, the 
                        will to carry on when the world did 
                        everything it could to stop me. 

           INSERT SHOT: Victor Hugo and Henri Leboeuf join the 
           riders, along with the One Armed Man and former President 
           Ulysses S Grant.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT'D)
                        Years have come and gone. Ten years. 
                        More, and now it’s not even about the 
                        fight. 

           INSERT SHOT: The riders reach the battlefield outside the 
           village of Colmar. 

           Across the muddy expanse, they see the enemy lines by the 
           trees. But these are not Germans any more...
           They are the people who ridiculed Frederic - JP Morgan, 
           Astor, Vanderbilt, Cleveland. They are crazy Charles and 
           the Paris intellectuals. They are the RICH and the ELITE 
           with their GOLDEN CANNONS and laughing minions.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT'D)
                        The fight will always be there. It’s 
                        about the people joining me, the people 
                        helping to carry the load.

           INSERT SHOT: Frederic and his allies CHARGE the lines of 
           the Rich and rout them. And they’re joined by THOUSANDS 
           of regular folks - an army of common men, women and 
           children and Brendan P Maloney. They swarm the enemy 
           lines -

           Flashing swords slash down and slaughter the sneering 
           Vanderbilts, the San Francisco Trump, the Paris 
           Intellectuals. It’s a sweeping VICTORY for Frederic.

           BACK TO THE RESTAURANT SCENE:

                                 PULITZER
                        I’m positively priapic with joy that we 
                        are so close. Yet...

           Concern from those around the table.

                                 PULITZER (CONT’D)
                        Still so far. We need more. And we need 
                        it soon. We have to build before Winter 
                        or we lose another year and how our 
                        enemies will swoop upon that delay to 
                        destroy us in our moment of victory.

                                 EMILIE
                        The coins are not enough?

                                 PULITZER
                        No. We need more dollars. 

                                 EMILIE
                        How many?

                                 PULITZER
                        25,000.

           Frederic’s attention is caught by the Italian Shrine in 
           the corner of the restaurant, with the figurines of the 
           Virgin Mary and Saints.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I have an idea.
           INT. SUITE, HOTEL - DAY

           Frederic carves a new sculpture of Liberty, 18 inches 
           high, from clay.

           INT. CERAMICS FACTORY, BROOKLYN - DAY

           A MOLD is made of Little Liberty.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           Brendan P Maloney runs a STALL selling those 18 inch high 
           plaster models of Liberty for a dollar a pop. Seems 
           everyone in the city wants one.

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        Those tacky statuettes of Liberty all the 
                        damn tourists buy? They came first. 
                        That’s right. Without those little 
                        Liberties, there would have been no big 
                        Liberty. True fact.

           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - DAY

           The haunting bellow of a passing ship’s horn.

           Frederic addresses a large group of WORKMEN, led by 
           architect Dick Hunt.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Gentlemen, let us begin.

           Nobody moves.

                                 DICK HUNT
                        They don’t speak English. Or French. I 
                        don’t actually know where they come from. 
                        Timbuktu most likely.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Immigrants. Outsiders. The unwanted. The 
                        lost. Well, good. The time for talk is 
                        over. Now is the time for us to do.

           He leads them down to the dock -

           Where SHIPS are lining up to UNLOAD BUILDING MATERIALS 
           for the PLINTH. 
                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        It only seems right that the men who 
                        built Liberty barely had a word of 
                        English between them.

           Time lapse of the PLINTH rising, and completed.

           Frederic and Emilie climb a ladder to the top.

           Emilie is draped in a copper-colored fabric. She wears a 
           copper radiant crown, carries a copper torch, and tablet. 

           She poses as Liberty, looking out towards the city.

                                 FREDERIC
                        The whole of Manhattan can see you.

                                 EMILIE
                        Why am I looking at the city, though.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s your home.

           She turns around, and faces OUT TO SEA.

                                 EMILIE
                        I should be looking out to the ocean, 
                        looking for the people coming here for 
                        freedom and a new life.

           He joins her. It’s a good idea. But still, it’s not 
           right. 

                                 FREDERIC
                        I like it, but all the people in the city 
                        will see is the back of her head.

           At that moment -

           A SHIP passes by the island. Hundreds of passengers crowd 
           on deck. The Ship’s Captain TOOTS the HORN. The 
           passengers wave.

           Emilie and Frederic turn and WAVE back.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        It’s like President Grant told me. The 
                        best view is of the ships sailing by. 
                        Liberty has to face the ships, has to 
                        welcome the new arrivals. This is the way 
                        she will face.

           He MARKS the position of Emilie with CHALK, and whistles 
           down to the build crew below.
           Cranes whir into action and begin to LIFT the first 
           pieces of Liberty’s iron Skeleton UP onto the plinth.

           TIME LAPSE:

           Of the iron skeleton taking shape.

           Then -

           One by one -

           The numbered pieces of Liberty’s copper skin are attached 
           with iron straps and copper rivets.

           Piece by piece, she rises.

           EXT. BATTERY PARK, MANHATTAN - DAY

                        That’s my piece they’re putting on now. I 
                        paid for that. Me. Not JP Morgan. Me.

           Liberty is built as far as the shoulders.

           INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

           Frederic is high inside Liberty, guiding the workers, 
           lending a hand, building his masterpiece.

           He reaches into his pocket, and takes out the POEM that 
           Victor Hugo wrote for him.

                                 WORKER
                        What you have there?

                                 FREDERIC
                        A poem.

                        You going to read it to us?

                                 FREDERIC
                        No. It’s for her.
           He tucks the poem behind an iron connection strap, and 
           rivets the piece in place, sealing the poem within the 
           skin of Liberty, forever. The SOUND of him HAMMERING in 
           the rivets becomes the...

           EXT. KNICKERBOCKER HOTEL, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           The hammering of a GAVEL by the MASTER OF CEREMONIES to 
           quieten the assembled GUESTS at -

           A LAVISH DINNER -

           In the Grand Ballroom of the city’s oldest luxury hotel.

           A small orchestra finishes its piece. There are hundreds 
           of tables, with a thousand or more HIGH SOCIETY diners. 
           We recognize many of the wealthy families here, including 
           the Astors, who built this hotel.

                                 MASTER OF CEREMONIES
                        Ladies and gentlemen, please be 
                        upstanding for your distinguished host, 
                        owner and publisher of New York’s best 
                        selling daily newspaper, Mr Joseph 
                        Pulitzer.

           Pulitzer takes to the stage. His backdrop is a huge 
           PAINTING of Liberty. And he’s flanked by MODELS in 
           Liberty costumes...

                                 PULITZER
                        Thank you. Tonight we celebrate the 
                        truest spark of human ingenuity. We 
                        celebrate the triumph of an idea that 
                        will change the way the whole world sees 
                        this great city of ours forever. An idea 
                        that would have been crushed a thousand 
                        times by small-minded bureaucrats and 
                        dilettantes - were it not for the 
                        perseverance and persistence of one man. 
                        You wouldn’t put your hands in your 
                        pockets for him so you can damn well put 
                        your hands together for him, the tres 
                        magnifique Mr Frederic Auguste Bartholdi.

           Frederic kisses Emilie, and makes his way to the stage.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I’m good with big ideas. Not so good with 
                        big speeches. Fortunately, you are 
                        blessed with an unbelievable artistic 
                        community. We have heard tonight their 
                        music, their songs, and now...
           He takes out a sheet of paper...

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Their poetry. We celebrate many things 
                        tonight. For me, we celebrate the most 
                        important aspect of any man’s life - the 
                        woman. The mother, the wife, the 
                        daughter, the statue. And here, the poet, 
                        the very wonderful Miss Emma Lazarus.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT'D)
                        I read for you tonight the words she has 
                        written regarding our Lady Liberty. 

           A pause whilst he milks the attention of his audience.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
                        With conquering limbs astride from land 
                        to land.

           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - NIGHT

           We move across the harbor waters towards the island and 
           the silhouette of the giant statue there.

                                 FREDERIC (V.O.)
                        Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates 
                        shall stand...

           Up, onto the island now, towards the plinth.

                                 FREDERIC (V.O.)
                        A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
                        Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
                        Mother of Exiles. 

           Circling around her moonlit curves and the fold of her 
           dress.

                                 FREDERIC (V.O.)
                        From her beacon-hand, Glows world-wide 
                        welcome; her mild eyes command, the air-
                        bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

           Adoring Liberty, almost complete, only her face and her 
           torch yet to be fixed in place.

                                 FREDERIC (V.O.)
                        Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp, 
                        cries she, with silent lips. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FREDERIC (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Give me your tired, your poor, your 
                        huddled masses yearning to breathe 
                        free...

           And back down to the TENTS of the Immigrant Workers and 
           their camp-fires. Men from the darkest corners of the 
           Earth, gathered to labor on its greatest wonder. Their 
           names have been forgotten. Their work lives on.

                                 FREDERIC
                        The wretched refuse of your teeming 
                        shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-
                        tossed to me...

           INT. KNICKERBOCKER HOTEL, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Frederic raises his clenched fist in triumph...

                                 FREDERIC
                        I lift my lamp beside the golden door!

           A hush falls over the distinguished guests.

           A tear rolls down Emilie’s cheek.

           Frederic shares a look with Pulitzer. He nailed it.

           Astor gets up from his seat. He applauds.

           And one by one, the rest of High Society stands and 
           applauds Frederic, applauds Liberty, applauds everything 
           she encapsulates about hope, and freedom.

           A beacon of light for the world.

           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - DAY

           Early morning mist shrouds the island. 

           We follow Frederic’s walk from the dock -

           To the plinth -

           To the public entrance to the interior.

           He is greeted by all the workers he passes. Not like a 
           King, or a boss. But as one of them.

           He’s carrying a BURLAP SACK over his shoulder, about the 
           size of a sack of potatoes.
           The workers are setting out SEATS around the plinth, and 
           building a small stage.

           INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

           Frederic climbs the steel stairs inside the statue -

           Past more workers applying the finishing touches to the 
           interior -

           All the way up to the VIEWING DECK in her crown.

           Here, he sets down the burlap sack -

           And takes out a HUGE ROLLED FLAG - red, white, and blue.

           With several men helping, he feeds the FLAG out onto a 
           POLE that runs horizontally across the FOREHEAD of 
           Liberty. Once secured -

           He releases the TIES that keep the flag rolled.

           The flag UNFURLS downwards.

           EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

           We see that the flag is a huge Tricolor.

           It COVERS the face of Liberty.

           We see TWO STERN MESSENGERS striding up from the dock. 

                                 MESSENGER #1
                        A French flag? What the bejeezus is all 
                        that about then?

                                 MESSENGER #2
                        He’s French, the fella that’s done the 
                        drawing for the statue.

                                 MESSENGER #1
                        Anyone can do a drawing. It’s Americans 
                        what’s built it. The nerve of some 
                        people.

                                 MESSENGER #2
                        That’s foreigners for you.

           Even more stern, they march up to the plinth.
           INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

           Frederic enjoys the VIEW and a cigar.

           A worker approaches from the stairs...

                                 WORKER
                        Some Messengers are here.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Tell them I’m busy. 

                                 WORKER
                        The telegram comes from the President.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Then have them to bring it up.

           A FEW MINUTES LATER...

           Frederic READS the message. The Messengers are sweating 
           and exhausted from the climb up to the viewing level.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        President Cleveland is offering to 
                        deliver the inauguration address for 
                        Liberty?

                                 MESSENGER #1
                        Yes. It’s a great honor.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It is. An incredible honor. And it should 
                        go to someone who deserves it. Tell the 
                        President I respectfully decline his 
                        offer. Good day, gentlemen.

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON - DAY

           President Cleveland reads a reply telegram. He EXPLODES.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        WHAT?!!!

           INT. RESTAURANT, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Frederic dines with Emilie. 

           The Messengers approach his table with another telegram.

           Frederic reads.
                                 FREDERIC
                        He’s offering to declare a holiday for 
                        New York, and organize a parade, if I let 
                        him cut the ribbon and speak.

                                 EMILIE
                        What does your heart say?

                                 FREDERIC
                        It says that cutting the ribbon is a 
                        special job for a special person, like 
                        you.

           To the Messengers...

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Tell him thank you, but no. We have our 
                        own scissors.

                                 MESSENGER #1
                        Sir, I don’t think you understand. The 
                        President is very angry about this.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Then let him know I was more angry when 
                        he refused to donate a single cent of 
                        State or Federal funds, or his own very 
                        deep pockets, towards the building of the 
                        single greatest monument of the modern 
                        world. The man who cuts the grass on 
                        Bedloe’s Island has more right to cut the 
                        ribbon on Liberty than the President. He 
                        will have to contribute far more than his 
                        massive ego to persuade me otherwise.

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON - NIGHT

           President Cleveland THROWS something heavy and breakable 
           across the room. It SMASHES.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        WHAT?!!!

           EXT. UNION SQUARE, MANHATTAN - DAY

           Frederic and Emilie feed the birds at his statue of 
           LAFAYETTE that now stands in the Square.

           The distraught Messengers approach with another urgent 
           telegram. Emilie reads it...
                                 EMILIE
                        He’s now offering to pay for a ticker-
                        tape parade, with marching band, a 21 
                        cannon salute, a firework display, and a 
                        party afterwards.

           Frederic considers the offer...

                                 EMILIE (CONT’D)
                        I do love fireworks.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Tell him that the cost of the party shall 
                        not be less than $50,000. I want to 
                        invite a lot of important guests.

           The Messengers leave with his demands.

                                 EMILIE
                        $50,000 is such a lot of money.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s symbolic. He could have paid half of 
                        that when he was the Governor, and when 
                        he took office as President. He could 
                        have helped. He could have rallied 
                        support. Now he wants all the glory. No. 
                        Liberty has a price. And today, the price 
                        is a $50,000 party.

                                 EMILIE
                        Who shall we invite?

                                 FREDERIC
                        For Liberty? Everyone. The whole world.

           EXT. HOTEL, MANHATTAN - MORNING

           The sun has barely peeked above the horizon, but already 
           the city is alive with workers, merchants and carriages.

           INT. SUITE, HOTEL - MORNING

           Emilie helps Frederic with his cravat. They both wear new 
           clothes. Emilie has red white and blue ribbons around her 
           hat. There’s a KNOCK on the door.

                                 EMILIE
                        That will be our carriage.

           Frederic opens the door.
           In the HALLWAY, there are four POLICE, and several BURLY 
           MEN in SUITS. The first of these men offers his hand to 
           Frederic and introduces himself.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        Special Agent Raven, sir. Good morning.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Have I done something wrong?

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        No, sir. Not at all. I’m leading the 
                        President’s Security Detail. I just 
                        wanted to let you know about a few of the 
                        minor changes we’ve had to make, as a 
                        matter of courtesy.

                                 FREDERIC
                        What kind of changes?

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        Specifically, there can be no women at 
                        the inauguration.

                                 FREDERIC
                        No women?

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        None. We’ve had threats from Emancipation 
                        Groups aimed at the President himself and 
                        we just can’t take the risk. The 
                        President sends his apologies.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It’s unfortunate. I was so looking 
                        forward to meeting him again.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        Sir?

                                 FREDERIC
                        If the President cannot make it because 
                        he is afraid of women, then I completely 
                        understand.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        The President will be there, sir. We just 
                        can’t have any women there at the same 
                        time.

           Emilie comes to the door.
                                 EMILIE
                        If your President thinks I’m a danger to 
                        his life then perhaps you need a new 
                        President.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        I cannot possibly comment on that, ma’am. 
                        But I’m willing to suggest that the ban 
                        does not apply to your lovely wife, sir.

                                 FREDERIC
                        What about Liberty? She’s a woman.

                                 EMILIE
                        A very large woman. She could crush him 
                        like a fat grape.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT RAVEN
                        If Liberty promises to behave, she can 
                        stay too. I appreciate your cooperation, 
                        sir. Have a wonderful day.

           EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

           Dense FOG.

           You can barely see ten feet ahead.

           At the front of the boat ferrying them across the harbor 
           with the BAND and dignitaries, Frederic is tense.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Even now the Gods conspire against me.

                                 EMILIE
                        God sends the fog to hide the shame of 
                        these stupid men.

           All around, the harbor is full of fleeting shadows. 
           HUNDREDS of boats mill about, decked out in French and US 
           flags. Fog Horns BLARE.

                                 FREDERIC
                        I knew I shouldn’t have let Cleveland 
                        come today.

                                 EMILIE
                        I hear he likes to make long speeches.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Long boring speeches.
           They hear a CHANT coming across the water. Dozens of 
           female voices shouting a protest mantra together. And now 
           their boat appears out of the mist, bedecked in protest 
           banners and slogans - it’s a Feminist Movement boat.

                                 FEMINISTS
                        Votes for women! Shame on America! Votes 
                        for women! Shame on America!

           Emilie takes up the cry...

                                 EMILIE
                        Votes for women! Shame on America!

           Frederic joins her...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Votes for women! Shame on America!

           They feel better. He glances behind. The other fifty 
           occupants of the boat are all STERN FACED MEN in suits, 
           staring at him with faces of contempt. Good.

           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - DAY

           Blanketed in fog. 

           The band set up.

           Dignitaries take their seats.

           Red, white and blue ribbons adorn every surface.

           The plinth of Liberty looms over them, a huge stone 
           monolith. But then the fog hides Liberty completely. Only 
           her toes are visible.

           Frederic addresses the BAND LEADER.

                                 FREDERIC
                        When I release the flag from Liberty’s 
                        face, that’s your cue to begin the 
                        anthems.

                                 BAND LEADER
                        How will I know? I can’t see the flag.

                                 FREDERIC
                        It will fall. When it does, play. Play 
                        loud. Play strong. They have to hear you 
                        all the way across the harbor. 
           Frederic embraces the Band Leader, and kisses both his 
           cheeks.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Play for Liberty.

           President Cleveland arrives.

           He’s holding his SPEECH. It looks like it’s several pages 
           long. Frederic groans inside.

           Emilie brushes down his jacket.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Nobody can see her. Nobody can see this 
                        moment. All these years, and what do we 
                        get? A fog-bank and an old windbag of a 
                        President.

                                 EMILIE
                        Perhaps the old windbag will blow the fog 
                        away.

           He smiles.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Where would I be without you?

                                 EMILIE
                        With your brother, probably. Now, it has 
                        been 21 years since you had the idea to 
                        build Liberty. We won’t let a little bad 
                        weather ruin the final day. Go. She has 
                        you for one more hour. Then you are all 
                        mine. And only mine.

           Frederic heads off to Liberty.

           We follow him, shaking hands with a “tunnel” of workers 
           lining the route to the plinth’s entrance.

           INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

           Frederic climbs the 354 step to her viewing platform...

           Where there are TWO SEATS. One is occupied -

           By Simon. He passes Frederic a bottle of Brandy.

                                 SIMON
                        For the cold. Congratulations old friend.

           Frederic drinks. And proposes a toast.
                                 FREDERIC
                        To blue skies ahead.

                                 SIMON
                        I think that’s impossible today.

                                 FREDERIC
                        Impossible, no. Improbable, yes.

                                 SIMON
                        Then I’ll drink to improbable blue skies.

           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - DAY

           We move across rows and rows of dignitaries, all men, and 
           each man doing his utmost to stay awake as President 
           Cleveland delivers one of the dullest oratories ever.

           His words are mercifully MUFFLED and come across as a 
           soporific drone...

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

           Emilie yawns.

           The yawn is contagious.

           Now everyone yawns.

           Still Cleveland drones on.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND (CONT’D)
                        Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

           INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

           Looking out of the viewing windows into the grey 
           enveloping mist...

                                 FREDERIC
                        Laboulaye would have enjoyed it here 
                        today. He liked parties, and people.

           Then -

           He sees it.

                                 FREDERIC (CONT’D)
                        Look!

           The CLOUDS above are PARTING.
           There’s a slither of BLUE SKY.

                                 SIMON
                        My God. It worked.

           Simon looks at his bottle of Brandy. And drinks a whole 
           lot more.

           Frederic reaches out and RELEASES the FLAG that’s 
           covering Liberty’s FACE. Grabs Simon by the hand. And 
           runs to the steps...

           EXT. BEDLOE’S ISLAND - DAY

           The French Flag floats down from Liberty and seems to 
           DISPEL the fog with every twist and turn of its flight.

           The Flag flutters over the gathered dignataries -

           All look up and SEE the blue sky appearing overhead.

           And as Cleveland DRONES on -

           The Band Leader gives the signal and STRIKES UP THE BAND.

           The US ANTHEM blasts out and cuts Cleveland off before he 
           can turn to page 2 of 20.

           Everybody stands and CHEERS as the fog parts and reveals 
           Liberty in all he GLORY.

           Frederic and Simon run from the plinth and JOIN the 
           celebration. Boats surrounding the island LAUNCH 
           FIREWORKS.

           Frederic and Emilie see Pulitzer amid the crowd of 
           dignitaries and share a look of triumph.

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        We travel different paths, but we all 
                        want the same destination. 

           And we rise from the crowd on Bedloe’s Island, up to the 
           face of Liberty. Fireworks explode all around.

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        Freedom. Freedom to be who we are...

           Then plunge down and race across the harbor, teeming with 
           ships and party boats -

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        Freedom to do what we do...
           All the way across to Manhattan where -

           EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

           We have the FIRST EVER TICKER TAPE PARADE in honor of 
           Frederic and Liberty.

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        Freedom to love who we love. 

           The Band march at the front, playing the French Anthem. 

           It’s the biggest party New York has ever seen. And it’s 
           all at the President’s expense.

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        Liberty was created to be a symbol of 
                        hope for France and America.

           In Frederic’s carriage are Emilie and Pulitzer.

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        But she has become so much bigger than 
                        Frederic ever dreamed.

           As they parade down Broadway, crowds line either side and 
           cheer. Streamers and ticker tape fill the air. 

                                 PULITZER (V.O.)
                        She’s a symbol of hope for the whole 
                        world.

           The marching band switches from the French Anthem to the 
           Can Can.

           And we leave the DANCING Frederic and Emile to rise up 
           through the streamers - and back out to Liberty.

           We circle around her, and keep her in the foreground as 
           behind, we see a TIME LAPSE of Manhattan over the next 
           130 years...

           We see Liberty turn from the dazzling color of copper -

           To her famous verdigris green. We see Manhattan reaching 
           for the heavens with skyscrapers. We see the attacks on 
           the Twin Towers. And the rise of the new LIBERTY TOWER.

           Then hold on a glorious wide of Liberty at night -and 
           red, white, and blue fireworks explode all around her.

           THE END.
