           A single gunshot echoes over black as we fade into...

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           South Central, Los Angeles.  Chaos.  Sirens.  It’s frenetic.

           Dry heat sizzles off of cracked pavement as a hooded figure 
           sprints into frame, sending gunfire behind him.  A 
           destruction of cop cars can be seen in his wake.  

           We fall back to Will EVANS, 30s, bruised in a tattered LAPD 
           uniform, as he takes cover behind a lowrider.  

                                 EVANS
                        Stop!  Stop now!

           Evans is plain yet handsome.  He feels like a cop and he is 
           young, but not as young as he used to be.  

           Eva CHAVEZ, 30s, catches up to Evans as he exchanges gunfire.  
           Eva’s attractive, maybe not as attractive as she used to be, 
           but she makes the uniform look good. 

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Nice of you to join me.

           They have obvious chemistry.

                                 CHAVEZ
                        You know me.  Not one to miss a 
                        party.

                                 EVANS
                             (serious)
                        You good?

           She looks like she’s seen better days.

                                 CHAVEZ
                        Let’s get this guy.

           Evans sees the assailant fleeing again through the rear car 
           window and continues his pursuit.  And boy is this guy fast. 

           They race over cars and through the streets when a cop car 
           suddenly screeches into frame and forces the figure down an 
           alleyway.  Dead-end.  The figure clicks his gun empty, tosses 
           it aside, and tries to scale the wall to no avail.

           Evans catches up and tentatively approaches as Chavez takes 
           cover behind the cop car.  
                                 CHAVEZ (CONT’D)
                             (to Evans)
                        Don’t do anything stupid.

           Evans winks to Chavez, but a bead of sweat drips down his 
           face.  He’s nervous.  We see the hooded figure from behind 
           scraping at the brick wall.  Desperate for an escape.

                                 EVANS
                        On the ground!  Now!

           The figure suddenly gives up and starts to laugh maniacally.  
           Chavez retrains her gun, as Evans creeps to within striking 
           distance.  His weapon hot.

           The figure is right in our face now as he begins to turn 
           around, lowering his hood, and that’s when we see... that 
           he’s an Orc!!!  Gray, peeling skin, dark eyes, bald head and 
           slightly animalistic features with a shaved-off horn between 
           his eyes.  

                                 ORC
                             (still laughing)
                        You don’t get it, do you?  Your 
                        time is done...

           The Orc begins to change colors as he heats up from the 
           inside.  Evans looks like he’s been sucker punched.  He takes 
           one last look back to Chavez, resigned, and she screams, 
           helpless, as the Orc EXPLODES into a fiery ball!  

           We see the destruction and mushroom cloud from far above as 
           we FADE OUT.

                                                            OVER BLACK:

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        What the fuck...?

           INT. BRONZE PICTURES - DAY

           JAY, 30, Hollywood Creative Executive aspiring for more, sits 
           at his open-air cubicle staring at a printed-out screenplay.  
           Speechless.

           The office continues to busily move around him, movie posters 
           on the walls, (I think you know what it looks like), but Jay 
           remains planted in his chair, dumbstruck, until Carl PETERS, 
           40, EVP Production, comes up from behind and breaks him out 
           of his trance.  He’s eating a protein bar.

                                 PETERS
                        What are you reading?
                                 JAY
                        It’s the new Lax Mandis script.

                                 PETERS
                        Another one?

                                 JAY
                        I guess.  Even his stupid title 
                        pages annoy me at this point.

                                 PETERS
                        Didn’t he have a movie come out 
                        this weekend?  How’d it do?

                                 JAY
                        BARNACLE?  One man’s struggle to 
                        live a normal life after a freak 
                        accident turns him into a 
                        cephalopod?  It’s actually doing 
                        really well...

                                 PETERS
                        Hmm, I could really go for sushi 
                        today...  So what’s this new one?  
                        GOONIES in space?  THE MARTIAN... 
                        on Earth?

           Jay glances back at the screenplay in disgust.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t even know.  It’s like he’s 
                        not even trying.  It’s like his dog 
                        took a shit and that piece of shit 
                        wrote this screenplay.

                                 PETERS
                        It can’t be that bad.

                                 JAY
                        He never writes with any substance.  
                        And it’s so painfully broad.  But 
                        it also just doesn’t make any 
                        sense.  I mean - look - he put a 
                        Sudoku puzzle on page 49!

           He holds up page 49 and there is, indeed, a Sudoku puzzle.

                                 PETERS
                        I can never figure those out.  Why 
                        are you still printing out scripts 
                        by the way?  Don’t you have an 
                        iPad?
                                 JAY
                        I legitimately think I’m starting 
                        to go blind.  I can’t stare at a 
                        screen anymore.  I’m sorry.

                                 PETERS
                        Well it’s not good for the 
                        environment, so no more printing.  
                        Who’s the new intern again?

                                 JAY
                        His name’s Dave.

                                 PETERS
                        Right!  I like him.  He smells like 
                        pancakes.  Have him do coverage on 
                        that script and send me your 
                        thoughts asap.

           Peters ambles away pretending to look busy.

                                 JAY
                             (to no one)
                        Didn’t I just do that?

           Jay opens a blank email and addresses it to Peters.  He 
           writes in the subject line: UNTITLED LAX MANDIS PROJECT.  He 
           tabs down to the message box and holds for a beat, thinking.  

           He then pastes in the smiling poop emoticon and stares at it.  
           It stares back at him.  He stares back at it and we see the 
           hint of a smile for the first time in Jay.

                                 DAVE
                        You got anything for me?

           Dave, 20, over-eager and not jaded yet, sneaks up on Jay.  
           Jay minimizes the windows on his computer.

                                 JAY
                             (unenthusiastic)
                        Check this script out and let me 
                        know what you think.

                                 DAVE
                        Awesome!  What a cool title page!

           Jay shudders to himself.  

                                 JAY
                        By the way, did you get a chance to 
                        read that spec about Arthur Miller?
                                 DAVE
                        Yeah - It sucked balls.

                                 JAY
                        Really?  You didn’t find the world 
                        interesting or the connection 
                        between how the early years of the 
                        Cold War reflect similar themes to 
                        today’s uneasy political landscape?

                                 DAVE
                        I didn’t understand anything you 
                        just said.  Was the writer a friend 
                        of yours?

                                 JAY
                        Don’t worry about it.  Thanks.

           Jay goes to pick up another screenplay, on top of a seemingly 
           endless pile, as Dave trots off. 

           But Jay shares a cubicle with CINDY and KAREN, both 20s, who 
           work in the Publicity department, where the most minor of 
           issues become life-changing crises.  Cindy and Karen arrive 
           at their desks, sandwiching Jay, and open takeout lunches.

                                 CINDY
                        This is all bell pepper.  It’s 
                        insane how much bell pepper is in 
                        this Kung Pao.  I’m literally going 
                        to die.  I’m not even hungry. 

           Karen isn’t paying attention to Cindy and is instead staring 
           at her dress.

                                 KAREN
                        I hate that this dress wrinkles.  
                        It wrinkles all day and it’s 
                        stressful.

           Jay puts his noise-cancelling headphones on and turns the 
           volume up as far it will go before preparing for page one of 
           a new screenplay.  

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Cheap beer.  Jay is joined by ZACK and JESS, another exec and 
           an agent trainee, early 30s, as they set up the lone pool 
           table.  

                                 JAY
                        Thanks for coming out, guys.
                                 JESS
                        Lady troubles?

                                 ZACK
                        You have to have a lady to have 
                        lady troubles.

                                 JESS
                        Not necessarily true.

           Jay breaks the rack.  It’s a decent break, but they won’t 
           sink a single ball the entire scene.  Zack goes to line up 
           his shot.

                                 JAY
                        Just another one of those days 
                        questioning my overall existence 
                        and lot in life.

                                 JESS
                        Is it Tuesday already?

                                 ZACK
                        You have a lot?

                                 JAY
                        I feel like Sisyphus.

                                 ZACK
                        I’m pretty sure they have a cream 
                        for that.

                                 JAY
                        No, you know, the Greek myth.  He 
                        was the son of a King who was 
                        forced to roll a massive boulder up 
                        a hill, only to watch it roll back 
                        down, repeatedly, and for eternity.

           Beat.

                                 JESS
                        Well that about sums up my life.  

           Jess and Zack clink glasses.

                                 JAY
                        Isn’t the definition of insanity 
                        doing the same thing over and over 
                        again and expecting a different 
                        result?  Like what are we actually 
                        doing in this town?
                                 JESS
                        Trying to make movies that are both 
                        culturally enriching and 
                        entertaining to the masses?

                                 JAY
                        More people watched a YouTube video 
                        of a drunken panda wandering its 
                        cage than our last two releases 
                        combined. 

                                 ZACK
                        That was a great video though.

                                 JESS
                        I love that panda.  So what’s the 
                        alternative?

                                 ZACK
                        I guess you could always move back 
                        home, have a bunch of kids, and 
                        change your last name so that when 
                        you pop into someone’s Facebook 
                        feed you’re hardly recognizable.

                                 JESS
                        That was oddly specific.

                                 ZACK
                        That’s all my feed is these days.  
                        I feel like I log into someone 
                        else’s Facebook every day.

                                 JAY
                        I’m serious, guys.  Did you know 
                        that The Beatles recorded their 
                        last album - their last album - 
                        when they were just 29 years old.

                                 JESS
                        I’m beginning to think I need a 
                        stronger drink.

           A frustrated beat as Jay thinks of what to say, sincere.

                                 JAY
                        Remember what Murphy said back when 
                        we were interns together?

           INT. MURPHY’S OFFICE 2005 - DAY

           Murphy, 50s, slick, but approachable producer with an air of 
           confidence having survived 30 years in the business.  
           Big corner office.  We cut into the POV of the chair facing 
           opposite his desk, which is slightly raised so he’s looking 
           down on us as he declares straight into the camera:

                                 MURPHY
                        Fuck all the actresses.

           Murphy looks off-screen, confused, like that wasn’t the line 
           he was supposed to deliver.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Jay and Jess give a blank look to a grinning Zack.

                                 JAY
                        What?  No.  No, he said...

           INT. MURPHY’S OFFICE 2005 - DAY

           Murphy addresses the camera again.  Genuine.

                                 MURPHY
                        This whole town likes to say no, 
                        kid.  But if you’re willing to 
                        outwork the other guy, treat people 
                        well, and stand by your opinions 
                        with both passion and conviction 
                        and you push through those no’s 
                        until you get to a yes, well then, 
                        in time, you’ll be running this 
                        place.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           We cut back to our trio.

                                 JAY
                        And I believed him... But it’s been 
                        ten years and what’s changed?  
                        Instead of getting coffee, we’re 
                        getting coverage, but it’s all the 
                        same.  When are we going to do 
                        something that matters?

                                 JESS
                        You don’t have to get coffee 
                        anymore?
                                 JAY
                        And the quality?  Suddenly, we’re 
                        appealing to the lowest common 
                        denominator and competing with 
                        SnapChat for views?

                                 JESS
                        No offense, but Murphy is a 
                        dinosaur.  The guy was making 
                        movies in a different era.  They 
                        were giving out three-picture deals 
                        like they were Tic-Tacs back then. 

                                 ZACK
                        Uh, dude, I’m pretty sure we’re all 
                        going to be holograms in five years 
                        and none of this will matter.  I 
                        say enjoy the ride.

                                 JAY
                        That’s exactly my point.  My 
                        biggest fear is looking up from my 
                        phone one day and realizing life 
                        has passed me by: all these 
                        collective likes and posts turning 
                        into minutes, days, and weeks, and 
                        I can no longer distinguish between 
                        the digital self we project online 
                        and from what’s real, where all the 
                        lines have become so blurred I 
                        don’t even know who I am anymore.

                                 JESS
                        What brought all this on?

           Beat.

                                 JAY
                        You guys read the new Lax Mandis?

                                 ZACK
                        Fuck that guy!

                                 JESS
                        Talentless assclown excuse for a 
                        writer!

                                 ZACK
                        I heard he hates puppies.

                                 JESS
                        I’m pretty sure he’s not allowed 
                        within 500 feet of a school.
                                 ZACK
                        It’s like he falls asleep on his 
                        keyboard, wakes up, and goes: 
                        That’s not bad.

                                 JESS
                        I want to rub his face in his work 
                        and show him: This is what you did!  
                        Look at what you did!

           Jess gets a little caught up in it.  Jay and Zack stare.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        Too much?

                                 JAY
                        You guys are really sweet.  But why 
                        do people keep buying his stuff...?

                                 JESS
                        Simple: People are idiots.  Look - 
                        Don’t let Lax Mandis cause you to 
                        have an existential crisis. That’d 
                        be the most effective thing he’d 
                        ever accomplished in his life. 

                                 JAY
                        I met on the YouTube job.

                                 JESS
                        They could become a real player.

                                 ZACK
                        You could turn Drunk Panda into a 
                        franchise!

                                 JAY
                        I just don’t want to crank out 
                        YouTube videos my whole life.  I’ve 
                        always had a dream of making movies 
                        and that’s not what they do.  I 
                        mean, how do you create a 
                        compelling arc in 30 seconds?

                                 ZACK
                        Give me your phone.

                                 JAY
                        Why?

                                 ZACK
                        I’m about to show you how to create 
                        a compelling arc in 30 seconds.
           Jay hands Zack his phone.  Zack begins typing.

                                 JAY
                        How do you know my password?

                                 ZACK
                        Don’t worry about it.

           Zack opens a dating app and begins swiping.

                                 JAY
                        A dating app, really?

                                 ZACK
                        Pass.  Pass.  

                                 JESS
                             (to Jay)
                        You gonna be all right, chief?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah...  You know, living the dream 
                        can be a real fucking nightmare 
                        sometimes.

                                 JESS
                        Welcome to Hollywood.

           They clink glasses.  

                                 ZACK
                        Oh a match!  

           Jay and Jess look at the phone.

                                 JAY
                        That looks like a head shot.  I 
                        can’t date an actress.

                                 JESS
                        Murphy would be proud.

                                 ZACK
                        You realize if you say you’re not 
                        going to date an actress, you’re 
                        eliminating half of the dating pool 
                        in Los Angeles, right?

                                 JESS
                        Maybe she’s working as an actress 
                        to put herself through medical 
                        school.  Is that a thing?
                                 JAY
                        I don’t think so.

           Zack types a response to the match.

                                 ZACK
                             (reading as he types)
                        You’re cute.  Smiley face.  Let’s 
                        hike Runyon and take selfies.  
                        Send.

           Zack hands back Jay’s phone, proud.  Jay shakes his head and 
           motions for more beers from the bar.  A lot of angry people 
           look like they want to play pool.

           I/E. JAY’S CAR - NIGHT

           A tired Jay sits behind the wheel on Melrose stuck in 
           traffic... because it’s 11:00pm on a Tuesday night, so of 
           course there’s traffic.

           A giant billboard for BARNACLE leers down on him from across 
           the street (think Adam Sandler mugging to the camera with a 
           crab claw for a left hand).  Jay rolls his eyes and turns as 
           the light changes green.  He pulls into the garage of a 
           nondescript apartment building.

           INT. JAY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jay slugs down the hall carrying a few scripts and his iPad.  
           He shuffles past a few people holding beers, hanging out in 
           front of an obvious party with music blaring.  He continues 
           to his door.

           INT. JAY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jay enters.  A nice studio, but a studio nonetheless.  He 
           doesn’t bother flipping on the lights.  He tosses his keys on 
           his dresser, sheds his jacket, exhausted, and crashes onto 
           his bed still in the rest of his clothes.  Bass from the 
           party next door creeps in through the walls.

           The apartment is sparsely furnished, Ikea, we may notice a 
           typewriter, but we definitely notice all the classic movie 
           posters that dominate his walls as if he wished he were 
           making films in a different era (Butch Cassidy, The 
           Producers, Chinatown, Rocky, The Apartment, etc.).  

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. BRONZE PICTURES - DAY

           We match cut to the movie posters hanging on the walls of 
           Bronze Studios.  Let’s just say they’re not Academy winners.  

           Phones ring as the day begins.  Jay strides in, more 
           energized following the previous night, and knocks on Peters’ 
           corner office door.

                                 JAY
                        You wanted to see me?

           Peters waves him in.  His office is filled with memorabilia 
           and contemporary art that nobody understands, himself 
           included. A protein bar is on his desk.

                                 PETERS
                        A couple new things came in this 
                        morning.  We got a link to this 
                        foreign film people are loving, 
                        BLACK GARDEN, may be a new director 
                        to watch out for.  And we also got 
                        a new Goldmeyer script.  It is 
                        supposed to be in the vein of THE 
                        PLAYER, but about a Hollywood 
                        agent.  

                                 JAY
                        Ugh.  I hate reading scripts about 
                        Hollywood.  Pass.

                                 PETERS
                        Could you check them out?

                                 JAY
                        Course.

           Jay starts to leave.

                                 PETERS
                        Oh and what was the name of that 
                        Lax Mandis script again?  LIGHT?

           There goes Jay’s energy.

                                 JAY
                        DARK.  It’s a contained thriller 
                        set in a... closet.

                                 PETERS
                        Is it like PANIC ROOM within a 
                        PANIC ROOM?
                                 JAY
                        Sure.  If that helps you.  Oh, and 
                        there are also orcs.

           Peters stares at him trying to comprehend that last part.

                                 PETERS
                        Whatever.  I heard Tom Cruise is 
                        attaching himself.  Could you suss 
                        it out and see what the deal is? 

                                 JAY
                        To that piece of shit?

                                 PETERS
                        I think he’s just misunderstood.  
                        Scientology is a cruel mistress.

                                 JAY
                        What?  No, that’s not what I meant.

           Jay notices the script coverage is on Peters’ desk.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Is that the coverage?

                                 PETERS
                        Oh, yes!  Dave gave it to me 
                        directly.

                                 JAY
                             (more to himself)
                        That’s annoying...

                                 PETERS
                        Look!  He even solved the Sudoku!

           Peters holds up the Sudoku puzzle and heads with Jay towards 
           the door.  He picks up the protein bar and his gym bag on the 
           way out.

                                 PETERS (CONT’D)
                        I’m late for a meeting, but we’ll 
                        talk it all through later!

           Peters jets off and leaves Jay standing at his assistant’s 
           desk.

                                 JAY
                        Does he always take his gym bag to 
                        meetings?
                                 ASSISTANT
                             (Yes)
                        No?

                                 JAY
                        That’s what I thought.  If you need 
                        me I’ll be the one over there 
                        banging my head against the wall.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        You got it!

                                 JAY
                        By the way, did you ever read that 
                        Arthur Miller spec I gave you?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I’m not that into baseball.

                                 JAY
                        It’s not...

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I’ve just been really busy.

           He tries to look busy, but a Facebook window is visibly open 
           on the Assistant’s computer and CandyCrush plays out on his 
           iPad.  CandyCrush starts to make a noise.  Jay stares at the 
           assistant, who slowly reaches for the iPad to shut it off 
           without breaking eye contact with Jay.  He shuts it off.

           Jay’s phone buzzes to break the awkwardness.  A Bumble reply 
           from Liz:

           “I love Runyon!  Can I bring my purse dog? ;)”

           Jay grins and lets out a laugh.  The Assistant continues.

                                 ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        We can get an intern to do coverage 
                        on that script if you want.

           Jay’s focus stays on his phone.

                                 JAY
                        Don’t worry about it.

           He walks away, upbeat, typing out a reply.  When the coast is 
           clear, the Assistant snatches his iPad back and starts 
           crushing that candy.
           EXT. HIPSTER BAR - NIGHT

           Pick one in Silver Lake.  

           INT. HIPSTER BAR - NIGHT

           Lots of ironic hats and skinny jeans fill out the place.  Jay 
           and LIZ, 30, sit at the bar with elaborate cocktails.  Mid-
           conversation.

                                 LIZ
                        It probably wasn’t until I watched 
                        the music video for Madonna’s Like 
                        A Prayer that I knew I really 
                        wanted to be an actress.

           Jay shifts in his chair.  Can we get the check, please?

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m messing with you.  I don’t 
                        know, there’s something about the 
                        power of the stage and being in 
                        front of an audience that makes me 
                        feel alive.

           She’s sincere.  Jay takes it in.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Plus I suck at math.

                                 JAY
                        Fuck math.

                                 LIZ
                        Look - I realize it’s a bit crazy 
                        to want to act, but so’s this town.  
                        And I know I’d always regret it if 
                        I didn’t at least try, so I’m 
                        giving it a shot.  

                                 JAY
                        I’ll drink to that.

           They cheers their glasses.  Jay looks around as the place 
           begins to fill up.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  This place is really 
                        happening.
                                 LIZ
                        Yeah.  I’m surprised they let you 
                        in without a scarf.  It’s like 
                        you’re not even trying.

           A scarfy, skinny jeans couple walks by them.

                                 JAY
                        Call me old fashioned, but I prefer 
                        the girls’ jeans to be tighter than 
                        my own.

                                 LIZ
                        You’re a man of principle.  So what 
                        about you then?  You got my story.

                                 JAY
                        I kill dreams.

                                 LIZ
                        Is that a union thing?

                                 JAY
                             (by rote)
                        I work in development for a company 
                        that finances and produces movies.  
                        Primarily, I’m the guy that decides 
                        if that screenplay you’ve been 
                        working so hard on in between 
                        shifts at Starbucks goes onto the 
                        next level.  But most likely, I’m 
                        going to toss it onto a pile of 
                        countless others and tell you to 
                        come back when you have Bradley 
                        Cooper attached.

                                 LIZ
                        Harsh.  At least Starbucks has good 
                        benefits.  So where does the money 
                        come from?

                                 JAY
                        Q-tips.  

                                 LIZ
                        Q-tips?

                                 JAY
                        The owner is the son of some 
                        billionaire.  Apparently, there’s a 
                        lot of q-tip money out there.

           They laugh at the absurdity.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        He’s never around.  I honestly 
                        think he just wants to walk red 
                        carpets and hit on actresses.

                                 LIZ
                        Who doesn’t?  Okay.  I get what 
                        your job is, but there are a lot of 
                        other easier ways to make money.  
                        Why stick it out here for the Q-tip 
                        King?

                                 JAY
                        That should really be our company 
                        name.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m serious!

           Jay doesn’t like getting serious, but he relents. 

                                 JAY
                        Ah Well I guess the connection 
                        stems from my dad.  He used to work 
                        in advertising and, when I was 
                        really young, he’d put me in his 
                        commercials and let me pretend to 
                        work the camera. This makes me feel 
                        close to him or like I’m following 
                        in his footsteps.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s really sweet.

                                 JAY
                        Once upon a time anyway...

           He starts to trail off.

                                 LIZ
                        What do you mean?

                                 JAY
                        Lately it feels like the whole 
                        industry has become more of a 
                        business with nobody willing to 
                        take a risk, you know?  I try to 
                        think of what would make my father 
                        proud and I can’t imagine what he’d 
                        say if he saw my name on something 
                        like BARNACLE...
                                 LIZ
                        He’d be proud that you did 
                        something - That you put something 
                        into this world.  And taught us all 
                        about the dangers of deep sea 
                        diving through toxic waters.

                                 JAY
                        Thank you... 

                                 LIZ
                        Forgive me if this is offensive, 
                        but why don’t you just quit...?

                                 JAY
                        I can’t.  I don’t want to believe 
                        I’ve spent the last ten years 
                        working towards nothing.  And I 
                        can’t pay rent on a quarter-life 
                        crisis.  Plus I still have this 
                        foolish dream of seeing my name in 
                        the end credits just once.

                                 LIZ
                        So why not produce on your own?

                                 JAY
                        I would, but I actually haven’t 
                        seen a movie through production yet 
                        and I feel like I need that 
                        experience first.

                                 LIZ
                        Well it’s all a means to an end, 
                        right?  I’m waitressing my ass off 
                        right now and taking whatever parts 
                        I can.  You have to do a few for 
                        them before you can do one for 
                        yourself.

                                 JAY
                        Don’t waitress your entire ass off.  
                        I kind of like it right now.

                                 LIZ
                        Nice to have you back with us.

                                 JAY
                        Sorry, you’re completely right.  
                        But sometimes I can’t help but feel 
                        like I’m continually pushing a 
                        boulder up a hill only to see it 
                        fall back down.
                                 LIZ
                        Just be sure to move out of the way 
                        as the boulder rolls back down.

           Jay laughs to himself.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Sisyphus, right?

           He lights up at that.

                                 JAY
                        Yes!

                                 LIZ
                        I would’ve much preferred to have 
                        been Atlas.  So much easier to 
                        shrug off the world.  

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, he probably has serious back 
                        problems though...

           She finishes her drink.  Jay’s falling...

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        How about one more?

           They share a smile and then Liz looks apprehensive.

                                 LIZ
                        I’d love to, but... this place 
                        closes in an hour and I’m not sure 
                        that’s enough time for him to make 
                        us another drink.

           Jay laughs and motions for the bartender, who is splashing 
           the essence of an exotic tree leaf into a new concoction.  
           It’s a spiritual experience.  

           INT. BRONZE STUDIOS - DAY

           A big glass fishbowl of a conference room.  More chairs than 
           people.  Jay sits around a table with Peters, Assistant, 
           Dave, MARTIN, 30s/marketing, and KELLY, 30s/sales.  Peters

           Jay looks unengaged, doodling an image of Sisyphus getting 
           squashed by a boulder.

                        Jon Snow is totally alive.  My 
                        friend’s cousin saw him at EP/LP 
                        last week and she said he still had 
                        his beard, which means they’re not 
                        done shooting yet.

                                 JAY
                        Or it means he likes facial hair.

                        Interesting.  

                                 DAVE
                        I was reading some fan fiction 
                        online and there are credible 
                        rumors saying Peter Dinklage is 
                        going to have an affair with one of 
                        the dragons this season.

                                 JAY
                        How would that even...?

                        Credible rumors.

                                 LYLE
                             (off-screen)
                        Hello?!  Does anybody work here?

           The demeanor suddenly shifts and everyone straightens up.

                                 PETERS
                        Shit.  Is that Brannigan?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I thought he was in Spain.

                                 KELLY
                        I thought he was in jail.

                                 MARTIN
                        Oh no, they let him out.

                                 KELLY
                        Oh good.

           LYLE BRANNIGAN, 30s, is seen outside the glass walls of the 
           conference room wielding a golf club.  Confident in tattered 
           jeans and flip-flops, he enters the room and perches on the 
           table.  
           He could be confused for a homeless person, but instead he’s 
           the overweight billionaire Q-tip heir trying his hand in 
           Hollywood.

                                 PETERS
                        Mr. Brannigan!  Didn’t realize you 
                        were in town. 

           Brannigan’s mind is elsewhere.

                                 LYLE
                        She said she was 18... 

                                 PETERS
                        What’s that?

           He perks back up.

                                 LYLE
                        Did you know that Dubai doesn’t 
                        have an extradition treaty with the 
                        US?  These are just things you 
                        learn on the road.

           Beat.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Well what’d I miss?  What am I 
                        interrupting?

                                 PETERS
                        We were just going over some 
                        estimates for Cannes.  

                                 LYLE
                        Oh great!  France.  Now they DO 
                        have an extradition treaty with the 
                        US.

                                 PETERS
                        Right... Uh... Kelly: How are the 
                        numbers projecting for ALIVE AGAIN?

                                 KELLY
                        We should be able to hit our 
                        targets.  Except in Japan.

                                 MARTIN
                        Zombies don’t do well in Japan.

                                 LYLE
                        Why don’t zombies do well in Japan?
                                 KELLY
                        It’s a cultural thing.  They do 
                        better with ghosts and spirits and 
                        the like.

           He’s still confused.

                                 JAY
                        Zombies are more Western.  It’d be 
                        like if we were to make a movie 
                        about an American ninja.

                                 DAVE
                        Can we?  That sounds awesome.

                                 LYLE
                        Do I smell pancakes?  What if we 
                        make the zombie also a ghost?

                                 JAY
                        I think that’s a double negative...

           Lyle stares.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        But we can certainly look into it.

                                 LYLE
                        Great!  What else?  

           Jay clears his throat and jumps in, trying to act casual, but 
           with obvious excitement.

                                 JAY
                             (in one breath)
                        I found this spec about Arthur 
                        Miller and Elia Kazan.  It tracks 
                        their relationship from Death of a 
                        Salesman through their respective 
                        affairs with Marilyn Monroe and 
                        also their time in front of the 
                        House Un-American Activities 
                        Committee.  It’s a complex 
                        character piece that also captures 
                        the time perfectly and could really 
                        resonate with today’s politics.  I 
                        think it could be a real awards 
                        play and expand our brand.

           Beat to the room.  Peters looks nervous.

                                 LYLE
                        Hmm... I like Marilyn...
           Was that an answer?

                                 PETERS
                        Jay: Did you take a look at that 
                        BLACK GARDEN film I gave you?

           Jay is still wondering about Arthur Miller, but...

                                 JAY
                        Uh, yes.  Russian film.  It was 
                        actually a really poetic and 
                        nuanced portrait of a man coming to 
                        terms with the end of his life; 
                        wrestling his demons from the war 
                        as he reconciles with each of his 
                        estranged children.  Beautifully 
                        shot and paced.  He’s definitely a 
                        director I think we should bring 
                        in.

                                 PETERS
                        He’s coming on to direct the Lax 
                        Mandis project.  

                                 JAY
                        He’s a hack.

                                 PETERS
                        This is a new project that’s 
                        getting a lot of heat right now.  
                        Tom Cruise is starring and the 
                        studio is looking for a partner.

                                 JAY
                        Oh no.

                                 LYLE
                        I love it already.  What’s the 
                        pitch?

                                 PETERS
                        It’s kind of like PANIC ROOM set 
                        within a PANIC ROOM.  Right, Jay?

                                 JAY
                        It’s nothing like PANIC ROOM.  It’s 
                        just a contained thriller set in 
                        a... closet.  I don’t understand 
                        what people are responding to.

                                 LYLE
                        Well if it’s contained at least we 
                        can make it for a budget...  Is the 
                        closet a metaphor?
                                 JAY
                        It’s a metaphor for a bad 
                        screenplay.

                                 PETERS
                        We’ll bring them in for a meeting.

                                 LYLE
                        Hmm.  Great.  Keep me posted.  I 
                        left q-tips for everyone at the 
                        front desk by the way.

           Lyle wanders out.  The room sighs relief.  Jay looks shell-
           shocked as his cartoon Sisyphus winks at him from beneath the 
           rock.

           INT. BRONZE STUDIOS - DAY

           Jay hunches over his phone in his cubicle.  Tossing a stress 
           ball in the air.

                                 JAY
                        I can’t believe this is happening.

           INT. THE AGENCY - DAY

           We intercut back-and-forth with Jess on the phone at The 
           Agency.  Sleek, modern office building that they’ll be paying 
           off for the next 10 years.  Jess sits in a bullpen and 
           scrambles to keep up as people hurry around her and drop 
           papers on her desk.  She is stressed and only half-paying 
           attention to Jay.  

                                 JESS
                        From what I hear a lot of people 
                        want that project, so who knows 
                        what will happen.

                                 JAY
                        You could literally put the word 
                        “contained” in front of anything 
                        and people will get excited.  It’s 
                        a contained thriller set in the 
                        trunk of a car.  It’s a contained 
                        thriller set in an air balloon.  
                        Give me a break...

                                 JESS
                             (distracted)
                        I’ve got a contained thriller in my 
                        ass right now.
           Jay stops tossing the stress ball.

                                 JAY
                        What?

           A senior agent passes by Jess’s desk.

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        Hey Jess - Were you able to do that 
                        thing?

           Jess stops her scrambling to focus on the agent.

                                 JESS
                             (incredulous)
                        That thing?  Do you mean was I able 
                        to find a lead role for Vince 
                        Vaughn’s second cousin?  No, I 
                        wasn’t able to do that “thing” and 
                        if I get assigned one more actor’s 
                        cousin or nephew or gardener I may 
                        shoot somebody.

           She says the last statement to the room with a smile, but no 
           one cares.  The senior agent stares blankly until.

                                 SENIOR AGENT
                        That could actually be a great 
                        reality show.  Celebrity Siblings: 
                        In the Shadows of the Stars...  
                        Thanks, Jess!

           He rushes off.

                                 JESS
                        Ugh, sorry, Jay.  I feel you.  But 
                        come out tonight!  Some director is 
                        having a party in the hills and he 
                        invited the whole agency.  There 
                        will be free alcohol...

                                 JAY
                        There’s no such thing as free 
                        alcohol.  A hundred bucks says I’ll 
                        end up talking to some quote 
                        unquote “digital influencer” 
                        telling me how his company is 
                        changing the game by optioning 
                        Buzzfeed’s back catalogue.

                                 JESS
                        That’s the spirit.  I’ll text you 
                        the address.
           We go back to Jay as he hangs up the phone.

                                 CINDY
                        My sister discovered this new Kale-
                        flavored vodka that’s supposed to 
                        really exfoliate the skin.  I’m 
                        obsessed.

                                 KAREN
                        Do you think it would count for my 
                        juice cleanse?

                                 CINDY
                        Definitely. We’re going to be so 
                        skinny people are going to think we 
                        have an eating disorder.

                                 KAREN
                        I literally may die.

                                 JAY
                        Way ahead of you.

           EXT. MANSION IN THE HILLS - NIGHT

           It’s obnoxious, but a nice view.  Fancy cars litter the 
           driveway and there’s a giant waterfall in the middle with 
           water spewing out of a tiger’s mouth.  Jay and Liz walk up to 
           the door.

                                 JAY
                        Well this guy’s not 
                        overcompensating...

           INT. MANSION IN THE HILLS - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Jay and Liz take a moment to survey the scene from the 
           doorway.  A mixed mid-level industry crowd mill about - most 
           of them on cell phones.  

           In a room to their left, a group of people look like aliens 
           as they demo new Oculus software and reach out to the sky as 
           if they’re on drugs.  It’s oddly sexual.  Jay and Liz stare 
           for a beat. 

                                 JAY
                        The future scares me.

                                 LIZ
                        Drinks?

           Jay refocuses and sees people outside.
                                 JAY
                        Outside.

           EXT. MANSION IN THE HILLS - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Pool.  Obnoxious view continues.  There’s an ice tiger 
           sculpture.  Upscale crowd.

                                 JAY
                        Wow.  This is a classy affair.

           A waitress approaches them with a tray of drinks.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Jello shots?

                                 JAY
                        I take back my last statement.

           They both grab shots and cheers.  It doesn’t go down easy.

                                 LIZ
                        Ugh.  Tastes like college.

           They immediately grab beers from another passing waiter to 
           wash it down and Jay leads them over to Blake, 30, agent 
           trainee, mid-conversation with two execs.  Blake is upbeat.

                                 BLAKE
                        So we’ve got the retreat in a few 
                        weeks and hopefully I’ll get the 
                        official bump then, but things are 
                        great.  I’ve got a handful of hip 
                        pockets at this point, but overall 
                        the partners have been supportive.

                                 EXEC #1
                        Congrats.  That’s really great.  
                        We’ve got to say hi to the host, 
                        but let’s catch up later.

                                 BLAKE
                        Thanks!  Sounds good.

           The execs walk off.

                                 JAY
                        That’s great to hear, Blake.  I 
                        knew things were touch-and-go there 
                        for a minute.

           Blake says the following with a smile, still strangely 
           upbeat.
                                 BLAKE
                        Oh I hate my job.

                                 JAY
                        But you just...

                                 BLAKE
                        I’m completely miserable.  I love 
                        it.  I haven’t had more than 4 
                        hours of sleep in three years and 
                        they’ve been promising me a 
                        promotion for the past two.  But 
                        who cares?  Not this guy.  Haha!

                                 JAY
                        Well this is Liz...

                                 LIZ
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 BLAKE
                        Pleasure.

           Zack and Jess walk up with beers.

                                 ZACK
                        Jay!  You made it!

                                 JAY
                        Hey guys!  Zack, Jess, this is Liz.

                                 ZACK
                        The actress!

           He goes in for a hug.

                                 JESS
                        He can’t do anything for your 
                        career.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh I’m painfully aware.

                                 JESS
                        I like her.

                                 JAY
                        And do you guys know Blake?  He 
                        works over at ITA.

                                 ZACK
                        How do you like it over there?
                                 BLAKE
                        Really great.  Really solid people.

           Jay and Liz share a look.

                                 JESS
                        I need to find a bathroom.

                                 LIZ
                        I’ll join you.

           They walk off.  The guys look after.

                                 BLAKE
                        She’s cute.  Significant other?

                                 JAY
                        She’s an other.  I’m not sure how 
                        significant yet.

                                 BLAKE
                        Lot of talent here, Zack.  Should 
                        we try our luck?

           Jay notices Zack took out his phone and is swiping.

                                 JAY
                        Are you seriously on a dating app 
                        right now?  These are some of the 
                        most beautiful women in LA.

                                 ZACK
                        None of these girls want me or 
                        Blake to hit on them right now. 

                                 BLAKE
                             (deflated)
                        He’s right.

                                 JAY
                        You’re not so bad...

           Zack pauses from swiping.

                                 ZACK
                        It’s not that.  It’s more taboo to 
                        meet someone out or in a bar than 
                        it is online nowadays.  

           Zack scans the area and motions to a few girls at a side 
           table.
                                 ZACK (CONT’D)
                        Sure, Blake, you could approach 
                        that girl, maybe even say something 
                        witty, but she’s still going to 
                        judge you along with her friends.  
                        Now, if she knew you were a Gemini, 
                        had a steady job, and liked 
                        cuddling up to Game of Thrones on a 
                        Sunday night, she may be down.  
                        Either way, you’re both telling 
                        your friends you met at Whole 
                        Foods.

           Zack goes back to swiping.

                                 JAY
                        But you’re none of those things.

                                 ZACK
                        So?  It’s the internet...

           Blake shuffles out his phone.

                                 BLAKE
                        Which app do you like?

           Jay rolls his eyes and takes another swig of his beer.

           INT. MANSION IN THE HILLS - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Liz checks her makeup in the mirror while Jess fiddles with 
           something we can’t yet see.

                                 LIZ
                        So how long have you known Jay?

                                 JESS
                        We started in the mailroom at The 
                        Agency together years ago.  He’s 
                        one of the good ones.  Not 
                        completely dead inside and still 
                        with a glimmer of hope that the 
                        industry can do good.  It’s kind of 
                        sweet in a sad way.

                                 LIZ
                        That qualifies as one of the good 
                        ones?

                                 JESS
                        This town has a twisted sense of 
                        humor.  You have to stay grounded 
                        somehow - especially these days.
           Jess bends down to snort a line - that’s what she was doing - 
           and then shoots back up.  She collects herself and offers one 
           to Liz.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        Bump?

                                 LIZ
                        I gave at the office.  Thanks.

           Jess shrugs and goes back down to do another line.  A couple 
           of girls walk in.

                                 GIRL #1
                        Can you believe Mandis bought this 
                        place off of the grosses for BRITE?

                                 GIRL #2 
                        I guess it also doesn’t hurt when 
                        your dad directed some of the best 
                        comedies of all-time.

           Jess and Liz look to each other and rush out.

           EXT. MANSION IN THE HILLS - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Zack and Jay share blank looks as an animated TREVOR, 30s, 
           rattles on.  CARLY, 18, hipster chic, with her breasts 
           popping out, looks bored as she texts.

                                 TREVOR
                        It was hard to leave traditional 
                        film, but I’m working with a lot of 
                        digital influencers now, like Carly 
                        here, who have instant access to 
                        over a million followers.  We’re 
                        working on the first-ever feature 
                        film for Vine.

                                 ZACK
                        Aren’t Vines only 7 seconds long?

                                 TREVOR
                        We’re going to string enough of 
                        them together where it makes a 
                        narrative.  It’s going to be like 
                        an interactive choose-your-own 
                        adventure for a new generation.  
                        And then the finished film will be 
                        available on YouTube for download.

                                 JAY
                        How’d you build your following?
                                 CARLY
                             (without looking up)
                        I’m a life coach.

           Beat as they process that nugget.  Carly just wanders off, 
           head buried in her phone the whole time.  

                                 JAY
                        So what happens when these “loyal 
                        followers,” i.e. what I can only 
                        assume are countless hormonal 
                        teenage boys, grow up and get jobs 
                        and don’t have time for Carly’s 
                        mindless selfies anymore?  They 
                        can’t really expect to maintain 
                        these audiences, can they? 

           Trevor and Zack are distracted as a few models walk by in 
           short skirts.  

                                 ZACK
                        No man, you’re totally right...

           Blake heads back over eagerly with an Oculus headset. 

                                 BLAKE
                        Did you guys try the Oculus yet?  
                        It’s virtual porn.  They say it’s a 
                        potential 50 billion dollar 
                        business.

           Zack and Trevor fight over the Oculus trying to get a look.  

                                 JAY
                        If that’s not a sign of the 
                        apocalypse, I don’t know what is.  
                        I need some air...

           But they’re not paying attention.  And Jay wanders off just 
           before Liz and Jess rush back up.

                                 LIZ
                        Hey!  Where’d Jay go?  

           Zack and Trevor are distracted as they fight over sneaking 
           peaks into the Oculus.  Liz looks around.

                                 JESS
                        We need to get out of here.

                                 ZACK
                             (still distracted)
                        We just got here.
                                 JESS
                             (re the Oculus)
                        So does that count as a threesome 
                        if you’re both sharing it?

           Zack immediately lets go.  

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        Idiots.  This is Lax Mandis’ house.

                                 ZACK
                        Oh this is going to be awesome.

                                 TREVOR
                        Mandis?  Fuck that guy.  I’m 
                        convinced he gets his ideas from 
                        fortune cookies.

           The gang glances around the party looking for Jay.  Liz gets 
           out her cellphone and starts texting Jay.

           Jay wanders to a side couch by the pool and plops down.  He 
           doesn’t look so hot, but takes another passing Jello shot 
           anyway.  A few execs linger around him texting.  He overhears 
           the conversation of two people in front of him. 

                                 EXEC #2
                        It puts you in a virtual theater, 
                        so it’s just like you’re going to 
                        the movies, but without having to 
                        leave your home!

                                 JAY
                             (to himself)
                        I think I’m going to be sick...

           A MAN sitting next to Jay can’t help but laugh.  Jay turns to 
           him.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Can you believe this?  I’m scared 
                        for what this town’s future looks 
                        like.

                                 MAN
                        Right.  Although you can’t really 
                        fight the future, can you?

                                 JAY
                        But it doesn’t mean you have to lay 
                        down and rid yourself of all 
                        creativity either.
                                 MAN
                        True.  But the secret to change is 
                        to focus all of your energy, not on 
                        fighting the old, but on building 
                        the new.

                                 JAY
                        What is that?  Plato?

                                 MAN
                        I dunno, I read it on a fortune 
                        cookie.

           They cheers their drinks as the execs continue in front of 
           them.

                                 EXEC #4
                        I’m really trying to capture an 
                        authenticity that I feel is missing 
                        in today’s entertainment.  We’re 
                        inundated with all of these 
                        superhero movies, escapism for 
                        escapism, but nobody is doing 
                        anything that’s really connecting 
                        with audiences anymore.

           Perhaps some hope?  Jay and the Man look intrigued.

                                 EXEC #4 (CONT’D)
                        So I’m working on a film where 
                        we’ve pulled all of the most 
                        popular hashtags across social 
                        media and written the entire 
                        screenplay in hashtag.  These are 
                        real people, using real hashtags.  

           The Man cracks up, but Jay can’t help himself.

                                 JAY
                        I’m sorry, I couldn’t help but 
                        overhear.  Did you say hashtag?

                                 EXEC #4
                        I call it: hashtag hashtag.

           He does the international symbol for hashtag with his hands.  
           Jay is speechless.  The Man is still laughing.  

                                 EXEC #4 (CONT’D)
                        Do you get it?  Because it’s a 
                        hashtag.
           Exec #2 now does the symbol with his hands (because that’s 
           helping).  Jay stands up, agitated and a bit tipsy, but he 
           can’t stop what’s been building from coming out.

                                 JAY
                        Oh, I get it.  Years from now, when 
                        historians look back and wonder at 
                        what point did society decide to 
                        give up, they’re going to point to 
                        this night, this conversation 
                        actually, as the night that all 
                        original thought came to die. 

           Exec #4 is taken aback and looks around for help.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter with you? All of 
                        you? Can’t you see how 
                        desensitizing these apps are making 
                        us?  Virtual sex? We can literally 
                        go fuck ourselves now?  And we 
                        wonder why people can’t sit still 
                        for two hours in a theater anymore, 
                        it’s because of people like Mr. 
                        Hashtag over here. Hashtag if you 
                        say hashtag one more time I’m going 
                        to beat you over the head with a 
                        hashtag until it knocks some sense 
                        into you.

                                 EXEC #4
                        I actually don’t know how that 
                        would be possible...

                                 MAN
                        Come on, man, they’re just having 
                        fun.

                                 JAY
                        No! When did we become complacent 
                        to churn out the same recycled 
                        mindless garbage? Instead of taking 
                        risks, we’re worried about how many 
                        likes we’re getting as our heads 
                        are constantly bowed at a 45 degree 
                        angle to see how many people are 
                        validating our every thought.  It’s 
                        all bullshit.  But we perpetuate 
                        the cycle until our attention spans 
                        are less than a second long and we 
                        can’t focus on anything meaningful 
                        because we’re too busy seeing what 
                        Zack had for breakfast in the hefe 
                        filter.  
                                 ZACK
                             (aside)
                        It was an acai bowl. 

                                 JAY
                        And it’s polluting and seeping into 
                        everything we do and how we live.  
                        But is what we’re gaining by 
                        looking at our devices really worth 
                        what we’re losing by not being in 
                        the moment, connected to those 
                        around us?  We’re caught in a 
                        constant stutter step checking 
                        everyone’s statuses, but that’s not 
                        real.  And the shit we’re putting 
                        on screen these days?

           Liz and Jess try to get Jay’s attention to stop to no avail.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        End of Watch meets Lord of the 
                        Rings?  Gravity Underwater?  
                        Barnacle?  It’s like we’re 
                        literally reaching into the trash 
                        and gluing old screenplays 
                        together.  And then we wonder why 
                        box office continues to go down 
                        while people would rather watch 
                        Carly for 7 seconds a day.

           Carly looks up from her phone for the first time.  Huh?

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Why aren’t we demanding more from 
                        ourselves?  We all got into this 
                        industry for a reason.  Let’s 
                        remind ourselves how good we can be 
                        when we make something real, 
                        something authentic, something that 
                        connects us, as people, and speaks 
                        to our hearts and minds.  Something 
                        that doesn’t have to be a sequel or 
                        a superhero.  We’re better than the 
                        sewer-dwelling Lax Mandis’s of the 
                        world.

           Jay, exhausted, pleads to a lost audience.  Silence.  Zack 
           begins a slow clap, but Jess punches his arm to stop.

           And, of course, the Man finally stands up to confront Jay.  6 
           foot 2 inches of douchebag, he is LAX MANDIS, lanky, 
           overgrown man-child.  Lax greets our hero with a smile.
                                 LAX
                        Hi, Lax Mandis.  I don’t think I 
                        ever got your name...

           Lax puts out his hand to shake.  Jay looks uneasy.  His eyes 
           narrow.  He looks at the face that encompasses all that 
           disgusts him with the industry and his insides begin to 
           broil.

           Jay stares daggers through that smug, privileged look on 
           Lax’s face.  His crooked smile taunting Jay.  Is he going to 
           punch him?  His fists clench.  The crowd looks nervous. 

           Jay looks like this is his moment, his righteous moment where 
           he finally rights all the wrongs in this world by telling Lax 
           off in the most victorious of fashions in front of all of his 
           peers... but instead he leans over and vomits into the pool. 

           Lax takes a step back and tilts his head sideways as Jay 
           heaves.

                                 JESS
                             (to a stunned Liz)
                        Well there goes that last glimmer 
                        of hope.

           Blake in full Oculus gear appears on the lawn in the 
           background humping the grass.  Oblivious.

           EXT. MANSION IN THE HILLS - STREET CORNER - NIGHT

           Jess, Zack, and a slumped-over Jay sit in a row on the curb.  
           An Uber driver pulls up.

                                 UBER #1
                        Are you Phil?

                                 JESS
                        Not us.

                                 ZACK
                        Uber is like a drunken bat signal.  
                        You just have to be sober enough to 
                        touch a button and, like magic, 
                        Raul in a Toyota Prius suddenly 
                        appears to take you home.  Thanks, 
                        Raul, I almost slept in that 
                        bush...

                                 JAY
                        Where’d Liz go?
                                 JESS
                        She got an uber.

                                 JAY
                        Fuck.  I should call her.

                                 JESS
                        Don’t worry about it.  We’ve all 
                        been there.

                                 JAY
                        Really? Because I just vomited in a 
                        pool in front of all my colleagues.

                                 JESS
                        Well I haven’t been there there, 
                        but I know how you feel.

           Another Uber pulls up.

                                 UBER #2
                        Are you Bryan?

                                 ZACK
                        Not us.

           The driver moves on.

                                 JESS
                        So you let off some steam.  Big 
                        deal.

                                 ZACK
                        Cheer up.  I got you a souvenir.

           Zack hands him an Oculus.  Another Uber pulls up.

                                 JESS
                        I don’t think you were supposed to 
                        take those.

                                 JAY
                        I just want to go home.

           Jess regards him.

                                 UBER #3
                        Are you Carlos?

           Zack is about to say something, but-

                                 JESS
                        Yes, we’re Carlos!  Come on.
                                 ZACK
                        What are the chances you’re 
                        actually going to see him again 
                        anyway?  Barnacle will be a distant 
                        memory by tomorrow.

           Jess pulls Jay up and they all hop into the car.  The Uber 
           driver pulls away.  A guy, presumably Carlos, is on his phone 
           looking around.

           INT. BRONZE PICTURES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Lax Mandis sits smug alongside Karl (the director), Peters, 
           and Lyle.  Karl is an intense Russian man in his 50s who 
           looks like he doesn’t speak much English, so he nods along 
           instead.  

           Jay looks like he may throw up again, but is hanging in.

                                 PETERS
                        Barnacle!  Wow.  Just wow.

                                 LAX
                             (smug)
                        They said a comedic version of THE 
                        FLY couldn’t be done -

                                 JAY
                             (rubbing his head)
                        Nobody said that.

           Lyle shoots him a look.

                                 LAX
                        But $120M later and we’re already 
                        working on the sequel.

                                 LYLE
                        Really great stuff.  So tell us 
                        more about DARK?

                                 KARL
                        When I read Lax screenplay, it like 
                        I little boy on countryside. The 
                        vast expanse of air and beauty as I 
                        run through the reeds, free...  
                        Until the soldiers came, took my 
                        mother.  Helpless, I escape inward 
                        and use imagination to drown out 
                        the screams. Hiding for what felt 
                        like years as the terrors closed in 
                        around me.
           Well that was unexpected.  Lax jumps in.

                                 LAX
                        It’s like PANIC ROOM set inside a 
                        PANIC ROOM.

                                 KARL
                        Yes, so much panic.

                                 LYLE
                        Well we all couldn’t be more 
                        excited to partner with the studio 
                        on this one.  We think it’s really 
                        special.

           Lyle reaches over to shake Lax’s hand.  All smiles.

                                 KARL
                        So much panic...

           INT. BRONZE PICTURES - PETER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Peters, Lyle, Jay confer.  Peters has an energy bar.  He’s 
           starting to look a little heavier.  Dave hands coffee out to 
           everyone.

                                 PETERS
                        Did anybody else get any of that?

                                 LYLE
                        It doesn’t matter.  It’s Tom Cruise 
                        in a genre thriller.  We’ll sell 
                        the shit out of foreign and hope it 
                        hits in China.  Are there any 
                        Chinese elements?

                                 DAVE
                        Maybe you can make one of the Orcs 
                        Chinese?

                                 LYLE
                        That’s not a bad idea.  Figure it 
                        out, guys.  Now where the hell are 
                        those pancakes?!

           Lyle leaves the room in a hurry with Dave.

                                 JAY
                        It just feels like we’re really 
                        reaching here with the screenplay.
                                 PETERS
                        Tom Cruise signed on.  An actor of 
                        his caliber wouldn’t do it if it 
                        wasn’t good.

                                 JAY
                        I’m going to refrain from 
                        commenting on that.

           They both look to the wall at a poster of a generic-looking 
           action comedy starring Robert DeNiro called: Grandpa’s Last 
           Stand.

                                 PETERS
                        Nonetheless.  This is happening.  
                        Lax did have one kind of odd 
                        request though.

                                 JAY
                        What...?

                                 PETERS
                        He wants you on set.

           Jay looks dead inside.

           EXT. THE STEPHEN MURPHY COMPANY - DAY

           A strip mall off Ventura in the valley.  Dry cleaners, 
           massage parlor, pet store, Subway, and a generic sign for The 
           Stephen Murphy Company.

                                 MURPHY
                             (V.O.)
                        You’re asking me for advice?

           INT. THE STEPHEN MURPHY COMPANY - DAY

           Movie posters from the 80s/90s hang on the walls.  There is a 
           lifer assistant, CAROL, 50s, sitting outside the one office, 
           which looks like it hasn’t been updated in two decades.  
           Carol plays Pokemon Go on her phone.

           Stephen MURPHY, 60s, weathered from the industry and a bit 
           resigned, sits behind his desk.  Jay opposite.

                                 JAY
                        You gave me my first internship 
                        back in college.  You’re the reason 
                        I thought I could carve out a 
                        career in this town.  I really 
                        value your opinion.
                                 MURPHY
                        Lean in close, kid, I’m going to 
                        tell you a secret.

           Jay leans in.  Murphy throws a script at his face.

                                 MURPHY (CONT’D)
                        Take the job!  For the love of... 
                        I’m working in a strip mall in the 
                        valley.  My phones aren’t exactly 
                        ringing.

           They’re not.  Although Carol is about to catch a Pokemon.

                                 JAY
                        I hate pretending to be a cog in 
                        the machine.  I feel like I’m 
                        perpetuating the same bullshit and 
                        whatever conscience I may have had 
                        is yelling at me to stop.  At what 
                        point do we sacrifice our morals 
                        and righteous indignation and 
                        just... sell out?

                                 MURPHY
                        This point.  Right now.  This is 
                        the point.  Righteous indignation?  
                        Do I have to remind you, I’m 
                        working in a strip mall in the 
                        valley?  I’m pretty sure guys are 
                        getting happy endings next door 
                        while I’m in here reading scripts 
                        by UCLA students reimagining old 
                        Disney properties.  Beauty and the 
                        Beast from the point of view of the 
                        clock?  Go fuck yourself.  

                                 JAY
                        The clock?  I would’ve gone with 
                        the candlestick.

                                 MURPHY
                        I am telling you, it is a slippery 
                        slope.  You’re in the game!  Use 
                        this opportunity to learn how to  
                        handle a production on your own and 
                        then you can do your own thing.  
                        Just put up with it for a little 
                        bit longer.

                                 JAY
                        You don’t think I’m selling out?
                                 MURPHY
                        What I wouldn’t give to sell out.  
                        I’d love to sell out.  Instead, I’m 
                        working in a strip mall in the 
                        valley where the highlight of my 
                        week is Marta at the Dry Cleaners 
                        giving me a discount on my blazers.

                                 JAY
                        It actually sounds like you have a 
                        really nice community here.

                                 MURPHY
                        What I wouldn’t give to go back to 
                        the 90s.  When all you needed to 
                        get something green lit was half an 
                        idea and a cheap hook.  Arnold 
                        Schwarzenegger pregnant?  We made 
                        that movie.  That actually 
                        happened.  You remember that, 
                        Carol?

                                 CAROL
                             (without looking up from 
                              her phone)
                        You set women back 20 years.

                                 JAY
                        But that’s exactly my point.  
                        What’s changed?  Rather, what are 
                        we doing to change it?

                                 MURPHY
                        Kid, you can’t change it.  This is 
                        Hollywood.  You just have to make 
                        the most of it and put something 
                        out there that hopefully sells some 
                        popcorn.  And do enough drugs in 
                        the interim to swallow your pride 
                        and get you through each day.

           Jay gets up to leave and pauses at the door.

                                 JAY
                        Right.  It’s a cliche, but my dad 
                        used to say if you loved what you 
                        did you never had to work a day in 
                        your life, and if you loved who 
                        you’re with, then you wouldn’t want 
                        those days to end...  I used to 
                        really love this town, but it’s 
                        sure starting to feel a lot like 
                        work.
                                 MURPHY
                        Listen, I get it.  And I wish it 
                        were different.  I truly do.  But 
                        heed my advice... or you could find 
                        yourself working in a strip mall in 
                        the valley where you’re afraid to 
                        enter your office after hours 
                        because you’re convinced the pet 
                        store is a front for the Russian 
                        mafia.

           Jay exits, passes Carol.

                                 MURPHY (CONT’D)
                        Carol?  How’s the rest of my day 
                        look?

           Still not looking up from her phone.

                                 CAROL
                        You’re speaking at UCLA at 3.

                                 MURPHY
                        Fuck.

           EXT. THE STEPHEN MURPHY COMPANY - DAY

           Jay exits a bit defeated.  A businessman leaves the massage 
           parlor next door with a pep in his step.  

                                 JAY
                             (to himself)
                        Well that was a mistake.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Ask for Claudia next time.

           Jay looks at him awry - awkward - as the businessman shuffles 
           off.  He stands there for a minute, not knowing his next 
           move.  A sign for Vlad’s Pet Supply, featuring a stoic-
           looking Siberian Husky for a logo, gazes down upon him.

           INT. THE DOG CAFE - DAY

           Liz sits opposite Jay in a window booth.  There’s an adorable 
           dog on Liz’s lap as they share a coffee.

                                 LIZ
                        This is great!

                                 JAY
                        What are you talking about?
                                 LIZ
                        You get to make a movie.  Who cares 
                        what it is?

                                 JAY
                        But it represents everything I 
                        hate. I just don’t know if I’d be 
                        able to look myself in the mirror.

                                 LIZ
                        Get rid of your mirrors then.  
                        Morals are overrated.

                                 JAY
                        How’s everything been with you?  

                                 LIZ
                        Good! I’m glad you called. Believe 
                        it or not, I actually got a couple 
                        of leads from that party.

                                 JAY
                        That’s really great.  I’m glad 
                        something good came from it... And 
                        hey - I want to apologize for what 
                        happened.  I’m not sure what came 
                        over me.

                                 LIZ
                        It’s fine. Usually you have to pay 
                        money to see entertainment like 
                        that.

                                 JAY
                        Ha-ha.

                                 LIZ
                        Look - We wouldn’t be able to 
                        appreciate the highs if we weren’t 
                        low now and again.  It happens.  
                        But I am curious - do you often 
                        carry a soapbox around with you?  
                        It must get really heavy...

                                 JAY
                        Okay, okay.  Everyone’s a comedian.  
                        Thank you for that. Why’d you 
                        choose this place anyway? 

                                 LIZ
                        All of these dogs are up for 
                        adoption - I thought it’d cheer you 
                        up.
           Liz holds up her adorable puppy and tries feeding it coffee.

                                 JAY
                        I think there’s something wrong 
                        with mine.

           We now see the dog on Jay’s lap and it’s a mangy-looking 
           mutt, fairly comatose.  Jay lifts his paw, but it flops back 
           down.

                                 LIZ
                        You know... If Mandis is as bad as 
                        you say, why not use this 
                        experience to get closer to him and 
                        expose him for what he really is?

                                 JAY
                        That’s... That’s actually kind of 
                        ingenious.  Remind me never to 
                        cross you.  And I do have an old 
                        friend at The Wrap always looking 
                        for dirt...

                                 LIZ
                        See!  So you get to learn how to 
                        make a movie and bring down the 
                        system at the same time.  You can 
                        thank me on the red carpet.

           Jay’s dog sneezes and it freaks him out.  They laugh.

                                                               FADE TO:

           SUPER: ONE WEEK TO PRODUCTION (AFTER 7 WEEKS OF PREP WHEN THE 
           DIRECTOR REALLY WANTED 12)

           EXT. THE STUDIO - GATE 4 ENTRANCE - DAY

           Jay pulls up to the security, who couldn’t care less, playing 
           Pokemon Go.  Jay hands over his ID.

                                 JAY
                        Here for DARK.

                                 SECURITY
                        Stage 20.  Park in the structure 
                        ahead, anywhere not marked reserve. 

           He hands Jay a pass that he puts on his dash.

                                 JAY
                        Thanks.
           Jay eases into the giant parking garage.  First floor, a 
           handful of golf carts line all of the spots.  No worries.  A 
           big electronic speedometer clocks Jay’s speed (10mph) over a 
           sign that reads SLOW as he ascends to the second floor.

           Jay navigates the second floor, but all spaces are marked 
           handicapped.  He speeds up to the third floor now, 12mph, all 
           spots are marked as 1-hour and 2-hour temporary spaces. OK... 

           Slightly peeved, Jay circles to the next floor, 16mph: 
           Reserved for the Studio.  He hits the gas to the next floor, 
           17mph, sees a few open spots, pulls into one, marked Reserved 
           for Electric Vehicles.  You’ve got to be kidding me.  

           Jay backs up, and guns it to the next floor, 22mph, no open 
           spots.  He gasses it to the next, 45mph, he’s on the roof 
           now, cars lined up everywhere, but he spies one open spot 
           towards the end.  He veers into it, sees a handwritten paper 
           sign: Reserved for Vince Vaughn’s Cousin.  Jay hesitates as 
           he reads the sign (what the fuck...?) and decides to park in 
           the spot anyway.

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - DAY

           Jay walks past various stages with a studio map in his hand.  
           They all look the same.  He turns the map over looking for 
           clarity.  At that moment, a studio tour tram slowly drives 
           by.  Jay looks up to see tourists ogle him.  One raises their 
           camera to take a picture of him.  He looks around bewildered 
           and more confused than angry.  

           The tram moves on just as a couple of zombies in makeup walk 
           by and snap him out of it.

                                 JAY
                        Hey, do you guys know where Stage 
                        20 is from here?

                                 ZOMBIE
                        Just around the corner past the 
                        apocalypse.

           Jay nods thanks and looks ahead.  There is, indeed, a set of 
           destruction and apocalypse being built ahead.

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 - DAY

           Jay arrives at the stage for DARK.  People hurry about.  An 
           elaborate closet is being constructed on the main stage.  Lax 
           Mandis walks past with a young, female PA and then does a 
           double take at Jay and circles back, oddly enthusiastic.
                                 LAX
                        There he is!

                                 JAY
                        Here I am...

           Lax puts his arm around Jay as they walk and talk.

                                 LAX
                        Jay, I couldn’t help but feel some 
                        tension these past few weeks and 
                        I’d like to clear the air.  Do you 
                        know why I was hoping they’d send 
                        you?

                                 JAY
                        Because you have a twisted sense of 
                        humor?

           Lax stops in his tracks and laughs, a little too loudly.

                                 LAX
                        What? No! I get it. I’ve worked in 
                        this business a while now.  And 
                        haters are always gonna hate... 
                        hate, hate, hate, hate.

                                 JAY
                        Are you quoting Taylor Swift right 
                        now?

                                 LAX
                        But I think you’re different.  And 
                        what you said at my party really 
                        resonated.  You know, before you 
                        decided to puke in my pool that is.  
                        It’s hard to find people with your 
                        kind of passion anymore and I want 
                        this to be a positive experience 
                        for you.

                                 JAY
                        Really?

                                 LAX
                        Absolutely.  And that’s why I have 
                        a special job for you here.  A job 
                        that’s at the crux of this 
                        production, crucial to the flow and 
                        energy of everyone on set.  Here it 
                        is.

           They’ve arrived at craft services.  CARLOS, 40s, mans the 
           station and looks a little perplexed himself.
                                 JAY
                        This is craft services.

                                 LAX
                        Oh but it’s so much more!  Crafty 
                        Carlos is a microcosm for the 
                        entire shoot - pivotal to the well-
                        being of everyone on set. 

                                 JAY
                        This is because I puked in your 
                        pool, isn’t it?

                                 LAX
                        Little bit.

           Lax pats him on the back and heads off after another young, 
           female PA.

                                 CARLOS
                        Fuck that guy.  Chilaquiles?

           Carlos offers Jay some chilaquiles as he gets a text from 
           Liz: How’s Operation Axe Mandis?

           Jay grins and types out a reply: Enemy smarter than 
           anticipated.  Commencing recon and... chilaquiles.

           Jay sends the reply and overhears a conversation around the 
           corner.

                                 BRENT (O.S.)
                        Little Miss Sunshine meets...

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Speed.

           Laughter. Jay goes to check it out and sees BRENT, TYLER, and 
           STEVE, all around 30, lounging.

                                 TYLER
                        I got this one.  When their 
                        daughter wins a local beauty 
                        contest, a dysfunctional family 
                        must travel across the country to 
                        nationals without going over 50mph 
                        or the runner up’s father will blow 
                        up their van.

                                 BRENT
                        Dark.

           Jay laughs and joins in.
                                 JAY
                        What is this?

                                 STEVE
                        Two movies get thrown out and then 
                        someone has to come up with a 
                        logline for them.

                                 TYLER

                                 BRENT
                        The Hangover.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll go.  Uhh... Two days before he 
                        is to marry Princess Leia, Han 
                        Solo, along with Luke and Chewbaca, 
                        go for one last bender through the 
                        galaxy that ends up with one of 
                        them frozen in carbonite.

           More laughter all around.

                                 STEVE
                        Nice.  What’s your name?

                                 JAY
                        Jay.  I’m with the financier.  You 
                        guys?

                                 STEVE
                        I’m Steve with the studio.  That’s 
                        Tyler, who works for Cruise, and 
                        Brent, who’s with Mandis.

                                 BRENT
                        Are you the guy that puked in his 
                        pool?

                                 JAY
                        Sorry if you had to clean that up.

                                 BRENT
                        I didn’t, for the record, but that 
                        was pretty awesome. 

                                 JAY
                        So what’s been going on here?

                                 STEVE
                        They’re about done constructing the 
                        closets and then we start shooting 
                        in a week...
           They all look over to the main stage where a giant, walk-in 
           closet is being constructed.

                                 JAY
                        This all seems vastly unnecessary.  
                        My apartment has a closet we 
                        could’ve used.

                                 BRENT
                        If you’re looking for logic, you’re 
                        in the wrong town.

                                 STEVE
                        Swingers.

           They all look a bit stumped.  Jay looks around taking it all 
           in, unsure.

           INT. SOUL CYCLE - NIGHT

           Jay walks in with Jess.  

                                 JAY
                        What am I doing here?

                                 JESS
                        You’re too stressed!  This will be 
                        good for you.

           Zack strolls up wearing lululemon pants.

                                 JAY
                        I didn’t realize they made 
                        lululemon for guys...

                        Oh yeah man.  Check out my butt in 
                        this thing.  This is amazing.

                                 JAY
                        I’m actually trying to un-see it.

           Publicity girls Cindy and Karen stride by into the room.

                                 CINDY
                        Jay?! You do SoulCycle? Good for 
                        you.

                                 KAREN
                        Work, bitch.
           They keep going.  The gang enter after them.

           INT. SOUL CYCLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay is sweating, trying to keep up in the back of the room on 
           a bike next to Zack and Jess.  The instructor in front 
           screams out directions as the Hamilton score plays over their 
           conversation.

                                 JAY
                        I immediately regret this decision.

           Zack and Jess are unphazed.  Jess actually sends emails on 
           her blackberry.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Guys, I’m not sure I’m into this 
                        anymore.

                                 ZACK
                        I can hook you up with my lululemon 
                        guy.  Non-chafing.

                                 JAY
                        No, I mean, I’m not sure about this 
                        career anymore.  I look around at 
                        the people in positions above me 
                        and I don’t like anything that I 
                        see.

                                 ZACK
                        China, man.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 ZACK
                        You know, China.  It’s fucking 
                        everything up.

                                 JAY
                        What are you talking about?

           Jess finishes sending an email.

                                 JESS
                        You need to embrace the trends is 
                        all.  This industry is changing 
                        every day, and the margins are 
                        getting smaller, so we all have to 
                        improvise a bit and adapt.
                                 JAY
                        It’s more than that.  I think I’m 
                        getting disillusioned.  I just 
                        don’t know what else I’m qualified 
                        for after spending the last 10 
                        years developing screenplays.

                                 ZACK
                        Maybe you could write?  Oh, maybe 
                        you could write about us?!

                                 JAY
                        No, that’s an awful idea.  Nobody 
                        wants to watch us.  We’re horrible 
                        people.

                                 JESS
                        And I hate movies about aimless 
                        twenty-somethings.  Get a job.

                                 ZACK
                        I’ve got a job and I still feel 
                        aimless...

                                 JAY
                        I actually did try writing earlier 
                        this year.  I had an idea about 
                        Arthur Miller I was working on.

                                 ZACK
                        Football movies don’t work 
                        overseas.

                                 JESS
                        Why didn’t you tell us you were 
                        writing?  We could totally package 
                        that...

                                 JAY
                        I wasn’t sure how you’d react.  
                        Johnny was once a part of our group 
                        and now he gets looked down upon.

                                 ZACK
                        Johnny gets looked down upon 
                        because he’s selling used cars in 
                        the valley and has an unhealthy 
                        obsession with chia pets.  I’d love 
                        to read your football movie, dude.

                                 JAY
                        I just don’t know when this turned 
                        into a job.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        I’m starting to think I should 
                        cruise, do the bare minimum.  If I 
                        didn’t care so much, none of this 
                        would be happening.

                                 JESS
                        Well that’s bullshit.  Here’s a 
                        thought: Why don’t you actually try 
                        to make the movie you’re working on 
                        good? It’s hard enough to put 
                        something into production and you 
                        at least have a chance to make a 
                        difference.  Why throw away your 
                        shot?

                                 JAY
                        Nice Hamilton reference.

                                 ZACK
                        Yeah.  Just make sure nobody shoots 
                        you in the end...

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 - DAY

           Steve and Brent eat chilaquiles, but Jay is distracted as he 
           holds a marked up script in his hands looking towards the 
           director, Karl. Karl is pacing and mumbling inaudibly to 
           himself by the main closet.  There are now multiple versions 
           of closets on the stage. 

                                 STEVE
                        I had to cut my cable.  It was 
                        getting way too expensive.

                                 BRENT
                        Oh same.  It’s ridiculous.

                                 STEVE
                        Now I only pay for Netflix and 
                        Amazon. And HBO. I guess I also 
                        have Showtime. Oh and Hulu. But 
                        that’s it.  What about you, Jay?

                                 JAY
                        What? Sorry guys, I’ll catch up.

           They shrug as Jay heads over to Karl.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, Mr. Karlovic?

                                 KARL
                        So much blood.
                                 JAY
                        I can come back.

                                 KARL
                        What?  Who are you?

                                 JAY
                        I’m with the financier.  Jay.  
                        We’ve met multiple times.

                                 KARL
                        Yes?

                                 JAY
                        I was wondering if we could discuss 
                        the screenplay.  

                                 KARL
                        What screenplay?

           Jay offers him the screenplay and notes.  Karl nods his head 
           along.

                                 JAY
                        The screenplay for this movie...

                                 KARL
                        What is this...?

                                 JAY
                        See, I get that this is a genre 
                        piece, but that doesn’t mean we 
                        can’t delve into the psyche of 
                        Cruise’s character a bit and really 
                        get to the root of his motivations; 
                        what the orcs represent themselves 
                        and perhaps highlight his abuse as 
                        an orphan?  Mr. Karlovic...?

                                 KARL
                        This isn’t my screenplay. 

           Karl tosses the screenplay.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t...

                                 KARL
                        I write new piece.  Where is it?  
                        Full of passion and desire, and - 
                        what’s the word - genocide.

                                 JAY
                        What now?
           Jay looks around for help.  Lax is in the background hitting 
           on a young, female PA (surprise) and looks over as Karl 
           becomes more agitated.  He hustles over.

                                 LAX
                        What’s going on here?

                                 KARL
                        What happened to revision?

                                 LAX
                             (to Jay)
                        What’d you do?

                                 JAY
                        I have no idea.

           Karl is increasingly upset and begins making a scene.

                                 KARL
                        My film!  The trials of young man, 
                        trapped in darkness, the war 
                        encroaching just beyond his four 
                        walls, but tormented by the guilt 
                        of having to leave his mother on 
                        the outside, not knowing if she 
                        live or die, the struggle, the 
                        blood! Where is my script! Where is 
                        my mother!?

                                 JAY
                        I’d actually like to read that...

                                 LAX
                        Karl, we discussed this...  

                                 KARL
                        No!

                                 LAX
                        Karlovic!

           Lax suddenly begins speaking and arguing with Karl in 
           Russian.  Jay is completely at a loss and heads back to Brent 
           and Steve finishing their chilaquiles.  Steve doesn’t have 
           anywhere to wipe his hands though as it’s quite messy.

                                 STEVE
                        I didn’t know Lax spoke Russian.

                                 JAY
                        Neither did I.  Although I kind of 
                        feel like he’s making half of it 
                        up.
           He is.  And Karl looks askance on occasion before continuing 
           to argue.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I wonder what this means for the 
                        production.

                                 KARL
                             (to Lax)
                        Fuck you!

                                 STEVE
                        That could translate into anything.

                                 KARL
                        I done!

                                 STEVE
                        Same with that.

           Karl storms up to Jay on his way out the door and hugs him.

                                 KARL
                             (to Jay)
                        Thank you.

           Karl exits.  Everyone has stopped and stares at Jay, 
           speechless.  Steve wipes his hands off on Jay’s shirt.  Jay 
           looks on helpless at an aggravated Lax. Brent slowly side 
           steps away from Jay.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           A shot is slammed down inside a dive bar that rests just 
           outside the studio.  Jay sits alone in front of the empty 
           glass.  His iPhone on the counter buzzes.  The bartender 
           comes back around.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You working on one of the films 
                        over there?

                                 JAY
                        If you can call it that...

           He glances at his phone, 12 missed calls.  Peters texts him: 
           Call me.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What’s it about?

           Jay hesitates.  He stares at himself in the bar mirror.
                                 JAY
                        It’s kind of like Panic Room.  
                        Within a Panic Room...  That ate 
                        another Panic Room.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Huh.  So kind of like Inception 
                        with a Hitchcockian twist?  Cool.

           Jay takes a second look at the bartender, who pours him 
           another drink and moves on.  His phone vibrates.  This time a 
           text from Liz: Does the Operation needs reinforcements? I 
           look good in uniform. 

           Jay finally smiles again, has a thought, and dials a number 
           on his phone.

                                 JAY
                             (into phone)
                        Craig, it’s Jay.  You still over at 
                        The Wrap?  I may have something for 
                        you...

           I/E. JAY’S CAR - STUDIO PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

           Jay idles in his car.  He takes a deep breath, collecting 
           himself, and looks down at his phone pulled up to The Wrap 
           headline: Trouble in the Dark? Mandis clashes with director.

           Jay puts his phone away and stares through his windshield 
           noticing a new parking sign: Vince Vaughn’s Cousin (Please 
           stop parking here).  He takes a moment before shutting the 
           ignition off and exiting.

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - MORNING

           Jay pulls out his phone, takes a deep breath, and dials as he 
           makes his way towards Stage 20.

                                 PETERS (V.O.)
                        Jay? Is that you? What’s going on 
                        over there?  Where have you been?

                                 JAY
                        Look, Peters, I can explain.

           Jay can hear audible cheers in the background of the phone 
           call.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Wait.  Are you at the Dodgers 
                        game...?
           Intercut with:

           INT. DODGER STADIUM - DAY

           Peters, looking no worse for wear, sits in a suite with Dave 
           sipping on a coke.  Peters munches on an energy bar and has a 
           foam #1 finger.  Dave eats popcorn out of his lap.

                                 PETERS
                        No... Listen, Lax told me whatever 
                        happened between you two is water 
                        over the bridge.  He really wants 
                        you to learn from him and it’d be 
                        great to build this relationship 
                        for the company.  

                                 JAY
                        He put me in charge of craft 
                        services.

                                 PETERS
                        What happened to Carlos?

                                 JAY
                        No, it’s just... he’s fucking with 
                        me.  But never mind that, sorry to 
                        go MIA last night. I can explain 
                        everything...

                                 PETERS
                        TMZ already got ahold of some 
                        security footage.  It’d actually be 
                        kind of comical if, you know, it 
                        weren’t our entire company on the 
                        line. And somehow The Wrap is all 
                        over us, too.

           Dave looks down at his phone playing Karl freaking out and 
           flailing his arms on loop.  He shows the video to Peters.

                                 JAY
                        This is salvageable.  And if we 
                        can’t work it out with Karl, I’ve 
                        got a short list of great directors 
                        backed up looking for work right 
                        now that would be perfect.

                                 PETERS
                        Whoa - Slow down.  The studio 
                        already sorted everything out.

                                 JAY
                        Really?  Karl’s coming back?
                                 PETERS
                        What?  No, that guy is probably in 
                        a bunker somewhere.  Look, we all 
                        want to keep this thing moving 
                        along, so they went with the next 
                        best guy who knows the material.

                                 JAY
                        Oh no.  Please don’t.

                                 PETERS
                        He’s already immersed himself with 
                        everyone, so it’s an easy 
                        transition, plus it’s an important 
                        relationship for the studio.  And 
                        us, mind you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 - CONTINUOUS

           Jay slows his pace as he approaches the stage entrance.  A 
           home run is heard over the phone along with massive cheering.

                                 PETERS (V.O.)
                        Look, I gotta go.  Try not to fuck 
                        things up.  Again.

           Jay stops in his tracks and stares at his phone.

                                 JAY
                        Fuck.

                                 LAX
                        Well look who it is...

           Jay looks up to find Lax walking up to him, giddy.

                                 JAY
                        Lax - I want to apologize for 
                        yesterday.  I’m not sure how things 
                        escalated so quickly. 

                                 LAX
                        Apologize?  Are you kidding?  I 
                        could hug you.  I’ve been dying to 
                        direct.  I’m tired of watching 
                        other people fuck up my work.

           Lax moves on and Jay tries to catch up.
                                 JAY
                        Well that’s not what I was 
                        expecting.  In that case, could we 
                        talk about some of those script 
                        changes?  I really think if we hone 
                        in on Cruise’s motivation we could- 
                        holy shit, is that a tiger?!

           A tiger wanders up and grazes against Lax’s leg. Jay freaks 
           out.  Lax lights up.

                                 LAX
                        Oh there she is.  She always 
                        wanders off when she’s off-leash. 
                        Come here, Petunia.

           He feeds her a treat.

                                 JAY
                        What the hell is a tiger doing on 
                        set?!

                                 LAX
                        Petunia is my emotional support 
                        tiger.  Yes, you are... This is a 
                        very stressful time for me, Jay. In 
                        case you don’t remember, our 
                        director quit yesterday. I feel 
                        like you were there...

                                 JAY
                        OK, but still, you can’t have a 
                        tiger on set.

                                 LAX
                        Sure I can.  See? Here’s my 
                        doctor’s note.

           Lax hands Jay a card. 

                                 JAY
                        This is a Starbucks gift card!  

                                 LAX
                        Oh well it’s here somewhere.  Now, 
                        what were you saying about my 
                        script?  

           Jay can’t help but be distracted by Petunia who follows Jay’s 
           movements.
                                 JAY
                        I just think... it couldn’t hurt 
                        to... punch up some of the 
                        backstory.

                                 LAX
                        Oh backstory, blah blah blah.  
                        Slows too much down.  Right, 
                        Petunia?  People want popcorn, Jay.  
                        They want entertainment, escapism.

                                 JAY
                        No offense, but two 100 million 
                        dollar movies flopped this past 
                        weekend, I’m not sure popcorn is 
                        good enough anymore.  Audiences are 
                        too smart.

                                 LAX
                        That’s misleading.  Did you look at 
                        the Cinemascore?

                                 JAY
                        OK.  The Cinemascore says the 
                        studio is going to lose 100 million 
                        dollars...  Look - Nobody should 
                        root for these movies to fail, but 
                        shouldn’t we at least take notice 
                        and try to do something 
                        different...?

           Lax is restless.  Petunia growls.

                                 LAX
                        Now you’ve upset Petunia.  Bottom 
                        line, Jaybird, is the studio green 
                        lit this script, your boss green 
                        lit this script.  We’re shooting 
                        this script. If you have a problem, 
                        you can talk to the script 
                        supervisor.  

                                 JAY
                        Is the script supervisor-

                                 LAX
                        It’s Petunia.

           Lax wanders off with Petunia.  Jay lingers, helpless, and 
           heads towards the trailers to find Steve, Brent, and Tyler 
           playing cards.
                                 JAY
                        Do you guys know Lax has a tiger 
                        here?!

                                 BRENT
                        Oh shit, did he bring Petunia?  She 
                        was supposed to stay in the car.

           Brent rushes off.

                                 STEVE
                        That tiger can read my thoughts.

                                 JAY
                        How is this normal?

                                 TYLER
                        Dude, how is any of this normal?

           Good point.  Jay’s exasperated, but, defeated, he takes 
           Brent’s seat and joins them.

           EXT. LA ZOO - DAY

           Jay walks the grounds with Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        I didn’t even realize LA had a zoo!  
                        What made you want to come here?

                                 JAY
                        It just came to me. So did anything 
                        ever come from those leads?

           Some hesitancy from Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        It didn’t work out.  They put me up 
                        for something else, but I’m not 
                        crazy about it.

                                 JAY
                        Well one for them and one for you, 
                        right?  They’d be lucky to have 
                        you.

                                 LIZ
                        What about you?

                                 JAY
                        I can’t tell if Mandis is a 
                        sociopath or if he’s just messing 
                        with me.
                                 LIZ
                        So another day at the office?

                                 JAY
                        I’m not sure what the point is 
                        anymore.  Did you know The Beatles 
                        recorded their final album when 
                        they were all just 29 years old?

                                 LIZ
                        Oh yeah?  ...Did you know Dr. Seuss 
                        didn’t write The Cat in the Hat 
                        until he was 54?

                                 JAY
                        Huh?  Really?

                                 LIZ
                        You can’t compare yourself to 
                        others in the arts.  There’s no 
                        straight line to success and 
                        there’s no timeline for the 
                        creative process.  And if there is, 
                        then it’s on a giant broken loop. 

           Jay takes that in stride.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        How’s the war front going?

                                 JAY
                        Collecting battle victories for 
                        now.  But it is far from over.

           They arrive at the gorilla enclosure.  A tram pulls up near 
           them and tourists take pictures.  The gorilla just stares at 
           Jay as Liz also raises her phone to take a picture.  Jay 
           flashes back to the moment on the lot where the tram tourist 
           took a picture of him.  It’s eerily similar.  The gorilla 
           looks on helpless.  Jay lowers Liz’s camera, she doesn’t know 
           why, but is fine with it.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        This world works in mysterious 
                        ways.

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah.  That’s why I prefer to live 
                        on another planet.

           She walks off.  He follows.  There’s almost a skip in his 
           step.
           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20

           Busy stagehands and production assistants scurry about.  Jay 
           idles trying not to get in the way as people hustle around 
           him.  Steve, Brent, and Tyler lounge nearby.  

                                 JAY
                             (more to himself)
                        Do you ever get the feeling you’re 
                        just in the way?

           Jess suddenly walks up typing on her blackberry.

                                 JESS
                        It’s my job to be in the way.

                                 JAY
                        Jess!  What are you doing here?

                                 JESS
                        I’m visiting the apocalypse next 
                        door.

                                 JAY
                        Well there’s something you don’t 
                        hear every day. How’s it going?

                                 JESS
                        It’s a zombie film from the 
                        zombie’s perspective...  That’s how 
                        it’s going.  And someone keeps 
                        parking in my client’s spot. Kill 
                        me that this is my life.  I wish I 
                        just repped writers...

           Steve is reading something on his phone and chimes in.

                                 STEVE
                        Did you guys see this?  One of the 
                        PAs died after an accident today on 
                        the set of Lost Followers.  She was 
                        only 27.

                                 BRENT
                        Wow.  That’s awful.

                                 TYLER
                        Really puts things in perspective.

                                 JESS
                        Shit... They’re shooting Lost 
                        Followers already?  

           Jess immediately gets on her phone.
                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck, Benny?!  You were 
                        supposed to tell me when casting 
                        started up again.  Now what the 
                        hell am I going to do...

           Jess storms off.  

                                 JAY
                        Good to see you, too.

           Lax sidles up reading off his phone.

                                 LAX
                        “Mandis Endangers Film Set with 
                        Endangered Animal.”  Do you guys 
                        know where the hell this is coming 
                        from?

                                 JAY
                             (shrugging)
                        Maybe one of the crew was nervous 
                        having a live tiger loose on set?  
                        Just a thought.

                                 LAX
                        But Petunia wouldn’t hurt a fly.  
                        She’s a rescue.  They were going to 
                        put her down for maiming her 
                        previous owner - total 
                        misunderstanding by the way - until 
                        we intervened.  

                                 JAY
                        What was that last part?

                                 LAX
                        Where is that cat anyway... Here 
                        kitty, kitty...

           Lax walks off and the gang goes back to normal.  Jay texts 
           Liz: Another win for the home team.  Jay puts his phone away 
           and looks at all of the action happening around him.  

           He then notices a spindly young man rearranging set lights so 
           that he can make shadow puppets on the wall.  Jay rushes 
           over.

                                 JAY
                        Hey!  What are you doing?

           The spindly young man doesn’t speak well and retreats into 
           himself a bit.
                                 SPINDLY
                        Hmmmm.

                                 JAY
                        Hello?  What exactly are you doing 
                        over here?

           Steve notices what’s unfolding and hurries over to gather 
           Jay.  They slowly walk away towards Crafty Carlos’ table.

                                 STEVE
                        You can’t talk to Freddy like that, 
                        man.

                                 JAY
                        Who is that guy?  He’s breaking 
                        down a day’s work.

           Brent and Tyler join them.  Freddy goes back to making 
           elaborate shadow puppets in the background, oblivious.

                                 STEVE
                        He’s a diversity hire.

                                 JAY
                        Well he looks like he doesn’t know 
                        what he’s doing...

                                 BRENT
                        Whoa.  Racist much?

           Lax overhears nearby and re-joins the conversation. (He was 
           looking under a table for Petunia).

                                 TYLER
                        Are you saying that because he’s 
                        black?

                                 JAY
                        What?  No!  Guys - I’m black.

           Did I forget to mention that?

                                 TYLER
                        Really?  I thought you were just 
                        tan.

                                 JAY
                        No - I’m black.  And Radio over 
                        there is playing master puppet 
                        theater on our very expensive 
                        soundstage and we’re losing the 
                        day’s work.
                                 LAX
                        Do we have a problem here, Jay?  
                        I’m sensing some racial tensions.

                                 JAY
                        Not at all!  But look at him.

                                 TYLER
                             (looking at the shadows)
                        Kind of looks like a swan.

                                 LAX
                        Freddy!

           Freddy walks over to Lax.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        Freddy, this is Jay.  Freddy is 
                        part of the studio’s new diversity 
                        initiative.  Did you know that less 
                        than 1% of movies released 
                        theatrically last year featured a 
                        diverse lead and less than 1% of 
                        those were played by Denzel 
                        Washington?

                                 JAY
                        I don’t think you’re calculating 
                        that right...

                                 LAX
                             (talking over Jay)
                        We’re all very supportive of 
                        Freddy’s input and contribution.  
                        Here you go.

           Lax feeds Freddy a treat and he wanders back to the wall for 
           his puppet theater.

                                 JAY
                        Did you just feed him your tiger 
                        treat?

                                 LAX
                        I’m not sure I like your attitude, 
                        Jay.  Do you not think Hollywood 
                        should be more diverse?

                                 JAY
                        OK, yes, but you can’t honestly 
                        pretend this is helping.  It’s a 
                        systemic problem if anything and 
                        this is just putting a band-aid 
                        over a larger issue. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        If we want to tell diverse stories, 
                        we need to find ways to support 
                        diverse voices at the outset of the 
                        creative process and not at the end 
                        when your script is written and the 
                        only thing you need is, apparently, 
                        shadow puppets.

                                 TYLER
                             (again, at the shadows)
                        It’s a dragon!

                                 LAX
                        You’re doing great, Freddy!  Look, 
                        Jay, I don’t know what your problem 
                        is.  Everyone loves puppets.  It’s 
                        good for morale.  Besides, you 
                        don’t see Carlos complaining.

           Lax walks off before Jay can respond.  Carlos chimes in.

                                 CARLOS
                        But what I really want to do is 
                        direct... 

                                 JAY
                             (to himself)
                        Where’s Katzenberg when you need a 
                        memo?

           Petunia gnaws on a plate of chilaquiles nearby on the ground.

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 - LATER

           Steve, Brent, and Jay lounge by the trailers.  

                                 STEVE
                        It’s this cool new speakeasy in 
                        Hollywood.  The entrance is in a 
                        garage, then you walk through a 
                        fridge, and then you have to crawl 
                        through a microwave to get to the 
                        bar.

                                 BRENT
                        That just seems like a lot of work 
                        for a drink.

           Peters walks up with Dave in tow.  Peters looks like he’s put 
           on some pounds.

                                 PETERS
                        Hey, Jay.  How we looking?
           Jay does a double take at Peter’s weight as he chomps down on 
           another protein bar.

                                 JAY
                        Good.  They’re just doing some run-
                        throughs with Cruise.

           Tyler hurries over to them.

                                 TYLER
                        Uh, guys, Cruise won’t come out of 
                        the closet.

                                 DAVE
                        He’ll come out when he’s ready.  My 
                        brother took years and then one 
                        day, bam, his ringtone is Britney 
                        and you can find him dancing 
                        Saturdays at The Abbey.

                                 TYLER
                        No, literally, we can’t get him out 
                        of the closet.

           They head into the main staging area.  A handful of elaborate 
           closets and doors have been built.  One main closet sits in 
           the center and it all looks like one giant, interconnected 
           puzzle.  The guys sidle in.  

           Lax stands in front of the main closet mid-argument as a 
           handful of stage hands pound on the door and try to get it 
           open.

                                 BRENT
                        Should we tell him it gets better?

                                 STEVE
                        This is like R. Kelly’s worst 
                        nightmare.

                                 LAX
                        We’re going to get you out of 
                        there!

                                 CRUISE
                             (O.S.)
                        Fuck you, Mandis!

           Lax is scrambling and walks away.  He motions to Jay.

                                 LAX
                        I give up.  You wanted to produce.  
                        Produce.
                                 JAY
                        What?!

                                 CRUISE
                             (O.S.)
                        Who is that?!

                                 JAY
                        Uh, Mr. Cruise.  This is Jay with 
                        the financier.  We’ve met multiple 
                        times.

                                 CRUISE
                        You’re trying my patience, Jay with 
                        the financier.

                                 JAY
                        We’re going to get you out of 
                        there.  
                             (to the Stagehand)
                        What the hell can we do?

                                 STAGEHAND
                             (to Jay)
                        It won’t shimmy.  It was supposed 
                        to swing back and forth here, but 
                        the hinges warped under the lamps, 
                        which for some reason were all 
                        pointed on this door.

           Jay shakes his head as he looks over to Freddy, oblivious, 
           who is petting Petunia.

                                 JAY
                        Why can’t we just bust it down?

                                 STAGEHAND 2
                        It was a three-week build.  This is 
                        all custom.

                                 JAY
                        So’s Tom Cruise.

                                 CRUISE
                             (O.S.)
                        What’s happening?

                                 JAY
                        Fuck this.

           Jay grabs a crowbar from the Stagehand.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Stand back, Mr. Cruise.
                                 CRUISE
                             (O.S.)
                        Wait, what?

           Jay winds up and smashes through the door repeatedly.  Lax 
           was ordering chilaquiles from Carlos as he looks over and 
           panics.  He runs up.  Cruise screams like a girl from the 
           inside, but Jay makes a bigger hole and etches out enough 
           room for Cruise to get through.  Jay pulls him out.  Cruise 
           dusts himself off and looks at Jay like he may be nuts.  Jay 
           smirks a bit, proud of himself.  One of the stagehands takes 
           a selfie with Tom in the background.

                                 JAY
                        Think of it this way, you can use 
                        the experience for the shoot.  Sort 
                        of method in a way.

           Cruise looks back at the smashed-in door and to Jay.

                                 CRUISE
                        Huh?  How about that?

           Cruise calmly walks off and Tyler quickly follows behind.  
           Lax steps up to Jay, who stills holds the crowbar.  The 
           stagehands struggle to put the closet back together.

                                 JAY
                        I think I like this producing 
                        thing.  You think he’s all right?

           Lax looks uneasy.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure he’s fine.  He’s probably 
                        fine.  Right?

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 - MOMENTS LATER

           Lax, Jay, Brent, and Steve huddle around a table.

                                 LAX
                        He’s out.

                                 BRENT
                        So out.

                                 JAY
                        How can he do that now?
                                 LAX
                             (reading off email)
                        Due to extenuating circumstances 
                        and a hostile work environment 
                        aided by one financier wielding a 
                        quote-unquote crowbar at said 
                        client’s face - do you really need 
                        me to go on?

           Jay’s quiet.

                                 STEVE
                        I didn’t realize force majeure 
                        covered crowbars.

                                 LAX
                        And to top it off another Wrap 
                        article leaked from set.

           Lax tosses his phone to the side in frustration.  Steve 
           reads.

                                 BRENT
                        “Dark’s Idea of Diversity? Mandis 
                        Exposed.” 

                                 LAX
                        These are beginning to piss me off. 
                        I mean, they’ve got it all wrong.  
                        I love those shadow puppets...

           Jay texts Liz (Lax takes notice): Victory sure builds an 
           appetite. Dinner later? The texting ellipses signifying Liz 
           typing a reply shows up on Jay’s phone.  And then it 
           disappears.  Before Jay can think twice about it, Steve 
           chimes in:

                                 STEVE
                        OK, guys, but what are we going to 
                        do here about Cruise?  My bosses 
                        are going to kill me.

                                 LAX
                        Oh I already have the perfect 
                        backup.  We won’t miss a beat.  Big 
                        action star.
                             (under his breath)
                        From the 80s.

           There’s a knock at the door.  Tom Selleck, yes, that Tom 
           Selleck, walks in.
                                 JAY
                             (aside to Lax)
                        Were you just going down the 
                        alphabet?!

                                 TOM SELLECK
                        I gotta tell you guys, I really 
                        connected to this script when I 
                        read it.  Because, well, I own a 
                        closet.

           The guys think he’ll say more, but that’s it.

                                 LAX
                        Thanks, Tom.  Go find your trailer 
                        and settle in.

           Tom walks out.

                                 TOM SELLECK
                             (O.S.)
                        It’s so dark! How’d it get so dark!

                                 LAX
                        Isn’t he great?

                                 JAY
                        How is this okay?

                                 LAX
                        It’s a genre piece, so the actor 
                        really isn’t that important.

                                 JAY
                        Said no one ever.

                                 LAX
                        I think this is an opportunity to 
                        do what Tarantino does so well and 
                        revitalize an old actor’s career.

                                 JAY
                        OK, but I still wouldn’t think 
                        Magnum P.I. to be our first 
                        choice...  Did you speak to Peters?

                                 LAX
                        You bet.  And everything’s back on 
                        schedule.  Isn’t movie-making 
                        great?

           Lax wanders off and yells after a female zombie.  
                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        So which parts of you aren’t dead?

           Jay frantically dials his phone. Lax tries hitting on the 
           female zombie in the background, but she slaps him midway 
           through Jay’s conversation below.

                                 JAY
                        Peters?  So you have heard? ...Yes, 
                        Quigley Down Under had a certain 
                        neo-western charm to it, but I 
                        don’t see how that’s... uh-huh... 
                        Well how is Lyle okay with this?  
                        ...Dubai?  Well can’t someone...? 
                        ...Okay.

           Jay hangs up.  Lax shows up again.  This time he’s on one of 
           those stupid hoverboards and literally does circles around 
           Jay.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I think my boss is in prison.

                                 LAX
                        Turns out I have an opening in my 
                        dance card this weekend, Jaybird.  
                        I’d like you to join me.

                                 JAY
                        You should know I don’t put out on 
                        the first date.

                                 LAX
                        We’ll see about that.

           Lax tosses an invite at his chest and it hits the ground.  

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        Parkour!

           Lax jumps off his hoverboard and it rolls unceremoniously to 
           the side.

                                 JAY
                        That’s not parkour.  That’s just 
                        park.

           Lax wanders off anyway and calls out over his shoulder

                                 LAX
                        Dress nice!

           Jay picks up the invite and gives it a look: Variety’s Women 
           in Entertainment Awards Gala
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY - EVENING 

           Cinespia screening - A John Hughes marathon.  Jay walks Liz 
           past tombstones towards the open grassy area in front of a 
           giant wall where a film will be projected.  He has a picnic 
           basket and blanket in hand.  There are a lot of people, but 
           we’ll pretend not as many as in real life because, seriously, 
           way too many people go to this thing.

                                 LIZ
                        When I go, I know I’ll want people 
                        to get drunk, dance all over my 
                        tombstone, and then watch old 
                        movies until sunrise.

                                 JAY
                        Rest in Peace is really just a 
                        suggestion here.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m so excited.  I’ve heard about 
                        these screenings, but have never 
                        been.  

                                 JAY
                        I remember you mentioning John 
                        Hughes on our first date and 
                        thought this would be fun. He did 
                        that film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 
                        right?

                                 LIZ
                        Ha-ha. My brother and I used to 
                        watch Breakfast Club after school 
                        every day. Ironic, that we’d come 
                        home from school to watch a movie 
                        about detention, but it kept us 
                        close.

                                 JAY
                        And where is he again?

                                 LIZ
                        He’s an engineer back in DC.  

                                 JAY
                        Oh a normal job.  I wonder what 
                        that’s like.

                                 LIZ
                        Novel, right?  We didn’t have a lot 
                        in common except movies.
           They come across a photo/video booth with a prop classroom 
           stage set up.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        We have to do the dance!

                                 JAY
                        What dance?

                                 LIZ
                        I’m going to pretend you didn’t ask 
                        that.

           Jay puts his picnic basket down and a Cinespia worker sets up 
           the stop-motion video booth.  Liz dons a red wig a la Molly 
           Ringwald and Jay sports Emilio Estevez’s letterman jacket.  
           Liz tries to show Jay the dance (that side-by-side shuffle) 
           as the video shoots them.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        It’s... You just... No, you put 
                        your feet...

           Jay tumbles over laughing.  Liz’s wig falls off as she tries 
           to help him.  The Cinespia worker looks bored.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz and Jay are cracking up looking at their dance video.  
           They’re set up in the grass on a blanket as Jay pours Liz a 
           glass of wine.  The opening credits to The Breakfast Club 
           begin in the background.

                                 LIZ
                        Thanks for this.

                                 JAY
                        No, thank you. You’ve been so 
                        great.  I feel like I’ve been 
                        droning on about Mandis lately and 
                        you’re the only thing keeping me 
                        sane.

                                 LIZ
                        I didn’t want to jinx it.

                                 JAY
                        He did invite me to some awards 
                        gala tomorrow night though.

                                 LIZ
                        Should I be concerned?
                                 JAY
                        Only if he asks me to dance.

           They laugh a little loudly and get shushed by the person next 
           to them.  They do a double take because the person next to 
           them is Judd Nelson (aka Bender), which makes them crack up 
           even louder.

           INT. FANCY BALLROOM - DAY

           Jay double checks his invite (Variety’s Women in 
           Entertainment Gala) and walks in wearing probably his only 
           suit.  Classy affair, other people in tuxes, and tables 
           spread about.  Jay walks up to the bar, but is stuck behind a 
           few guys mid-conversation.

                                 GUY #1
                        So I’m on the 18th hole, it’s all 
                        lined up, and I completely shank it 
                        to the left into a water hazard.  I 
                        finally make it out of the hole 10 
                        strokes later.

           The guys around him all laugh.  Jay looks bored as they block 
           the bar.

                                 GUY #1 (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I kill it at the driving 
                        range by myself, but whenever I get 
                        to the course I can’t hit it 
                        straight.

                                 GUY #2
                        So basically you’re saying you’re 
                        horrible with a group, but a pro on 
                        your own?

           Guy #1 nods along in agreement.

                                 GUY #3
                        That’s funny.  I’m the same way, 
                        but with sex!

           They all laugh obnoxiously.  Jay gives up and wedges his way 
           to the bar to grab a beer.  Lax shows up.

                                 LAX
                        There’s my little Jaybird, all 
                        grows up.

           Lax straightens Jay’s tie, he swats him away.  Lax grabs a 
           beer and he ushers Jay towards his table.
                                 JAY
                        So how did you score an invite to 
                        this?

                                 LAX
                        I love women in entertainment, Jay. 
                        I love women in politics, I love 
                        women on screen. I couldn’t be more 
                        supportive of women. My dream is 
                        that one day there is a female 
                        version of me. We need female role 
                        models as strong as guys like us.  
                        Don’t you agree?

           Jay’s not quite sure how to respond to that one.  An Older 
           Gentleman injects himself into the conversation.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        Lax!  Good to see you here.  How 
                        are you?

           Lax plays nice, but looks like he gets this a lot.

                                 LAX
                        Hey there! 

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        You know, I go back a long way with 
                        your father.

                                 LAX
                        Oh yeah?  So do I.

           Jay chuckles to himself.  The Older Gentleman is oblivious.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        Say hi to him for me, will you?

                                 LAX
                        Of course.

           Lax and Jay find their table and sit down.

                                 JAY
                        That must get annoying.

                                 LAX
                        Only as annoying as you let it.

           Lax goes to clink Jay’s glass, and they cheers.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        All of these people are trying to 
                        get something out of everyone else.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        It’d be funny if it weren’t so 
                        tragic.

                                 JAY
                        And what are you trying to get?

                                 LAX
                        Laid.  

           Jay chokes on his drink.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        Hey, at least I’m honest about it.  
                        I’ll admit and own everything I do.  
                        You think these people can say the 
                        same?  That guy back there has been 
                        trying to get the rights to An 
                        American Vampire in Paris from my 
                        dad for the last ten years.  It’s 
                        pathetic.

                                 JAY
                        Is nothing happening with that?  
                        That could actually be a cool 
                        revamp.

           Lax smiles to himself.

                                 LAX
                        You know, I can’t quite put my 
                        finger on it.  Are you one of those 
                        executives who wishes he was a 
                        writer?

                                 JAY
                        What?  God, no.  I hate staring at 
                        a blank page...

           I really do.

                                 LAX
                        I know how you feel.  My dad 
                        practically wrote my first couple 
                        of screenplays...  

           Jay is surprised at that reveal, but more so his openness.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        I had no confidence at first, but 
                        you just have to stick with it.
                                 JAY
                        I did have a silly idea to write 
                        about Arthur Miller and Elia Kazan 
                        framed against the Cold War, but 
                        nobody cares about that stuff.

                                 LAX
                        A-ha!  So that’s what it is.  
                        You’re my regular Willy Loman.

                                 JAY
                        Well that’s not exactly what I was 
                        hoping for...

                                 LAX
                        You’ve got to let go.  This stress 
                        you carry is going to put you in an 
                        early grave.  Look around.  You 
                        don’t see those zombies sweating 
                        the small stuff.  Wow, they really 
                        are everywhere come to think of 
                        it...

           There are, indeed, zombies dressed in suits at the gala under 
           a “Women in Horror” table.  Jay shakes off the image.

                                 JAY
                        Right, but we can’t all just be 
                        zombies.  There has to be more 
                        value in what we’re doing.  If we 
                        spend our lives, 24/7, slaving away 
                        on these projects - shouldn’t it be 
                        for something that’s making more of 
                        a difference or impact with 
                        everything going on today?

                                 LAX
                        Au contraire, my good man.  Are you 
                        familiar with the Epic of 
                        Gilgamesh?

                                 JAY
                        I always considered myself more in 
                        the vein of Sisyphus.

                                 LAX
                        You crack me up.  Gilgamesh, or G-
                        money as I call him, was a demi-God 
                        King.  And when his best friend 
                        dies, it freaks him out, and he 
                        goes off searching for eternal 
                        life.  
                                 JAY
                        I feel like this is the abridged 
                        version.

                                 LAX
                        So G-money travels across the 
                        globe, through darkness and past 
                        monsters of all sizes, until our 
                        boy finds the ferryman.  Now, the 
                        ferryman was rewarded immortality 
                        by the gods for saving humankind 
                        during the great flood, but the 
                        ferryman tells G-money to return to 
                        his homeland: seeking immortality 
                        is futile and he should be 
                        satisfied with the pleasures of 
                        this world.  Gilgamesh is 
                        distraught, he’s come all this way, 
                        spent half his waking life 
                        searching for nothing?  But just as 
                        our G-man is about to depart - get 
                        this - the ferryman’s wife 
                        convinces her husband to tell 
                        Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant 
                        that restores youth.  A plant that 
                        you could probably get today on 
                        most street corners.  Anyway, 
                        Gilgamesh is ecstatic, at last, he 
                        thinks.  So he finds this plant and 
                        hurries back home to share it with 
                        his village.  But one night upon 
                        the return, a snake steals the 
                        plant and, as it slithers away, it 
                        sheds its skin and becomes young 
                        again.  So G-man, defeated, returns 
                        empty-handed; forced to now deal 
                        with his mortality.  But what does 
                        he discover upon his return to the 
                        village?  His city has actually 
                        flourished in his absence, and will 
                        long flourish after he is gone.  He 
                        realizes that while he can’t live 
                        forever, humankind will endure and 
                        that will be his legacy as King, 
                        and it’s the closest thing to 
                        immortality he’ll ever know.

                                 JAY
                        So what?  Am I Gilgamesh in this 
                        story?

                                 LAX
                        G-man?  J-man?  Sounds like a match 
                        to me.   
                                 JAY
                        And our film set is the village... 
                        and the film will live on in 
                        eternity?

                                 LAX
                        Now you’re getting it.  Let’s enjoy 
                        it while we’re here.  Don’t go 
                        chasing something that doesn’t 
                        exist.  Now I admit I haven’t been 
                        the kindest to you, but I also 
                        didn’t throw up in your pool.

           Jay is able to laugh at himself now.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        We’re far along as it is, but if 
                        you have any suggestions or 
                        anything you think we should look 
                        at to make this thing the best it 
                        can be, I’m all ears.  Nobody sets 
                        out to make a bad movie. Take the 
                        night to think about it and let’s 
                        talk about it tomorrow.

                                 JAY
                        Wow.  Really?  That’s very big of 
                        you.

           Jay looks more determined and smiles to himself.  Is Lax 
           starting to grow on him?

                                 LAX
                        Oh crap, did we miss the award?

           They look to the stage where an Older Man is accepting an 
           award.

                                 JAY
                        Did they really just give a “Women 
                        in Film” award to a man...?

                                 LAX
                        He’s written a lot of great female 
                        roles.

           The Older Man finishes his speech at the podium.

                                 AWARD WINNER
                        Women have a voice, too, and are 
                        dominating more and more at the box 
                        office.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 AWARD WINNER (CONT'D)
                        It’s important that they are heard 
                        and I can’t tell you how much this 
                        award means to me and my beautiful 
                        wife.

           The wife stands quietly to the side stage.  Most of the crowd 
           actually appears to be men.  Jay and Lax share a sideways 
           glance.

           INT. ROOFTOP BAR - NIGHT

           Jay, Blake, and Zack share a drink at the bar.  Actors who 
           have time to work out twice a day, but say they woke up like 
           this fill out the swanky place.  A folksy singer with a beard 
           and guitar plays background music from the corner stage.

                                 JAY
                        This could be a game-changer for 
                        me.  I think we could really fix 
                        this script. 

                                 ZACK
                        Aren’t you guys just a couple of 
                        days away from production?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, but there are still tweaks we 
                        can make to just add some depth 
                        here and there.  It could make a 
                        real difference.

                                 BLAKE
                        And did I hear you brought in Tom 
                        Selleck?

                                 JAY
                             (defensive)
                        We did.  But it could be a cool 
                        turn for him.  Think of what 
                        Tarantino just did with Kurt 
                        Russell. 

           Blake and Zack roll their eyes a little and bite their tongue 
           at Jay’s change-of-heart.

                                 ZACK
                        Happy for you, man. 

                                 BLAKE
                        Are you guys seeing all those Wrap 
                        articles about Mandis? Sounds like 
                        a joke. I don’t know how you’re 
                        doing it. 
           Jay adjusts in his seat, but doesn’t say anything.  Does he 
           feel guilty?  Meanwhile, the hipster singer starts a new song 
           with a bit of a forced twang.  The guys twinge at the sound 
           and look up.

                                 ZACK
                        Somebody call Mumford, one of his 
                        sons is on stage.

                                 BLAKE
                        How’s everything going with that 
                        actress?

                                 JAY
                        Pretty great actually.  Who knew.  
                        How’s your love life?

           A couple of beautiful girls pass by them.

                                 BLAKE
                        I don’t know.  I mean, why can’t I 
                        find a girl who understands me as 
                        well as the targeted ads on my 
                        social media?

                                 JAY
                        Good luck with that.

                                 ZACK
                        Have you tried PositiveSingles.com?

                                 BLAKE
                        Isn’t that for people who have 
                        tested positive for STDs?

           Zack spits out his beer.

                                 ZACK
                        Wait, what?  I thought it was just 
                        for optimistic people.  

           Zack quickly checks his phone.  Jay motions to a girl trying 
           to get a drink at the bar.

                                 JAY
                        She’s cute, Blake.  Why don’t you 
                        buy her a drink?

           Blake takes notice.

                                 BLAKE
                        Come here often?

           She laughs.
                                 CUTE GIRL
                        Original.  Are you here with the 
                        mixer?

                                 BLAKE
                        Mixer?

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        The young Hollywood mixer?  I’m 
                        trying to be a writer.

                                 BLAKE
                        Oh no, sorry, we’re just in from 
                        out of town.

           Cute Girl looks a bit confused and wanders off.  Blake 
           rejoins his guys.

                                 JAY
                        What’s wrong?  No STDs?

                                 BLAKE
                        Slowly put the drinks down, guys.  
                        We walked into a networking event.

           The guys look around.  Hollywood’s aspiring finest awkwardly 
           mingle with each other. Quick cuts of different 
           conversations:

                                 INDUSTRY GUY #1
                        So it’s kind of like Groundhog Day 
                        set during World War II.

                                 INDUSTRY GIRL #2
                        It’s my own management company.  
                        But we also produce.  Well we’re 
                        looking to produce.

                                 INDUSTRY GUY #3
                        Just signed him.  You’ll love him.  
                        His script reads like a young David 
                        O. Russell.

                                 INDUSTRY GUY #1
                        Picture Bill Murray in Schindler’s 
                        List.

                                 INDUSTRY GIRL #2
                        We’re open to everything.  And by 
                        we, I mean me.  It’s just me right 
                        now, but we’re open!
                                 INDUSTRY GUY #3
                        We’re really hoping it makes the 
                        Black List this year.
                             (extreme close-up as the 
                              last line is repeated)
                        Black List this year...

           Back to the guys.  They look stone-faced as they put down 
           their drinks and try to shuffle out the side exit.

                                 JAY
                        No sudden movements.

                                 ZACK
                        Nice and easy.

                                 INDUSTRY GUY #4
                        Hey!  

                                 JAY
                        Ah!

                                 INDUSTRY GUY #4
                        You here with the mixer?  I just 
                        started in the mailroom.

                                 JAY
                        Sorry, we, uh- Did you say the 
                        mailroom?

           Zack comes to the rescue.

                                 ZACK
                        We actually all work at Chipotle!

                                 BLAKE
                        Eat fresh!

                                 INDUSTRY GUY #4
                        Isn’t that Subway’s slogan?

                                 ZACK
                        It’s ours now!  Bye!

           They laugh as they make for the exit.  Industry Guy is 
           confused, but moves on unphazed and earnest.

                                 JAY
                        Were we ever that young?

                                 BLAKE
                        We’re such assholes.
           Blake and Zack head out, but Jay hesitates for a beat at the 
           door, looking back at Industry Guy #4 and the youthful, not-
           so-cynical aspiring dreamers.  Do they remind him of anyone?  
           He shakes it off and joins his guys who are waiting for him.    
           There’s a peeling, faded Barnacle billboard in the 
           background.

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 - DAY

           Jay has a handful of notes in his hand and one of Peter’s 
           protein bars.  He finds Steve lounging in his usual spot by 
           the trailers.  Steve looks a little confused at his phone.

                                 JAY
                        Hey, Steve.  What’re you doing?

                                 STEVE
                        I’m trying to watch Amazon Prime, 
                        but I think I just ordered 
                        groceries by mistake.

                                 JAY
                        Have you seen Lax?

                                 STEVE
                        He’s over by the dressing rooms.  
                        The orcs are in makeup today.

                                 JAY
                        Cool.  Thanks.

                                 STEVE
                        By the way, dude, you shouldn’t eat 
                        those protein bars.  My brother 
                        used to eat them, but he was a 
                        ballplayer, so unless you’re 
                        working out 12 hours a day, that’s 
                        not going to be a good look for 
                        you.

                                 JAY
                        Huh.  Good to know.  Thanks.

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           A few orcs sit in chairs getting the final touches done on 
           their makeup.  They look like the forgotten extras from Lord 
           of the Rings.  Jay walks in.

                                 JAY
                        Hey guys.  Has anyone seen Lax?
                                 MAKEUP ARTIST GUY
                        He’s around here somewhere.

           A female orc enters through a side door.  She gets closer to 
           Jay and freezes.  Jay does a double take.

                                 JAY
                        Liz?  Is that you?!

                                 ORC LIZ
                        Hi, Jay.

           She’s apprehensive.

                                 JAY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ORC LIZ
                        One for them, one for me, right?

                                 MAKEUP ARTIST GUY
                        You’re dating an orc?  Cool.

           His high-five goes unanswered.  Jay pulls Liz over to the 
           side.

                                 JAY
                        But after all I’ve said about this 
                        guy, how could you even, I mean 
                        why?

           Lax emerges behind them from the same door Liz came from.  
           Jay looks back and forth between the two.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh god. I think I’m going to be 
                        sick.

                                 ORC LIZ
                        Give me a little credit, Jay.  I’m 
                        not that much of a cliche.

                                 JAY
                        But still, what about Axe Mandis?

           Lax walks up and overhears that last part.

                                 LAX
                        Axe Mandis?  I prefer Climax Mandis 
                        if you know what I mean.

           Lax high fives Makeup Artist Guy and keeps walking.
                                 ORC LIZ
                        Truth is, I needed the money.  I 
                        don’t know how to tell you this, 
                        but I’m trying to move back to New 
                        York.  I miss the live experience 
                        of theater and it’s clearly not 
                        working out for me here.

           She motions to her outfit.  Jay looks like he may faint.

                                 JAY
                        Can we please not do this while 
                        you’re wearing that?

                                 ORC LIZ
                        It took them three hours to put 
                        this on.

           Jay takes a closer look at Liz.

                                 JAY
                        Wait.  Are you... Are you an Asian 
                        orc?

           Liz rolls her eyes.  She is, indeed, dressed as an Asian orc 
           with some Eastern garb and makeup. (FYI: She’s not an Asian 
           actress).  They’re at an impasse.  Frustrated.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        So that’s it?  You’re just going to 
                        give up?

                                 ORC LIZ
                        How can you say that?  This town 
                        isn’t what I thought it was, so now 
                        I’m making something happen for 
                        myself.  Can you say the same?  

           Liz storms off.  Lax saunters back up to a stunned Jay.

                                 JAY
                        What the hell just happened?

           Lax notices a handful of notes still in Jay’s hand.

                                 LAX
                        Women, huh.  What are those?

                                 JAY
                        These are the notes you asked for.

           Jay is still reeling, but hands them over to Lax, who flips 
           through them.  Lax laughs.
                                 LAX
                        I asked for these?

                                 JAY
                        Yes!  You asked me for my notes 
                        after the whole Gilgamesh speech.

                                 LAX
                        Oh I was so high at that party.  I 
                        didn’t know which way was up.  We 
                        start shooting in two days.  Are 
                        you nuts?  We can’t implement 
                        these.

           Lax presses the notes back in Jay’s chest.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t get it.  Why are you doing 
                        this to me?  Why would you ask for 
                        me on set?  

                                 LAX
                        What?  I didn’t ask for you to be 
                        here.

                                 JAY
                        Yes, you did.  Because of spite for 
                        calling you out at your own party 
                        or whatever childish reason you 
                        have in your head.

                                 LAX
                        Let’s get something clear.  I 
                        didn’t ask for you to be here.  In 
                        fact, you’ve caused nothing but 
                        problems since you’ve been here.  
                        But your company needs a physical 
                        body on set so that they can get 
                        official credit from the guild.  
                        They sent you here.  Not me.  
                        You’re just a placeholder.  So stop 
                        thinking this world is out to get 
                        you.  You’re not Gilgamesh.  You’re 
                        just one of the pawns in the 
                        village who will be forgotten 
                        later.  And I’m the snake.  So fuck 
                        off and stop sabotaging my movie.

           Lax leaves Jay shell-shocked.  Makeup Artist Guy begins a 
           slow clap, but no one joins in.
           INT. IRISH BAR - NIGHT

           Jay, Zack, and Jess drink at the bar.

                                 JESS
                        Fuck that guy.

                                 ZACK
                        That’s the problem with dating 
                        today.  You never know if you’re in 
                        an actual relationship until you’re 
                        married... 

                                 JAY
                        I didn’t even know she was unhappy.

                                 JESS
                        She sounds like a good actress.  
                        Should I sign her?

                                 ZACK
                        You think she was seeing other 
                        people?

                                 JAY
                        I don’t think that was it.  

                                 ZACK
                        Well was she still active on the 
                        dating app?

                                 JAY
                        Bumble doesn’t show you when they 
                        last signed on.

           Zack grabs Jay’s phone.

                                 ZACK
                        Uh, yes, it does.  See, if you 
                        press this button, you can search 
                        by who’s most active. 

           A handful of guys nearby overhear and whip out their phones.  

                                 ZACK (CONT’D)
                        Nope.  Wow.  You may have been in a 
                        relationship. I’m sorry, man.

           One of the guys looking at his phone in the background freaks 
           out and runs out of the bar.
                                 JAY
                        We talked it through.  She’s going 
                        to be closer to her family this way 
                        and she did always love live 
                        theater.  It just sucks.

           He’s despondent.

                                 ZACK
                        Come on.  Don’t let reality ruin 
                        your day.  There, there.

                                 JESS
                        So what are you going to do about 
                        Lax...?

           Jay gets an idea.  He pounds the rest of his drink, opens an 
           email on his phone, and starts typing away to Craig at The 
           Wrap, subject line: Like Father, Like Son. The bartender 
           makes his way over and Jay orders another round for the three 
           of them.

           DREAM SEQUENCE

           EXT. ROCKY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

           Harsh winds blow across Jay’s face as he struggles against a 
           mighty object.  We pull out to realize his back is to a 
           massive boulder as he attempts to push it up the endless 
           mountain.  He sweats and shakes as his knees get weak.  
           Suddenly, a slurping sound is heard like someone finishing a 
           soda.  

                                 LAX 
                             (O.S.)
                        Put your back into it.

           Jay looks up to see Lax, casually perched atop the boulder 
           drinking a coke through a straw.  His legs dangle off of the 
           giant rock.  Jay tries to ignore him and turns around to push 
           from another angle.  Lax suddenly appears at Jay’s side, 
           examining the ground around him and checking the wind 
           direction with his finger.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        Hmm.  Slight cross wind south-
                        southwest.  Maybe try pushing up.  
                        Have you thought of that?

           Jay turns around to ignore him, but Lax appears on the other 
           side of him.
                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, that’s not helping.  Here, 
                        hold this.

           Lax hands his soda to Jay.  As Jay takes it, the boulder 
           moves slightly opposite him and he jumps out of the way in 
           time to see it roll back down the mountain.  Jay and Lax look 
           down and see it disappear into the fog as it continues to 
           speed down the hillside.  Jay looks depressed and defeated, 
           but Lax just grabs his drink back and slurps again.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        Bummer.

           Lax walks away.

           END DREAM SEQUENCE

           INT. JAY’S APARTMENT - BED - MORNING

           Jay awakens with the same depressed look on his face and a 
           headache, rubbing his head.  Typing on a blackberry is 
           overheard.

                                 JAY
                        Well that was a mistake.

           The camera pulls out to find Jess next to him in bed.

                                 JESS
                        What?  Sorry, this client is 
                        killing me.

           Jess answers a call on her phone.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        It’s not rehab!  She has lupus, you 
                        fucking jackals.  There’s a 
                        difference.  Leave her alone.  

           She hangs up.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                             (to Jay)
                        Ugh.  My client is back in rehab.

           She gets out of bed, naked, and heads to the bathroom.  Jay 
           slinks back under the covers, pulling the blankets over his 
           head.
           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - STAGE 20 - DAY

           Jay sits rather comatose in a chair to the side as he watches 
           the action unfold around him.  Steve sits next to him.  Jay 
           still has a set of notes in his hands.  He keeps refreshing 
           The Wrap on his iPhone, but nothing significant shows up.  
           Jay looks back to the set:

           Workers prep for the day’s shoot.  Stagehands put finishing 
           touches on the main closet.  Tom Selleck melodramatically 
           runs lines to himself.  Freddy is still attempting to make 
           shadow puppets, but the lights are at least all in place.  
           Brent tries to wrangle Petunia away from the stage.  The orcs 
           do whatever orcs do, but Liz isn’t there. Lax looks proud as 
           he navigates through it all.

           Jay looks back to his phone and then to the set.  He looks 
           like he’s having an epiphany as something clicks internally 
           and he feels refreshed.  He takes a moment and a deep breath 
           to himself before tossing his notes into a nearby trash bin.  
           He rises from his chair.

                                 JAY
                             (to Steve)
                        Take care of yourself, Steve.

           Steve is playing Pokemon Go.  Oblivious.

                                 STEVE
                        You, too.

           Jay makes for the exit.  Lax does a double take as he watches 
           him leave.

           EXT. THE STUDIO - BACKLOT - CONTINUOUS

           Jay exits the stage, feeling refreshed.  Lax catches up to 
           him.

                                 LAX
                        Jay?  Where you going?

                                 JAY
                        I’m done.

                                 LAX
                        What do you mean you’re done?  And 
                        here I thought we were just 
                        starting to have fun.
                                 JAY
                        There’s nothing on that set for me.  
                        And every day I am here it is just 
                        starting to feel more and more like 
                        work.

                                 LAX
                        Of course it’s work.  This is work!  
                        What’s it supposed to feel like?

                                 JAY
                        I just know whatever the reason is 
                        I got into this business, it’s not 
                        this.

                                 LAX
                        Hey at least something happens in 
                        my films and it’s not just a bunch 
                        of people sitting around 
                        complaining.

           I don’t know to what you’re referring.

                                 JAY
                        Look, Lax.  I honestly don’t care 
                        anymore.  You do whatever you want 
                        to do.  I just can’t be a part of 
                        it.  I’m sure Peters will send you 
                        another lackey soon.  He’ll 
                        probably smell like pancakes.

                                 LAX
                        Well that’s convenient timing.  I 
                        know it was you, Jay.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 LAX
                        The Wrap?  They called me this 
                        morning.  You really think my dad 
                        wrote my first screenplay?  I was 
                        testing you... And putting all of 
                        that in an email?  Have you learned 
                        nothing from this town? 

           Jay laughs to himself.  Resigned.

                                 LAX (CONT’D)
                        All of those articles though... Is 
                        that what you really think of me?
                                 JAY
                        I don’t know.  I think a part of me 
                        wanted it to be as simple as 
                        blaming you for perpetuating the 
                        industry’s problems, when it was 
                        probably more me projecting and not 
                        dealing with my own complacency. 
                        But I do know that every second I 
                        stay on that set is a second I’m 
                        wasting.

                                 LAX
                        And here I was just starting to 
                        like you.  So be it, Jaybird.  I’ll 
                        miss you.  We could’ve made magic 
                        together.

                                 JAY
                        No, we really couldn’t have.

           Jay begins to walk away, but turns around.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I read up on your boy 
                        Gilgamesh.  The guy was a 
                        tyrannical dictator who raped his 
                        women and didn’t know what he had 
                        until it was gone.  Have a nice 
                        life.

           Jay walks off.  Lax questions himself momentarily, but shrugs 
           it off and heads back to set.

           INT. BRONZE PICTURES - PETER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jay stands in front of Peters, who is noticeably fatter.  
           Peters uses a Q-tip.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll just get my things and be out 
                        of here.

                                 PETERS
                        Cool.

           Peters is watching the Dodgers game streaming on his 
           computer.

                                 JAY
                        I still don’t get how Lyle is okay 
                        replacing Tom Cruise with Tom 
                        Selleck.
                                 PETERS
                        Apparently, he owns the director’s 
                        cut of Three Men and a Baby.  This 
                        is all pocket change to him anyway. 

                                 JAY
                        And the studio?

                                 PETERS
                        Still onboard, except they’re now 
                        making it a faith-based film.  
                        Something about finding the light 
                        through the darkness.  I don’t 
                        know.  You sure you don’t just want 
                        to take a break?

                                 JAY
                        I’m sure.  Thanks.  Oh, and I got 
                        you a going-away present.

           Jay puts a box of protein bars on his desk.

                                 PETERS
                        Thanks, Jay!

           INT. BRONZE STUDIOS - JAY’S DESK - DAY

           Jay walks down to his desk where Dave is already setting up 
           his stuff.  Dave pours syrup over a plate of pancakes.  Karen 
           and Cindy look disgusted.

                                 JAY
                        Just getting the last of it.

           Jay notices a picture frame with Dave standing next to Lyle 
           on a beach somewhere.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Is that... Lyle?

                                 DAVE
                        Oh yeah, he’s my uncle.  

                                 JAY
                             (laughing)
                        That makes sense.  The nepotism in 
                        this town...

                                 DAVE
                        Why?  Who are you related to?

           Jay thinks about it for a second before responding.
                                 JAY
                        My dad.  Enjoy the pancakes.

           Jay grabs a box of his things and doesn’t look back.

           EXT. THE STEPHEN MURPHY COMPANY - DAY

           Jay pulls his car into the lot.  As he walks up, he sees 
           Murphy coming out of the office with a woman.

                                 MURPHY
                        Jay!  To what do I owe the 
                        pleasure?

                                 JAY
                        I’m done, Murph.  Just wanted to 
                        say goodbye.  I appreciate your 
                        advice over the years, but I’ve 
                        decided to go back home.

                                 MURPHY
                        Bullshit.

                                 JAY
                        Excuse me?

                                 MURPHY
                        You came into this office not too 
                        long ago with a fire in your belly 
                        demanding more, to do some good.  
                        Now I admit, until I met Claudia 
                        here,

           Claudia waves hello.

                                 MURPHY (CONT’D)
                        I was beyond burnt out myself, just 
                        like you’re feeling now.  I was 
                        disillusioned and couldn’t remember 
                        the last time I felt truly 
                        impassioned about the work.  But 
                        the world needs outsiders calling 
                        each other out.  This town needs 
                        people like you.

                                 JAY
                        But what do you do when nobody 
                        wants to listen?

                                 MURPHY
                        You speak louder.  

           Jay takes it in, unsure.
                                 MURPHY (CONT’D)
                        I apologize for the last time we 
                        saw each other.  I wasn’t in a good 
                        place.  But you’re too young to be 
                        so god damn cynical.  I know that 
                        fire still burns inside of you.  
                        You just have to find the right 
                        place to channel it.  The real 
                        truth is, things were never easy in 
                        this town. The 80s, 90s - sure, we 
                        made some healthy profits - but it 
                        was always hustle and work that won 
                        out in the end.  We’re just living 
                        in a time now where everyone has 
                        the tools to be a great filmmaker.  
                        It should be more exciting than 
                        anything and, more importantly, it 
                        needs curators and creatives like 
                        us to bring something great and 
                        fresh to the table.... Now, this 
                        business may have written me off 
                        years ago, but I’ve still got some 
                        friends in high places. Promise me 
                        you won’t go home just yet.  I 
                        think I know the right spot for 
                        you.  And it’s not in a strip mall 
                        in the valley.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        What’s wrong with a strip mall in 
                        the valley?

                                 MURPHY
                        Absolutely nothing.

           Murphy kisses Claudia and they walk off.  Jay stands there, 
           admiring how Murphy seems to have it figured out, and thinks 
           to himself.

           INT. SYNERGY MEDIA - DAY

           Open space offices bustling with activity.  People of all 
           ages and diversity.  Some are editing, some are reading, some 
           are collaborating, some are recording, but the energy all-
           around is positive and upbeat.  Jay walks alongside Roy 
           Davis, late 50s, as he gives Jay a tour.

                                 ROY
                        We pride ourselves as a new type of 
                        management and production company.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROY (CONT'D)
                        I took some time to figure out my 
                        next move after leaving The Agency, 
                        spent a lot of time in China, and 
                        eventually secured several rounds 
                        of financing from one of their top 
                        conglomerates. Sure, some of us 
                        wish we were still making feature 
                        films, but what’s most important to 
                        us here is finding and reaching 
                        audiences in new and creative ways.  
                        You see, today’s distribution 
                        models have changed.  It’s never 
                        been easier to consume or create 
                        content and, with that, comes the 
                        challenge of how do we, as a 
                        company, cut through the clutter 
                        and reach that audience?  Our 
                        answer here at Synergy is simple: 
                        Content.  Content has always been 
                        king.  If you put something good 
                        out there, people will find it and 
                        they’ll share it.  But there has to 
                        be accountability and a willingness 
                        to put in the work and out-hustle 
                        the competition from the start.  
                        Now I truly believe that if we take 
                        good care of each other, good 
                        things will happen.  The core team 
                        and culture here is most important 
                        to me. 

           INT. SYNERGY MEDIA - ROY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           They walk into Roy’s office.  Jay looks like a kid in a candy 
           store as Roy takes a seat behind his modest desk.  Pictures 
           of family frame his office.  A couple of vintage posters, 
           including The Producers, look back at Jay.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        I want the talent to be the ones 
                        walking out my door each and every 
                        night.  I want you to be as curious 
                        and as passionate as you’ve ever 
                        been as that’s the only way we’ll 
                        continue to adapt as a company and 
                        thrive.  This industry is changing 
                        by the minute and there needs to be 
                        more of a sense of urgency amongst 
                        us all to drive it forward and be 
                        ready for what the model will look 
                        like in 5, 10, 20 years.  I believe 
                        we have the greatest jobs in the 
                        world.

                        But that drive and that passion has 
                        to start within each of us.  Now, 
                        Murphy couldn’t speak more highly 
                        of you and that goes a long way 
                        with me.  We could have you 
                        starting with the development team 
                        immediately, but everyone wears a 
                        lot of hats here and you’ll find 
                        your place soon enough.  So how 
                        does that sound?

                                 JAY
                        Honestly, too good to be true.  I 
                        can’t tell you how refreshing all 
                        of this is to hear.  I won’t let 
                        you down.

                                 ROY
                        I know you won’t.  We’ll see you 
                        tomorrow.

           Jay lays in bed content for the first time in a while.  He 
           looks over at the matching Producers poster on his wall, 
           smiles to himself, and rolls over going to sleep at peace.

           EXT. SYNERGY MEDIA - MORNING

           Jay strolls up to the imposing Hollywood offices.  He wears a 
           blazer and jeans and looks more put together than we’ve seem 
           him yet.  A couple of people rush out of the offices.  That’s 
           weird.

           INT. SYNERGY MEDIA - MOMENTS LATER

           The elevator doors open on Jay and his heart sinks a bit.  
           The desks are scattered, posters are coming off of walls, 
           phones are being unhooked.  Jay walks through like it’s the 
           apocalypse, not knowing what’s going on.  The mood is 
           depressed as only a handful of people remain from the 
           previous day.  He grabs the shoulder of someone on their way 
           out.

                                 JAY
                        Hey, what’s going on?

                                 GUY
                        You didn’t hear?  The Chinese money 
                        fell through.  It was never real.  
           Jay’s weak in the knees.

                                 JAY
                        That’s impossible.  What about Roy?  
                        He must have a plan.

                                 GUY
                        Oh he has a plan.  There’s a rumor 
                        he’s taking a job at Buzzfeed.  The 
                        prick.  I gotta go.  Good luck.

           Guy walks out.  Jay slumps down and the office continues to 
           unwind around him.

           EXT. JAY’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           The rolling gate comes down on a U-Haul as Jay packs the last 
           of his belongings.  Zack and Jess join him.

                                 ZACK
                        Fucking China, man.  What’d I tell 
                        you?

                                 JAY
                        It’s for the better.  

                                 JESS
                        I could probably get you a job at 
                        The Agency as a trainee.  You sure 
                        you don’t want to stay?

                                 JAY
                        I’m sure.  But thank you.

                                 ZACK
                        Man, what’s happening to the world?  
                        Growing up, we were told never to 
                        talk to strangers.  Now, all of a 
                        sudden, they drive me around when 
                        I’m drunk, pick up my laundry, and 
                        bring me ramen.

                                 JAY
                        I think that just means you’re 
                        drinking too much.

                                 JESS
                        So what are you going to do?

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know.  Travel a bit.  I 
                        need some time.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        We’ve spent our adult lives telling 
                        other people’s stories.  I’d like 
                        to write my own for once.

                                 ZACK
                        That was the cheesiest thing I’ve 
                        ever heard.

           Jess’ phone rings and she answers.  Zack and Jay just stare 
           at her.

                                 JESS
                        This is Jess...  She was under the 
                        legal limit!  We’ve been through 
                        this!  ...Oh, wait, what?  Really?!  
                        Thank you!

           Jess hangs up.  A bit speechless with restrained jubilation.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        My boss just tipped me off.  
                        They’re promoting me on Monday... 

           The guys immediately go in to hug her.

                                 JAY
                        Holy shit.  That’s amazing!

                                 ZACK
                        Yes!

                                 JESS
                        I never thought they’d actually do 
                        it... And you have to stay now.  We 
                        have to celebrate!

           Jay looks torn.  But he needs to get out of this town.

                                 JAY
                        I can’t, Jess.  I can’t see all 
                        those people again.  But this is so 
                        well-deserved.  You’ll do great.

           Jess hugs Jay again.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for being there for me, 
                        guys.  You kept me sane for as long 
                        as was possible.  I’ll come back 
                        soon.

                                 JESS
                        Miss you, Jay.
                                 ZACK
                        Stay strong, brother.

           Jay gets in the U-Haul and drives off into the sunset.  I 
           mean on Sunset.  It’s the closest way to get to the 405.

                                 JESS
                        Think he’ll really be back?

                                 ZACK
                        Ten bucks says he has two kids, a 
                        desk job, and randomly pops up into 
                        my Facebook feed in about 5 years 
                        time.

           Jess looks off in the distance at the receding truck, but 
           then goes back to emailing on her phone as the two walk away.

           SUPER: MORE LIKE TEN YEARS LATER

           INT. JAY’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Because people can afford houses in places not named Los 
           Angeles.  Pictures of Jay traveling the world line the walls. 
           The pictures morph into him with a wife and kid and then we 
           pan across a bookshelf with a few novels written by Jay 
           himself: The Birth of a Salesman by Jay Michaels; To the Edge 
           and Back by Jay Michaels; Greek Mythology for Dummies by Jay 
           Michaels; Home by Jay Michaels. 

           A framed letter bookends the shelf with a picture of Jay, 
           proud, in front of his latest release: “To My Favorite 
           Client, Here’s to Many More! -Jess”

           We make our way to the kitchen where Jay finishes cooking and 
           plates dinner.  A TV plays on in the background as he brings 
           the plates around to the table, already set.  His young son 
           comes running into the room with a package.

                                 YOUNG SON
                        Dad!  It came.

           Jay opens the package and carefully inspects.  It’s a Super 8 
           camera.

                                 JAY
                        Wow.  She’s beautiful.  We’re going 
                        to have fun with this.

           The young son puts the camera to his face like he’s filming 
           just as Jay’s pregnant wife walks into the room.
                                 JAY’S WIFE
                        Hey!  Not at the table.

                                 JAY
                             (to his son)
                        We’re going to have fun with this 
                        tomorrow.

           Jay winks to his son as he puts the camera away.  He pulls 
           the chair out for his wife who smiles to him.  A quiet, 
           contented moment as his family sits around the table.  Life 
           is good.  

           Until the TV pipes up in the background cutting into an 
           “Inside Hollywood” style news report.  Jay realizes the TV is 
           on and gets up to turn it off, but pauses in front of the 
           set.

                                 FEMALE ANCHOR
                        We’re back with prolific director, 
                        Lax Mandis, from such heralded 
                        films as DARK and BARNACLE.  He 
                        joins us now ahead of the release 
                        of his latest picture about Arthur 
                        Miller.  A bit of a departure for 
                        you, Lax.  Tell us about this one.

                                 LAX
                        My pleasure, Sally.  Love those 
                        earrings by the way.  Fabulous. 

                                 FEMALE ANCHOR
                        Oh, thank you.

                                 LAX
                        This has long been a passion 
                        project of mine for some time.  
                        People called me silly for even 
                        trying to get it made, but there’s 
                        something at the core of Arthur 
                        Miller’s career and his tumultuous 
                        relationship with Elia Kazan that I 
                        think will speak true to today’s 
                        audiences.  Also, it’s set against 
                        the backdrop of the Cold War, which 
                        as you know, was so cold.

                                 FEMALE ANCHOR
                             (looking at her notes)
                        Right... And I didn’t realize 
                        Arthur Miller had such a prominent 
                        football career?
                                 LAX
                        Oh yeah.  Hell of an arm.

           Lax winks to the camera.  Is he winking at Jay?  Jay holds 
           the remote, but is shaking a little.

                                 JAY’S WIFE
                        Oh, honey, I like his movies.  Did 
                        you ever know him while you were in 
                        Los Angeles?

           Jay slowly looks up to his wife who has joined him.  Jay’s 
           look is part concern for his better half and part PTSD of a 
           time he’d prefer to forget.  Before he can really think about 
           anything more, he looks down at his hands, which slowly begin 
           to emanate other-worldly colors.  

                                 JAY’S WIFE (CONT’D)
                        Jay, what’s happening?

           Jay looks confused himself.  His wife slowly backs away.  The 
           room is getting smaller on Jay as we see his whole body is 
           now changing colors as it begins to heat up from the inside.  
           He looks straight at the camera with a blank face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JAY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jay’s house sits among other cookie-cutter houses in 
           suburbia... when it suddenly EXPLODES into a fiery ball!!  We 
           see the destruction and mushroom cloud from far above 
           until...

                                 JAY’S WIFE (V.O.)
                        Honey?

           INT. JAY’S HOUSE - EVENING

           We smash back into Jay’s house.  He’s still standing in front 
           of the TV holding the remote as his wife comes up behind him.  
           Jay’s Wife looks to the TV and back to Jay.

                                 JAY’S WIFE
                        Honey?  What’s the matter?

           Jay looks from the TV to his wife and kid.

                                 JAY
                        Absolutely nothing.
           He smiles, more confident than ever.  Putting that time 
           behind him, he shuts off the TV and kisses his wife.  Jay 
           tosses the remote over his shoulder onto the couch as he 
           rejoins his family for dinner and we fade to black.

                                                               THE END?
