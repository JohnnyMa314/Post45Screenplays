           Present day Tonya Harding, 44, overweight with the same 
           haircut she had in 1994, stares warily into the camera.

                                 TONYA
                        What’s people’s impression of me? 
                        That I’m a real person.

           She smiles a child star’s overly bright smile.

                                 TONYA
                        That I didn’ ever apologize for 
                        growin’ up poor or bein’ a red neck 
                        which is what I am. In a sport 
                        where the fuckin’ judges want you 
                        to be this old-timey version of 
                        what a woman’s supposed to be. Um. 
                        For bein’ the first U.S. woman to 
                        land the triple. So fuck ‘em. 

           She lights up a cigarette.

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)
                        I think the haters would say I grew 
                        up in a trailer park which I never 
                        did - chompin’ on cigars while 
                        plottin’ on how to take out my 
                        competition with a bunch a idiots 
                        in a basement somewhere. Which is 
                        bullshit cause I didn’t even smoke 
                        back then. Plus I have asthma.

           She puffs. She thinks for a moment. Her smile is gone.

                        Um... As a great skater.

           JEFF (GILLOOLY) STONE, middle aged, nondescript with a hint 
           of world weariness about him.

                                 JEFF
                        At 27 I was the most hated man in 
                        America. Maybe the world- with a 
                        moustache I still can’t apologize 
                        enough for. My name was a verb. 
                        Like, if you bash someone in the 
                        kneecap, you ‘Gillooly’ them... 
                        That was cool though. 

           He thinks a minute, touches where his moustache used to be.
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        When I got outta jail I changed my 
                        name to get a fresh start, you 
                        know? Only I moved right back to my 
                        same small town so - probably I 
                        didn’t think that through. Like a 
                        lot of things back then. But Tonya 
                        had my heart. She was my first. A 
                        part of you never gets over that. 
                        Well... Tonya did. 

           LAVONA (HARDING) GOLDEN, 70’s, wearing a wide brimmed hat, a 
           moulting half fur coat and A LIVE BIRD on her shoulder.

                                 LAVONA
                        Tonya’s my 5th child from husband 
                        number 4. She was always a handful 
                        but I loved her and I guess we 
                        spoiled her. Which is a goddamned 
                        hat trick when you haven’t got shit 
                        your entire life. Still. I drove 
                        her to competitions & practices. I 
                        sewed her all her costumes. I 
                        waited tables to pay for everything 
                        till I had to quit finally cause of 
                        the artificial parts in my hands. 

           She studies her hands.

                                 LAVONA (CONT'D)
                        But to her, her mother’s a monster. 
                        Her own mother.

                        As a body guard, my training is in 
                        counter espionage and counter 
                        terrorism. If I’d been in charge of 
                        the Kerrigan operation, we’d a 
                        gotten away with it. But Jeff was 
                        the mastermind. Originally Jeff & 
                        Tonya wanted to take out Nancy 
                        Kerrigan. I popped up, said there’s 
                        other ways to disable people. So. 
                        You’re welcome. Tonya was a 
                        narksassiss. Literally. I mean that 
                        in the true sense of the word.

                        press looked down on- then became. 
                        We paid Jeff, Tonya -all the main 
                        players for their stories 
                        exclusively, which meant for the 
                        first time the N.Y. Times & 
                        respectable press hada report what 
                        we said. (Smiling) Tonya really 
                        changed our standards in the media.

                                 FAN # 1
                        I always loved you, Tonya. I never 
                        believed you had anything to do 
                        with that incident. You are one of 
                        the best ice skaters who’s on ice. 
                        The people’s champion. And I’m glad 
                        to see you bounced back to a small 
                        extent. I am a Tonya Harding fan! 
                        And a Leonard Nimoy fan.

                        When I first met Tonya, I had no 
                        interest in being her coach. Lady 
                        figure skaters, you know, are put 
                        on a pedestal. Very much like a 
                        Miss America pageant... I never saw 
                        anyone beat Tonya in arm wrestling 
                        so- She was never going to be that. 

           She straightens her skirt that’s already straight.

                        Tonya and her folks lived in the 
                        back of their truck. They collected 
                        cans and bottles to survive. Ice 
                        skating’s an expensive sport and it 
                        made no sense for her to do it. 

           INT. ICE RINK - DAY - 

           A TITLE CARD READS: 40 YEARS EARLIER.

           Tonya, just 3 1/2, in a home made skating outfit and skates, 
           stands on the ice with Lavona, who wears sneakers. 
           They watch DIANE RAWINSON, late 20’s, pretty, perfect, 
           teaching a group of skaters.

           Lavona, puffing on a cigarette, sizes Diane up.

           When the class is over, Lavona takes Tonya’s hand and walks 
           across the ice.

                                 LAVONA
                        Diane! Lavona Harding. I spoke with 
                        you on-

                                 DIANE
                        Mrs. Harding-

                                 LAVONA
                        Lavona. It’s Lavona-

                                 DIANE
                        I’m sorry. There’s no smoking on 
                        the ice.

                                 LAVONA
                        Oh... I’ll smoke it quietly then. 
                        This here’s my daughter Tonya.

                                 DIANE
                        Mrs. Harding. I told you on-

                                 LAVONA
                        I know what you told me. And it’s 
                        Lavona. Only you never seen her 
                        skate.

                                 DIANE
                        I don’t-

                                 LAVONA
                        Now she’s in regular class but 
                        she’s already too good for it and 
                        she don’t even know how she’s doin’ 
                        it. It’s like a fucking miracle, 
                        for Christ sake. We figure with the 
                        right training she can make the 
                        most of her gift. Like Ice Capades 
                        maybe one day or something.

           Diane looks down at the little girl.

                                 DIANE
                        How old are you, honey?

                                 LAVONA
                        She’s a soft 4.
           Diane glances at a group of skaters warming up.

                                 DIANE
                        She’s a very pretty girl but I 
                        don’t take on students this young. 
                        I’m sorry. I have a class waiting.

           She skates to the center of the ice as students gather round.

           Tonya watches her go. Lavona stares bullets at Diane, then 
           nods purposefully to Tonya. 

           Lavona walks off the ice.

           Tonya slowly skates around the perimeter of the rink. As the 
           class begins, she circles the outside of the group.

           Never taking her eyes off Diane, she picks up speed, working 
           her way inside the group, narrowing her circles around Diane.

           Diane tries to ignore the little girl but soon her students 
           begin to laugh. 

           Tonya thrives on the attention. She skates in ever smaller 
           circles around Diane, wherever the coach skates.

           Finally Dianne stops. And the tiny 3 year old continues 
           zooming in ever shrinking circles all around her.

           Diane smiles.

           INT. COMPETITION ICE RINK - DAY

           A line of pagent-y 7 to 9 year old skaters stand in a line as 
           a trashy 3 year old girl (Tonya) receives a 1st place medal.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        I won my first competition before I 
                        was 4. Those bitches didn’t know 
                        what hit ‘em. 

           INT. PRACTICE ICE RINK - 40 YEARS AGO -EARLY MORNING

           Totally in her own world, Lavona skates by herself on the 
           ice. There is a surprising grace about her.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        My mother never told me I was good. 
                        Skating did.

           Suddenly 4 year old Tonya takes to the ice and barrels over 
           to her mother, breaking whatever fantasy Lavona was lost in. 
                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        A child automatically wants to love 
                        their mother.

           Lavona turns her back sharply away from her daughter. Tonya 
           slows to a stop beside her mom and waits.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        But mine was bat shit crazy.

           Lavona skates off the ice, leaving Tonya all alone.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        I didn’t ever know what went on in 
                        that head. 

           INT. PRACTICE ICE RINK - DAY - 4 YEARS LATER

           CLOSE ON: LAVONA sitting in the bleachers sipping ‘coffee’ 
           from a thermos.

                                 LAVONA
                        Wrooooong!!

           On the ice, 8 year old Tonya flounders. Parents of the other 
           skaters sit as far away from Lavona as possible.

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        Concentrate. Is that what you call 
                        a clean skate, for Christ sake?

                                 SKATER MOM
                        Could you not swear in front of the 
                        kids please, Lavona?

                                 LAVONA
                        I didn’t swear, you cunt. (To Tonya 
                        who’s talking to a skater) Stop 
                        talking to her! That girl is your 
                        enemy. You’re not here to make 
                        friends.

           Tonya and the girl skate toward the exit. Lavona jumps up.

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        Where the hell are you going?

                                 TONYA
                               (Embarrassed) 
                        I have to go to the bathroom.
                                 LAVONA
                        Don’t tell me what you have to do. 
                        I paid for you to practice. You’re 
                        gonna stay on the ice and practice.

           The other girls heads off. Tonya looks toward the bathroom. 

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        Get over here.

           Tonya recognizes the look on her mother’s face. She skates 
           backward, away from Lavona.

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        You’re only making it worse!

           Parents and skaters stop and stare.

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll have to come off the ice 
                        sometime. Ya hear me? I’ll be right 
                        here waiting.

           Tonya knows this is true. She puts all her attention on the 
           ice. She is unquestionably a prodigy. Ferocious. Fearless.

           At the height of her routine, she slows down suddenly, 
           coasting across on the ice. She looks at her mother.

           Lavona stares coldly. 

           Tonya drops her head. Not knowing what else to do, urine runs 
           down Tonya’s leg as she glides, hoping no one is watching.

                        To hear her tell it, I would 
                        operate on her daily without 
                        anaesthesia. One fuckin’ time. I 
                        hit her one time, with a hairbrush. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Lavona WHACKS 8 year old Tonya with a hairbrush.

                                 LAVONA
                        Fucking terrible scum su-!

           A female skating judge walks in, catching them. Tonya and 
           Lavona look up at her, caught.

                        A child sometimes wants to be 
                        corrected. When I felt this, I gave 
                        her criticism.

           Lavona pushes 9 year old Tonya off of her chair.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Through the car’s BACK WINDOW, we see Lavona slap 10 year old 
           Tonya across the face.

                                 LAVONA
                        The thing about Tonya was, she 
                        skated better when she was enraged. 
                        If there was no “You can’t do it” 
                        type of thing, she wouldn’t do it. 
                        She was my only kid with talent. I 
                        knew how to inspire her.

           The bird poops on Lavona’s shoulder. Lavona keeps on talking.

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        The truth is, she has issues, okay? 
                        Anger issues. She always had ‘em. 
                        She was just unnaturally born that 
                        way and I hada deal with it.

           CLOSE ON: TONYA, 11-ISH, FIRING A GUN. BAM!!

           A rabbit hops out of the way.

           EXT. WOODS - MORNING

           Tonya and her father AL, 48, walk through the Oregon woods.

                                 TONYA
                        Dang! 

                                 AL
                        It was a clean shot, Tonnie.
                                 TONYA
                        I know it. I was aiming for her 
                        eyes like you said. Otherwise I 
                        coulda got her probably.

                                 AL
                        No sense in shooting a bunny if you 
                        shoot half the meat off her.

           They walk through the woods, collecting discarded beer cans.

                                 TONYA
                        When I get older I’m gonna work in 
                        an office and have a deadline.

                                 AL
                        I thought you wanted to do Ice 
                        Capades.

                                 TONYA
                        I can do both. Yesterday mom made 
                        me wear my skating costume to 
                        school. The mustard yellow one with 
                        the tiara. Everyone made fun of me.

                                 AL
                        Why’d she do that?

                                 TONYA
                        Cause they were taking school 
                        pictures and she said we could use 
                        the samples for competitions. When 
                        I got home I told mom that Margie 
                        Sussman called us white trash and 
                        mom told me -

           SMASH CUT ON: LAVONA.

                                 LAVONA
                        Spit in her milk!!

           BACK TO TONYA AND AL.

                                 AL
                        I hope you didn’t do that, Tonnie.

                                 TONYA
                        Not yet... 

           He takes Tonya’s gun, reloads it.
                                 TONYA (CONT'D)
                        She sews beads on the backside of 
                        my costumes so if I fall I scrape 
                        up my butt. She does it on purpose.

           Al is quiet.

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)
                        Do you love her?

                                 AL
                        I guess. Do you?

                                 TONYA
                        ...Yes.

                                 AL
                        Like you love me?

           He hands the gun back to her. 

                                 TONYA
                        Nope. 

           Al nods. She aims. She fires.

           A bunny flies backward, dead.

           INT. ICE RINK - DAY

           A DAINTY SKATER glides on one leg, arms extended. 

           12 year old Tonya barrels past.

           Tonya soars up & lands a triple axel. She immediately looks 
           to Diane, standing with Lavona, for approval. 

                                 DIANE
                        Nice!

                                 LAVONA
                        What does she need a fucking fur 
                        coat for? I don’t have a fucking 
                        fur coat.

                                 DIANE
                        Because it’s not just skating. It’s 
                        how Tonya talks. What she wears. 
                        She needs the right contacts. The 
                        judges want figure skaters to be-

                                 LAVONA
                        Rich, prissy, a-holes-
                                 DIANE
                        Well rounded. It’s a question of 
                        fitting in.

                                 LAVONA
                        She’s 12 and she lands fucking 
                        triples. She doesn’t fit in. She 
                        stands out.

                                 DIANE
                        She stands out because she looks 
                        like she chops wood every morning.

                                 LAVONA
                        She does chop wood every..?

                                 DIANE
                        Lavona. She’s a fantastic athlete 
                        but you also need grace to become a 
                        world class figure skater.

                                 LAVONA
                        Well I don’t have money coming out 
                        of my ass.

                                 DIANE
                        You want to work with me a little? 
                        23 skaters I train so I can coach 
                        Tonya full time.

                                 LAVONA
                        And I waitress full time to pay for 
                        your coaching.

                                 DIANE
                        The difference is she’s not my 
                        daughter.

                                 LAVONA
                        No she’s mine. And I’m not throwing 
                        my money away so she can fit in 
                        with these little shits. You can 
                        dress up a pig however you want, ya 
                        know what I’m saying?

                                 DIANE
                        It’s not about fitting in. It’s 
                        about how she’s growing up. 

                                 LAVONA
                        Lick my ass, Diane. She can do a 
                        fucking triple.

           And in the background, Tonya does.
           INT. GROCERY STORE - EVENING

           As Lavona pushes a cart, Tonya, in skates, tiara and skating 
           outfit, practices her jumps and landings. 

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        Everything was saved up for 
                        skating. Period. Which was 
                        pressure. We were really poor. We 
                        didn’t have a lotta fun. We never 
                        went to Disneyland or on trips. If 
                        I wanted something, I hada come up 
                        with a way to get it.

           Shoppers don’t know what to make of her.

           EXT. ICE RINK - DAY

           Tonya, 12, in a fur coat stands with girls also in furs.

                        Mine’s mink.

                                 TONYA
                        Well we don’t owe nothing on mine.

                                 SNOOTY GIRL
                        What kind of a coat is that?

                                 TONYA
                        Rabbit.

           QUICK SHOTS: Tonya gleefully fires on an unsuspecting rabbit.

           INT. PUBLIC ICE RINK - AFTERNOON

           CLOSE ON: The razor sharp edge of Tonya’s skate racing at 
           ridiculous speed. The sound of blade scraping against ice.  

           Tonya, 15, (now played by the same actress who plays modern 
           day Tonya) prepares for a tricky jump but another skater 
           crosses nearby. Tonya STOPS, skates over to the girl.

                                 TONYA
                        You’re. In. My. Way.

           Cowed, the other skater moves aside. Then Tonya JUMPS.

           At the other end of the rink, 18 year old JEFF GILLOOLEY 
           watches at the rail with his friend, SHAWN, 18, obese.
                                 JEFF
                        Who’s that?

           Shawn squints, ketchup from his hotdog falls on his shirt.

                        We met at the Lloyd’s Center

           Jeff smiles nostalgically. Tonya rolls her eyes in disgust.

           INT. PUBLIC ICE RINK - DAY

           Tonya and Jeff chat awkwardly on opposite sides of the rail.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        I was right outta high school and I 
                        had no game whatsoever.

           Jeff tries to appear super cool:

                                 JEFF
                        So... do you like food?

           Tonya hesitates, then nods.

           INT. HARDING BATHROOM - DAY

           Tonya uses a curling iron while applying blue eye shadow. Her 
           stepbrother CHRIS, late 20’s, watches, hand on his crotch.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        I remember Jeff and my’s first date 
                        cause I had my stepbrother arrested 
                        earlier in the day.

           Chris traces Tonya’s back with his finger. Tonya pulls away.

                                 CHRIS
                        You don’t need that makeup, Tonnie.

           He moves closer, his hands slowly cupping her breasts.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        You look good to me already.

           He smiles. In one quick motion Tonya whirls around, 
           brandishing the hot curling iron like a baseball bat, 
           WALLOPING Chris across the face. He goes down LOUD and HARD.

                        day. And I’d never been on a date. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATRE - EVENING

           Jeff ‘casually’ puts his arm around Tonya. She smiles.

                                 TONYA
                        What’s the name of this picture?

                                 JEFF
                        Running Scared.

                        Little did I fucking know.

           Tonya’s dad sits 2 rows behind, watching them.

           EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - EARLY EVENING

           On the Marquee: Crocodile Dundee. Top Gun. Ferris Bueller. 
           Jeff & Tonya stand close, say goodbye. Just before they kiss:

                                 AL
                         Okay. That’s enough.

           They stop inches from a kiss. And they part.

                        On that first date, Lavona went 
                        with us. And she chose the 
                        restaurant. The King’s Buffet. 
                        Tonya said she was 16 but she was 
                        15. I was 18.

           INT. KING’S BUFFET RESTAURANT - EARLY EVENING

           Lavona, Tonya, Jeff sit at a serve yourself style restaurant.

                                 LAVONA
                        You a gardener or a flower, John?

                                 JEFF
                        Jeff.
                                 LAVONA
                        In a relationship there’s a flower 
                        and there’s a gardener.

                                 TONYA
                        Mom-

                                 JEFF
                        Um, I don’t know. It’s our first 
                        date...

                                 LAVONA
                        I’m a gardener who wants to be a 
                        flower. How fucked am I?

           She downs a drink. 2 restaurant employees approach the table.

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        Tonya won’t garden to save her 
                        life. You’re gonna have to do all 
                        the gardening there fella.

                                 TONYA
                        Mom!

                                 LAVONA
                        What??

           They look at Jeff as if saying, ’See what I put up with?’

                                 1ST RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE
                        We’re gonna need some of the 
                        chickens back.

           A beat. They all turn, puzzled.

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 2ND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE
                                     (To Lavona)
                        You’re not our only customer who 
                        likes our chicken.  

                                 LAVONA
                        I don’t like your fucking chicken. 
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

           Lavona glares but they just wait. A stand off. 

           Finally she hands over her bag. The employee opens it.
           CLOSE ON: LAVONA’S LARGE PURSE. 

           The inside is LINED with plastic and it is stuffed FULL with 
           broiled chicken parts.

                                 1ST RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE
                        The rule is all you can eat, lady. 
                        Not all you can carry.

           Then they walk off with the large dripping purse.

                                 LAVONA
                        I’m gonna need that purse returned 
                        a-hole.

                                 JEFF
                        Lavona was mean. And she stank. And 
                        she was alcoholic. She pretty much 
                        abandoned all 5 of her kids. But 
                        Tonya needed her approval. And 
                        Lavona wouldn’t give it. Probably 
                        cause Tonya needed it.

           EXT. GILLOOLEY YARD - DAY

           Jeff and Tonya work under the hood of Jeff’s truck. On the 
           trucks radio, Peter Gabriel sings, Sledgehammer. 

                                 TONYA
                        My dad’s only been laid off a 
                        couple months now. We had plenty of 
                        money before. I have a fur coat and 
                        everything.

                                 JEFF

                                 TONYA
                        Yeah. And you know skating’s an 
                        expensive sport so... He hurt his 
                        back. He can’t even sleep on the 
                        water bed no more. Otherwise-

                        My family’s poor.

           This quiets her. Tonya watches him.
                                 TONYA
                        You need me to disconnect the plugs 
                        before you-

                        Kay.

           She moves closer as they work. Jeff hands her a towel.

                                 TONYA
                        That’s all right.

           She wipes her hands on her pant legs. Jeff smiles.

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)

                        I do this job for the Association 
                        for Retarded Citizens. I mean, I’m 
                        not a retarded citizen. I’m their 
                        driver. Which is cool. I can’t 
                        decide between college & Air Force. 
                        My dad was Air Force. He died when 
                        I was young and my college is paid 
                        for. Just seems like a natural deal 
                        to go to college but- I dunno.

                                 TONYA
                        My parents had me quit school. To 
                        concentrate on skating. Which is 
                        nice but-

                                 JEFF
                        You miss your friends.

                                 TONYA
                        No. I didn’t have friends there. I 
                        have friends from skating but I 
                        only ever see them at competitions. 
                        A lot of them aren’t as into it as 
                        me and sometimes I show up and 
                        they’re just gone. I had a lot of 
                        friends just disappear.

           He watches her, moved.

                                 JEFF
                        Well you can have some of mine. I 
                        have friends I haven’t even used 
                        yet.
                                 TONYA
                        So, what? You like me?

                                 JEFF
                        You are so fuckin’ pretty.

                                 TONYA
                        No, I’m not!

           She looks COMPLETELY BAFFLED as he moves closer. A beat.

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)
                        You are.

           Under the open, greasy hood of his truck, they kiss.

                        You gotta move now, honey.

           She takes his hand and pats her head with it.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Tonnie, please.

           Then he pushes her backwards. She stares.
                                 TONYA
                        Dad?

           He stares ahead.

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)
                        Dad!

           He drives off. She watches his truck till it’s out of sight.

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)
                        Take me!!

           Lavona watches silently. Then goes inside and shuts the door.

           INT. ICE RINK - NIGHT

           Tonya skates alone on the ice, one powerful move after 
           another. It is the only release she has as her athleticism 
           transcends her surroundings. She is in the zone. Nothing can 
           touch her. This is who she is.

           She whips into a frantic whirl.

           TONYA’S P.O.V.: Her world spins in chaos but somehow she 
           controls it.

           Then she stops. She looks around the empty rink, breathing 
           hard. She hears the Zamboni come onto the ice behind her, 
           signaling the closing of the rink.

           Tonya starts to cry.

           INT. ICE RINK LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           ‘Swan Lake’ blares. Skaters in costumes Vegas would reject 
           stretch and prepare for a competition. Bangles, glitter and 
           sequins are everywhere. And these are the boys.

           INT. ICE RINK LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Muscular girls transform themselves into ‘Graceful Swans.’ 

           One hides a competitor’s skate. 

           One stealthily drenches another’s costume with a Coke.  

           One ‘accidentally’ face sprays her competition as she 
           lacquers her hair with Aquanet.
           INT. ICE RINK - SCORING AREA - DAY

           Applause as a SUGAR PLUM FAIRY leaves the ice. Waiting for 
           her scores she sips tea. Tonya, in 1980’s overly thought out 
           ‘PUNK,’ steps beside her, smashing a Coke can in her fist.

           A beat. Both girls give the other the once over as the music 
           changes. ZZ Top’s ‘Sleeping Bag’ BLARES. Tonya burps loudly.

           INT. ICE RINK - ON THE ICE - DAY

           Tonya performs to the music. The judges clearly dislike her 
           selection but her skating has a power none of the other 
           skaters possess. This is no old fashioned ice princess. 

           INT. ICE RINK - THE STANDS - DAY

           Jeff grimaces nervously when Tonya soars and lands.

           Shawn licks food from his fingers, watching the monitor 
           instead of watching live.

           Lavona studies Tonya, cooly.

           When Tonya finishes, the crowd CHEERS.

           INT. ICE RINK - SCORING AREA - DAY

           Tonya, out of breath, using her asthmas inhaler, waits for 
           her scores with Diane. When the scores come in, the crowd 
           BOOS loudly.

           Tonya and Diane quickly gather their things and walk off.

                                 TONYA
                        They fuckin’ hate me. Emily Ann 
                        fell and scored higher.

                                 DIANE
                        Emily Ann is a more traditional-

                                 TONYA
                        She fell on her ass! This is 
                        bullshit.

                                 DIANE
                        If your routine were more 
                        conventional-

                                 TONYA
                        I don’t want to be conventional!!
                                 DIANE
                        Your scores reflect that.

                                 TONYA
                        If I did a triple they’d have to 
                        give me my fucking scores.

                                 DIANE
                        It’s not nearly consistent enough. 
                        Right now you need to focus on 
                        being more like the other skaters.

                                 TONYA
                        I don’t want to do what everyone 
                        else is doing. Skating’s what makes 
                        me special. They don’t like ZZ Top? 
                        Let’s see how they like Billy 
                        fuckin’ Idol!

                                 LAVONA (V.O.)
                        Tonya.

           Lavona stands there imperiously. Tonya looks mortified.  She 
           tears up. Lavona waits. 

           Finally Tonya heads over. But she walks past Lavona into 
           Jeff’s arms. He comforts her.

           Lavona watches silently.

           INT. HARDING KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Tonya sits, eating self-consciously. Lavona stands behind 
           her, uncomfortably close, just glaring at her. Finally:

                                 TONYA
                        It wasn’t my fault.

                                 LAVONA
                        Nothing’s ever your fault.

                                 TONYA
                        I out-skated-

                                 LAVONA
                        You skated like a graceless bull 
                        dyke! I was embarrassed for you out 
                        there. 

                                 TONYA
                        I’m sorry.
                                 LAVONA
                        Your father’s not paying alimony ya 
                        know. Every penny I make - every 
                        penny - goes to your skating. And 
                        you weren’t even fucking trying. 

                                 TONYA
                        I said I was sorry.

           Lavona wallops Tonya across the head from behind.

                                 LAVONA
                        Don’t fucking talk back to me.

                                 TONYA
                        Saying I’m sorry isn’t talking 
                        back!

           Outraged, Lavona rails on her even harder. 

                                 LAVONA
                        That supposed to be smart? You 
                        think I like working for you, you 
                        selfish bitch? 

           Tonya escapes around the other side of the table.

              LAVONA
                              TONYA
           You fucking ungrateful-
                        Stop it!!

           Lavona throws a glass of milk at Tonya but misses.

                                 LAVONA (CONT’D)
                        Rolling your fucking alien eyes at 
                        me when I’m talking! 

                                 TONYA
                        I didn’t!

                                 LAVONA
                        If you’re sleeping with that 
                        moustache I want you to start 
                        paying rent. 

                                 TONYA
                        You’re crazy!

                                 LAVONA
                        I’m not paying for you to act like 
                        a whore and live off me for free!

              TONYA
                              LAVONA
           Bat shit fuckin’ crazy!
                        Ugly fuckin’ whore!
           Lavona throws a KNIFE. It lands in Tonya’s arm. They stop.

           Tonya looks at the knife in her arm. She pulls it out. She 
           takes the knife by the handle and slowly approaches Lavona, 
           glaring at her.

           When she is in Lavona’s face, she slams the knife point first 
           on the table. Then she walks out. Lavona doesn’t move.

           CLOSE ON MODERN DAY LAVONA.

                                 LAVONA
                        Oh, please! Show me a family that 
                        doesn’t have ups and downs... 
                        Teenagers are difficult. I didn’t 
                        make that rule. Ask any mother.

           CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY JEFF.

                                 JEFF
                        After they divorced, her dad moved 
                        to Idaho for work so we got a place 
                        together. There wasn’t no more talk 
                        of air force or college. I didn’t 
                        care though. I wanted to take care 
                        of her. To protect her. Everything 
                        I did was to protect her...

           INT. JEFF AND TONYA’S HOUSE - DAY

           In an overly saturated scene of domestic bliss, Jeff delivers 
           sandwiches to Tonya at the front door with a suitcase packed.

                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        It was a nice time. I helped her 
                        get her G.E.D. I’d make her peanut 
                        butter sandwiches and she’d go off 
                        to competitions. We had exactly the 
                        same interests.

           She gives him a flirty kiss which turns into a grope which 
           turns to full on making out as they slide down to the floor.

           EXT. OREGON FORREST - DAY

           A 4 wheel truck splatters mud everywhere. Jeff steers with 
           his feet while, head out the window, mud covered Tonya 
           screams with delight.
                                 JEFF (V.O.)
                        We both liked trucks. And fixing 
                        cars up. We liked to go 4 wheeling. 
                        So I thought it would last forever! 
                        It was a real simple time. There’s 
                        no way I coulda known either of us 
                        would be known around the world. 

           TRUE TONYA FANS #2, MATTHEW AND VIVIAN, 20’S HIPSTERS, SIT IN 
           THEIR BROOKLYN APARTMENT IN FRONT OF A HUGE BLOWN UP 
           PHOTOGRAPH OF TONYA AND NANCY ON THE ICE.

                                 MATTHEW    
                        Vivian and I raised money on Kick 
                        Starter to turn the hallway in our 
                        apartment into a Nancy and Tonya 
                        museum. Our theory is everyone is 
                        either a Nancy or a Tonya. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        If you have to think about it- 
                        you’re a Tonya. Which is confusing 
                        cause if you immediately think 
                        you’re a Nancy- you’re definitely a 
                        Tonya. But. If you think you’re 
                        Oksana Baiul, who won that year- 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Well aren’t you just perfect.

                                 MATTHEW AND VIVIAN
                        We see right through you.

           INT. ICE RINK - SCORING AREA - DAY

           The crowd BOOS as Tonya’s scores are revealed. Tonya glares. 
           Diane puts her arm around her but Tonya throws it off.

                                 TONYA
                        This is fucking wrong, Diane.

           Tonya jumps back onto the ice as another skater moves into 
           her starting ‘graceful swan’ pose.

                                 DIANE
                        Tonya!

           INT. ICE RINK - ICE - DAY (CONT.)

           Tonya skates past the posing skater who remains frozen, ONLY 
           HER EYEBALLS follow Tonya who skates over to the judges.
                                 TONYA
                        Hey! How do I get a fair shot here?

           The judges are stunned.

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)
                        I’m up at 5 every morning working 
                        my ass off. You wanna stop wasting 
                        my time & tell me to my face you’re 
                        never giving me scores I deserve?

           The audience starts whistling and cheering for her.

                                 JUDGE 1
                        This is how it’s done. Some of 
                        these girls have paid their dues- 

                                 TONYA
                        I don’t give a shit if they’ve been 
                        at it longer! I out-skated all of 
                        them today.

                                 JUDGE 2
                        When you come onto the ice in an 
                        outfit like that, I’m gonna deduct 
                        half point before you even skate.

                                 TONYA
                        Well you know what? If you can come 
                        up with $5000 for a costume for me 
                        then I won’t have to make one. But 
                        until then, stay out of my face. 

                                 JUDGE 3
                        Maybe you’re just not as good as 
                        you think you are. Maybe you need 
                        to pick another sport.

                                 TONYA
                        Suck my dick! This is fuckin’ 
                        rigged!

           The crowd goes wild as Tonya skates past the ‘frozen swan,’ 
           whose terrified eyeballs watch Tonya race past her.

                        and complete a triple axel jump-

                        Shit like that. She had this 
                        attitude now. Thought she was 
                        better than everyone. And outta

           Tonya throws her clothes into a suitcase, heads out the door.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        Now he was hittin’ me to, I don’t 
                        know, show me who’s boss. So he 
                        could feel better about himself. I 
                        just had enough. My whole entire

                        to anything. Well. Maybe I would.

           She SLAMS the door behind her, triumphantly.

           INT. JEFF AND TONYA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jeff OPENS the door. Jeff and Tonya’s house is now empty 
           except for 1 chair. Jeff takes a look around, stunned.

                        Skate America.

                        Tonya did the triple. No one else 
                        could or even had the balls to try. 

           She nails a triple. The audience cheers.

                        1991 was Tonya’s year. By 92 she 
                        stopped practicing. At the 1992 
                        Olympics, Tonya showed up late, out 
                        of shape and in no way ready to go. 
           INT. OLYMPIC ICE RINK 1992 - EVENING.

           Tonya tries for the triple and tumbles hard on the ice.

                                 ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
                        No! Down she goes!

                                 ANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.)
                        Well she’s had a troubled year. The 
                        girl comes from the wrong side of 
                        the tracks. Mother married and 
                        divorced 6 times. Troubled 
                        childhood. But she’s a fighter who 
                        really guts it out!

           INT. OLYMPIC ICE RINK 1992 - LATER

           Tonya waits for her scores with Doddie. She uses her inhaler.

                                 ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.)
                        See? She’s asthmatic. All sorts of 
                        problems.

           INT. OLYMPIC ICE RINK 1992

           Tonya, disappointment on her face, watches as Kristi 
           Yamaguchi, Madori Ito and Nancy Kerrigan get their medals.

                        So, I’d broken off my skate blade 2 
                        days before. They put it back on a

           Tonya hits the snooze button as the alarm goes off.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        All my landings were off. It wasn’t 
                        my fault. 

           She takes a swig of beer, turns over and goes back to sleep.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Tonya downs a beer as she shoots pool.

           Doddie checks her watch, waiting for Tonya at the empty rink.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        I mean they seen it but they didn’t 
                        think it was there cause it wasn’t

                        really good. I was really happy

           Jeff rips Tonya’s hair out. She screams.

           EXT. PORTLAND STREET - NIGHT

           Tonya runs through the mud, terrified, holding her skates.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        You feel so small and you wanna be 
                        bigger. So you tell yourself what

                        But at a certain point, I thought, 
                        all I know is violence. That’s 
                        where I feel comfortable. And 
                        that’s so fucked up. So I divorced 
                        him. Done.

           INT. ICE RINK - DAY

           In practice, Tonya goes for a triple and lands it. She glides 
           on the ice, just processing it.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        And guess the fuck what? The jumps 
                        started to come back.

           INT. ICE RINK - AFTERNOON

           Tonya reaches incredible height, easily pulling off a triple. 
           She looks to Diane, once again her coach, for approval.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        But Jeff. He wasn’t done with me. 

           INT.EXT. TONYA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tonya gives her statement to officers as police lights flash.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        I called the cops on him that whole 
                        summer. Filed restraining orders. 
                        He was always threatening me.

           INT./EXT. TONYA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jeff pulls up in his truck honking his horn. When Tonya looks 
           out the window, he gets out and holds up a purse.

                                 JEFF
                        Missing something?

           Tonya looks around her apartment where she left her purse but 
           it is gone. There is a BANGING at the door.

           Tonya hesitates, not knowing what to do. She goes to the 
           door. A beat. The second she unlocks it, he BASHES through.

           She falls back, turns to run but he tackles her. Tonya kicks 
           him hard, getting away. 
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I am gonna break your fucking legs!

           He grabs her and he shoves her up against the wall. He pulls 
           out a gun and puts it against his head.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Do you want me to kill you or do 
                        you want me to kill myself?

                                 TONYA
                        Stop it!

                                 JEFF
                        Huh? Which is it, bitch? What do 
                        you want?

           She pushes him off her and gets to the door before he spins 
           her around and puts the gun right in her face.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I’ll fucking kill you right here. 
                        You don’t need your purse. You 
                        don’t need anything. You’re gonna 
                        be with me or nobody!

           She screams, knees him in the balls and runs out the door.

           EXT. TONYA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tonya runs out SCREAMING. 

           Jeff reaches the doorway and starts FIRING.

           He fires into the ground near Tonya’s feet but a fragment 
           ricochets into her head.

           BOOM. She goes down hard.

           Tenants come out of their apartments. Jeff waves his gun.

                                 JEFF
                        Get back! Get away from her!

           He drags her into his truck and SCREECHES away.

                        did! Look what you made me do!

           POLICE SIRENS are heard telling them to pull over.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I will kill you if you say 
                        anything! Shit!

           He pulls the car over and throws the gun under the back seat 
           as a POLICEMAN comes over to Jeff’s window.

           POLICEMAN’S P.O.V.:

           Jeff and Tonya sit calmly. Jeff nods at the policeman. Tonya, 
           her head bleeding profusely smiles brightly at the officer.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        I’m going to need you both to get 
                        out of the car.

           Jeff good-naturedly chats with the policeman. Tonya, bleeding 
           and smiling, watches.

                        And he let us go!! Didn’t say 
                        anything about the blood! Took 
                        alcohol and 2 guns out of the 
                        truck! Then he just put me back in 
                        there with him which is why I don’t 
                        trust the authorities. Or anyone... 
                        Jeff can talk his way outta

                        thought her skating career was 
                        over. Then the Olympic committee

                        were going to be just 2 years away

           Tonya shakes her head. The Association member looks around.

                        You are not our ideal. You’re a

                        not get the marks you deserve. 
                        Think about that.

           He walks off. Tonya is left there, stunned.

           Jeff and Tonya listen to an answering machine message over 
           and over but it’s inaudible due to wear.

                                 TONYA
                        She’s saying Nancy Kerrigan trains 
                        at Tuna Can Arena.

                                 JEFF
                        Who’s gonna name an arena Tuna Can?

                        again. Our machine’s a piece of 
                        crap. Could you tell me where Nancy 
                        Kerrigan trains again? I have a bet 
                        with Jeff. Spell that, hon? Uh huh. 
                        And what times does she train?

           She winks at Jeff and writes it all down.

                        That is such bullshit. The FBI 
                        found this piece of paper in some 
                        random dumpster supposedly in my 
                        hand writing with Nancy’s training 
                        schedule and shit on it. If I were 
                        gonna destroy evidence, why would I 
                        drive to the middle a nowhere and 
                        throw it away when I could just

                        It was the arena Nancy skated at 
                        and her training times. Why did 
                        they need training times if they 
                        were mailing letters? Gillooly can

                        planning it and she was. But the 
                        plan was to mail some letters. 
                        There was never suppose to be an 
                        assault. Just letters. Like a scary 
                        Monica Seles type thing which was 
                        in the news then. So I gave Shawn a

              TONYA
           I had a session later that 
           night. So I was asleep.
                               JEFF
                        January 6th. I was sleeping 
                        in.

           They both stare into the camera, blankly.

           INT. ICE RINK - LOBBY - DAY

           Huge banners announce ‘L’eggs Presents 1994 Women’s National 
           Figure Skating Championships.’ 

           Shane Stant, Shawn’s ‘professional hit man’ stands slightly 
           bug-eyed watching the security guards in front of a 
           ‘Restricted Area’ sign, psyching himself up.

                                 SHANE
                        If my mind’s a blank, no one can 
                        pick up my vibes. No one can 
                        identify me if they don’t see my 
                        eyes...

           His face goes slack as his mind blanks. He gazes down and 
           oddly to the right. He takes a deep breath, holds it. Then:

           He walks right past security.

           INT. ICE RINK - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           Shane wipes his brow as he gets his bearings. Cameramen, 
           skaters, technicians, coaches, all mill about.

           A 12 YEAR OLD SKATER nods at him as she passes. Shane falls 
           backward against a wall, trying to remain out of sight.

                                 SHANE
                        I’m an invisible being. I’m 
                        completely unseen.

           He turns. A SECURITY GUARD is right beside him, staring. They 
           lock eyes. A beat.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You all right?

                                 SHANE
                        ...The john?
           The guard points. Shane mind-blanks again as he heads off. 

           Shane looks around, lost. He stops Michelle Kwan’s coach.

                                 SHANE (CONT’D)
                        Which one’s Kerrigan?

           The coach points to the ice rink. Shane watches Nancy 
           Kerrigan practice on the ice. 

           He spots the exit curtain that leads off the skating rink and 
           he heads in that direction, trying to stay out of sight.

           A PRETTY YOUNG SKATER is bent over, tying her shoe. 

           Shane stares at her ass as he passes, trips, falls over a 
           bench, creating a clatter.

           People rush over to help him up but he stares them all down, 
           macho-like. Then he ‘casually’ heads toward the rinks’ exit. 

           When he gets there, he tries to ‘blend in’ but is too wiggly, 
           too nervous. His breathing is quick.

           Nancy suddenly steps off the ice, PASSING by him. He does a 
           double take. A cameraman sweeps by in hot pursuit. 

           Shane follows the unsuspecting cameraman closely, matching 
           his steps so exactly it looks like one person walking. 

           Shane SNAPS open a baton. They disappear behind the curtain.

           INT. SKATING RINK - ROOM BEHIND THE CURTAIN - DAY

           As the cameraman bends to put down his camera, Shane almost 
           falls over him but slips around him instead.

           Barely getting his balance, he run/walks quickly, legs high, 
           towards the exit, raises the baton, STRIKING NANCY KERRIGAN’S 
           LEG from behind as he runs out, never looking back.

           INT. SKATING RINK HALLWAY - DAY

           Shane races down the hallway SUPER FAST as the first screams 
           are heard.

           Shane overshoots the exit, hops back and runs toward 2 large 
           glass doors that lead to the street. 

           He CRASHES into them. He pushes & pulls them. They’re locked.
           Shane takes a step back. He looks down the hall then back at 
           the glass doors, puzzled.

           He looks at the baton in his hand then at the glass doors. He  
           RAISES the baton.

           But instead of using the baton, HE SMASHES THE GLASS WITH HIS 
           HEAD, baton held high.

           Glass shatters. He pulls his head back, dazed, then he pushes 
           through the door. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A bit baffled, Shane takes a step in one direction then the 
           opposite one. Then in one direction, then the other.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Stop that man!

           An OLD MAN happens to be standing there. Shane FREEZES. The 
           older man takes in Shane’s size then takes a step back. 

           Then the old man turns and runs off. A beat. 

           Shane inexplicably tackles him & they both hit the ground 
           hard. 

           Then Shane jumps up. 

           He races down the street just as a car pulls alongside him, 
           never stopping.

           Shane throws the baton underneath a random car and jumps 
           inside the getaway car as it skids off.

           The old man on the ground gives him the finger.

                        Shane Stant was clueless. Before

                        moved his car every 15 minutes to

           Jeff lays sprawled out on the bed. Finally he answers his

                        Well they put a fucking stamp on 
                        the letter, Jeff, is what I’m 
                        saying. Turn on the TV. It’s 
                        everywhere.

           She hangs up. 

           Jeff falls out of bed, turns on the TV and stands naked in 
           front of it. He channel surfs.

           On every station Nancy cries out “WHY??”

                                 JEFF
                        WHAT THE SHIT????!!!

           He throws the remote across the room.

           CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY TONYA.

                                 TONYA
                        I was terrified. There was some nut 
                        job out there. So I called Jeff and 
                        told him, you know, what was 
                        happening and he sounded so 
                        sincere. Like ‘Oh my God! I wish I 
                        was there for you.’ Like I’m some 
                        stupid bitch when he planned the 
                        whole thing.
           EXT. SHAWN’S (PARENTS) HOUSE - DAY

           Jeff’s truck skids and screeches to a halt. Dust flies.

           INT. SHAWN’S (PARENTS) HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY (CONT.)

           Jeff burst through the door. Shawn and his parents are 
           watching the news reports on the attack.

                                 JEFF
                        What the hell, Shawn?!?

                                 SHAWN
                        We did it man! We’re everywhere! 
                        It’s so friggin’ awesome!

                                 JEFF
                        What the fuck did you do??

                                 SHAWN
                        I changed the course of history! 
                        Whoooo!

                                 SHAWN’S PARENTS
                        Whooo!

                                 JEFF
                        Are you insane?! No one’s supposed 
                        to get hurt. It’s supposed to be 
                        psychological warfare re- 

                                 SHAWN
                        What if it didn’t work, Jeff? What 
                        if it didn’t scare her? All our 
                        hard work woulda been for nothing.

                                 JEFF
                        What hard work? It was mailing 
                        fucking letters!!

                                 SHAWN
                        I had to make sure it would happen. 
                        Look, I’m Tonya’s bodyguard. Now 
                        all the skaters are gonna need one. 
                        The money’s gonna be pouring in. I 
                        changed the course of history!

                                 SHAWN’S PARENTS
                        Whooo!!

                                 JEFF
                        This is out of control.
                                 SHAWN
                        Right? We’re on friggin’ CNN!!

           He kisses Jeff playfully. Jeff pushes him away. 

           Shawn’s parents channel surf. On one station, a sketch that 
           resembles no one is shown:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR 1
                        This is a sketch of the attacker 
                        but so far observers cannot agree 
                        whether the suspect is black or 
                        white.

           The channel changes.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR 2
                        ...have learned exclusively the 
                        attacker comes from the Canadian 
                        province of Ontario where Kerrigan  
                        received hate mail some months ago-

           Shawn hoots and applauds. Jeff holds his head in his hands.

                                 JEFF
                        It was a simple plan, Shawn. Why 
                        didn’t you just stick to it?

                                 SHAWN
                        I did stick to the plan.

                                 JEFF
                        This was not the plan!

                                 SHAWN
                        This was always the plan. See, in 
                        my profession I have to think 4 
                        steps ahead of everyone, Jeff. Why 
                        do you think I called the death 
                        threat on Tonya?

           Jeff is stopped in his tracks.

                                 JEFF
                        Why- wait, what???

                                 SHAWN
                        People don’t take me seriously, 
                        Jeff. But I am in control of 
                        situations. I think I proved that.

                                 JEFF
                        This is out of control, you dumb 
                        fuck! We have to fix this!
                                 SHAWN
                        Relax. Everything’s great. Jesus. 
                        My parents taped over my favorite 
                        Star Trek episode to record the CNN- 
                        I’m keeping it together! We win!

                                 JEFF
                        You’re a fucking idiot!

                                 SHAWN
                        We gotta get those guys out of 
                        Detroit though. They’re stuck there 
                        and they don’t have any money. 

           Jeff heads towards the door.

                                 JEFF
                        Unbelievable!

                                 SHAWN
                        Right?!! Whooo!!!!

           The door slams after Jeff.

           TRUE TONYA FAN #4. LESTER, 50’S his shirt reads “If you can’t 
           handle me at my Tonya, you don’t deserve me at my Nancy.’ 

                                 LESTER
                        Tonya. I am not a total weirdo. I 
                        live in a small town where you 
                        could live a normal life without 
                        people trying to dig up dirt like 
                        you’re Paris or Brittany showing 
                        your gutter hanging out. Nancy 
                        Lonergan was a world class bitch in 
                        my opinion. Again, I am not a 
                        weirdo and if you want, you could 
                        help me rebuild my 64 Impala SS 
                        from the frame up.

           He gives the most hopeful of smiles and crosses his fingers.

           INT. ICE RINK NATIONALS - NIGHT 

           Fans hold signs cheering her on as Tonya skates around the 
           ice. She looks almost angry, determined, intense. 

                                 TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
                        She told us- I know there are a lot 
                        of people out there who think I’m a 
                        has been. I have a lot to prove.

                        And will she do - a triple axel?

           Tonya begins to skate to the music from Jurassic Park.

           INT. WESTERN UNION - NIGHT

           A CLERK watches Tonya skate on a small TV as Jeff sends a 
           money order. Jeff is extremely overly casual.

                                 JEFF
                        Make it to Derrick Smith & Shane 
                        Stant.

           On the TV, Tonya SOARS HIGH and lands a triple Lutz.

                        Huge! 

           INT. SPORTS BAR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Lavona has stopped waiting tables as Tonya can be seen 
           skating on the various TV sets in the bar.

                                 TV COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
                        Now if she is going to do a triple 
                        axel, this is where she does it..!

           Lavona stands stock still amid the chaos of the restaurant, 
           watching Tonya. She hold herself tightly, afraid to breathe.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Miss?.... Miss?

                                 TV COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
                        It looks like it is...

           ON THE TV SETS: Tonya prepares, JUMPS but only does a single. 

                                 TV COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
                        Nope. She elected to pull back on 
                        that one. She only did a single.

           Lavona gives a small, almost imperceptible flinch.

           ON THE TV: Tonya jumps IMPOSSIBLY HIGH into a triple loop.

           CLOSE ON: The muscles in her legs as she goes up, the power 
           of landing on that thin blade and the sound of ice scrapping.

                                 TV COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
                        Double axel, triple toe...
                                 TV COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
                        These are magnificent jumps that 
                        she’s doing. It’s her height and 
                        the speed that are so different 
                        than all the other woman.

                                 MANAGER
                        Lavona -We don’t pay you to-

                                 COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
                        Her final triple...

           Lavona is in the routine with Tonya, focused, alert.

                                 MANAGER
                        Lavona, c’mon!

                                 COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
                        ...Nicely done!!

                                 LAVONA
                        I wanna see her face.

                                 MANAGER
                        I said c’mon!

                                 LAVONA
                        I wanna see her fucking face at the 
                        end!!

           The manager and customers turn to watch the monitor. 

                                 COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
                        For all the skeptics who felt that 
                        Tonya’s peak had passed, I think 
                        she proved she’s still a winner 
                        even without that triple axel. 

                                 COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
                        I think she wanted all along to 
                        prove she could do it without the 
                        triple axel. And it looks like 
                        that’s the case.

           Tonya is triumphant. Elated. The crowd is on their feet.

           Lavona takes it all in, stonefaced. Is she happy? Jealous? 
           Missing out? Proud? Plotting her next move?

           When she turns away from the TV, her mask is already back on. 
           She turns her attention to her customers.

                                 LAVONA
                        What can I get you?
           INT. ICE RINK - NATIONALS - WAITING AREA - NIGHT

           Tonya sits between her choreographer & Diane. When the scores 
           come in, all 5.8 And 5.9, Diane screams. Tonya covers her 
           mouth, fist pumps a few times and hugs her both ladies.

                                 COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
                        This is a great moment for Tonya. 
                        She’s had everything go wrong. 
                        She’s let everything go wrong. And 
                        now all of a sudden to pull this 
                        off and become our National 
                        Champion is... terrific.

           When her score for composition and style come in, Tonya 
           realizes she has won. She bursts into tears.

                                 COMMENTATOR 2 (V.O.)
                        She said all along, she knows what 
                        she is capable of. And she wants 
                        the world to know exactly what 
                        she’s capable of.

           Tonya is triumphant. 

           Nancy Kerrigan watches from the stands.

           The FLASH! FLASH! FLASH of photographer’s cameras.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

           Photographers take pictures as Jeff and Tonya walk through 
           the lobby of their hotel. Tonya is elated.

                        Okay, fellas. That’s enough.

                        Thank you!

           They sit down on a couch, off on their own.

                                 JEFF
                        We have to get our story straight.

                                 TONYA
                        You do the talking. You’re my

                        Okay. Cause we have to be real 
                        careful about what we say.

                                 TONYA
                        Right? We can’t afford to make a

                        Tonya I wanna be a skater like you.

                                 TONYA
                        Thanks. Hope you mean it!

           She signs an autograph and the girl moves on.

                                 JEFF
                        We play it cool. After all, we both 
                        have alibis.

                                 TONYA
                        Alibis?... For Campbell’s soup?

                                 JEFF
                        Campbell’s Soup? What are you 
                        talking about?

                                 TONYA
                        My endorsement deals! Isn’t that 
                        what you’re talking about?

                                 VOICE
                        Excuse us.

           Jeff and Tonya turn. 2 men is suits stand before them.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        We’re with the FBI. Could we have a 
                        word?

           Jeff and Tonya stare.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Tonya and Jeff sit around a table with FBI men. 

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        It’s just a formality. We’re 
                        talking to everyone. 
                                 TONYA
                        We don’t know anything.

                                 FBI AGENT 2
                        That must make life difficult. 

           He laughs at his joke, alone. Then:

                                 FBI AGENT 2 (CONT'D)
                        Maybe you heard something or saw-

                                 TONYA
                        I was asleep. And Jeff wasn’t here.

                                 JEFF
                        I wasn’t even here!

           They turn to Jeff.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I was asleep too. In Oregon. At 
                        home. In Portland. Which is where I 
                        live. Which is in Oregon. 

           He takes a deep breath. Instead of exhaling, he holds it.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        I see. What do you make of all 
                        this, Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        Well. You never know about these 
                        things. It’s a scary prospect what 
                        this world is coming to.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        So you don’t know anything about 
                        what happened.

                                 JEFF
                        No. No, I don’t.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        How long are you in Detroit?

                                 JEFF
                        We’re heading to the airport now.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        Well, why don’t we give you a ride? 
                        We’ll make sure you get there okay.

              TONYA
                               JEFF
           Thank you. That is so-
                        Oh, that’s not-
                                 FBI AGENT 1 (CONT’D)
                        Okay. We can all ride together.

                                 FBI AGENT 2
                        But first. Who’s Derrick?

           Jeff looks like he just pooped his pants and doesn’t want 
           anyone to know it.

                                 TONYA
                        I don’t know any Derrick.

                                 JEFF
                        I know lots of Derricks. 

           They all turn to Jeff.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna miss our plane.

           The FLASH of cameras going off.

           INT. PORTLAND AIRPORT - NIGHT.

           FLASH! Tonya, teary-eyed, carrying a stuffed bear is mobbed 
           by friends, reporters & camera crews.

           Jeff lags behind. Shawn, trench coat & tie, plays bodyguard.

                                 REPORTER
                        How does it feel to have won?

                                 TONYA
                        I’m really happy! But it won’t be a 
                        true crown until I get my chance 
                        with Nancy. And that’ll be 
                        Olympics. And let me tell you - I’m 
                        gonna whip her butt.

           She laughs. None of the reporters do.

                                 REPORTER
                        What about reports that you talked 
                        to the FBI?

                                 TONYA
                        I mean, they talked to everybody. 
                        And they, they’re doing, um - let’s 
                        see - a thorough investigation to 
                        try to find the man who did it. 

           She walks on with the reporters followed by Shawn and Jeff.
           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Shawn and Tonya are elated. Jeff, not so.

                                 TONYA AND SHAWN
                        Whooo!!!!!!

                                 TONYA 
                        I won Nationals! Again!

                                 SHAWN
                        They were all taking my pictures! 

                                 TONYA
                        I get to go to the Olympics!

                                 SHAWN
                        I’m gonna rake in the money! 

                                 TONYA
                        I’m gonna get the gold medal!

                                 SHAWN
                        I changed the course of history! 
                        Say something, man.

                                 JEFF
                        This is a cluster-fuck!!!!!

                                 TONYA AND SHAWN
                        Whooo!!!!!!

                                 JEFF
                        I mean it! It’s not funny. We have 
                        to fix this!

                                 TONYA
                        Fix what? We talked to the FBI. No 
                        one arrested us. Everything’s fine.

                                 SHAWN
                        She’s right man. We outsmarted em. 
                        My guys are paid & back in Arizona-

                                 JEFF
                        AAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!!!!!

                                 TONYA
                        What is the problem?

                                 JEFF
                        You want to tell me what happened, 
                        Shawn?? Who did you talk to?
                                 SHAWN
                        Nobody!

                                 JEFF
                        If you tell me now, maybe I can fix 
                        it. But if you don’t tell me, we’re 
                        gonna be all fucked.

                                 SHAWN
                        I didn’t talk to anyone. You know I-

                                 JEFF
                        Somebody knows something and they 
                        shouldn’t know anything. 

                                 SHAWN
                        I never said anything! 

                                 JEFF
                        How did they come up with the name 
                        Derrick, Shawn??

                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t know? How can you even ask 
                        me that? I could withstand torture 
                        and never talk. They could never 
                        break me!

                                 JEFF
                        Shawn-

                                 SHAWN
                        They could never, ever break me. 
                        The one thing you don’t have to 
                        worry about is that I would ever 
                        talk. Seriously, man.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           A TITLE CARD reads: 24 HOURS EARLIER.

           Shawn sits at the bar, bragging to a group of people.

                                 SHAWN
                        That whole Nancy Kerrigan thing? 
                        That was us! That’s my team! We got 
                        $65,000 to take her down!

           INT. PARALEGAL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Shawn brags to a fellow student.
                                 SHAWN
                        ...Then my team obtained press 
                        credentials by beating up a 
                        reporter and used it to get inside 
                        the rink, where they take out 
                        another guard by wrapping him in 
                        duct tape. 

           INT. RESTUARANT - DAY

           Shawn brags to an old woman at a lunch counter.

                                 SHAWN
                        BAM! My hit man whacks Nancy 
                        Kerrigan with a retractable baton 3 
                        times in the knee and again on the 
                        head. BAM! Then he shouts, “I spent 
                        29 hours on a bus for you, bitch!” 
                        YEAH!

           EXT. SHAWN’S (PARENTS) HOUSE - NIGHT

           A TITLE CARD reads: 48 HOURS AFTER THAT.

           A group of suited FBI men knock of Shawn’s front door. 

           When Shawn opens it, he falls to his knees, letting out a 
           glottal sound somewhere between a laugh, scream and cry.

           Shawn sits on the couch surrounded by agents in suits.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        What can you tell us about Tonya 
                        Harding?

                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t know Tony Harding.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        Aren’t you her bodyguard?

                                 SHAWN
                        ...Let me finish... Well. I don’t 
                        know her well.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        How about Nancy Kerrigan?
                                 SHAWN
                        Who?

                                 FBI AGENT 2
                        You haven’t heard of Nancy 
                        Kerrigan?

                                 SHAWN
                        Oh. I thought you said Nancy 
                        Herring.

           Shawn wipes his brow.

                                 FBI AGENT 2
                        Shawn-

                                 SHAWN
                        Jeff did it!!

           INT. JEFF AND TONYA’S KITCHEN/CBS NEWS STATION - DAY

           Jeff answers the ringing phone in the kitchen. Ann Schatz 
           talks on her phone at CBS News.

                                 ANN SCHATZ
                        Jeff, Ann Schatz, CBS sports. I’ve 
                        got this letter and I’d like to 
                        show it to you in exchange for an 
                        interview with Tonya.

                                 JEFF
                        What kinda letter, Ann?

                                 ANN SCHATZ
                        Um. It’s the most bizarre- It says 
                        Tonya Harding #1. Jeff Gillooly #2. 
                        Shawn Eckhardt #3. Nancy Kerrigan 
                        #4-

                                 JEFF
                        Okay. 

                                 ANN SCHATZ
                        Then- #1 and #2 hire #3 to hit #4 
                        in the knee with a bat. Then-

                                 JEFF
                        Hold on. Who is this letter from?

                                 ANN SCHATZ
                        It was mailed from someone who

                        her about this.

           INT. JEFF AND TONYA’S KITCHEN/CBS NEWS STATION - DAY

           Jeff lowers the phone a moment before responding.

                                 JEFF
                        Sure Ann. We’ll be happy to come 
                        down for an interview and clear 
                        this up.

           Jeff hangs up and the second he does the phone rings.

                                 SHAWN
                        You gotta pay me the money you owe 
                        me and I gotta get outta town. They 
                        know something.

                                 JEFF
                        What? Why do you-

                                 SHAWN
                        We gotta meet or-

                                 JEFF
                        Shawn, calm down. Where do you want 
                        to meet?

                                 SHAWN
                        Elmer’s Pancake House. Meet me at 
                        the stroke of midnight.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m not meeting at the fucking 
                        stroke of-

                                 SHAWN
                        That’s the plan, man. And bring the 
                        money!

           Shawn hangs up. Jeff slams down the phone in frustration.
           EXT. ELMER’S PANCAKE HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           As Jeff heads in, he can’t help but notice A DOZEN IDENTICAL 
           BLACK SEDANS parked in the lot. Something’s clearly up.

           INT. ELMER’S PANCAKE HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           Shawn wipes sweat from his face and the back of his neck. 
           When he spots Jeff approaching, his several chins tremble.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s going on, Shawn?

                                 SHAWN
                        Nothing... Why don’t you sit down, 
                        Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        You wanna go to that bar on-

                                 SHAWN
                        No, no, no. This is good. Sit down.

           Jeff sighs. He stares at Shawn hard as he sits.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s up, man? You okay? You’re 
                        sweating an awful lot even for you.

                                 SHAWN
                        No I’m not okay! You know I’m not 
                        okay... They know.

                                 JEFF
                        Who?

                                 SHAWN
                        You know.

                                 JEFF
                        No.

                                 SHAWN
                        What we talked about on the phone.

                                 JEFF
                        You asked me to pay you for your 
                        body guard services. I got your 
                        money, Shawn. I wouldn’t do you 
                        wrong. You’re like my brother.

           The sweat is now pouring off Shawn. He moans.
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        You want me to call a doctor or-?

                                 SHAWN
                        The FBI! They know something’s up.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s up?

                                 SHAWN
                        You know.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t.

                                 SHAWN
                        You do.

                                 JEFF
                        Uh, uh.

                                 SHAWN
                        Uh huh.

           Shawn mimes whacked Nancy crying out ‘Why?!?’

                                 JEFF
                        Whoa!!

                                 SHAWN
                        Yes!

                                 JEFF
                        Oh!

                                 SHAWN
                        I know! 

                                 JEFF
                        Let me get this straight- 

                                 SHAWN
                        Yeah.

                                 JEFF
                        Shawn. Are you trying to tell me 
                        you had something to do with this 
                        whole Nancy Kerrigan thing?

                                 SHAWN
                        What the fuck, Jeff?! Of course I-
                                 JEFF
                        Don’t- say another word or I’ll be 
                        forced to go to the authorities.

           And Shawn realizes Jeff knows he’s wearing a wire. Jeff leans 
           in close to Shawn. KISSING CLOSE. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had love in my heart for you 
                        only I can’t help you with this. 
                        I’m gonna talk to my attorney for 
                        you, Buddy. But you made your bed. 
                        Now die in it.

           Jeff walks out. Shawn looks outside nervously to the G-men.

           INT. DIANE AND BOB RAWLINSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tonya and Jeff wait for Bob Rawlinson, Tonya’s lawyer.

                                 TONYA
                        Why don’t we turn his ugly, fat ass 
                        in? Big, dumb, fucking, tub a guts. 

                                 JEFF
                        Cause it’s only his word against 
                        ours. We need some insurance so-

                                 TONYA
                        I’m gonna lose everything! I worked 
                        my whole life for this and he-

                                 JEFF
                        If it ever came down to that, I’d 
                        tell them you didn’t have anything 
                        to do with it. But right now we 
                        gotta get our story straight. Since 
                        they can’t pin anything on us, we 
                        didn’t know anything.

                                 TONYA
                        We didn’t know anything.

           Bob Rawlinson, lawyerly handsome, joins them, looking grim.

                                 BOB
                        Look. They arrested Shawn and he’s 
                        saying it was all your idea, Jeff. 

              TONYA
                               JEFF
           We didn’t know anything!
                        We didn’t know anything!
                                 TONYA
                        We didn’t know about the attack. It 
                        was supposed to be- 

           Jeff squeezes her arm hard. She screams, turns to him.

                                 JEFF
                        We gotta go. From now on it’s gonna 
                        be a shit show for us out there.

           He yanks her quickly out the door.

           INT. JEFF’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           The second Jeff gets in the truck, he turns and PUNCHES TONYA 
           FULL ON IN THE FACE.

           CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY TONYA.

                                 TONYA
                        He fuckin’ nails me. BAM. Freakin’ 
                        hits me right in the face. Sayin’ 
                        I’m such a stupid C-word. What part 
                        of keep my mouth shut’s unclear? 

           INT. JEFF’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Jeff, furious, screeches onto the road and drives off. Tonya, 
           humiliated, studies him in the dark.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        And that’s when I started thinking, 
                        okay maybe there’s more to this. 
                        Maybe there’s more to what he said 
                        the story was. Just because of who 
                        he is. And how he is. That’s when 
                        it finally hit me he was guilty. 

           INT. COURT HOUSE - DAY

           Tonya and her lawyer meet with the FBI.

                                 TONYA (V.O.)
                        He knew skating was my life. How 
                        could he do that and say he loved 
                        me? No. I left for good. I finally 
                        got away from him which is what I 
                        was trying to do all along.

                        To this day he has never admitted 
                        to me, which I wouldn’t care 
                        anyways, but he’s never admitted to 
                        me that he actually did it. That he 
                        planned it and had it done. 

           INT. TONYA’S DAD’S APARTMENT/JEFF’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tonya answers the phone. Jeff is on the other line.

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t believe it. You gave me up.

                                 TONYA
                        I didn’t!

                        The FBI showed me your transcript.

                                 TONYA
                        That’s cheating!

                                 JEFF
                        I told you they couldn’t prove 
                        anything. 

                                 TONYA
                        I tried saying what you wanted me 
                        to say but they saw through it. I- 
                        Oh, Jeff... I think- You really 
                        need to just kill yourself.

                        I though being famous would be fun. 
                        I was loved for a minute. Then I 
                        was hated. Then I was a big joke. 
                        It was like being abused all 
                        fucking over again. But this time 
                        it was by all of you. You’re all my 
                        attackers. You bought what Jeff was 
                        selling and I was the punch line. I 
                        stopped watching TV entirely. Cause 
                        the shit show had really begun.

                        Some people on the other side are 
                        saying that you’re the mastermind. 
                        That this was your idea. Your way

                        was megalomaniacal was you. And

           I.U.P.G. (Innocent Until Proven Guilty) buttons as fast as 
           she can bring them out.

           Mall employees hand out Xeroxed copies of Tonya’s autograph.

           Fans hold up homemade signs reading, “Portland is Proud of 
           Tonya!” “We Love Tonya! Deal With It America!” 

           Languages from all over the world shout questions at Tonya. 
           As she walks through the chaos, she smiles and waves.

           Tonya throws up her hands then throws her leg up ONTO their 
           table pointing to her laces. The judges examine it as the 
           music continues. Her face resembles the classic Tragedy Mask.

           He’s led off. The sound of a judge BANGING a gavel.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY  

           Tonya and her lawyer stand before a judge as he pronounces 
           sentencing. Her face is blank. She looks down at her feet.

                                 JUDGE LONDER
                        3 years probation, a $100,000 fine 
                        plus $10,000 to reimburse the

                        Another $50,000 to set up a fund 
                        for the Special Olympics. 500 hours 
                        community service; a psychological 
                        evaluation- 

           He stops. Tonya looks up.

                                 JUDGE LONDER (CONT’D)
                        -and your immediate resignation 
                        from the US Figure Skating

           Tonya face is blank.

           She flinches. This was a surprise to her.
                                 TONYA
                        All I did was hindering 
                        prosecution. You’re not gonna ever 
                        let me skate again? I’d rather do 
                        jail time. They only got 18 months.

           The judge stares. 

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)
                        Your honor. I’m not educated. All I 
                        know is skating. I’m no one without 
                        it. I’m not this monster. I’m just 
                        trying to understand life like 
                        everybody else. This is like a life 
                        sentence. I don’t even remember 
                        before skating. Please! Give me the 
                        jail time so I can still skate! 

           Her lawyer nudges her, motions for her to take the deal. 
           Tonya stares ahead.

           Shane Stant was released from prison in July 1995 with his

           2007, “Shawn Eckhardt died a long time ago. There is no other 
           person than Brian Griffith.”

           Jeff Gillooly was released from prison in 1995 and changed 
           his name to Jeff Stone (over the strenuous objections of Jeff 
           Stones across the country). He is currently happily married 
           to his third wife. He has 2 kids and works as a mechanic and 
           used car salesman.

           During Jeff’s second marriage, his wife filed a restraining 
           order against him. He was also arrested for assault.

           Tonya Harding was stripped of both of her National titles. 
           Her dream of starring in Ice Capades is as yet unrealized. 
           She does professional landscaping, deck building and house 
           painting. Until recently she was a commentator on World’s 
           Dumbest. 

           She lives in Oregon, in very close proximity to Jeff Gillooly 
           but they have no contact. She says being a mother changed 
           everything for her and wants everyone to know she is a good 
           mother. Just like her dad.
