           INT. PIG ‘N WHISTLE - NIGHT

           TITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 14TH, 1939

           ROBINSON LOWELL (20s), a mousey film industry underling with 
           a nervous disposition, sits in a booth fidgeting with a fork. 
           His eyes dart around; clearly, he’s waiting for someone.

           That someone is FRANKLIN (30s), a picture-perfect Aryan piece 
           of shit: blonde hair, blue eyes, towering/cut physique, etc. 
           He looks like what all men want to be. Including me... sigh.

           Franklin enters and makes eye contact with Robinson. Franklin 
           walks over, sits across from Robinson, and says nothing.

                                 ROBINSON
                             (looking at watch, annoyed)
                        I hope whatever studio you're 
                        working for pays overtime.
                             (no response)
                        I'm saying you're late.
                             (no response)
                        Did you bring the thing or what?

           Franklin pulls a thick envelope out of his jacket pocket and 
           tosses it onto the table. This guy gives zero fucks. He's 
           like Donald Trump, but a fascist. So he's like Donald Trump.

                                 ROBINSON (CONT'D)
                             (quickly grabs envelope)
                        Christ! Are you crazy? You know 
                        what we’re doing here isn’t exactly 
                        on the up-and-up, right?
                             (no response)
                        Whatever, pal.

           Robinson pulls a manila envelope from a satchel and attempts 
           to pass it to Franklin beneath the table. Franklin doesn’t 
           move. Robinson finally gives up and just hands it to him.

                                 ROBINSON (CONT'D)
                        Not making this easy, are you?

           Franklin looks inside the manila envelope, then stands and 
           heads for the exit. As Franklin goes, Robinson looks across 
           the room and notices TWO SUITS (30s) watching them closely.

                                 ROBINSON (CONT'D)
                        Shit.
           Robinson follows after Franklin. On his way to the door he 
           looks back over his shoulder: the suits are following them.

           EXT. PIG ‘N WHISTLE - NIGHT

           Franklin exits and looks around; Robinson exits behind him.

                                 ROBINSON
                        I think we’ve got company.

           Franklin turns around just as the suits exit.

                                 SUIT #1
                             (flashes badge)
                        United Artists security, fellas. 
                        Mind if we--

           Franklin pulls a Luger from his jacket.

           He SHOOTS Robinson in the fucking face. Robinson falls dead.

                                 SUIT #2
                        Holy shit!

           Franklin takes off running; the suits pull out guns and FIRE.

           At the end of the street, a single headlight comes to life: 
           it belongs to an approaching motorcycle/attached sidecar. 
           Franklin jumps in as it passes; the DRIVER (30s) guns it.

                                 SUIT #1
                        Get the car!

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           The motorcycle flees as the suits’ car gives chase.

           INT. THE SUITS’ CAR - NIGHT

           Suit #1 drives as Suit #2 SHOOTS out the window.

           EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           The chase leaves the bright lights of Hollywood and enters 
           the darkness of the rural winding road as it heads west. The 
           motorcycle hugs curves at breakneck speeds, barely missing 
           oncoming traffic as it crosses the dividing line. The suits 
           close in, still SHOOTING out the window as they approach——
           EXT. THE PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           A BULLET rips through the motorcycle driver’s head; he falls 
           off the bike, tipping it over in the process. Sparks fly as 
           it SCRAPES across the road; it comes to a stop in the sand.

           Franklin, still very much alive, stands and runs toward the 
           water. The suits, still SHOOTING, jump out and give chase.

           Franklin DIVES into the ocean and swims like a motherfucker. 
           The suits stop at the water’s edge, CHUCKLING as they reload.

                                 SUIT #2
                        Go get him.

                                 SUIT #1
                        What am I? A creative exec?

           The suits aim and FIRE into the water. Bullets WHIZ past 
           Franklin's body; still, he swims.

                                 SUIT #2
                             (to Franklin, loudly)
                        You can’t win, buddy! Stop already!

           Amazingly, Franklin does just that as he treads water.

                                 SUIT #2 (CONT'D)
                        You gotta be kidding me.

           The suits take aim at Franklin’s head... which is now slowly 
           rising out of the water as if by magic.

                                 SUIT #1
                        Who the fuck is this guy? Houdini?

           Franklin continues to rise out of the water as it’s revealed 
           he’s standing on the deck of a surfacing German U-boat.

           The U-boat’s hatch opens; Franklin starts to climb inside. As 
           the boat dives, Franklin smiles and gives the suits a proud 
           “Sieg Heil!” salute. He SLAMS the hatch shut as the U-boat 
           disappears beneath the water’s surface. After a beat--

                                 SUIT #2
                        So that just fucking happened.

           EXT. THE BAVARIAN ALPS - DAY

           TITLE: OBERSALZBERG, BAVARIA, GERMANY

           A NAZI OFFICER (20s) drives a motorcycle up a winding 
           mountainous road. A satchel is strapped to his back.
           EXT. THE BERGHOF - DAY

           He parks in front of a sprawling estate and pulls the manila 
           envelope from the satchel. He KNOCKS on the front door.

           INT. THE BERGHOF (VARIOUS LOCATIONS) - DAY

           Another OFFICER (30s) answers and takes the envelope. The 
           envelope is then passed from OFFICER to OFFICER as it moves 
           through the building, finally ending up in a large——

           OFFICE

           The room is decorated in ornately carved, dark-wood inlays. A 
           large statue of a bronze eagle is mounted above the door.

           A HIGH-RANKING OFFICER (40s) enters carrying the envelope. He 
           sets it down on a huge wooden desk, then exits.

           A pair of hands pull a paper stack out of the envelope. Typed 
           on its cover sheet: “THE GREAT DICTATOR” BY CHARLIE CHAPLIN

           A fist SLAMS down onto the stack; the wood beneath it CRACKS. 
           The fist belongs to ADOLF HITLER (50). (If I need to explain 
           who Hitler is you probably shouldn’t be reading this script.)

                                 HITLER
                        NEIN!!!

           EXT. GUIDO’S FINE ITALIAN DINING - NIGHT

           TITLE: WASHINGTON, D.C.

           RAIN pours down on a hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurant.

                                 GUIDO (O.S.)
                        Lemme tell you what I know, fellas--

           INT. GUIDO’S FINE ITALIAN DINING (PRIVATE BACK ROOM) - NIGHT

           Crime boss GUIDO ROCOCO (50s) —— a greasy chub of a gangster 
           who looks like he sweats mayonnaise —— walks around a table 
           of his fellow GANGSTER UNDERBOSSES while they eat dinner.

                                 GUIDO
                        --we got us a rat at the table.
           Guido walks toward VINCENZO (30s), a beaky, rail-thin fella.

                                 GUIDO (CONT'D)
                        Isn’t that right, Vinnie?

                                 VINCENZO
                        How would I know, boss?

           Guido moves behind Vincenzo and rests a hand on his shoulder.

                                 GUIDO
                        Oh, you’d know, Vinnie. You’d know.

           Guido presses a gun barrel into the back of Vincenzo’s skull 
           and COCKS the hammer when, suddenly, the door behind him is 
           KICKED in. A team of FBI AGENTS enters with their guns drawn.

           They’re led by MADISON PACKARD (25), a handsome, pompous 
           asshole in a ridiculously expensive suit who takes both his 
           job and his life way too fucking seriously.

                                 MADISON
                        Hands in the air, assholes!
                             (presses gun barrel to the 
                              back of Guido's skull)
                        Drop it or lose your brains, Guido.

           Guido DROPS his gun. Across the table, a gangster named PETRY 
           (30s) slowly moves his hand toward his jacket pocket.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        Guido Rococo, you--

           Petry pulls something out of his pocket. In one quick motion, 
           Madison grabs Guido by the back of the head and SLAMS his 
           face down onto the table, instantly SHATTERING his nose.

           Simultaneously, Madison SHOOTS across the table, striking 
           Petry in the shoulder. Madison hasn’t missed a fucking beat.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                             (continuing)
                        --are under arrest.

           Petry SCREAMS and writhes in his chair as it’s revealed——

                                 PETRY
                        You shot me, Madison!

           ——he’s actually an undercover agent working with Madison.

                                 MADISON
                        You were going for something!
                                 PETRY
                             (flashes badge)
                        My badge!

                                 MADISON
                        What am I, Petry, a mind-reader?

                                 PETRY
                             (overly dramatic)
                        Well, this is it! I'm entering a 
                        tunnel of light! Abraham Lincoln is 
                        waving me in!

                                 MADISON
                             (to Guido, re: Petry)
                        By the way... there’s your rat.

                                 PETRY
                        Do me a favor, Madison, would you? 
                        Say goodbye to my wife and kids.

                                 MADISON
                        Yeah, whatever.

           Madison is the best agent the Bureau has; everyone knows it, 
           including him. Because of this, he’s no fun to work with. Or 
           talk to. Or be around. Or anything.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                             (to agents)
                        I'll let you boys take it from 
                        here.

           Madison winks at his fellow agents and exits.

                                 FBI AGENT
                             (to agents, re: Madison)
                        What a fucking dickhead.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS (HALLWAY) - DAY

           TITLE: THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

           United States Secretary of War, HAROLD STRANGE (50s), marches 
           down a long hallway with a thick binder under his arm.

           He approaches a door. Its nameplate reads: J. EDGAR HOOVER, 
           DIRECTOR, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION. He enters a——
           WAITING ROOM

           ——where a buttoned-up shrew of a SECRETARY (50s) sits PECKING 
           at a typewriter, one finger at a time. He walks past her.

                                 SECRETARY
                        He prefers people to knock first.

           Harold SCOFFS, opens the door without knocking, and enters——

           J. EDGAR HOOVER’S OFFICE

           J. EDGAR HOOVER (44), FBI Director and brassiere aficionado, 
           sits at his desk flipping through a Sears Christmas catalog; 
           the women’s undergarments section, to be exact.

           Hoover quickly/nervously closes the catalog and stands.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        I prefer people to--

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        Knock first, I know. But trust me, 
                        Edgar, you’ve got bigger things to 
                        worry about than having me walk in 
                        on you trying on a girdle.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                             (adjusts under his suit)
                        I have no idea what you’re 
                        insinuating, Mr. Secretary.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        Sure.
                             (tosses binder onto desk)
                        Last week, a German U-boat surfaced 
                        off the coast of Los Angeles.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Christ. What was it doing there?

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        Providing an escape for a Nazi spy 
                        who was smuggling out intelligence. 
                        Specifically, the manuscript of an 
                        upcoming motion picture titled The 
                        Great Dictator. It's a parody film 
                        that pokes fun at Hitler and the 
                        Third Reich. It's currently being 
                        made by Charlie Chaplin.
                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                             (flipping through binder)
                        Chaplin is still alive?

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        Apparently. But he may not be for 
                        long if Hitler has his way.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Wait, let me get this straight: 
                        Hitler’s upset over a picture that 
                        hasn’t been made yet, so he’s 
                        sending Nazis to L.A. to kidnap 
                        Chaplin and halt its production.
                             (Strange nods)
                        That’s the stupidest fucking thing 
                        I’ve ever heard.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        Agreed. But when a U-boat pulls up 
                        to Santa Monica Pier we should 
                        probably do something about it. 
                        Unless you want to be the person to 
                        explain to Roosevelt why we didn't.

                        Crippled cocksucker. Okay, fine. 
                        I’ll send Packard to Los Angeles 
                        first thing in the morning.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        It’s only Charlie Chaplin, Edgar. 
                        No need to send your best guy.

                        Eh, he just shot a fellow agent.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        Another one?

           Hoover SIGHS as he SLAMS the binder shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. UNION STATION (PLATFORM) - DAY

           A severe-looking, sharply-dressed COUPLE exit a train.

           The man is ULRICH LUTZ (30s), a towering, brick-shithouse 
           pacifist who uses violence only as a last resort.
           His partner is SUKA HÜNDIN (20s), a beautiful/brutal woman 
           who uses violence as an only resort.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE (V.O.)
                        Intel suggests Nazis may have 
                        already arrived in Los Angeles.

           EXT. UNION STATION - DAY

           Ulrich and Suka wait curbside.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE (V.O.)
                        We don’t know how many there are, 
                        or who they may be working with.

           A black car pulls up. An UNSEEN PERSON in the backseat opens 
           the back door; Ulrich and Suka get in. The car pulls off.

           EXT. CHARLIE CHAPLIN STUDIOS - DAY

           Ulrich and Suka sit in a parked car as a MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE 
           CHAPLIN (40s) walks past. They follow him with their eyes.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE (V.O.)
                        What we do know is that these Nazis 
                        were handpicked by Hitler himself--

           The man enters a building. Ulrich and Suka exit the car.

           INT. CHARLIE CHAPLIN STUDIOS (CHAPLIN’S OFFICE) - DAY

           The man picks a bowler hat off a rack and puts it on.

           He opens an old cigar box sitting on a desk; inside are 
           sheets of fake toothbrush mustaches. He peels one off, sticks 
           it under his nose, and wiggles his top lip as he tests it.

           Behind him, Ulrich and Suka quietly open the door and enter. 
           A gold plate on the door reads: CHARLIE CHAPLIN

                                 HAROLD STRANGE (V.O.)
                        --which means they’re the best.

           From Ulrich and Suka’s vantage point, they see the silhouette 
           of Chaplin’s most famous character: THE TRAMP.

           Ulrich throws a sack over the man’s head as Suka HITS him 
           with a billy club. Ulrich catches his body as it falls, 
           tosses him over his shoulders, and carries him out.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS (J. EDGAR HOOVER’S OFFICE) - DAY

           Madison, who is clearly unimpressed, sits across from Hoover.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        And that's why you're going to L.A.

                                 MADISON
                        But I don’t want to go to L.A.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        The requirements of your job aren’t 
                        based on wants, Packard.

                                 MADISON
                        This sounds like a bad joke. Why 
                        would Hitler care about a stupid 
                        picture? Also, Chaplin’s alive?

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        That’s what I said! We’re so alike.

           Hoover awkwardly stares at Madison, fawning over him.

                                 MADISON
                        Sir?

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                             (snapping out of it)
                        Here’s the deal: Chaplin is still 
                        alive, and you’re going to L.A. to 
                        keep him that way.
                             (remembering)
                        Oh!

           Hoover SCRIBBLES something on paper; he hands it to Madison.

                                 MADISON
                        What’s this?

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        The address of a fabulous little 
                        sausage stand in Hollywood. It's to 
                        die for. Get the Antonio. That’s 
                        what I eat when I'm in L.A.
                             (Madison lowers his head)
                        Oh, Packard. You act as if I were 
                        sending you to Siberia. It’s 
                        Hollywood, for Christ's sake. The 
                        land of beautiful people and golden 
                        opportunities. Go. Have fun.

           INT. PUBLIC SCHOOL 63 (COMMUNITY CENTER ROOM) - NIGHT

           TITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA

           FIVE MEN sit in a circle facing each other. This is a weekly 
           meeting of the COPS WITH AGGRESSION ISSUES SUPPORT GROUP.

           Three of the men are LAPD cops: KENLEY (33), ERIK (37), and 
           HUNTER (28). They are being led by KEVIN (47), a bald, hard-
           edged, retired cop who knows their pain all too well.

           The odd man out is DENNISON (35), a kind, caring, and maybe 
           somewhere-on-the-spectrum nice guy... who also is a cop.

                                 KEVIN
                        Dennison, since this is your first 
                        time attending our Cops With 
                        Aggression Issues Support Group, 
                        I'd like you to start tonight.

                                 DENNISON
                        Sure. Well, I realized I had a 
                        problem when I came upon a guy who 
                        was trying to break into my car.

                                 HUNTER
                        And then you stabbed him.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hunter, please. This is a Dennison 
                        story, not a Hunter story. Okay?
                             (Hunter nods)
                        Please, Dennison... continue.

                                 DENNISON
                        So I flashed my badge, and then--

                                 HUNTER
                        You stabbed him.

                                 KEVIN
                             (warning)
                        Hunter....

           Unsure of what's going on, Dennison hesitates a beat. Then--

                                 KEVIN (CONT'D)
                        You were saying, Dennison?

                                 DENNISON
                        So this guy starts telling me how 
                        his mom is sick, and how he needs 
                        money to get back home to Milwaukee 
                        before she dies. So I--
                                 HUNTER
                        Stab him.

                                 ERIK
                        Hunter, if you don't let this guy 
                        finish his goddamn story, I'm gonna 
                        break your pinky fingers again.

                                 KEVIN
                        Erik, it's fine to use terse words, 
                        just not curse words.

                                 KENLEY
                        Fucking right.

                                 KEVIN
                        Kenley!
                             (to Dennison)
                        I apologize. So a man tried to 
                        break into your car, and then asked 
                        you for money. What happened next?

                                 DENNISON
                        I gave him a buck and let him go.

           A long beat of silence passes. Then--

                                 KENLEY
                        You're a fucking pussy.

                                 DENNISON
                        Am I in the right place? This is 
                        the group for cops dealing with 
                        aggression issues, right?

                                 HUNTER
                        So... you stabbed the guy, right?

                                 DENNISON
                             (ignoring)
                        I ask because you're all already so 
                        aggressive. Why are you here?

                                 KEVIN
                             (realizing)
                        Wait... are you here to learn how 
                        to become more aggressive?

                                 DENNISON
                        Yes! Isn’t that what this is?

                                 KEVIN
                        Dennison, you may say you’re a cop, 
                        but you sound like a fucking nurse.
           Kevin HIGH-FIVES the other guys around the circle; this ramps 
           up their aggression, which they then unload on Dennison.

           For some reason, Dennison appears to revel in their vitriol.

                                 ERIK
                        I’m gonna come over there and punch 
                        you in your nurse pussy.

                                 DENNISON
                        Yes! Give me more!

                                 HUNTER
                        And then I'm gonna stab you!

                                 DENNISON
                        See? This is what I needed!

                                 KENLEY
                        I once choked a fucking penguin!

           The room falls silent, like a needle scratching a record.

                                 DENNISON
                        Oh, wow. Okay, that’s intense.

           A fired-up Dennison stands and eagerly pumps his arms, as if 
           he were absorbing the aggression in the room by osmosis.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Thanks. You guys are the best.
                             (opens door to leave)
                        I mean, you jerks are the best.

           Dennison winks at them and exits.

                                 KEVIN
                        He really fucking sucks at this.

                                 ERIK
                             (glances over)
                        Is that his gun?

           They look over and, sure enough, sitting on the floor is 
           Dennison’s department-issued handgun. Dennison reenters.

                                 DENNISON
                             (goes for gun)
                        Sorry, I forgot my--

           Erik grabs Dennison’s gun and shoves it down his pants.

                                 ERIK
                        Pussies don’t get guns.
                                 DENNISON
                        But I--

           Erik pulls the gun out of his pants, COCKS it, and then 
           shoves it back down his fucking pants.

                                 ERIK
                        You want it? Go get it.

                                 DENNISON
                        I... can't I... just....

           Dennison leaves.

                                 ERIK
                        I’m rock hard right now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Dennison now sits like a reprimanded child in a principal’s 
           office. Standing behind the desk across from him is CAPTAIN 
           RONALD BASKETTI (50s), Dennison’s annoyed/frustrated boss.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        You’re a cop, Dennison. You know 
                        that, right? Because most cops know 
                        not to lose their guns.

                                 DENNISON
                        I didn’t lose my gun, Ron. Those 
                        angry guys took it and then shoved 
                        it down their pants.
                             (quietly)
                        I did lose my other guns though.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        Don’t push me, Dennison. And don’t 
                        call me Ron. We’re not friends. I’m 
                        your captain.

                                 DENNISON
                        Yes, Captain Ron.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        Dennison, do you know how many of 
                        your department-issued guns are on 
                        the street? Go ahead, take a guess.

                                 DENNISON
                        I don’t know, maybe--
           Basketti SLAMS a thick binder down on his desk.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        Seven!
                             (opens binder, reads)
                        Detective Dennison lost his gun at 
                        the Fourth of July parade. 
                        Detective Dennison lost his gun on 
                        the Griffith Park Merry-Go-Round. 
                        Detective Dennison lost his gun in 
                        the men’s restroom at Grauman’s.
                             (closes binder)
                        I don’t even have another gun to 
                        give you. You’ve literally lost all 
                        of our extras.

                                 DENNISON
                        You’re gonna fire me, aren’t you?

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        You’re not fired, but you’re off 
                        active duty. For now, you’re my 
                        bitch, and that means being 
                        assigned to bitch duty.
                             (Dennison chuckles)
                        What’s funny?

                                 DENNISON
                        You said “duty.”

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. UNION AIR TERMINAL - DAY

           TRAVELERS hurriedly rush in and out of the airport terminal.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI (V.O.)
                        The feds have an agent coming into 
                        town on special assignment. You’re 
                        going to pick him up and drive him 
                        around, give him a lay of the land.

           Madison exits to find Dennison standing next to a De Luxe 
           Ford. He’s holding a sign: FBI AGENT MADISON PACKARD

                                 MADISON
                             (flashes badge)
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard.

                                 DENNISON
                             (puts hand out for shake)
                        Nice to meet--
           Madison hands Dennison his suitcase, then gets in the car. 
           Dennison puts the suitcase in the backseat, then gets in.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           After a long, awkward beat of silence——

                                 DENNISON
                        Wanna know my name?
                             (Madison shakes his head)
                        Alright.

           Dennison STARTS the car and pulls off.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES (VARIOUS LOCATIONS) - DAY

           Dennison drives while Madison takes in L.A.: palm trees; 
           convertibles; tourists, etc. Madison hates all of it.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison pulls up to Chaplin Studios.

                                 DENNISON
                        Here we are: Chaplin Studios.

           Madison exits without saying a word.

           EXT. CHARLIE CHAPLIN STUDIOS - DAY

           Madison walks toward the entrance. Dennison exits the car.

                                 DENNISON
                        I’m new to this, so I don’t know if 
                        I’m supposed to follow you, or--

           A STUDIO EMPLOYEE (20s) exits out of the gate.

                                 MADISON
                             (flashes badge)
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard. Where 
                        might I find Mr. Charles Chaplin?

           The employee points across the street to——
           INT. THE RED LIGHT (FRONT ROOM) - DAY

           The Red Light is a notorious brothel. Its walls (and windows) 
           are covered in red fabric. The only light in the room comes 
           from a lamp on a desk; its lamp shade is, obviously, red.

           MARLA (20s), wearing a bustier, panties, and garter belts, 
           lies on a couch filing her nails. Dennison and Madison enter.

                                 DENNISON
                        Hey, Marla.

           Madison throws Dennison a look: “You know this fucking girl?”

                                 MARLA
                        Hey, Dennison. Who’s your friend?

                                 MADISON
                             (flashes badge)
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard. Where is 
                        Mr. Charles Chaplin?

           Marla points down the——

           HALLWAY

           Dennison and Madison walk down a long, door-lined hall; they 
           follow SCREAMS to a door at the end of the hall. They KNOCK.

                                 VICTORIA (O.S.)
                        Come in.

           BEDROOM

           Dennison and Madison enter to find VICTORIA (20s) lying on 
           the bed in a silky robe. She's reading a book. Lying beside 
           her is CHARLIE CHAPLIN (50); he’s drunk as fuck, completely 
           passed out. After a beat, and still asleep, Chaplin SCREAMS.

                                 VICTORIA
                        He gets night terrors when he 
                        drinks. Hey, Dennison.

                                 DENNISON
                        How’s your mother, Victoria?

                                 VICTORIA
                        Feeling much better. She says 
                        thanks for sending the flowers.

                                 DENNISON
                        It's the least I could do.
                                 MADISON
                             (nudges Chaplin)
                        Mr. Charles Chaplin?

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (startled awake)
                        Shirley Temple!
                             (realizing, drunkenly)
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 MADISON
                             (flashes badge)
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard. Sir, I 
                        need you to come with me. I have 
                        reason to believe you're in danger.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Really? I'm in danger. How’s that?

                                 MADISON
                             (glances at Dennison)
                        I’d rather not go into that here.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Listen, buddy, I’m not going 
                        anywhere until you tell me why I 
                        gotta go somewhere to go there.
                             (to Victoria)
                        Did that make sense?

                                 VICTORIA
                        Perfect sense, Charlie.

           Beat, as Madison weighs his options. Then——

                                 MADISON
                             (quickly, quietly)
                        Adolf Hitler is trying to kidnap 
                        you because you’re making a picture 
                        that pokes fun at him.

           Everyone (except Madison) bursts into LAUGHTER.

                                 DENNISON
                        Why would Adolf Hitler care about a 
                        stupid picture?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        It's terrible! Believe me, I should 
                        know. I wrote it.

                                 MADISON
                        Sir, has anything odd happened to 
                        you in the past few days?
           Chaplin closes his eyes and thinks. After a beat, he SNORES.

                                 VICTORIA
                        Charlie!

           Startled awake, Chaplin THROWS UP all over his own chest.

                                 DENNISON
                             (covering nose)
                        Oh, god!

                                 CHAPLIN
                        That one's for you, Hitler.

                                 MADISON
                        Mr. Chaplin, again, anything out of 
                        the ordinary. Anything at all.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        An employee went missing yesterday.

                                 MADISON
                        Went missing? Who went missing?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Bernie. No, no... Benny. My--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The man who looks like Chaplin (AKA Benny) sits beaten and 
           tied to a chair. Ulrich and Suka stand over him.

                                 BENNY
                        --stunt double! I swear, you got 
                        the wrong fella. I’m not Chaplin! 
                        Look! You can peel my mustache off!

           Suka does... and then PUNCHES him in the face. The chair 
           teeters backward, finally CRASHING to the floor.

                                 ULRICH
                             (in German)
                        Hit him as much as you want, Suka, 
                        he still won’t be Chaplin.

           A frustrated Suka gives Ulrich a look of death. Ulrich lifts 
           Benny (and the chair) off the floor only to realize——

                                 ULRICH (CONT'D)
                        Oh, dear. I think he's dead.
           Ulrich makes the Sign of the Cross. Suka rolls her eyes.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. THE RED LIGHT (BEDROOM) - DAY

                                 DENNISON
                        Why kidnap your stunt double?

                                 VICTORIA
                        Actually, good stunts can play a 
                        big role in a picture’s success.

           Madison throws Victoria a look: “How would you know?”

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Hitler thinks he can pull one over 
                        on me? Ha! Good luck, mustache-
                        stealing asshole. I’ll show him--

           Chaplin’s thought is cut off by a violent HICCUP that shakes 
           him out of the bed and onto the floor. He’s out cold.

                                 MADISON
                             (to Dennison)
                        This suit was made by--

           EXT. CHARLIE CHAPLIN STUDIOS - DAY

           Madison and Dennison carry an unconscious Chaplin between 
           them. Dennison is clearly doing the majority of the work 
           while Madison, who doesn’t want barf on his suit, stands at 
           arm’s length, barely holding up Chaplin’s arm by his sleeve.

                                 DENNISON
                        I assumed a suit made by Siamese 
                        prostitutes would be cheaper.

                                 MADISON
                        Like you know anything about suits.

           INT. CHARLIE CHAPLIN STUDIOS (HALLWAY) - DAY

           They carry Chaplin down the hall.

                                 MADISON
                        Besides, you should feel honored to 
                        be doing both the United States and 
                        Mr. Charles Chaplin a favor.
           Chaplin THROWS UP another mouthful of barf, but this time it 
           spews across the front of Dennison’s shirt.

                                 DENNISON
                             (covering nose)
                        That one smells like my grandma’s 
                        creamy potato chowder.

                                 MADISON
                        Your grandmother must be a horrible 
                        fucking cook.

           At the end of the hall, Ulrich (who is now carrying Benny’s 
           corpse over his shoulder) and Suka round a corner, coming 
           face-to-face with Madison, Dennison, and Chaplin.

           Everyone freezes in confusion, as if they were newborns 
           seeing their reflections in a mirror for the first time.

           After a beat, Ulrich and Suka recognize Chaplin; they pull 
           out Lugers and start SHOOTING. Madison and Dennison (and 
           Chaplin’s limp body along with them) dive to the floor.

           Madison pulls out a gun and returns FIRE. Ulrich spins and 
           uses Benny as a shield; bullets riddle his corpse.

                                 DENNISON
                             (tearing up)
                        I hope that guy was already dead.

           Suka peeks out from behind Ulrich (from behind Benny) and 
           FIRES back. Madison RETURNS and hits Ulrich in the thigh. 
           Ulrich SCREAMS, DROPS Benny to the ground, and then KICKS in 
           a door at the end of the hall. Ulrich and Suka dive inside.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        That’s not a bad idea.

           Dennison jumps to his feet and attempts to KICK in a door. It 
           doesn’t budge. He KICKS again. Nothing. Finally, Madison 
           stands and tries the doorknob. It opens with a CLICK.

                                 MADISON
                        You know what doorknobs do, right?

           Back at the end of the hall, Ulrich and Suka SHOOT around the 
           door frame as Madison and Dennison dive into a——

           SUPPLY CLOSET

           ——for cover.
                                 MADISON
                        We’re safe.

           Madison looks into the hall and realizes they’ve forgotten——

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Charles Chaplin!

           Madison returns FIRE around the door frame with one hand, and 
           pulls Chaplin into the closet by his leg with the other.

           HALLWAY

           Ulrich and Suka stand in a doorway with their guns drawn.

                                 ULRICH
                             (in German)
                        You close in from that side. I'll 
                        take the other.

           SUPPLY CLOSET

           Madison and Dennison are as they were.

                                 DENNISON
                             (listening)
                        She's coming down one side of the 
                        hall. He's coming down the other.

                                 MADISON
                        You know German?

                                 DENNISON
                        You don't?

           Chaplin turns his head toward Madison as he BURPS up another 
           mouthful of barf. He holds it in just long enough for Madison 
           to grab Chaplin by the head and turn him toward Dennison. 
           Again, Chaplin BARFS on Dennison. And again, he passes out.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                             (covering nose)
                        Oh, come on!

                                 MADISON
                        You good on ammo?

                                 DENNISON
                        Actually, I don’t have a gun on me.

                                 MADISON
                        Why don’t you have a gun?
                                 DENNISON
                        An angry man put it down his pants.

                                 MADISON
                        I don't even want to know.

           HALLWAY

           From opposite sides, Ulrich and Suka slowly move toward the——

           SUPPLY CLOSET

                                 MADISON
                        Fuck it, I’ll do it myself.
                             (cocks gun)
                        Watch and learn, gumshoe.

           Madison leaps through the doorway and back into the——

           HALLWAY

           ——where he returns FIRE. Ulrich and Suka dive for cover.

           But just when it looks like Madison has gained the upper 
           hand, he slips on Chaplin's barf and FALLS hard to the floor. 
           His gun slides across the floor toward the——

           SUPPLY CLOSET

                                 DENNISON
                        Rat farts!

           HALLWAY

           Dennison grabs the gun, rushes out, and aims at Ulrich and 
           Suka... who are already waiting with their Lugers drawn.

                                 ULRICH
                        Drop it, American.

                                 DENNISON
                             (in German)
                        Okay, Nazis. Let’s try not to do 
                        anything too... Nazi-ish.

           Ulrich and Suka throw each other a look: "He knows German?"
           As Dennison lowers his hands, he accidentally FIRES a bullet 
           into Madison’s shoulder. Madison SCREAMS like a six-year-old 
           with a skinned knee. It’s embarrassing for everyone involved.

                                 MADISON
                        You fucking shot me!

                                 DENNISON
                             (tears welling up)
                        I’m sorry!

                                 MADISON
                        You fucking idiot!

                                 DENNISON
                             (crying)
                        I barely touched the trigger! It 
                        was the gun’s fault!

                                 MADISON
                        Guns don’t just shoot people! 
                        Assholes just shoot people!

           Ulrich and Suka stare in disbelief, as if they just witnessed 
           an alien ship land in the middle of the fucking hallway.

                                 ULRICH
                             (in German)
                        What the fuck is going on?

           Dennison uses the moment of confusion to return FIRE. And by 
           “return fire” I mean “close his eyes and SCREAM like a bitch 
           while he FIRES blindly/haphazardly down the hallway.” 

           Ulrich and Suka flee in retreat.

           Dennison is still SCREAMING as the gun CLICKS empty. His 
           screams fade as he slowly pries his eyes open to find the 
           coast clear. After a beat, he turns to Madison.

                                 DENNISON
                        I am so, so, so--

                                 MADISON
                        Shut the fuck up right now!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LAPD HOLLYWOOD PRECINCT (BASKETTI’S OFFICE) - DAY

           Again, Dennison sits being reprimanded by Basketti. Madison 
           holds bloodied gauze and ice over the hole in his shoulder, 
           while Chaplin stands at a bar cart making himself a martini.
                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        I don’t believe it, Dennison.

                                 DENNISON
                             (to Madison)
                        That’s my name, by the way.

                                 MADISON
                        I still don’t care.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        You don’t even have a gun anymore, 
                        yet you still somehow manage to 
                        shoot your partner.

                          DENNISON
           We’re partners?!?
                                                          MADISON
                                               We’re not partners.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        No, Dennison, you’re not partners. 
                        Because you’re fired.

                                 DENNISON
                        Are you serious, Captain Ron? For 
                        once I’m working a real assignment, 
                        and not picking murdered 
                        prostitutes out of the gutter.

                                 MADISON
                        That happen a lot out here?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        You have no idea.
                             (to Captain Basketti)
                        Olives?

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        Bottom shelf toward the back.
                             (to Dennison)
                        I’m gonna need your badge.

                                 MADISON
                        Justice has been served.

           Dennison goes to hand over his badge when——

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (stirring drink)
                        I want Detective Dennison.
                             (re: Madison)
                        Him and this asshole.

                                 MADISON
                        If you take him you don’t get me.
                                 CHAPLIN
                        You don’t have a say. Hoover 
                        assigned you to me. I’m your job.
                             (to Basketti)
                        Fact is, these idiots saved my 
                        life. And if they did it once, they 
                        can do it again. Probably.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        Mr. Chaplin, I appreciate your--

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Captain Basketti, I donated more to 
                        the Fraternal Order of Police last 
                        year than the combined salaries of 
                        everyone else in this room.

                                 MADISON
                             (under breath)
                        You’d be surprised at what I make.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                             (to Dennison, sighing)
                        I’ll get you another gun.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison smiles as he drives, Madison scowls as he rides 
           shotgun, and Chaplin excitedly sits in the middle of the 
           backseat, like a son bookended by bickering parents.

                                 MADISON
                        This is fucking ludicrous.

                                 DENNISON
                        It’s kind of fun, isn’t it?

                          MADISON
                                                          CHAPLIN
           No.
                                               Yes.

                                 DENNISON
                        So... where to?

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (looks at watch)
                        I have an event at three o’clock--

                                 DENNISON
                        No offense, Charlie, but I was 
                        asking my new partner: FBI Agent 
                        Madison Packard.
           Madison hesitates to reply or admit this is even happening.

                                 MADISON
                             (sighing)
                        The Bureau’s Hollywood Division. At 
                        the very least, I should check in.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Wait... if the FBI already has an 
                        office here why’d Hoover send you?

           Madison throws Chaplin a look: “You’ll see.”

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FBI HOLLYWOOD DIVISION - DAY

           Four FBI agents —— MOSES, LOUIS, JEROME, and SAMUEL (all 20s) 
           —— sit around doing absolutely nothing.

           They’re all dressed like agents (matching suits, ties, shoes, 
           etc.), but they also share one common/obvious factor: they’re 
           drop-dead gorgeous. They’re fucking tens. All four of them.

           And like most perfect specimens who appear as if they were 
           created in a lab, they’re all aspiring actors who are only 
           working the FBI agent gig until they catch their big break.

                                 MOSES
                        So I say to the director, “Ummm, 
                        hello? I’d like to do the scene 
                        with pants on, please.”

                                 JEROME
                        You bitch. I wish my agent got me 
                        those kinds of roles. Or any roles.

                                 LOUIS
                        My agent just got me a role in a 
                        film about the first Thanksgiving. 
                        I play the wife of an Indian chief.

                                 MOSES
                        The wife of an Indian chief? How?

                                 LOUIS
                        Exactly.

           Madison, Packard, and Chaplin enter. The agents look up.

                                 DENNISON
                             (to Madison, re: agents)
                        They all brothers or something?
                                 JEROME
                        Hey, boys. What can we do for you?

                                 MADISON
                             (flashes badge)
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard.
                             (re: Dennison)
                        This guy isn’t important, and this 
                        is Mr. Charles Chaplin.

           Their eyes go wide. This officially just became an audition.

                                 LOUIS
                             (patting chest nervously)
                        Oh my god, it’s Chaplin.

                                 MOSES
                             (quietly)
                        I thought he was dead.

           The agents turn their “good sides” toward Chaplin and smile.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison, Madison, and Chaplin are as they were.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Those guys are about as useful as 
                        shit-covered Charmin.

                                 DENNISON
                        If they’re that bad at their jobs 
                        why does Hoover keep them around?
                             (realizing)
                        Oh.

                                 MADISON
                             (to Chaplin)
                        We need to get you somewhere safe. 
                        Do you have any friends who might 
                        be willing to take you in?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        I don’t really have friends, but I 
                        do have a producer. Roland O’Dix at 
                        Metropolitan Pictures. He’s kind of 
                        like a friend. A shitty friend.
                                 MADISON
                        Won’t work. We need to hole up 
                        somewhere that isn’t connected to 
                        the picture industry.

                                 DENNISON
                        I know a place.

                                 MADISON
                        Anyone else have any suggestions?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Guys, I really have this thing to--

                                 DENNISON
                        Please, FBI Agent Madison Packard?

                                 MADISON
                        Fine. But--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DENNISON’S APARTMENT (LIVING ROOM) - DAY

           Dennison’s apartment looks nothing like what you’d expect a 
           thirtysomething bachelor to be living in. It’s so sparkling 
           clean that you could eat off the fucking floor, and every 
           book, tchotchke, and frame has been meticulously placed.

           The room is also decorated with numerous vases that are 
           overflowing with intricate floral arrangements.

                                 MADISON
                        --what’s with all the flowers?

           Chaplin sits on a floral-patterned couch wrapped in plastic.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        I keep waiting for someone to wheel 
                        in a corpse and deliver a eulogy.

                                 MADISON
                             (to Dennison, re: flowers)
                        Is this all you? I mean, obviously, 
                        your wife contributed to this....

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Girly shit. Those are the words 
                        you’re looking for. Girly and shit.

                                 DENNISON
                        I don’t have a wife.
                                 CHAPLIN
                        I believe that.

                                 DENNISON
                        I do have a roommate though.
                             (calling out)
                        Colby? You home?

                                 MADISON
                             (to Chaplin, quietly)
                        If a male ballerina prances his way 
                        out here we’re leaving.

           Dennison’s roommate, COLBY (25), is not a male ballerina.

           Instead, she’s an incredibly intelligent, kind, and beautiful 
           woman (super-model caliber) who few men on Earth, especially 
           the men in this room, are worthy of.

                                 DENNISON
                        Guys, this is Colby.

                          MADISON
                                                          CHAPLIN
           What the--
                                               --fuck is going on here?

                                 COLBY
                        Nice to meet you, gentlemen.

                                 DENNISON
                        Colby, this is my partner, FBI 
                        Agent Madison Packard--

                                 MADISON
                             (flashes badge)
                        We’re not partners.

                                 DENNISON
                        --and this is Charlie Chaplin.

                                 COLBY
                        Wow! I love your pictures, Mr. 
                        Chaplin. I grew up watching them.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        And look at you now. All grown up.

                                 MADISON
                             (flashes badge again)
                        You saw my badge, right?

                                 COLBY
                        I did. It’s very impressive.
                                 DENNISON
                        Madison and I are working together 
                        because Adolf Hitler is trying to 
                        kidnap Mr. Chaplin.

                                 COLBY
                        Oh, dear.

                                 MADISON
                        He probably shouldn’t have just 
                        told you that, but it’s true.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        It’s kind of a big deal.

                                 COLBY
                        I should say so. Would you 
                        gentlemen like some lemonade?

                                 DENNISON
                        That would be great, Colby. Thanks.

           Colby walks off into the kitchen.

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (to Dennison)
                        Please tell me you’re fucking her. 
                        And if so, describe it in detail.

                                 DENNISON
                        Colby? No way! She’s like a sister.

                                 MADISON
                        Yeah, a sister you wanna fuck.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Guys, honestly, I’ve gotta go...
                             (looks at watch)
                        ...shit.

                                 DENNISON
                             (re: misunderstanding)
                        Of course. It's the room with the 
                        toilet at the end of the hall.
                             (Chaplin exits)
                        Look for the daffodils.

                                 MADISON
                             (looking around apartment)
                        So what’s your deal, Dennison?

                                 DENNISON
                        Deal? Why would I have a deal?
                                 MADISON
                        You’re a single cop, you live in a 
                        flower shop, you’ve got a smoking-
                        hot roommate you don’t want to 
                        fuck, and you know German. A person 
                        couldn’t make you up if they tried.

                                 DENNISON
                        What can I say? I’m complex.

                                 MADISON
                        Oh, you’re something alright. You 
                        really know German?

                                 DENNISON
                        I know three languages actually: 
                        German; Polish, and Russian.

                                 MADISON
                        And English.

                                 DENNISON
                        I know four languages actually.

                                 MADISON
                        Kind of impressive for a cop.

                                 DENNISON
                        How many languages do you know?

           Madison is saved as Colby enters holding a tray of lemonades.

                                 COLBY
                        Dennison, I don’t know if you care 
                        or not, but I just saw Mr. Chaplin 
                        climb out the bathroom window.

           Dennison and Madison jump up and run into the——

           BATHROOM

           ——where they don’t find Chaplin, but do find an open window.

                                 MADISON
                        Chaplin wasn’t taking a shit!

                                 DENNISON
                        That turd! Why would he lie?

                                 MADISON
                        Okay, let’s think here. If we were 
                        Chaplin, where would we be headed?
                                 DENNISON
                        To my non-friend producer?

           Madison gives him a look: “You may have something there.”

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. METROPOLITAN PICTURES (STUDIO LOT) - DAY

           Dennison and Madison walk between towering soundstages.

           On their way, they pass a throng of dressed extras: CAVEMEN; 
           MIMES; GLADIATORS; PILGRIMS; CIVIL WAR SOLDIERS, etc.

                                 MADISON
                        Do you like living out here?

                                 DENNISON
                        Yeah. Although, it is a little 
                        weird living in a city run by the 
                        pictures. Everything’s a fuck-ade.

                                 MADISON
                        A fuck-ade?

                                 DENNISON
                        That’s a French word for false.

                                 MADISON
                        Oh. A façade.

           They pass TWO MORE EXTRAS: a COP and a ROBBER.

                                 DENNISON
                        You play cops and robbers as a kid?
                             (Madison nods)
                        I loved playing good guys versus 
                        bad guys with my brothers growing 
                        up. I’d force them to be the bad 
                        guys, then make myself the hero. 
                        That’s kind of what this feels 
                        like. For the first time... ever, I 
                        guess, I feel like a good guy.

                                 MADISON
                        You're a good guy. You’re a cop.

                                 DENNISON
                        Sure, but I’ve never saved the day. 
                        I’d also kind of like to get shot. 
                        Not in an “I’m gonna die” kind of 
                        way; just a flesh wound.
                                 MADISON
                        You want to get shot? Why?

                                 DENNISON
                        Because that’s what happens to good 
                        guys before they save the day.

                                 MADISON
                        Well, take it from someone who has 
                        been shot, it fucking sucks.

                                 DENNISON
                        Yeah. Sorry about that.

                                 MADISON
                        We’re here.

           They stop in front of a bungalow. Mounted next to the door is 
           a gold-plated sign: ROLAND O’DIX, PRODUCER. They enter.

                                 ROLAND (V.O.)
                        Chaplin? I thought he was--

           INT. ROLAND O’DIX’S OFFICE - DAY

           Metropolitan Pictures producer ROLAND O’DIX (60s), a rotund, 
           balding man who is far more producer than friend, sits 
           smoking an expensive cigar behind a ridiculously long desk.

           Dennison and Madison, who are sitting across from O’Dix at 
           the opposite end, are easily twenty feet away from him.

                                 MADISON
                        He’s still alive, sir, I promise.

                                 ROLAND
                        Huh. You know, Chaplin brought me 
                        that stupid picture idea last year.

                                 DENNISON
                        Can you speak up? You’re very far--

                                 ROLAND
                             (ignoring)
                        I passed. Told him folks wouldn’t 
                        watch war pictures unless we were 
                        at war, which let’s all hope won’t 
                        be the case with the Germans.

                                 DENNISON
                        Is it just me? Am I going deaf?
                             (to Madison)
                        Are you hearing him okay?
                                 ROLAND
                             (ignoring)
                        Honestly, nobody gives a shit about 
                        Chaplin anymore. You want to keep 
                        someone worthwhile alive, protect 
                        Clark Gable.

                                 DENNISON
                             (screaming)
                        Fuck Clark Gable in the ass!

           Madison throws Dennison a look: “What the fuck was that?”

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        That I heard. I apologize.

                                 ROLAND
                        Okay, Mickey Rooney then. Point is, 
                        you can protect Chaplin, but you’re 
                        polishing brass on the Lusitania.

                                 MADISON
                        That reference is too soon, sir.

                                 ROLAND
                        Fine, the Titanic then! Christ.

                                 MADISON
                        Mr. O’Dix--

           Dennison CHUCKLES at the name; Madison doesn’t.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        --if you had to find Mr. Chaplin, 
                        where would you look?

                                 ROLAND
                        Hollywood bars.

                                 MADISON
                        Any bars in particular?

                                 ROLAND
                        Yeah. All of ‘em.

           EXT. METROPOLITAN PICTURES (STUDIO LOT) - DAY

           Dennison and Madison exit O’Dix’s office.

                                 MADISON
                        That guy is a shitty friend.
           They approach TWO EXTRAS dressed as COWBOYS (30s) who, for 
           some reason, are watching them closely. Dennison notices.

                                 COWBOY #1
                             (with a cowboy twang)
                        Howdy, fellas.

           They tip their hats as they pass; Dennison watches them go.

                                 MADISON
                        So how many bars in Hollywood?

                                 DENNISON
                        A hundred? Maybe more?

                                 MADISON
                        We’re gonna need help.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FBI HOLLYWOOD DIVISION - DAY

           Moses and Louis sit around as Dennison and Madison enter.

                                 MADISON
                        Hey, fellas. Interested in a job?

           They spring to their feet in excitement.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY

           Moses and Louis walk together down one side of the street——

                                 MOSES
                        I didn’t know he was talking about 
                        an FBI assignment.

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah, I thought he at least meant 
                        some background work.

           ——while Dennison and Madison walk together down the opposite 
           side of the street. They're all looking for Chaplin, as they 
           peer through the windows of every bar they pass.

                                 DENNISON
                             (peers through window)
                        No Chaplin.

           They approach ZELDA (30s), who is clearly a prostitute.
                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Zelda. I’d like you to meet my 
                        partner, FBI Agent Madison Packard.

                                 ZELDA
                        Hey there, handsome.
                             (to Dennison)
                        Are you picking up girls tonight?

                                 DENNISON
                        Can’t tonight. I’m working an 
                        important top-secret case. Hitler’s 
                        trying to kidnap Charlie Chaplin.

                                 MADISON
                        You have to stop telling people.

                                 ZELDA
                        Fun! Well, you boys have a good 
                        day. See you around, Dennison.

           Zelda walks off.

                                 MADISON
                        How do you know so many hookers?

                                 DENNISON
                        Prostitution is a dangerous job, so 
                        occasionally I'll drive them to and 
                        from jobs for their own protection.

                                 MADISON
                        So you’re their pimp.

                                 DENNISON
                        What? No! I’m just keeping them 
                        safe. And in return they give me a 
                        couple bucks off what they made. 
                        For gas money.

                                 MADISON
                        So... you’re their pimp.

                                 DENNISON
                        You’re misunderstanding.

                                 MADISON
                        Am I? You drive them to jobs, you 
                        protect them, and you take a 
                        percentage. Which of those things 
                        does a pimp not do?

           Slowly, the truth sinks into Dennison’s brain.
                                 DENNISON
                             (to himself)
                        Oh my god. I’m a pimp.

                                 MADISON
                             (peers through window)
                        No Chaplin.
                             (to Moses and Louis)
                        How you guys doing? Any luck?

           Moses and Louis are also looking into a bar window... as they 
           check out their reflections and fix their hair.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Judy Garlands!

                                 LOUIS
                        Oh, sorry! No, nothing yet, sirs!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Ulrich and Suka stand in the room where Benny died earlier. 
           The sound of FOOTSTEPS grows as a shadowy FIGURE approaches.

                                 FIGURE
                             (in German)
                        What in holy hell happened?

                                 ULRICH
                             (re: Benny)
                        The mustache confused Suka.

           Suka throws Ulrich a look: “Fuck off.”

                                 ULRICH (CONT'D)
                        Confused us. It won’t happen again.

                                 SUKA
                        Why can’t we just kill him?

                                 FIGURE
                        Because that is not the assignment. 
                        The Führer believes Chaplin is more 
                        valuable alive than dead, and until 
                        that changes it is not your place 
                        to question him. Chaplin is in 
                        Hollywood, and since you’ve been 
                        unable to fulfill the job thus far, 
                        I've arranged for help to join you.
                                 ULRICH
                        We don’t need help.

                                 FIGURE
                        I wasn’t asking.

           The figure walks off.

                                 ULRICH
                        I’ll get the car.

           Suka SOCKS Ulrich in the shoulder, then walks off.

                                 ULRICH (CONT'D)
                        Did your mother hug you growing up?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY

           Dennison and Madison continue to search for Chaplin.

                                 DENNISON
                        I never meant to be a pimp.

                                 MADISON
                             (notices something ahead)
                        That little shit-dick.

           Madison runs ahead. Dennison follows after as they approach——

           EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATER - DAY

           ——where Chaplin is pushing his hands into wet concrete in 
           front of a crowd of FANS, PRESS, and TOURISTS. Flashbulbs POP 
           as PHOTOGRAPHERS capture the moment on film.

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (to himself, re: concrete)
                        Feels like Greta Garbo.

                                 MADISON (O.S.)
                        What’s the matter with you, Mr. 
                        Charles Chaplin?

           Madison pulls Chaplin up by the back of his coat. ONLOOKERS 
           GASP in shock as camera shutters CLICK, forever documenting 
           this odd turn of events. Dennison approaches.

           Chaplin takes his concrete-caked hands and rubs them down the 
           front of Madison’s suit. Madison looks down, stunned.
           A long beat of silence passes as no one says a fucking word. 
           Finally, a camera shutter CLICKS and a flashbulb POPS.

           Madison PUNCHES Chaplin in the fucking face.

           Chaplin's body spins from the force, then lands facedown in 
           the wet concrete he just placed his handprints in.

           A handful of MACHO ONLOOKERS step forward in Chaplin's 
           defense. Dennison, feeling cornered, pulls out his gun——

                                 DENNISON
                        Fellas, come on... let’s stay calm.

           ——and accidentally FIRES a round into the air, which has the 
           exact opposite effect on the escalating situation.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Do guns shoot themselves now?!?

           Most onlookers dive to the ground for cover; others try to 
           run, SCREAMING and tripping over each other as they flee.

           Moses and Louis approach.

                                 LOUIS
                        We have no idea what’s going on, 
                        but it sounds fabulously thrilling!

                                 MADISON
                        Grab Chaplin and follow us!

           Moses and Louis pull Chaplin out of the wet concrete, then 
           follow Dennison and Madison through the crowd toward the car.

           Dennison and Madison open their car doors as Moses and Louis 
           toss Chaplin into the backseat.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                             (to Moses/Louis)
                        Go get your car.

           Moses and Louis run off toward their car.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison and Madison get in and turn around to face Chaplin.

                                 DENNISON
                        Why would you do that, Charlie?
                                 CHAPLIN
                             (through a mouthful of 
                              slowly-drying concrete)
                        I thought it would be funny to ruin 
                        his suit.

                                 MADISON
                        A very expensive suit, asshole!

                                 DENNISON
                        It was made by a Burmese murderer!

                                 MADISON
                        Siamese prostitute! Mr. Chaplin, 
                        need I remind you that you 
                        requested us?

                                 DENNISON
                        Exactly. We didn’t even want this 
                        job. I mean, I did, but FBI Agent 
                        Madison Packard here sure didn’t.

                                 MADISON
                        Huge understatement.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Know why I really requested you? 
                        Because you're idiots, and I knew I 
                        could easily ditch you morons!

                                 DENNISON
                        That’s redundant.

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (to Madison)
                        You’ve bought into your own macho 
                        bullshit so completely that you’re 
                        barely able to function as a human 
                        being, let alone interact with one.
                             (to Dennison)
                        And you’re a helpless pantywaist 
                        who can’t figure out how a gun 
                        works, most likely because of your 
                        tiny penis.

                                 DENNISON
                        I do not have a tiny penis!
                             (goes for fly)
                        So help me, I will prove it to you.

                          CHAPLIN
                                                          MADISON
           No!
                                               No!
                                 CHAPLIN
                        When it comes to protecting people, 
                        you two dipshits are the most 
                        unqualified people on Earth. I 
                        figured I had a better chance of 
                        staying alive if I took off and got 
                        as far away from you as possible.

                                 MADISON
                             (to Dennison)
                        He has a point about the gun.

                                 DENNISON
                        What, the tiny penis part? Because--

                                 MADISON
                        No, the part about you not knowing 
                        how to use a gun. It’s almost like 
                        you’re scared of it.

                                 DENNISON
                        Oh, really? Well, at least I don’t 
                        hide behind my gun the way some 
                        people hide behind their badge.

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (to himself)
                        I’m a dead man.

           A black car comes to a SCREECHING HALT alongside Dennison's 
           car. Chaplin’s door opens as TWO HULKING BRUTES (30s) yank 
           him out and toss him into the waiting car.

           Neither Dennison nor Madison notice as they ARGUE. Nor do 
           they notice when DAPHNE (20s), another prostitute, gets in.

                                 MADISON
                             (holds up badge)
                        This badge was manufactured by the 
                        Robbins Company of Attleboro, 
                        Massachusetts.

                                 DENNISON
                        No one cares about your badge!
                             (turns around)
                        Charlie, do you care-- Daphne?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hey, Dennison. I got a John waiting 
                        for me at the Farmer’s Market.

                                 DENNISON
                        I’m not your pimp, Daphne! Get out!
                                 DAPHNE
                             (exiting car)
                        You don’t have to be so aggressive.

           Dennison smiles at the "compliment."

           The black car beside them PEELS out; an additional/backup car 
           follows. As the cars drive off, Dennison and Madison see 
           Chaplin banging on the rear window. He’s mouthing: “HELP ME!”

                          MADISON
                                                         DENNISON
           Fuck!
                                               Crap!

           Dennison attempts to pull out, but is blocked in by another 
           car that has pulled up alongside them. It belongs to——

                                 MOSES
                        Ready and waiting!

                                 LOUIS
                        With bells on!

                                 DENNISON
                        Follow us!

           Dennison doesn’t wait for them to move; instead, he bulldozes 
           out in front of them, SCRAPING the side of his car alongside 
           the side of their car. He floors it and PEELS out.

                                 MOSES
                        This is my dad’s car.

                                 LOUIS
                        Go!

           They too PEEL out, following after Dennison’s car.

           Hollywood as TOURISTS/LOCALS dive into storefronts for cover.

           INT. SUKA’S CAR - DAY

           Chaplin cowers in the backseat between the two brutes. He 
           faces forward, watching Suka weave through traffic as if she 
           were a professional race car driver. Beside her is——

                                 ULRICH
                             (turns around)
                        Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Chaplin.

                        I mean that sincerely. I’ve seen A 
                        Dog’s Life over a hundred times.

           Suka rolls her eyes in disgust.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Thank you?

           Suka cuts hard right as she turns onto——

           EXT. THE MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY - DAY

           Suka's car leads the chase as they speed along the winding 
           road of a mostly desolate Mulholland Highway (AKA Drive).

           As they make their way, THUGS in the second (backup) car lean 
           out their windows and SHOOT at their pursuers.

                             (re: his father's car)
                        I’ll tell him it was a hit-and-run. 
                        He’ll buy that, don’t you think?

           Bullets riddle the windshield, SHATTERING the glass.

                                 LOUIS
                        That’s gonna be harder to explain.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Bullets also SHATTER Dennison’s windshield.

                                 DENNISON
                        They’re shooting at us?

                                 MADISON
                        They’re Nazis. It’s what they do.

                                 DENNISON
                        What do we do?

                                 MADISON
                        We shoot back.

           Madison leans out his window and starts SHOOTING; Dennison 
           watches Madison as he soaks in tricks of the trade.
           His confidence building, Dennison grabs the steering wheel in 
           his right hand, pulls out his gun with his left hand, and 
           starts SHOOTING out the window as he drives. The car swerves.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        I meant that I would shoot back!

                                 DENNISON
                             (giggling)
                        This is kind of fun.

                                 MADISON
                        You’re gonna get us killed!

           EXT. THE MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY - DAY

           The cars approach a sharp curve in the road.

           INT. BACKUP CAR - DAY

           Thugs in the backseat continue to return FIRE, but that all 
           stops when a SHOT rips through the head of the DRIVER (30s).

           His body slumps forward onto the wheel, causing the car to 
           violently swerve back and forth across the road.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison and Madison look on as the car loses control.

                                 DENNISON
                             (re: driver)
                        I got him!

                                 MADISON
                        Pretty sure that was me.

                                 DENNISON
                        No way! He’s on my side!

           INT. BACKUP CAR - DAY

           As the car veers perilously close to the road’s edge, the 
           PASSENGER (40s) shoves the driver’s dead body over, grabs the 
           steering wheel, and cuts it hard left.

           The car cuts sharply over the dividing line... and straight 
           into the path of an oncoming Ford COE Stake Bed truck.
           The truck SMASHES into the backup car head-on, pushing it 
           down the road in the opposite direction past——

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison looks on in childlike disbelief as the car passes.

                                 DENNISON
                        This is like out of a movie!

           EXT. THE MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY - DAY

           The TRUCK DRIVER slams on the brakes, which brings the truck 
           to a SCREECHING halt, but also sends the now-destroyed backup 
           car barreling down the road toward——

           INT. MOSES’ FATHER’S CAR - DAY

           ——who SCREAMS like a bitch as he slams on the BRAKES.

           EXT. THE MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY - DAY

           As the backup car closes in, it CLIPS a rock jutting out of 
           the cliff wall. It spins in 360° circles as it——

           INT. MOSES’ FATHER’S CAR - DAY

           ——crosses the dividing line in front of their now-stopped 
           car. It TEARS off the front grille and fenders as it passes, 
           then shoots off the cliff.

                                 LOUIS
                        They should put a guardrail along 
                        this road. Someone could get hurt.

           After a beat, the passing car EXPLODES on impact below; 
           beside them, a huge fireball rises up from the valley.

           Again, Moses guns the engine as they continue the pursuit.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison and Madison continue to discuss who shot the driver.

                                 DENNISON
                        There's no possible way you 
                        could’ve hit him from that angle.
                                 MADISON
                        Like you know about angles.

                                 DENNISON
                        I know all about angles. You got 
                        obtuse ones, acute ones, right--

                                 MADISON
                        Okay, you know about angles! I just 
                        don’t think a person of your... 
                        skill set could’ve made that shot, 
                        especially with his left hand.

                                 DENNISON
                        You’d be amazed by what I can do 
                        with my left hand.

           Madison GAGS at the thought.

           INT. SUKA’S CAR - DAY

           Suka looks up into the rearview mirror to find Dennison’s car 
           closing in. She looks at Ulrich: “Do I gotta do everything?”

                                 ULRICH
                             (to brutes, in German)
                        Shoot at their tires.

           The brutes look up at Suka who, through only a look, 
           communicates a very different message: “Kill them.”

           The brutes nod and pull out their guns as Chaplin sinks deep 
           in his seat. They lean out their windows and FIRE.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           The car takes more FIRE. Madison leans out his window, takes 
           careful aim, and SHOOTS the passenger-side brute in the head.

                                 MADISON
                        That was definitely me.

           INT. SUKA’S CAR - DAY

           The dead brute is slumped over through the door's open 
           window; half his is body inside the car, the other half out.

                                 ULRICH
                        Shit.

           It’s now Ulrich who leans out his window and FIRES.
           Chaplin sits frozen, watching it all unfold: Suka driving; 
           Ulrich and the brute SHOOTING, and the corpse hanging out the 
           window as it rocks back and forth from the motion of the car.

           And that’s when he notices that the car door is unlocked.

           In one quick motion, Chaplin lifts the handle and pushes 
           against the door (and the weight of the dead brute) with his 
           feet. The door opens. Chaplin jumps out of a moving car.

           EXT. THE MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY - DAY

           Chaplin rolls down the side of the road as he approaches——

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison swerves left, barely missing Chaplin with his tires.

                                               Mr. Charles Chaplin!

           As do the guys in——

           INT. MOSES’ FATHER’S CAR - DAY

           ——who SCREAM as they once again SCREECH to a halt.

           The front of their car stops just inches from Chaplin’s body, 
           which is now lying unconscious in the middle of the road.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison looks into his side-view mirror.

                                 DENNISON
                             (re: Moses/Louis)
                        They’ll grab him.

                                 MADISON
                        You sure about that?

                                 DENNISON
                        No. But I am sure of one thing: 
                        We’ve got some Nazis to catch.

           Dennison holds up his hand for a high-five. Madison doesn’t 
           high-five him back.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Maybe next time.
           INT. SUKA’S CAR - DAY

           The alive brute pushes the dead brute out onto the road with 
           his feet. He closes the door, then leans out his window.

           He raises his gun and aims at Dennison's head... as another 
           Ford COE Stake Bed truck comes barreling around a curve.

           A second TRUCK DRIVER (50s) WHISTLES as he drives.

           INT. SUKA’S CAR - DAY

           The truck driver lays on the HORN, causing the brute to turn 
           his head, which is then ripped off by the front of the truck.

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           The brute’s severed head presses against the windshield as it 
           comes face-to-face with the——

                                 TRUCK DRIVER
                        AHHH!!!

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           Dennison and Madison watch the truck/severed head pass. They 
           look at each other: “Did we just see that?”

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           The still-SCREAMING truck driver SLAMS on the brakes, which 
           launches the brute’s head off the windshield in the process.

           It violently rolls down the road.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Suka cuts hard and turns onto a dirt road as she tries to 
           shake them. It doesn’t work: Dennison also makes the turn.

           INT. SUKA’S CAR - DAY

           Suka shoots Ulrich another silent look: “Do something.”
           Ulrich crawls into the backseat. He opens the door and kicks 
           the brute’s headless body out, then SMASHES out the rest of 
           the car’s bullet-hole-riddled rear window. He SHOOTS at 
           Dennison and Madison.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

           They duck for cover as the windshield is destroyed in a hail 
           of GUNFIRE. They attempt to return FIRE, but it’s of no use.

                                 DENNISON
                        Hold on!

           Dennison FLOORS it.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Dennison’s car SMASHES into the back of Suka’s car; his front 
           grille locks onto her rear bumper. Dennison’s car is now 
           pushing Suka’s car down the road.

           Ulrich peeks above the backseat and raises his Luger at 
           Dennison’s face, which is now just feet away.

           INT. DENNISON’S CAR - DAY

                                 DENNISON
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard!

                                 MADISON
                             (takes aim)
                        I got him.

           A bullet TEARS through Ulrich’s hand; he SCREAMS as he drops 
           into the backseat.

           Dennison BURIES the pedal into the floorboards——

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           ——forcing both cars off the road and down a steep embankment. 
           On their way down, both cars FLIP numerous times. From inside 
           the cars, everyone (but Suka, who is that badass) SCREAMS.

           Ulrich gets launched out of the rear window; his body comes 
           to a stop hidden under thick brush. He GRUNTS something in 
           German before passing out. Suka’s car finally comes to a stop 
           when it SMASHES into the base of a tree.
           Dennison’s car lands on its roof, sending them both CRASHING 
           down onto their heads.

           After a beat, they stir and pull themselves out of the car.

                                 MADISON
                        You drove us off a fucking cliff!

                                 DENNISON
                        I know! It was cool, wasn’t it?

           They dust themselves off and approach Suka’s car. It’s empty.

                                 MADISON
                        We’re chasing ghosts here.

           They look up at the——

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           ——to find Suka hauling ass up toward the Hollywoodland Sign.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Madison raises his gun and takes aims at Suka; Dennison moves 
           in front of Madison's gun.

                                 MADISON
                        Get out of the fucking way!

                                 DENNISON
                        You can’t shoot her. She’s a woman.

                                 MADISON
                        Yeah, a Nazi woman.

                                 DENNISON
                        You can’t shoot a woman, even a 
                        Nazi woman. And you definitely 
                        can’t shoot her in the back.

                                 MADISON
                             (pushes Dennison aside)
                        I’m shooting her, and there’s 
                        nothing you can do to stop me.

           Madison pulls the trigger: CLICK. He’s out of ammo.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        Fuck! Gimme your gun.
                                 DENNISON
                        Absolutely not.

                                 MADISON
                        Okay. You’re right.

           After a beat, Madison unsuccessfully attempts to wrestle 
           Dennison’s gun away from him.

                                 DENNISON
                        I said no!

                                 MADISON
                        You’re a fucking asshole!

                                 DENNISON
                        Look, if you really want her, I’ll 
                        just go get her. Okay?

           Dennison takes off running up the hill.

                                 MADISON
                        She’s a ruthless killer, Dennison. 
                        You know that, right?

                                 DENNISON
                             (turns around)
                        Madison... she’s only a woman.

           Dennison continues his run up the hill.

                                 MADISON
                        Your funeral, pal.

           A hand grabs Madison from behind and spins him around.

                                 ULRICH
                        I apologize for this.

           Ulrich PUNCHES Madison hard in the face. Madison falls.

           EXT. THE MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY - DAY

           On foot, Moses and Louis apprehensively approach Chaplin’s 
           body, which is still lying motionless in the road.

                                 LOUIS
                        Mr. Chaplin? Hello?

                                 MOSES
                        I think he’s dead. But for real 
                        this time.
           They notice an OBJECT rolling down the road toward them.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        What is that?

           The object rolls closer, finally coming to a stop directly in 
           front of Chaplin’s face. It’s the severed head of the brute.

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (stirring)
                        What the-- where am--

           Chaplin snaps to when he sees the head. He SCREAMS.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Madison is pummeled by an extremely beat/shot-up Ulrich.

                                 ULRICH
                        I didn’t want to hurt you, but 
                        you’ve left me no choice.

           Madison picks up a log to defend himself; Ulrich SWATS it 
           away as if it were a fucking Popsicle stick.

                                 MADISON
                        Dennison!

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           Dennison, who is closing in on Suka, turns around to see 
           Ulrich beating the living shit out of Madison.

           He looks back up the hill to see Suka disappear behind the 
           Hollywoodland Sign, then back down the hill at the fight.

                                 DENNISON
                        Poop.

           EXT. THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - DAY

           Suka passes behind the sign as she continues her ascent.

                                 DENNISON (O.S.)
                             (in German)
                        Excuse me, Nazi woman, but where do 
                        you think you’re going?

           Dennison TACKLES Suka from behind. They slide down the hill 
           in the dirt and come to a stop at the base of the sign.
           Suka jumps to her feet like a fucking ninja (in heels) and 
           readies herself for a fight as Dennison uses the support of 
           the sign’s letters to help himself up.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Oh, so you wanna dance, little la--

           Suka PUNCHES Dennison in the face; his head flies back and 
           BANGS against the sign.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        You sure don’t hit like a la--

           Again, she PUNCHES him; again, his head HITS the sign.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Are you sure you’re a la--

           Again, she PUNCHES him, but now he falls to the ground.

           Suka stands over Dennison; she lifts her dress to reveal a 
           knife strapped to her thigh. As she pulls the knife from its 
           sheath, Dennison gets a quick glance up her dress.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Yep, definitely a lady.

           Suka smirks as if flattered. Dennison uses the moment to 
           punch her in her junk, and then bite her leg. Suka SCREAMS.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Madison and Ulrich are fully embroiled in a fist fight. 
           Madison takes another PUNCH to the face. Again, he drops.

                                 ULRICH
                        I know it’s cliché, but this is 
                        hurting me more than it’s hurting 
                        you. Or at least it’s fairly close.

           EXT. THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - DAY

           Dennison gets to his feet as Suka grabs her throbbing junk.

                                 DENNISON
                             (in German)
                        This may be forward, but under 
                        different circumstances I think 
                        maybe we could’ve dated.

           Suka takes the knife she was holding and throws it at 
           Dennison; it buries itself deep into his shoulder.
                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        My parents never threw knives at 
                        each other. Empty bottles a few--
                             (realizing)
                        --AHHH!!!

                                 SUKA
                             (charges at Dennison)
                        AHHH!!!

           Suka tackles Dennison, pinning him against the back of the 
           sign. She grabs the handle of the knife and starts to pull it 
           out of Dennison’s shoulder, but he places his palm on the 
           base of the handle and pushes it back in. Again, he SCREAMS.

           Amazingly, Suka LAUGHS.

                                 SUKA (CONT'D)
                        I may like you. You’re fucked up.

                                 DENNISON
                        Don’t get too attached.

           Dennison HEADBUTTS Suka in the face; her nose SHATTERS. She 
           stumbles backward as Dennison attempts to pull the knife out 
           of his shoulder. It doesn't come.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                             (re: knife)
                        It was coming out so easy for you!

           Again, Suka charges at Dennison. She CRASHES into him, his 
           body trapped between a brutal Nazi killer and the giant 
           letter “D” in HOLLYWOOD. As Suka ruthlessly pummels him, each 
           HIT is accompanied by the sound of wood CRACKING.

           Dennison looks above him as the “D” starts to tilt backward.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Well, this is happening.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Ulrich straddles Madison’s chest on the ground as he PUNCHES 
           him in the face. He pauses as the sound of SPLINTERING WOOD 
           grows louder. They both look up to see the “D” tip over——

                          MADISON
                                                          ULRICH
           Hollywoo?
                                               Hollywoo?

           ——and then start sliding down the hill toward them.
                          MADISON
                                                      ULRICH (CONT'D)
           Fuck!
                                               Fuck!

           EXT. THE FIRST “D” IN THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - DAY

           Suka straddles Dennison, still beating the fuck out of him as 
           they ride the backside of the letter “D” down the hill.

                                 DENNISON
                             (in German)
                        This is kind of erotic.

           Suka jams her thumbs into Dennison’s eyes and DIGS IN.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        I changed my mind!

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Madison and Ulrich jump to their feet and run out of the path 
           of the approaching letter. At the last second, just as it’s 
           about to pass, Ulrich shoves Madison into its path.

                                 ULRICH
                        Sorry!

           EXT. THE FIRST “D” IN THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - DAY

           Madison lands HARD on the sign as it continues its descent.

                                 DENNISON
                             (in German)
                        Hey, partner!

                                 MADISON
                        What?

                                 DENNISON
                        Oh, sorry. I said, hey, partner!

                                 MADISON
                        We're not fucking partners!

           Madison KICKS Suka in the chest; she goes flying toward the 
           front of the letter.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        None of this would’ve happened if 
                        you had just let me shoot her!
                                 DENNISON
                        There are rules!

           Suka crawls back toward them.

                                 MADISON
                        Fuck your rules!

           Madison pulls Dennison’s gun from its holster and aims at 
           Suka... just as he realizes the “D” is approaching a cliff.

                        Jump!

           Dennison and Madison do just that; they roll through the 
           brush, taking cactus spines in their legs, arms, and asses.

           Finally, they come to a stop and watch as Suka rides the “D” 
           off the side of the cliff. After a beat, they hear a CRASH.

           They stand and walk to the cliff’s edge; in the valley below 
           them, the “D” lies shattered in pieces.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        You should've let me shoot her.

                                 DENNISON
                        Cowards shoot women.

           Madison looks at Dennison —— who still has the knife sticking 
           out of his shoulder —— as if he just called his mom a whore.

                                 MADISON
                        Pretty big talk... for a pussy.

                                 DENNISON
                        This pussy is full of big talk.
                             (beat)
                        I mean, I'm not a pussy.

                                 MADISON
                        I don't even know why I let you get 
                        to me. You're just a dumb cop. It's 
                        not like you have any real power.

                                 DENNISON
                        I do so have real power! I could 
                        arrest you right now if I wanted.

                                 MADISON
                        I'd like to see you try.
                                 DENNISON
                        Okay. Challenge accepted.
                             (flashes badge)
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard, you are 
                        under arrest.
                             (takes out handcuffs, goes 
                              for Madison's wrists)
                        Anything you say can and will--

           Madison PUNCHES Dennison in the fucking head.

           A beat passes as the reality of what just happened dawns on 
           Dennison; his lips quiver, his eyes well up with tears.

                                 MADISON
                             (condescending)
                        Awww. Is someone gonna cry because 
                        I hit them?

                                 DENNISON
                        No. I'm gonna cry because you 
                        called me a dumb cop.

                                 MADISON
                        I'm getting Hoover to force you off 
                        this assignment. I'm done with you.

                                 DENNISON
                        I'm more done with you! And you're 
                        gonna have to walk back, because 
                        you're not getting a ride from me!

                                 MADISON
                        Your car is upside-down in a ditch!

                                 DENNISON
                        Can I at least have my gun back?

           Madison throws Dennison's gun far off into the distance.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Son of a biscuit.

           Madison walks off. Dennison wanders off to find his gun.

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF - DAY

           The splintered white-painted wood of the “D” moves as Suka 
           rises like a fucking Nazi phoenix from beneath its rubble. 
           She steadies herself and hobbles off... still wearing heels.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. FBI HOLLYWOOD DIVISION - DAY

           Madison stands at a desk holding a phone handset to his ear.

                                 MADISON
                        Mr. Hoover? It's me. Madison.

           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS (J. EDGAR HOOVER'S OFFICE) - DAY

           Hoover sits slowly brushing a blonde woman's wig that is 
           resting on a mannequin head on his desk. He looks distracted.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Make it quick, Packard. I'm in a 
                        meeting.

           INT. FBI HOLLYWOOD DIVISION - DAY

                                 MADISON
                        I'm calling about Detective 
                        Dennison. I'm requesting he be 
                        forced off the assignment. I think 
                        he's a detriment to our mission. 
                        Also, I'm not fully convinced he 
                        isn't brain damaged in some way.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        We'll talk about this in person 
                        tomorrow. I have a flight out to 
                        L.A. first thing in the morning.

                                 MADISON
                        You're coming out here? Why?

           INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS (J. EDGAR HOOVER'S OFFICE) - DAY

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Because you idiots broke the 
                        goddamn Hollywoodland Sign. The 
                        Mayor of Hollywood is pissed, so 
                        I'm coming out to calm the waters.

                                 MADISON
                        I apologize. For what it's worth, 
                        Dennison broke the sign.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Eh, Hollywood's Mayor isn't even a 
                        real mayor. I'll deal with it when 
                        I get there. Until then, play nice 
                        for once, would you, Packard?
                                 MADISON
                        Yes, sir.

           Hoover hangs up. He eyes the wig for a beat, then continues 
           to brush through it.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. THE PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           A bruised Suka stands on the beach holding a package wrapped 
           in brown paper. Behind her, Ulrich approaches. He looks as if 
           he’s been run over by a train: his head, torso, and hands are 
           wrapped in bandages.

                                 ULRICH
                             (in German)
                        Why are we meeting here again?
                             (no reply)
                        Whatever.

           Ulrich bends down, picks up a rock, and SKIPS it across the 
           waves. He picks up another rock, but this time he throws it 
           far into the water. As it meets the water it doesn’t sink 
           with a PLOP, but ricochets off its surface with a CLINK.

                                 ULRICH (CONT'D)
                        What the...?

           The water parts around the top of a surfacing German U-boat.

           The hatch opens and a naked Franklin (yes, that Franklin) 
           climbs out. He dives into the water and, again, swims like a 
           motherfucker toward the shore. Behind him, the U-boat dives.

           He walks out of the water and approaches Suka and Ulrich.

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (to Suka)
                        Like what you see?

           Suka, clearly unimpressed, says nothing.

                                 ULRICH
                        That really necessary? You couldn’t 
                        have brought a suit or something?

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (to Suka, re: Ulrich)
                        Who’s the mummy?

           Suka tosses the package to Franklin. He unwraps it: a dry set 
           of clothing... and a large knife. He starts to get dressed.
                                 ULRICH
                             (to Suka)
                        What's he doing here?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Haven't you put it together yet? 
                        I'm your replacement.

           Franklin takes the knife and slits Ulrich’s fucking throat!

           Suka and Franklin walk off together. Blood pours from 
           Ulrich's neck as he GURGLES his last breaths.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. LAUREL CANYON - DAY

           The canyon has been cleared/dressed for a location shoot. 
           Sitting in the middle of the set is Chaplin’s pride and joy: 
           an enormous cannon (AKA Big Bertha, The Paris Gun) that 
           famously appears in the opening scene of The Great Dictator.

           CREW and CAST (dressed as World War I-era German soldiers) 
           rush around as Chaplin (who is dressed as character ADENOID 
           HYNKEL) preps a camera. He’s giddy with excitement. Dennison 
           and Madison, on the other hand, are ignoring each other.

           Dennison pulls out a stick of gum and pops it in his mouth.

                                 DENNISON
                        I'd offer you a piece of gum but I 
                        never found my gun.

           To rub it in, Dennison does offer pieces of gum to TWO 
           PASSING EXTRAS who are dressed as German soldiers.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Some Wrigley’s, boys?

           They silently stare Dennison down as they pass; as they do, 
           Dennison realizes there’s something familiar about them.

           Though they’re now dressed as WWI-era Nazis, we recognize 
           them as the two cowboys they met leaving O’Dix’s office. 
           Slowly, that fact starts to dawn on Dennison——

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Hey, don’t we know those--

                                 CHAPLIN (O.S.)
                        Guys!

           ——but like that, Dennison's thought is gone.
           Dennison and Madison look over to find Chaplin sitting in a 
           bucket seat attached to a smaller gun beside Big Bertha; he’s 
           cranking handles, causing the gun to rise, fall, spin, etc.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        Feel like giving her a whirl?

                                 MADISON
                        No time for that now, Mr. Charles 
                        Chaplin.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Come on. All this shit cost me a 
                        small fortune to have made, and 
                        they’re just gonna destroy it after 
                        we wrap. It’s now or never, boys.

                                 DENNISON
                        It does look super fun.

                                 MADISON
                        It looks moderately entertaining.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Are you chicken, Madison?

                                 MADISON
                        I am not chicken. I’ve stared death 
                        in the face more times than--

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (imitating chicken)
                        Bawk, bawk, bawk! I’m FBI Agent 
                        Madison Packard--
                             (flaps arms like wings)
                        --and I’m a chicken. Bawk!

                                 MADISON
                        I'm still not--

                                 DENNISON
                             (joining in)
                        Bawk, bawk, bawk!

                                 MADISON
                        Do not push me, Dennison.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        My name is Madison and I peck at 
                        the ground, lay eggs, and eat my 
                        newborn chicks alive.
                             (thinking)
                        Chickens do that, right?
           Dennison nods as Chaplin crawls out of the bucket seat.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        Madison, you’ve given me no other 
                        option: I order you to try it out.

                                 MADISON
                             (sighing)
                        You two are worse than all of my 
                        eleven sisters combined.

           Madison climbs into the seat and cranks handles as Dennison 
           and Chaplin look on, pleased as fuck with themselves. The gun 
           spins as Madison gets a feel for the controls.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        Okay, I admit... it's a little fun.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        That's what I'm talking about!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Chaplin?

           Chaplin turns around to find Franklin (who, ironically, is 
           also dressed as a WWI-era German soldier) and the two extras 
           who passed/ignored Dennison earlier standing behind him.

           Franklin BASHES Chaplin in the head with a club. As his body 
           falls, Franklin grabs him and tosses him over his shoulder.

           Dennison, oblivious to what’s unfolding, turns around.

                                 DENNISON
                        Charlie? What's the--

           Franklin BASHES Dennison in the head; he falls to the ground. 
           The Nazis walk off carrying Chaplin’s body.

                                 MADISON
                             (oblivious)
                        Okay, how do I stop this thing?

                        Guys? Hello?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. LAPD HOLLYWOOD PRECINCT - DAY

           Dennison and Madison approach with their tails between their 
           legs, pissed off at themselves and each other.
                                 DENNISON
                        They were dressed like German 
                        soldiers! How was I supposed to 
                        know they were Nazis?

                                 MADISON
                        Do you even hear yourself?

                                 DENNISON
                        It’s not my fault someone was 
                        riding a giant toy gun while I was 
                        busy getting clubbed in the head.

                                 MADISON
                        You pressured me into riding the 
                        gun. You made chicken noises at me!

                                 DENNISON
                        Well, if the chicken shoe fits.

                                 MADISON
                        Chickens don’t wear shoes.

                                 DENNISON
                             (looks at Madison’s shoes)
                        I beg to differ.

           INT. LAPD HOLLYWOOD PRECINCT - DAY

           They continue to bicker as they enter.

                                 MADISON
                        You’re a fucking child.

                                 DENNISON
                        Oh, yeah? Well, you’re an adult. A 
                        big, stupid, dummy adult. So there!

           They look up to find Captain Basketti and J. Edgar Hoover 
           standing/waiting for them. Hoover is eating a hot dog.

                                 MADISON
                        Fuck.
                             (to Hoover, re: hot dog)
                        That the Antonio?

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Sure is. And he's delicious.

           Everyone looks on as Hoover takes an awkwardly large bite of 
           his wiener. Then——
                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        Detective Dennison! My office! Now!

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        You too, Packard. My--

           Hoover looks around, realizing he doesn’t have an office.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER (CONT'D)
                             (points at door)
                        Whoever’s fucking office this is.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Chaplin sits blindfolded/tied to a chair.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Hello? Nazi?

           Off in the distance, the CLICK-CLACK of high heels grows as 
           Suka approaches. She stops/stands in front of Chaplin.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        Well, I know you’re there, so 
                        you’re either deaf, dumb, or both.
                             (Suka socks Chaplin's jaw)
                        Not deaf. So what’s the plan here?
                             (still no response)
                        Nothing? Well then, how about this: 
                        Take me to mein Führer!

           Suka walks off, the CLICK-CLACK of her heels gets quieter.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        That’s what I thought, fascist!
                             (Suka stops)
                        Kidding. I didn’t mean it, honest.

           Suka walks off: CLICK-CLACK, CLICK-CLACK, etc.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LAPD HOLLYWOOD PRECINCT (NOT HOOVER’S OFFICE) - DAY

           Madison stares off into space as Hoover tears into him.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        You had one job, Packard.
           BASKETTI’S OFFICE

           Dennison is to Madison as Basketti is to Hoover.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        To grow a fucking pair and learn 
                        how to be a cop. And, of course, to 
                        keep Chaplin from falling into Nazi 
                        hands. But to be honest, I would’ve 
                        settled for one of those. Instead--

                        be captured, but it happened while

                        What do you mean?

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        What part of “Are you farting in my 
                        office?” do you not understand?

                                 DENNISON
                        I’m not farting!

           Madison pauses a beat to see if he heard Hoover correctly.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER (CONT'D)

                        Also, you should get that knife out 
                        before it turns gangrenous.

           Dennison looks down as we realize the knife is still sticking 
           out of his shoulder.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI (CONT'D)
                        I'm gonna need your gun.

                                 DENNISON
                        Well, see, here's the thing--

           Basketti SIGHS.

           EXT. LAPD HOLLYWOOD PRECINCT - DAY

           Dennison and Madison exit, both angry at the other person.

                        Back at you, penis... neck.

           Dennison walks off in the opposite direction.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Madison walks alone. As he passes a market, Colby exits 
           carrying two large bags of groceries. She recognizes him.

                                 COLBY
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard?

                                 MADISON
                        Colby. What are you doing here?

                        Picking up some items for dinner 
                        tonight. I like to have it ready 
                        for Dennison when he gets home from 
                        work. Would you like to join us?

                                 MADISON
                        I'd rather be eaten by badgers.

                                 COLBY
                        Oh, I'm sorry. But if that's true, 
                        drinks are in order. How about you 
                        follow me back for a quickie?

                        Let me help with those. I insist.

                                 COLBY
                        Thank you kindly, sir.
           An excited Madison takes her bags and follows after Colby.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD (BUS BENCH) - DAY

           Dennison —— who now has bloodied gauze wrapped across his 
           shoulder from where the knife once was —— pours his heart and 
           soul out to JASMINE (20s), another prostitute.

                                 DENNISON
                        I tried my best to be a friend to 
                        him, a partner, but he hates me.

                                 JASMINE
                        How could anyone hate you?

                                 DENNISON
                        Apparently, it's fairly easy.

           Dennison rests his head on Jasmine's shoulder and SOBS.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Jasmine, have you ever thought of 
                        me as your pimp?

                                 JASMINE
                        Kind of, yeah.

                                 DENNISON
                        But I don't want to be a pimp.
                             (crying)
                        I'm sorry. This is embarrassing.

                                 JASMINE
                        Oh, sweetie. It really is.

           Dennison looks up and wipes tears out of his eyes. As he 
           does, he glances over and notices a billboard advertising 
           cigarettes; on it, a COWBOY grins as he enjoys a smoke.

           Dennison stands and his eyes go wide as it hits him.

                                 DENNISON
                        Holy ships and giggles.
                             (at cowboy in ad)
                        Got you, partner.

           Dennison runs off.

                                 JASMINE
                        Where are you going?
                                 DENNISON
                        To get a gun!

                                 JASMINE
                        Can you pick me up from the Grand 
                        Motel around midnight?

                                 DENNISON
                        I'm not your pimp, Jasmine!

                                 JASMINE
                        Well, shit.

           Jasmine stands and wanders off in search of a John.

           INT. PUBLIC SCHOOL 63 (COMMUNITY CENTER ROOM) - NIGHT

           Kevin, Erik, Hunter, and Kenley are in the middle of another 
           meeting, but this one is now taking place over a poker game, 
           and while a communal bottle of whiskey is passed around.

                                 KENLEY
                             (drinks from bottle)
                        I raise you fuckers a hundred.

                                 ERIK
                             (takes/drinks from bottle)
                        So I grab him and yell, “Are you 
                        selling me yesterday’s newspaper?” 
                        The kid literally shit his pants.

                                 HUNTER
                             (takes/drinks from bottle)
                        Newsies should be skinned alive.

           Dennison enters.

                                 DENNISON
                        Hey, jerks. Remember me?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, you’re that nurse with a 
                        pussy.

                                 DENNISON
                        Again, I am not a nurse, and I do 
                        not have female genitalia.

                                 KENLEY
                        That's exactly what a fucking nurse 
                        with a pussy would say.
                                 DENNISON
                        Whatever! Look, I'm here for one 
                        reason: I want my gun back.

                                 ERIK
                        You're not getting your gun back. 
                        Know why? Because you ain't got the 
                        balls to take it out of my pants.

                                 DENNISON
                        You still have it in your pants?

                                 ERIK
                        Been there this whole time.

                                 DENNISON
                        Why?

                                 KENLEY
                        Yeah, fucking seriously, man. Why?

                                 DENNISON
                        Know what? Doesn't matter, because 
                        I'm coming for it. Right. Now.

                                 ERIK
                             (stands)
                        Prove it... pussy.

           Dennison rushes over and shoves his hands down Erik's pants. 
           But Erik isn't giving up easily, so he too shoves his hands 
           down his own pants. He grapples with Dennison for the gun.

                                 DENNISON
                        Gimme my gun!

                                 ERIK
                        That's not your gun!

                                 DENNISON
                        Oh.
                             (readjusts hands)
                        There! Now give me my gun!

                                 ERIK
                        You're not man enough to own it!

           A SHOT rings out as Dennison yanks the gun out of Erik's 
           pants. Silence fills the room. Erik has no reaction at all.

                                 DENNISON
                        Thank god it missed you.
                                 ERIK
                        Didn't miss me.

           Slowly, blood soaks through the crotch of Erik's pants.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        You're a man now, Dennison. Take 
                        your gun and go.

                                 DENNISON
                        Someone should call you a--

                                 ERIK
                        I said go!

           Dennison exits.

           Erik sits back down. Hunter passes him the bottle of whiskey. 
           Erik CHUGS from it. Then——

                                 HUNTER
                        Can I see the wound?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DENNISON'S APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - DAY

           Colby and Madison enter.

                                 COLBY
                        Those bags can go on the counter.

           Madison places the bags on the counter as Colby opens a 
           cupboard and grabs two empty glasses.

                                 COLBY (CONT'D)
                        Now, how about that quickie?

                                 MADISON
                        Yes...

           From behind, Madison rests his hands on Colby's hips.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        ...how about it?

           Colby jerks her head backward in a quick motion, BASHING 
           Madison in the face with the back of her skull.

           Stunned, Madison stumbles backward and SMACKS the back of his 
           head on the refrigerator door.
           Now completely fucking out of it, Madison stumbles back 
           toward Colby. She takes the empty glasses she's holding and 
           SMASHES them across either side of his head, one at a time.

           Madison COLLAPSES onto the floor; blood pours out of his 
           nose, mouth, ears... and pretty much everywhere. Then——

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck was that?

                                 COLBY
                        I was gonna ask you the same thing!

                                 MADISON
                        You said you wanted a quickie.

                                 COLBY
                        Which I was preparing for us.

                                 MADISON
                        Wait, what's a quickie mean to you?

                                 COLBY
                        A quickie is a refreshing cocktail 
                        made with grapefruit juice, lime, 
                        and a splash of gin. 

                                 MADISON
                        Oh, I see. No, a quickie means 
                        fucking. Specifically, a quick 
                        fucking. Hence the name.

                                 COLBY
                        And why would I do that with you?

                                 MADISON
                        Oh, I don't know. Because I'm 
                        stunningly handsome? Because I'm an 
                        FBI agent? Because I have a badge?
                             (flashes badge)
                        You've seen it, right?

                                 COLBY
                        I have. FBI Agent Madison Packard--

                                 MADISON
                        Please, just call me Agent Packard.

                                 COLBY
                        --I apologize if you misunderstood 
                        my intentions, but I wouldn't sleep 
                        with you if my life depended on it.
                                 MADISON
                        But... why?

                                 COLBY
                        Isn't it obvious? I love Dennison.

                                 MADISON
                        But... why?

                                 COLBY
                        He's kind, sincere, and genuine. 
                        You know, everything you're not.

           As if on cue, Dennison enters.

                                 DENNISON
                        Colby! I just became a man by 
                        blowing a guy's penis off!

                                 MADISON
                             (to Colby)
                        This is who you're in love with.

                                 DENNISON
                             (noticing)
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard? What are 
                        you doing here? And what happened 
                        to your nose? And ears? And face?

                                 MADISON
                        We were about to have a quickie.

                                 DENNISON
                        Delicious!
                             (to Colby)
                        Could you make me one, too?

           Colby preps quickies as Dennison helps Madison off the floor.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Follow me.

                                 MADISON
                        Fuck off.

           Dennison exits into the——

           LIVING ROOM

                                 DENNISON
                        I know where Chaplin is!
                                 MADISON
                             (entering)
                        You do? How?

                                 DENNISON
                        Remember the cowboys we passed at 
                        the studio? Well, those same guys 
                        kidnapped Chaplin.

                                 MADISON
                        The cowboys are Nazis?

                                 DENNISON
                        One and the same. And guess who has 
                        some explaining to do.

                                 MADISON
                        Chaplin’s shitty non-friend O’Dix.

           Amazingly, Dennison and Madison both CHUCKLE at the name.

                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        Only one problem: Hoover pulled me 
                        off the case. I fly back tomorrow.

                                 DENNISON
                        Basketti fired me! This is perfect! 
                        Now we don’t have anything to lose--

                                 MADISON
                        --because we already lost it all.

                                 COLBY
                             (enters with drinks)
                        Quickies!

           They each take a glass. Dennison downs his entire glass in 
           one gulp while Madison and Colby each take a sip.

                                 MADISON
                        Mmmm. That is refreshing.

                                 DENNISON
                             (to Madison)
                        So what do you say, partner?

                                 MADISON
                        I say we go get Mr. Charles Chaplin 
                        back from those cowboy Nazis.

           Again, Dennison holds his hand up for a high-five. This time, 
           Madison SLAPS it back.
                                 MADISON (CONT'D)
                        We’re gonna need guns.

                                 DENNISON
                             (pulls out gun)
                        I got my gun back!

                                 MADISON
                        I heard. But we're gonna need more 
                        guns. Like, a lot of fucking guns.

                                 DENNISON
                        Where can we get a lot of guns?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FBI HOLLYWOOD DIVISION - NIGHT

           Dennison and Madison enter as Moses, Jerome, and Samuel flip 
           through 8" x 10" photos; specifically, Moses’ new headshots.

                                 MOSES
                             (holds up photo)
                        This one is fabulous. I look pouty, 
                        but not too pouty.

                                 JEROME
                        Definitely don’t want too pouty.

                                 MADISON
                             (re: Louis)
                        Where’s, uh... the other one?

                                 SAMUEL
                        Louis is on set tonight. That’s 
                        what we call it in the business.

           Madison and Dennison walk off. The agents follow.

                                 MOSES
                        Why are you here? Eddie said you 
                        were off the case.

           Madison stops in front of an average-looking bookcase.

                                 MADISON
                        Eddie was wrong.

           Madison pulls on the bookcase, which is hinged like a door; 
           it opens to reveal a large steel door behind it.

                                 JEROME
                        Oh my god. That always been there?
                                 MADISON
                        Every office has one. You guys 
                        didn’t know this was here?

           Madison pulls on a lever as the door opens to reveal an——

           ARMORY

           ——that’s filled with every kind of weapon/ammo known to man.

                                 MOSES
                        If we did we would’ve been tugging 
                        on that lever every single day.

                                 MADISON
                        I’d expect nothing less. Take 
                        whatever looks pretty, boys.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Chaplin still sits blindfolded in the chair as it’s now 
           revealed the building isn’t a warehouse at all: It’s a 
           soundstage. Suka and Franklin enter.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Time to go, American.

           Chaplin SNORES. Suka and Franklin look at each other.

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
                             (in German)
                        Hitler’s worried about this guy?

           EXT. METROPOLITAN PICTURES (FRONT GATE) - NIGHT

           Dennison, Madison, and the three agents quietly sneak up.

           Dennison and Madison have gone classic in their weaponry 
           (guns), but Moses, Jerome, and Samuel grabbed more colorful 
           options: a crossbow, a mace, and a sword/shield combo.

                                 MADISON
                        Be as quiet as you can.

           As they enter, Samuel’s shield CLANGS against the gate.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Sorry.
           STUDIO LOT

           Franklin and Suka carry Chaplin under his arms. He GIGGLES.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        I’m extremely ticklish.
                             (no reply)
                        I forgot: Nazis can’t laugh.
                             (still no reply)
                        It must really suck to be German.

           SOUNDSTAGE

           The five guys move across the back lot in the shadows, 
           finally coming to an intersection.

                                 MADISON
                             (to agents, pointing)
                        You guys go that way. We’ll meet on 
                        the other side of the building.

           The agents nod as the two groups split up.

           INT. ROLAND O’DIX’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Franklin and Suka toss Chaplin into a chair. They untie his 
           hands/blindfold to finally reveal the shadowy figure:

           ROLAND O’DIX!

           He sits across from Chaplin holding a phone to his ear.

                                 ROLAND
                        Surprised to see me?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Not really. You’re a producer. The 
                        fact that you’re also a Nazi isn’t 
                        that much of a stretch.
                             (looks at desk)
                        Christ. If this desk doesn’t scream 
                        “tiny dick” I don’t know what does.

                                 ROLAND
                        A jokester until the very end.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Who says this is the very end?

                                 ROLAND
                             (hands phone to Chaplin)
                        Mein Führer.
                                 CHAPLIN
                             (into phone)
                        Adolf baby! It’s already Saturday 
                        there in Deutschland, right? 
                        Shabbat shalom!

           INT. THE BERGHOF (HITLER’S OFFICE) - DAY

           Hitler sits at his desk holding a phone to his ear.

                                 HITLER
                        Last chance, Mr. Chaplin: Will you 
                        make films for me or not?

           INT. ROLAND O’DIX’S OFFICE - NIGHT

                                 CHAPLIN
                        No. Thanks for calling though.
                             (hands phone back)
                        Wait, I forgot something.
                             (takes phone back)
                        Go fuck yourself!
                             (hands phone back)
                        Thanks.

           INT. THE BERGHOF (HITLER’S OFFICE) - DAY

                                 HITLER
                             (in German)
                        Kill him.

           EXT. METROPOLITAN PICTURES (SOUND STAGE) - NIGHT

           Moses, Jerome, and Samuel make their way around the building. 
           As they approach a door, SOMEONE exits.

           Terrified, they raise their weapons. Moses SHRIEKS as he 
           accidentally FIRES off an arrow. Luckily, it misses——

                                 MOSES
                        Louis?

           Yep, it’s Louis... dressed as the wife of an Indian chief.

                                 LOUIS
                        Guys? How...?

           They CLAP for Louis, who takes an extremely proud bow.
                                 SAMUEL
                        That was very convincing.

                                 LOUIS
                        Wanna see the costume warehouse? It 
                        has more feather boas in it than 
                        Moses’ closet.

                                 MOSES
                        Bitch.

           The guys drop their weapons/responsibilities and head inside.

           BACK LOT

           Dennison and Madison round a corner and see a group of FOUR 
           MEN smoking and LAUGHING. Suddenly, one of them SAYS 
           SOMETHING in German as they part to reveal——

                                 MADISON
                        The cowboy Nazi.

                                 DENNISON
                        That little turd. You ready?
                             (Madison nods)
                        Gimme a signal when--

                                 MADISON
                             (loudly, takes off)
                        Get ‘em!

           INT. ROLAND O’DIX’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           O’Dix stands in front of Chaplin holding a gun to his head.

                                 ROLAND
                             (to Suka and Franklin)
                        Get him out of the chair.
                             (they do)
                        I want to look into his eyes as I 
                        put a bullet between them.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Wait!
                             (Roland lowers gun)
                        Before you do this, I want to be 
                        clear: you’re killing me because 
                        the leader of a country decided it 
                        was worth spending, what? Millions 
                        of dollars?
                                 ROLAND
                             (thinking)
                        Mmmm... give or take.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        They’ve spent millions of dollars 
                        to take out a guy making a stupid 
                        picture. As if Germany didn’t have 
                        better things to spend that money 
                        on, like the homeless, or children, 
                        or homeless children. Is that what 
                        you’re telling me?

                                 ROLAND
                        Precisely.

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (lifts gun to own head)
                        Well then put a bullet in my brain, 
                        because that’s the dumbest fucking 
                        thing I’ve ever heard and it’s made 
                        me lose hope for all humanity.

           A GUNSHOT goes off outside, followed by a barrage of GUNFIRE.

                                 ROLAND
                        What the hell is that?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        That’s rhetorical, right?

                                 ROLAND
                             (to Suka and Franklin)
                        Go see what’s happening. Chaplin 
                        isn’t going anywhere.

           Suka and Franklin pull out their Lugers and rush out.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        You should act, Roland. You’ve got 
                        that bad movie villain slang down.

                                 ROLAND
                        Really? You think--

           Chaplin KICKS O’Dix in the dick. As he barrels over, Chaplin 
           PUNCHES him in the head. O’Dix drops to the floor. He’s out.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        That was way too easy.
                             (picks phone off desk)
                        Better make sure.

           Chaplin lifts the phone high above his head——
           EXT. BACK LOT - NIGHT

           Madison straddles the cowboy Nazi on the ground, pistol-
           whipping his face with the butt of his gun. Dennison 
           (horribly) SHOOTS at the other Nazis, who are fleeing.

           Dennison pauses next to Madison and the cowboy Nazi.

                                 MADISON
                        Come on! They’re getting away!

           Madison gets up and chases after the Nazis.

                                 DENNISON
                        And to think I offered you a piece 
                        of my Doublemint.

           Dennison KICKS him in the ribs, then follows after Madison. 
           Suka and Franklin quietly follow them with their guns drawn.

           INT. ROLAND O’DIX’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Chaplin sets the now-bloodied phone back on the desk. Then——

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Better safe than sorry.

           He pulls his leg back to kick O’Dix——

           EXT. BACK LOT - NIGHT

           Dennison and Madison continue to give chase, but now it 
           appears as if they’ve lost the Nazis.

                                 MADISON
                        Where’d they go?

           Dennison sees SOMEONE move between two building façades.

                                 DENNISON
                             (pointing)
                        There! Between the fuck-ades!

           They run between the buildings as they enter an——

           OLD WESTERN TOWN MOVIE SET

           Dennison is clearly impressed.
                                 DENNISON
                        No way. This is what I pictured in 
                        my head as a kid. I’d imagine I was 
                        getting shot at by--

           Bullets WHIZ past their heads. They look down the dirt road 
           to find Suka and Franklin SHOOTING at them.

                                 MADISON
                        Nazis!

           They turn to flee, but the rest of the Nazis are now closing 
           in on (and SHOOTING at) them from the opposite direction.

                                 DENNISON
                        More Nazis!

           They turn and run toward a door, which Dennison KICKS open.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        Worked that time!

           More SHOTS come as bullets SPLINTER the wood around them. 
           They dive inside for cover and find themselves in another——

           SUPPLY CLOSET

           They can’t believe their fucking eyes.

                                 MADISON
                        What is it with the supply closets?

                                 DENNISON
                        Brooms. Gotta put ‘em somewhere.

           INT. ROLAND O’DIX’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Chaplin finishes up one last KICK to the ribs of O’Dix.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        That should do it.
                             (picks up O'Dix's gun)
                        Well, well, well.

           He tucks it into his waistband and exits.

           INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

           Dennison and Madison duck as more FIRE comes their way.
                                 MADISON
                        I have a plan. Remember the last 
                        time we were in the closet 
                        together?

                                 DENNISON
                        Something about that sounds wrong. 
                        But yes, I remember. You ran out, 
                        slipped on Charlie's barf, and 
                        dropped your gun.

                                 MADISON
                        Really? You have to remind me of--
                             (they take more fire)
                        Never mind! I’m gonna jump out and 
                        shoot in one direction. At the same 
                        time, you jump out and shoot in the 
                        opposite direction. Alright? So 
                        which direction do you want?

                                 DENNISON
                        Sounds like we’re gonna die either 
                        way so I don’t care. You pick.

                                 MADISON
                        Okay, I’ll go left. You go right.

                                 DENNISON
                        Got it. So if I’m facing the door--

                                 MADISON
                        Your right!

           EXT. OLD WESTERN TOWN MOVIE SET - NIGHT

           Suka and Franklin close in from one end of the road with guns 
           drawn. On the opposite end, THREE NAZIS do the same.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        You’re surrounded, policemen.

                                 MADISON (O.S.)
                        I’m a federal fucking agent!
                             (beat)
                        Not that there’s anything wrong 
                        with being a cop!

           Franklin looks at Suka and shrugs.
           INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

                                 DENNISON
                        Thanks, pal.

                                 MADISON
                        Sure thing. You ready?

                                 DENNISON
                        The real me? No. But the kid me? 
                        Heck yes.
                             (puts hand out for a shake)
                        It was a pleasure working with you, 
                        FBI Agent Madison Packard.

                                 MADISON
                             (shakes Dennison's hand)
                        I couldn’t have asked for a better 
                        partner, Detective Dennison.
                             (beat)
                        Alright, we go on three. One--

                                 DENNISON
                        Two, three!

           Dennison leaps out into the——

           EXT. OLD WESTERN TOWN MOVIE SET - NIGHT

           ——and dives into the dirt as he FIRES at Suka and Franklin 
           (with his eyes closed tight). A chaotic mishmash of GUNFIRE 
           and YELLING unfolds.

           Madison leaps out and FIRES at the three Nazis. He quickly 
           dispatches two of them, but before he can get a third kill 
           shot off he takes a bullet to the knee.

           As Dennison continues to SHOOT at Suka and Franklin, Madison 
           finally manages to SHOOT and kill the last approaching Nazi 
           on his side. Then, the shooting stops.

           Dennison slowly pries opens his eyes to find Suka and 
           Franklin still standing as they look themselves over for 
           bullet holes. There are none. Dennison didn’t hit them once.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        You are a terrible shot, American.

           They aim their Lugers at Dennison, who closes his eyes.

           A SHOT rings out as a bullet tears through Suka’s shoulder. 
           She drops to the ground; standing behind her (with smoke 
           rising out of the barrel of his gun) is Chaplin.
           Franklin turns his gun/attention back to Dennison, but he’s 
           one step ahead of him. He’s got him in his crosshairs, and 
           he’s going to end this shit right now, which is why he says——

                                 DENNISON
                        Is that right, Nazi?

           Two BULLETS tear through Franklin’s chest, but neither of 
           them comes from Dennison’s gun. One comes from Madison’s gun 
           in front of him, the other from Chaplin’s gun behind him.

           Franklin staggers as he GASPS for air. He DROPS to the dirt 
           and bleeds out into the road. He’s gone.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                             (dumbfounded)
                        I don’t believe it.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Me either! I haven’t been this hard 
                        since The Wizard of Oz Munchkins 
                        invited me to that midget orgy.

                                 MADISON
                             (limps over to Dennison)
                        I’m just glad you weren't--

                                 DENNISON
                        You guys! I had him!
                             (notices Madison’s knee)
                        And you got shot? Pour salt in the 
                        wound! A wound, I'd like to point 
                        out, that I don’t even have!

           As Dennison continues to verbally unload on Madison and 
           Chaplin, behind them, Suka’s body starts to move.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        You didn’t want us to shoot him?

                                 MADISON
                        He wanted to do it himself.. after 
                        being shot with a non-lethal round.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Ah, got it.
                             (thinks on it)
                        Wait... what?

           Dennison and Chaplin grab a hold of Madison to help him walk.

           As they walk down the road, behind them, Suka gets to her 
           feet. Injured, she limps off without anyone noticing.
                                 MADISON
                             (to Chaplin)
                        What happened to you?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        I talked to Hitler on the phone 
                        while O'Dix held me at gunpoint. 
                        Can you believe he was a Nazi?

                          MADISON
                                                         DENNISON
           Yeah.
                                               Yeah.

                                 MADISON
                        How did you escape?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        I kicked him in the dick. Works 
                        every time.

                                 DENNISON
                        Honestly, guys, the one time I’m 
                        ready, willing, and able to prove 
                        myself as a man, and you cocks 
                        block me. You’re a couple of cock-
                        blockers, that’s what you are.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Maybe you should just be happy that 
                        you're still alive.

                                 DENNISON
                        Go fudge yourself, Charlie.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        I missed you guys. Come on. Let’s 
                        finish this stupid picture already.

           The agents -- Louis, Moses, Jerome, and Samuel -- emerge from 
           between two fuck-ades. All four of them are now wearing 
           costumes: Louis is the WIFE OF AN INDIAN CHIEF; Moses is a 
           STEEL WORKER; Jerome is a MOTORCYCLIST, and Samuel is a 
           KEYSTONE COP.

           Together, they’re the 1939 version of THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.

                                 LOUIS
                        Were those gunshots we heard?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        What the fuck are you guys?
                                 AGENTS
                             (all, together)
                        Fabulous!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. THE BAVARIAN ALPS - DAY

           TITLE: OBERSALZBERG, BAVARIA, GERMANY - ONE YEAR LATER

           An Opel Blitz 3.6 (Nazi) truck drives up a winding road.

           INT. NAZI TRUCK - DAY

           A NAZI DRIVER (20s) sits behind the wheel in the cab. His 
           cargo CLANGS in the truck’s bed: giant metal film canisters.

           EXT. THE BERGHOF - DAY

           OFFICERS unload them off the truck and onto a wheeled cart.

           INT. THE BERGHOF (VARIOUS LOCATIONS) - DAY

           The cart is pushed through numerous rooms as the canisters 
           makes their way through the building, finally ending up in——

           HITLER’S OFFICE

           Hitler approaches the pile of canisters. An envelope is taped 
           to the top canister. Handwritten on it: ADOLF

           He opens the envelope and pulls out a card. Printed on it is 
           the Star of David. Hitler opens the card. Handwritten on the 
           inside: GO FUCK YOURSELF, MUSTACHE THIEF. LOVE, CHAPLIN

           He shakes with anger as he CRUMPLES the card in his hand.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT

           TITLE: OCTOBER 15TH, 1940

           The premiere is underway as a giant marquee reads: WORLD 
           PREMIERE: CHARLIE CHAPLIN’S “THE GREAT DICTATOR”

           CELEBRITIES, PRESS, and FANS alike line the entrance as limos 
           drop off ATTENDANTS at the start of the red carpet.
           First out of a car is Moses and Louis who somehow managed to 
           land roles in the film. They approach a REPORTER.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Who do you portray in the picture?

                                 LOUIS
                        I play Goebbels--

                                 MOSES
                        I’m Hermann Göring.

                                 LOUIS
                        --and we were fortunate enough to 
                        play these roles because we helped 
                        save Charlie Chaplin's life.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        In what capacity?

                           MOSES
                                                           LOUIS
                  (with jazz hands)
                                                 (with jazz hands)
           As actors!
                                               As actors!

           Further down the red carpet, Chaplin is interviewed.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        My Himmler is amazing. My Mussolini 
                        is amazing. And, of course, my 
                        Hitler is amazing. I probably 
                        shouldn’t say that, should I?

           Behind him, J. Edgar Hoover walks by with his “plus twos”: 
           Jerome and Samuel. Chaplin pulls them over to the reporters.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        I’d like you to meet FBI Director 
                        J. Edgar Hoover and his... dates?

           The press LAUGHS. Hoover sweats nervously.

           Chaplin walks off as Hoover follows him with an evil eye. 
           We're witnessing the spark of what comes years later, when 
           Hoover accuses/investigates Chaplin for being a Communist.

           Further down the line, Captain Basketti is interviewed.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        Truth be told, I didn’t even want 
                        to come tonight. Chaplin hasn’t 
                        made a quality picture in a decade.

                                 REPORTER #3
                        And who are you again?
                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                        I’m Captain Ron--

                                 REPORTER #1 (O.S.)
                        Packard is arriving!

           The reporter leaves Basketti standing there.

                                 CAPTAIN BASKETTI
                             (to himself)
                        Son of a bitch.

           Chaplin approaches a limo. Madison exits with, surprisingly, 
           Petry, the undercover agent he shot in the restaurant.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Nice suit, FBI Agent Madison 
                        Packard! Lemme guess: a Soviet 
                        burlesque dancer made it for you.

                                 MADISON
                        Close: Sears. Charlie, I’d like you 
                        to meet Agent Petry.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Good to meet you, sir. What did you 
                        have to do be Packard's plus-one 
                        tonight?

                                 PETRY
                        Come back from the dead.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Okay then! Enjoy the movie, boys.

           Chaplin approaches another limo. Dennison and Colby exit.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        Colby! My beautiful princess.

                                 COLBY
                        Flattery will get you everywhere, 
                        Mr. Chaplin.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Really? Everywhere? Details please.
                             (to Dennison, quietly)
                        You fucking your sister yet or not?

                                 DENNISON
                             (giggling)
                        Maybe.
                                 CHAPLIN
                             (slaps Dennison on back)
                        That’s my boy!
                             (glances over)
                        Ah! Clark Gable just arrived.

                                 DENNISON
                        Clark Gable?!?

           Dennison looks over to find Clark Gable stepping out of a 
           limo. Instantly, Gable is swarmed by fans and the press.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        What’s with the Clark Gable hatred?

                                 DENNISON
                        Some things are best left a 
                        mystery, Charlie.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Fair enough. I gotta get inside. 
                        You two should find your seats.

           Clark Gable approaches and puts his arm around Chaplin.

                                 CLARK GABLE
                        Congratulations, old friend.

           They walk inside together; Dennison scowls as Gable passes.

           INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER (LOBBY) - NIGHT

           Chaplin and Gable enter together to APPLAUSE. They shake 
           hands and smile as flashbulbs POP, then part ways as a wave 
           of excited THEATERGOERS enters behind them.

           Hidden amongst them is a familiar face: Suka. Her hair is a 
           different color/style, and she’s wearing a large hat to hide 
           her identity.

           She pauses, looks around, and exits the throng of people by 
           walking off to the right. Just behind her, Dennison, Colby, 
           Madison, and Petry enter the——

           THEATER

           Chaplin stands at the front as people takes their seats.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        First, I’d like to take a moment to 
                        clear something up: I am not dead.
                             (the audience laughs)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to say a few words 
                        before we get started. As many of 
                        you know, this picture had a lot of 
                        hurdles; specifically, Nazis. But 
                        it never would’ve happened if it 
                        weren’t for some special people.

           Dennison and Madison, who are sitting next to each other, 
           look at each other and smile.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        First, my parents, both of whom are 
                        long dead, but I feel deserve to be 
                        mentioned. And second, I’d like to 
                        dedicate tonight’s premiere to--

           A projector beams a portrait of Benny up on the screen.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        --my stunt double, Bernie.

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                             (correcting)
                        Benny!

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Sorry. Benny. This one’s for him.

           Dennison and Madison give each other a look: “Really?”

           Chaplin walks up the aisle toward the exit as the lights dim. 
           Dennison motions him over as he passes.

                                 DENNISON
                        You’re not gonna stay and watch?

           The title pops up on the screen: “THE GREAT DICTATOR”

                                 CHAPLIN
                        I don’t need to see it, Dennison. I 
                        lived it.

                                 MADISON
                        Really?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        No, I just have to take a shit. 
                        That okay with you guys?

           Chaplin continues up the aisle as the Big Bertha scene plays. 
           On the screen, Chaplin spins around in the gun’s bucket seat.

                                 DENNISON
                        Remember when you did that?
                                 MADISON
                        I do.

                                 DENNISON
                        It was worth it, wasn’t it?

                                 MADISON
                        It was.

           MEN’S RESTROOM

           Chaplin enters a stall, pulls down his pants, and sits on the 
           toilet to do his business.

           An OBJECT tucked beside/beneath the bowl catches Chaplin's 
           eye. He reaches down and picks it up. It's a handgun. A piece 
           of paper with writing on it is taped to its handle.

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (reading from paper)
                        If found, please return to LAPD, 
                        Hollywood Division. Attention: 
                        Detective Dennison.
                             (beat)
                        You gotta be fucking kidding me.

           Chaplin tucks the gun inside his jacket pocket.

           After a beat, the DOOR OPENS followed by the CLICK-CLACK of 
           shoes on the tile. Beneath the door, Chaplin watches as a 
           pair of high heels stops in front of the stall.

                                 CHAPLIN (CONT'D)
                        Pretty sure you’re in the wrong 
                        room, miss.

                                 SUKA
                             (in German)
                        Right room.

           She FIRES through the door——

           THEATER

           ——which is heard by everyone in the theater. Chaos unfolds.

           People SCREAM. Others are trampled as folks rush for the 
           exits. Dennison and Madison, however, jump out of their 
           seats, pull out their guns, and go to fucking work.

                                 DENNISON
                        It’s Charlie!
                                 MADISON
                        In the shitter! You coming, Petry?

                                 PETRY
                        I've already died once, thank you.

           MEN’S RESTROOM

           Now shot in the shoulder, Chaplin KICKS at the stall door. It 
           swings open hard and BASHES Suka in the face. She stumbles 
           backward as Chaplin runs out and heads for the door.

           SHOTS bury themselves into the wall next to his head as he 
           opens the door and runs out. Suka chases after him.

           THEATER

           Dennison and Madison push people aside as they move up the 
           aisle. Dennison pushes past a man, who turns and says——

                                 CLARK GABLE
                        Hey, watch it--
                             (realizing)
                        Dennison? What are you doing--

           But just as we’re about to get the answer to this mystery——

                                 DENNISON
                        Fuck you, Clark Gable!

           ——Dennison PUNCHES Clark Gable in the fucking face! Clark 
           Gable spins and falls into a row of seats.

                                 MADISON
                             (continuing up aisle)
                        Come on!

                                 DENNISON
                             (following after)
                        You see that, Madison? I just 
                        punched Clark Gable in the face!

           LOBBY

           Madison enters and catches a glimpse of Suka chasing after 
           Chaplin. Madison aims, but there are too many people.

           Chaplin runs outside, Suka pursues——

                                 MADISON
                        They’re outside, Dennison!
           ——and Madison follows.

           EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT

           Madison BURSTS through the doors and onto the red carpet with 
           his gun drawn. Standing at the curb and facing him is a 
           bloodied Chaplin, who is being held up (both physically and 
           at gunpoint) by Suka. She presses her Luger into his temple.

                                 SUKA
                        Drop it.

                                 MADISON
                             (to Chaplin)
                        She shot you?

                                 CHAPLIN
                        While taking a shit. Who does that? 
                        Oh, right. Fucking Nazis.

           Suka turns the Luger on Madison and SHOOTS twice.

           One bullet tears through Madison's clavicle, which causes him 
           to drop his gun; it skitters across the ground. The other 
           bullet buries itself deep into his side.

           Madison falls backward and slumps against the wall.

           Dennison exits with his gun drawn. He trains it on Suka, who 
           now has her Luger pointed back at Chaplin’s temple.

                                 SUKA
                        Drop it.

                                 DENNISON
                             (to Madison)
                        You got shot?

                                 MADISON
                        Yeah.

           With Suka distracted by Dennison, Madison slowly reaches 
           (with his good hand) toward a gun strapped to his shin.

                                 DENNISON
                             (to Chaplin)
                        You, too?

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (shrugs)
                        Sorry.
                                 SUKA
                             (to Dennison)
                        I said drop it!

           Amazingly, Petry exits... right at the wrong moment.

                                 PETRY
                        Is the coast clear yet, or--

           Suka SHOOTS Petry in the thigh. He DROPS to the ground.

                                 PETRY (CONT'D)
                        Here we go again!

                                 MADISON
                             (to Dennison)
                        Shoot her like she’s Clark Gable! 

                                 SUKA
                        Shut up, stupid fucking American!

                                 DENNISON
                             (struggling)
                        I can’t shoot a woman--

           Suka aims at Dennison, but before she gets a round off a SHOT 
           rings out behind him. The bullet, which came from Madison’s 
           shin gun, tears through Dennison's shoulder. He falls to his 
           knees. Because of this, Suka’s SHOT passes above his head.

           Confused by what in the fuck is happening, Suka FIRES another 
           shot at Dennison, but it misses its kill mark and instead 
           buries itself into Dennison’s left forearm.

           As Dennison continues his fall to the ground, he FIRES one 
           shot. It finds its mark in the middle of Suka's forehead.

                                 DENNISON (CONT'D)
                        --but I can shoot a Nazi woman.

           Suka’s dead body falls into the gutter. Chaplin, who is 
           unable to stand on his own, falls with her.

           Five bodies —— four alive, one dead —— bleed out onto the red 
           carpet. No one moves for a beat. Then——

                                 PETRY
                        Is this Heaven? Grandma? That you?

           Dennison reaches his hand out to Madison. Madison grabs it.

                                 DENNISON
                        You shot me, pal. Thanks.
           LATER

           Flashing lights flood the street as MEDICS wheel Dennison, 
           Madison, Chaplin, and Petry on stretchers to ambulances.

                                 PETRY
                        Madison, promise me that you'll 
                        take care of my wife and kids.

                                 MADISON
                        I'll raise them as if I were their 
                        real father. Because I am.

           MEDICS lift Petry into an ambulance——

                                 PETRY
                        Thank you, Madison.
                             (realizing)
                        Wait... what now?

           ——and close the doors. The ambulance pulls off.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        He gonna die?

                                 MADISON
                        Eventually. Just not today.

                                 DENNISON
                        Once we’re all healed up, Colby and 
                        I are gonna have you both over for 
                        dinner and a quickie.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        Deal!

                                 MADISON
                        It's not what you think it is.
                             (to Dennison)
                        Here we are bleeding out, and 
                        you’re talking about hosting dinner 
                        parties? You got some balls on you.

                                 DENNISON
                        You’d be amazed by the balls on me.

                                 MADISON
                        We already are, Dennison.

           MEDICS lift Madison into an ambulance and close the doors. 
           They BANG on the side as it takes off, its SIREN blaring.
                                 CHAPLIN
                        Dennison, I forgot to tell you--
                             (pulls gun out of jacket)
                        --I found your gun in the bathroom!

                                 DENNISON
                        No way! Why didn't you use it to 
                        shoot that Nazi lady?

                                 CHAPLIN
                             (realizing)
                        Motherfucker! Eh, know what? I 
                        probably would've accidentally 
                        killed myself in the process. 

           Medics lift Dennison into an ambulance.

                                 DENNISON
                        I thought you were already dead.

           The medics close the door on Dennison’s ambulance and BANG on 
           the side. It takes off down the street, its SIREN blaring.

           As medics lift Chaplin into an ambulance he looks up at the 
           marquee and stares at the movie's title in lights. He smiles.

                                 CHAPLIN
                        All of this for a stupid picture.

           The medics close the doors and BANG on the side. It takes off 
           down the street, its SIREN blaring.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           TITLE: WASHINGTON, D.C. - SEPTEMBER 25TH, 1945

           Once again, Harold Strange walks with a binder under his arm.

           WAITING ROOM

           He enters and walks past the same shrew of a secretary.

                                 SECRETARY
                        He prefers people to--

           Strange enters——
                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Knock! Just once! Please!

           ——and tosses the binder onto Hoover’s desk.

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        The final report on Chaplin.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        It took five years to write it up?

                                 HAROLD STRANGE
                        We had better things to do, Edgar. 
                        Like win World War II.

           Hoover slides the binder into a trash can next to his desk.

                        Speaking of WWII, this just came in 
                        from our agents in Buenos Aires.

                                 J. EDGAR HOOVER
                        Buenos Aires? What's going on in--

           EXT. SOUTH AMERICAN COAST - NIGHT

           TITLE: LAS GRUTAS, ARGENTINA

           A FISHERMAN (30s) and his SON (16) wait in silence/boredom 
           with fishing rods in the calm waters of the South Atlantic. 
           Suddenly, the water around them BUBBLES. A U-boat surfaces.

           The father FIRES up the engine and takes off. The U-boat’s 
           hatch opens and a man climbs out: Adolf Hitler. He smiles. 
           After a beat, he looks down into the hatch.

                                 HITLER
                             (in German)
                        I don’t know how to swim.

           A life jacket is thrown up to him. He catches it.

                                 HITLER (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

                                          THE END
