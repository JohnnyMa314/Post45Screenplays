           The Black List was compiled from the suggestions of over 250 film executives, each of whom 
           contributed the names of up to ten of her favorite scripts that were written in, or are 
           somehow uniquely associated with, 2016 and will not have begun principal photography 
           during this calendar year.

           This year, scripts had to receive at least six mentions to be included on the Black List.

           All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.

           The Black List apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation 
           identification, and questionable 2016 affiliations.

           It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating:

           The Black List is not a “best of” list. It is, at best, a “most liked” list.

           The more we’re governed by idiots and have no control over our own destinies, 
            the more we need to tell stories to each other about who we are, why we are, 
                                  where we come from, and what might be possible.
