           EXT. SOMEWHERE - DUSK

           The back of a LITTLE GIRL’S HEAD. Part down the middle, 
           golden pigtails on each side. She’s on a bicycle. Riding 
           fast. We see her breath drift ahead in a vapor. She PANTS. 

           It’s magic hour--crisp; different shades of wintery blues. 
           The girl rides on. A neighborhood sinks on the horizon, tips 
           of roofs and chimneys. We stay LOCKED on the back of her 
           head. Through the tall grass, over a small bridge, into a 
           park with bare trees. The FOG is just beginning to descend. 

           A path stretches out before her. She pedals onward. Past 
           benches and water fountains and more naked trees. No one else 
           in sight. Then suddenly, she SLOWS...

           The path breaks off into a fork, each side identical to the 
           other. She BREATHES HARD. Little head turns from one 
           direction to the next. She BREATHES HARDER. Which way to go? 

           Finally, she makes her choice. Veers off to the right. We are 
           no longer locked to the back of her head. We stay still. Let 
           her go on without us. Watch as she shrinks into a small speck 
           in the distance, engulfed by wood and fog. 

           Long, lonely beat.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           Then, AGONIZING SCREAMS--

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           A WOMAN in the throws of childbirth. Her SCREAMS are near 
           unbearable. DOCTOR and NURSES rally around her. One nurse 
           right at her side: ALLISON ADAMS, but we’ll call her NURSE 
           ALLISON (34), sharp, plain-pretty. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        I want you to give me another big 
                        push, Holly. On three, okay? One, 
                        two...THREE. 

           The woman GROANS, gives another agonizing push. Holds 
           Allison’s hand for dear life. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Holly. You can do this. 
                        You’re right there. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        She’s crowning.
           The woman locks eyes with Allison. Pleads with her. Allison 
           holds her gaze, gives a firm nod. Another giant push. She 
           SCREAMS, PANTS. That WET EXPELLING SOUND. It’s finally over. 
           But then...an unwelcome silence. 

           Allison looks to the doctor. He’s gone pale as powder. She 
           looks from his face to his hands as he lifts-- 

           a limp, BLOODY FETUS. Several months premature. Dead. 

                                 PREGNANT WOMAN
                        What’s wrong? My baby! What’s 
                        wrong!?

           She WAILS. Grief stricken, the doctor hands the fetus to one 
           of the nurses. She wraps it like a burrito; pink alien head 
           disappearing under a towel. More unbearable SCREAMS. 

           PUSH IN ON ALLISON, ill, pure horror--

                                                                CUT TO:

           SAME

           Only this time: REALITY. The doctor places a perfectly crying 
           baby in the arms of the new mother. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        You have a beautiful, healthy 
                        little boy. 

           Nurse Allison leans in, bright smile.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Congratulations. 

           INT. HOSPITAL, LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison gathers her things from her locker. Another 
           nurse, PATTI, does the same.

                                 PATTI
                        Erwin? That’s just child abuse 
                        right there. I mean, Erwin? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        “Er” for short?

           Patti cracks up. 
                                 PATTI
                        I’d invite you down to the cantina 
                        with us, but I already know what 
                        the answer is.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Good night, Patti. Have fun.

                                 PATTI
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

           Allison sets her nurses badge in her locker. It reads: 
           ALLISON ADAMS. She closes the door. Pensive beat. 

           OFF HER FACE, depressed; troubled--

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Fog rolls through a Michael Myers-y street. Few lights on. 

           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           It’s dark. Quiet. Still. A water droplet falls from the tap.

           The back door opens, PANIC arriving in the form of ALLISON 
           ADAMS. Another Allison. We’ll call her CHEERLEADER ALLISON 
           (16), gorgeous, brink of womanhood. She vibrates, rushes to 
           the sink. Fills her mouth with water from the tap. Spits. 
           She’s crying. Shaking. Whole body chilled to the bone.

           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Cheerleader Allison quivers her way up the darkened stairs. 

           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

           She tip-toes past a room, light streaming out under the door.

           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           She enters, flips on the light. Still very much the room of a 
           little-girl-fairy-princess. She rushes into--

           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, ADJOINED BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Dry-heaves over the toilet. Long trail of spit. She cries. 

           Fumbles with the shower tap. Runs a hand along her bare leg.
           She sits fetal position on the shower floor as the hot water 
           consumes her. SOBS like a small, terrified child.

           A KNOCK on the bathroom door. 

                                 WENDY (ALLISON’S MOM) (O.S.)
                        Allison? Honey? Are you okay? 

           More SOBS. Deeper, guttural. 

                                 WENDY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Allison? What’s wrong?

           The door knob JIGGLES. Locked.

                                 WENDY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Allison, let me in. Allison!

           But she can’t move. She’s frozen--catatonic. STEAM envelops 
           as she can’t quite seem to get warm. Knob JIGGLES violently. 

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           A trail of smoke from the toaster. Something BURNS. We see 
           the quintessential 50’s diner in its silvery reflection.  

                                 DINER ALLISON (O.S.)
                        Ah, shit. 

           Another ALLISON ADAMS: DINER ALLISON (49), large-and-in-
           charge black woman, stands up from her gossip mag. Goes to 
           the toaster, hits eject as charred toast POPS. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What’d I say, Allison? This is 
                        exactly why you don’t read none of 
                        that shit, Allison. Go on lose your 
                        goddamn mind, Alli-- 

           She stops dead. Noticing something on the toaster. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        What the hell?

           She leans down for closer inspection. DING. She spins to the 
           front door-- 

           a flustered BUSINESS MAN stands in the doorway. Blood on his 
           shirt and hands.

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        I think I just hit an animal. 
           EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

           Diner Allison follows the business man out to his car. 
           Headlights glow on the body of a small deer wriggling in a 
           bloody heap. It’s alive. Barely. 

                                 BUSINESS MAN
                        It just came out of nowhere. It’s a 
                        baby one, right? Is there someone 
                        we should call? 

           BANG! Allison shoots the deer in the head. 

                                 BUSINESS MAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Watch where you’re going now on. 

           She brushes past him, back up the road to the diner. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Always fixing other people’s 
                        problems, Allison. Goddamn blood 
                        all over your nice new shoes. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The TV plays quietly. KIM (60’s), sits on the sofa, little 
           boy fast asleep on her lap: HARRY (6). She strokes his hair. 
           The front door opens and Nurse Allison enters, deflated.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Why isn’t he in bed?

                                 KIM
                        He was scared. Thought there was a 
                        bad guy outside. He watches too 
                        much TV, Allie.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                             (re: the playing TV)
                        Yeah. Right. 

           She goes into the kitchen, washes her hands. 

                                 KIM
                        I did that pile of dishes in the 
                        sink. You’re almost out of soap. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Mom, you can go. I’ll put him to 
                        bed. 
                                 KIM
                        Oh, I don’t mind. Really. How was 
                        work?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Mom. I’m exhausted. 

                                 KIM
                        Okay. Alright. I’ll get out of your 
                        hair.

           She starts to gather her things. A snippet of news broadcast 
           suddenly catches our attention:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR 
                        ...where 9 year-old Allison Adams 
                        disappeared on Thursday. The young 
                        girl was on a bike-ride to a 
                        friend’s house, but never arrived. 

           The smiling face of a BRIGHT-EYED BLONDE GIRL fills the 
           screen. Title underneath reads: MISSING! ALLISON ADAMS.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        Police are seeking anyone who may 
                        have seen Allison after...

                                 KIM
                        Well, that’s weird. That just sent 
                        a chill through my spine. 

           Nurse Allison stands in the doorway, eyes on the TV.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        That’s so crazy. 

                                 KIM
                        My mommy heart is racing. 

           ON NURSE ALLISON studying the little girl’s face.

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Blue light flickers from the TV. Same News Broadcast plays in 
           the B.G. We PAN through the room across neat stacks of 
           recycling: bottles, take-out boxes, piles of mail. We catch 
           the name on several envelopes: ALLISON ADAMS, water and 
           power. ALLISON ADAMS, cable bill. ALLISON ADAMS, disability 
           check. We PAN away from the wall to-- 

           a single armchair in the center of the room. A woman sits 
           watching TV.
           This is, yet, another ALLISON ADAMS: HERMIT ALLISON (68), bug-
           eyed and ghost-white. She eats peaches out of a can. Long, 
           black branches stretch out on the wall behind her--a home-
           made mural of some kind of tree.

           The face of 9 year-old Allison Adams flashes across the TV. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...bicycle was found in a park not 
                        far from the girl’s home. Police 
                        are urging parents in the area to 
                        keep an extra eye on their children 
                        as it is not yet clear if Adams 
                        was, in fact, abducted... 

           Hermit Allison cranes to look at the front door behind her: 
           four additional locks, all bolted shut. She turns back to the 
           TV, eats another slice of peach. Slow, careful chews. 

           MISSING ALLISON’S MOM (30’s) appeals to the camera now:

                                 MISSING ALLISON’S MOM
                        Please, if you have our little 
                        girl, give her back. She’s a very 
                        sweet and loving little girl. 
                        Please. Just drop her off somewhere 
                        even. We won’t come after you. We 
                        just really want her to come home. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison tucks her sleeping son under the covers. Plugs 
           in a smiley face night-light. She sits edge of the bed, 
           watches him sleep; his little chest moving up and down. 

           Her eyes drift up to the window above the bed. Blackness 
           looks back in. Allison stares out, searching.

           A beat. She switches off the bedside lamp. 

           DARKNESS. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A school right out of the movies. Bundled up kids pour out 
           after a long day. Somewhere, cheerleaders are CHANTING...

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - DAY 

           Cheerleader practice. A dozen or so GIRLS mid-cheer routine. 
           Perfectly choreographed. Cheerleader Allison is among them.
                                 CHEERLEADERS
                        Hop Left, Hop Right, who’s the team 
                        with all that might? Hop Up, Hop 
                        Down, you’re the boys who rule this 
                        town. Gooooooooooo Rabbits! 

           Cheerleader Allison notices a cute boy in a basket ball 
           jersey standing in the gym doorway. This is MICHAEL (16). She 
           smiles, shyly. Returns to her cheer. He’s smitten.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL, QUAD - DAY

           Cheerleader Allison fusses with things in her locker. Michael 
           lingers beside her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You bailed pretty fast last night. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Yeah, sorry. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s okay. I mean, I was bummed, 
                        but...
                             (beat)
                        So. What are you doing after 
                        school?

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        As in...after school right now 
                        or...? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Right now.

           His hand awkwardly brushes her’s on the locker door. She 
           looks at him. Smiles. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Hmmm. Tough question. A) I could go 
                        home, help my mom with dinner.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Uh-huh...

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        B) I could go to Marissa’s, work on 
                        T-shirts for the game.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay. And C?
                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Finish homework. I have a lot of 
                        homework that needs finishing. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        And what about D? I vote for D. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        D.
                             (flirty beat)
                        None of the above.

           He laughs. Loops a finger through her’s. Real cute. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I think you’re pretty cool, Allison 
                        Adams.

           She smiles, butterflies. Both more scared than they let on. 

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Diner Allison stands behind the counter on the land-line. A 
           handful of customers eat at tables. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Mhmm, yeah, I know. I’ve been on 
                        the line with Animal Control all 
                        morning. Yeah, that’s what I’m 
                        saying. No, no, you’re not 
                        listening to me. I’ve got a dead 
                        animal carcass on my hands and 
                        I’ve...no I will not hold. Are you 
                        kidding me? 

           She hangs up, exasperated. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        What’d I say, Allison? I don’t know 
                        why you bother. What did I say?

           She grabs a pot of coffee and busies herself refilling 
           customer’s mugs. 

           DING. A woman enters, perm, string of pearls: AUNT SARAH 
           (40’s), lingers in the entry. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Sit anywhere you like, baby. Menus 
                        are on the table.
                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Oh, no. I’m...I was wondering if I 
                        could speak with the manager. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        You from Animal Services? I’ve been 
                        waiting all day for you to show up.

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Uh, no. I’m here with these.

           She holds up a sheet of paper--the MISSING POSTER for 9 year-
           old Allison Adams. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        What is that? Lemme see that. 

           She comes over, looks at the poster. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        This some kinda joke?

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        What? No. I wish it was. That’s my 
                        niece. She’s been missing since 
                        last night. 

           Her voice quivers. Diner Allison takes her in. 

                                 AUNT SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I thought maybe...

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Absolutely. I’ll put it up myself. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Thank you. 

           Diner Allison goes behind the counter, retrieves some tape.

                                 AUNT SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Cute place here. I’ve always wanted 
                        to try it. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        You want some coffee? Pie? On the 
                        house. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Oh, no. I need to be going. 

           Diner Allison tapes the sign to one of the front glass doors.
                                 DINER ALLISON
                        You sure?

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Yeah. No, I’m fine. Thank you.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Someone take her?

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        I don’t know. We don’t know. Just 
                        trying to get the word out. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Beautiful little girl.

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        She is. She’s very special. Very 
                        loved.

           Aunt Sarah starts to cry. Diner Allison watches, 
           uncomfortable. A beat. She goes in to give an awkward hug.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        There, there. It’s okay. Let it 
                        out.

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Don’t you be sorry. You just gotta 
                        cry. You won’t be any help to her 
                        with all that bottled up inside. 

           Aunt Sarah cries even harder. Diner Allison holds her. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        There, there. You let it out, now.
                             (beat)
                        She’s got my name, you know?

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        What?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Allison Adams. First and last. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Really? Are you serious?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Bet she’s a little fighter. 
                                 AUNT SARAH
                        That’s so...weird. Cosmic. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        That’s why I thought it was a joke 
                        when you...anyway, you sure you 
                        don’t want any coffee?

           Aunt Sarah pulls away. Heads for the door. 

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        No. I have to put up more posters. 
                        Thank you. Thank you, you’ve been 
                        very kind. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Alright.

                                 AUNT SARAH
                        Thanks again. Allison. 

           She leaves. Diner Allison steps up to the poster. Studies it 
           backwards through the light. Heavy heart. OFF HER FACE--

           INT/EXT. NURSE ALLISON’S CAR, MOVING - DAY

           Nurse Allison drives to work. Listens to a MEDITATION TAPE:

                                 SOOTHING MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        ...pure visualization. Embrace 
                        clarity of mind. Release all 
                        tension. Experience what is your 
                        natural state of being. Breathe in 
                        through your nose and release a 
                        slow, steady stream through the 
                        mouth. Aaaaaah.

           Nurse Allison obeys. Big inhale and exhale. 

                                 SOOTHING MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        I want you to picture yourself in a 
                        boat. On a river. With tangerine 
                        trees and marmalade skies. 

           Allison stops. Leans in: what the...

                                 SOOTHING MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Somebody calls you. You answer, 
                        quite slowly. 

           Suddenly, she looks up. SLAMS ON HER BREAKS! Inches away from 
           colliding with a POLICEMAN. She gasps. He’s right in front of 
           her car, redirecting traffic into a different lane. 
           Outside, traffic’s jammed. POLICE CARS block off several 
           lanes, including the entrance to the PARK. Up the wooded 
           embankment, VOLUNTEERS and OFFICERS are combing through the 
           area. Yellow tape, squad cars; A SEARCH PARTY underway.

           Allison practices breathing. She pulls slowly past, eyes a 
           lamp-post transformed into a shrine for the missing girl: 
           candles, flowers, hand-made cards. WORRIED CITIZENS huddle 
           around it. 

           Allison watches as a THIN MAN in a CHECKERED JACKET sets a 
           PURPLE TEDDY-BEAR against the post. The teddy has a big smile 
           and one winking eye. The man continues on his way.

           An officer waves for Allison to keep moving and she drives 
           on, spooked. 

                                 SOOTHING MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Look for the girl with the sun in 
                        her eyes. And she’s gone. 

           INT. HOSPITAL, NURSES STATION - DAY

           A quieter day on the floor. Nurse Allison sits behind the 
           counter flipping through a gossip magazine. A MALE NURSE 
           arrives.

                                 MALE NURSE 
                        How’s Ms. Bloomberg doing in two? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                             (doesn’t look up)
                        Fast asleep, finally. And don’t you 
                        dare wake her up.

                                 MALE NURSE
                        Good. When you get a chance, Mr. 
                        Ivers needs a change over in seven.  

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Already? I just changed it. 

                                 MALE NURSE
                        Well, it’s full again. I just 
                        checked.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Okay. I’ll get to it in a minute.

                                 MALE NURSE
                        I’m going downstairs. You want 
                        anything? 
                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No, thanks. 

                                 MALE NURSE
                        Don’t forget, okay?

           She looks up, annoyed. He gives a cheeky smile; heads down 
           the hall. Allison returns to her magazine. Sighs. Flips 
           through several more pages.

           A SHADOW moves in over her. Someone hovering above the 
           counter.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        I’m gonna do it, just give me--

           She looks up. But it’s not the male nurse--

           A THIN MAN, (50’s) looks down on her, piercing eyes, harelip 
           scar. He fidgets, odd energy. Familiar checkered jacket. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Sorry. Can I help you? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I hope so. 

           His eye contact is severe; unwavering. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        What can I do for you?

                                 THIN MAN
                        I think I might need to see a 
                        doctor. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Okay. Can I have your name?

                                 THIN MAN
                        Are you a doctor? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No. I’m a nurse. I’ll need to take 
                        down your name so...

           He sets a large plastic water bottle on the counter--dark, 
           orangey liquid slushing inside. She eyes it, warily.  

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        What insurance provider are you 
                        with?
                                 THIN MAN
                        No one. I’m...I’m afraid I might be 
                        dying.  

           Allison looks at him, uneasy. The air shifts. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Sir, I’m gonna need some 
                        information from you. 

                                 THIN MAN
                             (abrupt, aggressive)
                        I just need you to help me! Please.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        That’s what I’m trying to do, sir.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Sorry. I know. I’m sorry. It’s 
                        just, I’m real scared. I’m pissing 
                        out blood. Does that seem normal?

           Allison looks to the water bottle. Small protein chunks 
           float. Sick. She looks around--no other nurses on the floor. 
           She turns back to him. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Nurse Allison ushers the Thin Man into the room.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        You can wait in here. The doctor 
                        will be in with you shortly.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Thank you so much. I’m pretty 
                        scared. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Well, try to stay calm. He’ll be in 
                        with you soon.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Are you gonna poke me with one of 
                        those needles?

           She looks at him. Tentative beat.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        We’ll just see what the doctor 
                        says, okay?
                                 THIN MAN
                        Needles give me the heebee-geebees. 
                        I hate hospitals. 

           He laughs, awkwardly. Allison forces a smile. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Well, you’re in good hands.

                                 THIN MAN
                        I know.

           He smiles. She turns back out into the hall, leery. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Nurse Allison?

           She stops. Reluctantly turns back to him.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Yeah?

                                 THIN MAN
                        I wouldn’t mind it, if you had to. 
                        With the needles. I know you’d just 
                        be doing your job. 

           She forces a much less convincing smile and leaves the room. 

           INT. HOSPITAL, NURSES STATION - DAY

           Nurse Allison waits behind the counter, on edge. DOCTOR 
           LIVELY (40’s), male approaches from down the hall.

                                 DOCTOR LIVELY
                        You paged me?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                             (hushed)
                        Yeah, I’ve got a guy over in one. 
                        He says he’s got blood in his 
                        urine. He’s...there’s something 
                        weird with--

                                 MALE NURSE
                             (coming around the corner)
                        You say you put him in one?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Yeah. 

                                 MALE NURSE
                        He’s not there.
                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        What?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Nurse Allison, Doctor Lively and the male nurse enter. No 
           sign of the Thin Man. 

                                 MALE NURSE
                        Maybe he went to the bathroom? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No, he would’ve had to pass by the 
                        desk. 

           She looks down the hall to a door marked EXIT just as it’s 
           closing. She looks back inside the room-- 

           Draped over the back of a chair is the man’s CHECKERED 
           JACKET. She stares at it, unnerved. Chilled to the bone. 

           EXT. FOX RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Lights glow inside. Classic John Hughes’ clapboard.

           INT. FOX RESIDENCE, MICHAEL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Cheerleader Allison and Michael sit opposite each other on 
           his bed. Safe distance between the two. Small TV flickers on 
           mute in the B.G. The mood is somehow melancholy. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You have beautiful eyes.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Stop it. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I mean it. They’ve got like ten 
                        different colors in them. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Thanks. 

           A staring game. He’s eager, she’s playing it cool.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wanna know things about you.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        What do you wanna know? 
                                 MICHAEL
                        I dunno. Your dreams. Your fears. 
                        Favorite color. Middle name... 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        We should be studying. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We have our whole lives to study. 

           She looks at him, another shy smile. Looks down.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        It’s Eleanor. My middle name.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s beautiful. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        It’s boring. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Nothing about you is boring. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        You’re too sweet to me. It’s weird. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do you want me to be meaner? 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        ...no. 

           They look at each other. A kiss feels inevitable. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        What time is it?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It doesn’t matter. 

           He leans in a little closer. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s not a school night. 

           She inches a little closer too. They’re both scared to death; 
           hormones racing.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Michael, I wanna get in trouble. I 
                        wanna go to the dentist and hear 
                        that I have a cavity. I wanna get a 
                        speeding ticket and cry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON (CONT'D)
                        I wanna fail on a test because I 
                        was up too late the night before 
                        with a boy. Those are some of my 
                        dreams, Michael.

           It’s a vulnerable, perfect moment. He leans in. They kiss. 
           After a beat, they pull away. Look at each other, flustered. 
           That was enough for now. A truly perfect moment. 

           EXT. FOX RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Cheerleader Allison climbs down the trellis outside Michael’s 
           window. She reaches the ground, spins toward the street when--

           BAM! She nearly runs head-long into a MAN waiting on the 
           grass. She gasps, covers her mouth. The man is MR. FOX 
           (40’s), bearded, kinda handsome. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Mr. Fox. Sorry, I--

                                 MR. FOX
                        You two have fun up there? 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        We were just studying. I’m sorry, 
                        we should’ve--

                                 MR. FOX
                        Relax, Allison. I’m not mad. I just 
                        came out here to fix one of these 
                        damn sprinkler heads. Good thing I 
                        turned them off when I did or else 
                        you would’ve got all soaked. 

           She laughs, awkwardly. Girlish. The tension is palpable. 

                                 MR. FOX (CONT’D)
                             (then, remembering)
                        Oh, you gotta let me give you a 
                        hug. 

           He comes in, wraps his arms around her. She holds her breath.

                                 MR. FOX (CONT’D)
                        Little girl disappeared right here 
                        in town and you know what her name 
                        was? 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Yeah, I saw it on the news. Same 
                        name as me. 
                                 MR. FOX
                        I almost had a heart attack when I 
                        heard it on the radio. Had to give 
                        you a hug.

           He releases her. She bites her lip, holds herself for warmth. 

                                 MR. FOX (CONT’D)
                        It’s a cold night.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Yeah. I should be getting home. 

                                 MR. FOX
                        Want me to give you a ride? 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Oh, no thank you. I’m fine. It’s 
                        just around the corner. 

                                 MR. FOX
                        That was a nice little moment we 
                        had last night. Short, but sweet.

           He strokes her face. She swallows. Her eyes flit back up to 
           Michael’s window. HEART POUNDING. Wants and doesn’t want it.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Well, I should probably go, Mr. 
                        Fox. Thanks for...

           His hand lingers. Another kiss might be in order, but--she 
           pulls back, turns. Steps away into the nighttime FOG. 

           EXT. SHED BEHIND DINER - NIGHT

           Low timber of an OWL HOOT. We PUSH IN on the small shed 
           window: 

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           A make-shift gym. A small TV flickers in the corner: The 
           Discovery Channel plays. Waves smash against jagged rocks.  

           Diner Allison stands in a wife beater, perfecting bicep curls 
           with 20lb weights. She stares ahead, intent; focused. Working 
           out aggression. She GRUNTS. Sweat drips down her brow. She 
           pumps up and down, up and down. GROWLS ahead.

           We SPIN AROUND to the wall across from her--big, blank wall 
           where a mirror used to be. Now, only shards of glass in the 
           corners, splintered off from the missing bigger piece.
           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison sits opposite her 6 year-old son, Harry. They 
           eat TV dinners. He’s cute; precocious. TV plays quietly in 
           the living room. 

                                 HARRY
                        Mom, you know what?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        What?

                                 HARRY
                        You make the best dinners.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Thank you. I’ll be sure to tell the 
                        people over at Stouffers. 

                                 HARRY
                        Who’s that?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Make sure you eat all your peas. 
                             (then)
                        How was school today?

                                 HARRY
                        Ugh! Mom! That’s what grown-ups 
                        always ask kids.

           He’s dramatic. Throwing his hands on the table. A funny kid. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        You’re right. 

                                 HARRY
                        It’s like, I don’t wanna talk about 
                        school and math and stuff. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Okay. What do you wanna talk about, 
                        then?

                                 HARRY
                        Like, Pokémon or connects or Power 
                        Rangers Dino Super Charge. That 
                        kinda stuff. And mom, you know 
                        what?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        What?
                                 HARRY
                        I can read four...no, five books 
                        now! 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Five whole books?! All by yourself? 
                        I don’t believe it!  

                                 HARRY
                        I can. That’s almost six. 

           She takes him in. Smiles. Emotion brims. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        What? Why are you looking at me 
                        like that? Mom! 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Nothing. I’m just a lucky lady, 
                        that’s all. 

                                 HARRY
                        Why?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Because. I have a pretty 
                        spectacular life. 

           She watches him. They continue eating. 

                                 HARRY
                        I ATE ALL MY PEAS!

           He throws up his hands, triumphantly.

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison and Harry cuddled in bed. She reads to him from 
           a “Choose Your Own Adventure” kids book. He’s enraptured.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        “You look down at your hands. 
                        Small, slimy scales are blistering 
                        across your fingers. ‘Oh no,’ you 
                        cry. ‘I’m running out of time!’ The 
                        sun has all but disappeared behind 
                        a swirl of black clouds and you can 
                        already hear the distant rumble of 
                        thunder. ‘It’s now or never,’ you 
                        say aloud.” 

           Nurse Allison snaps to Harry, dramatic wide mouth. He covers 
           his mouth with equal drama. 
                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        “If you brave the storm to reach 
                        the island, turn to page 71. If you 
                        dive into the depths of the sea to 
                        join the merpeople, turn to page 
                        31.”

                                 HARRY
                             (excitedly)
                        Merpeople! 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Okay.

           She flips to find the page.

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - LATER

           A very sleepy Harry now tucked under the covers. Nurse 
           Allison plugs in his night-light. Strokes his hair. She 
           gathers up a few toys strewn across the floor and suddenly 
           stops at the sight of something--

           the PURPLE BEAR with the winking face--the same one she saw 
           the Thin Man leave at the lamp-post. It lies haphazardly in a 
           corner. 

           Allison slowly moves toward it, transfixed; terror rising. 
           She picks it up. Examines it. Goes to her son.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Harry. Harry, where did you get 
                        this? 

                                 HARRY
                             (sleepily)
                        What?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        This bear. Where did it come from?

                                 HARRY
                        The man gave it to me...before nana 
                        picked me up from school. 

           All hairs stand on end. Her mind races. Her eyes drift up to 
           the window--

           BAM! The THIN MAN’S face right there, looking in! Allison 
           SCREAMS. He takes off as soon as she’s seen him. 

           Harry startles in bed. Allison grabs him, cradles him.
                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Oh my god. Oh my god!

           Mother and son huddle in his room, vulnerable and terrified. 

           INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Diner Allison takes a long swig of water, workout nearly 
           through. 

           Behind her, the TV in the corner drifts from beaches to SNOW. 
           STATIC FUZZ. A weird HUM suddenly vibrates, almost like it’s 
           picking up another signal. Allison snaps to look: What the 
           hell? She puts down the bottle and walks over--leans down to 
           inspect. BANGS on the side. More STATIC, worse than before.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Piece of shit. 

           She BANGS again. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           A rattled Cheerleader Allison walks the quiet streets. It’s 
           cold. Her BREATH trails ahead in a cloud.

           A BRANCH BREAKS behind her. She spins to look--NOTHING. Just 
           street and darkness. She trudges on, picking up pace. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nurse Allison switches off Harry’s bedside lamp. She and 
           Harry crawl across the floor to where her cellphone sits on 
           his dresser. 

           She snatches it up. 

           INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Diner Allison hunches in front of the TV. She BANGS the side 
           of it again--that weird, HIGH-PITCHED HUM. Then, the picture 
           starts to flicker back on, distorted. No longer crashing 
           waves. She leans in for a closer look, something’s 
           appearing...

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        What the hell?
           EXT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cheerleader Allison arrives at her house on high-alert. She 
           hurries to the side door, fiddles with her keys. 

           ANOTHER SOUND. She turns--can’t quite make anything out in 
           the dim street lights behind her. She fiddles some more with 
           the keys. Hands shaking. 

           INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Diner Allison stares, transfixed--

           ON THE TV: Fuzzy lines run through VIDEO FOOTAGE of a FRONT 
           DOOR shot from the inside. Newspaper covers each pane of 
           glass, blocking out daylight. Stained, carpeted floor. Long, 
           STATIC SHOT. 

           What the fuck? Allison studies it, furrowed brow. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nurse Allison sits on the floor, phone to ear.

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        911, what’s your emergency? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                             (whispering)
                        There’s a man outside my window. 

           EXT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cheerleader Allison finds the right key and lets herself 
           inside. She locks the door quickly behind her. Looks out one 
           last time into the darkness. 

           INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS

           ON THE TV: STATIC FUZZ returns, starting to blur out the 
           front door image. 

           Diner Allison BANGS again on its side. The Discovery program 
           returns, front door image gone as quickly as it came. Allison 
           stares at it, perplexed. Slightly shaken. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...nothing but the big expanse of 
                        ocean; the troubles of land a world 
                        away.
           A single boat sails across a glassy sea. Tranquil. Free. The 
           calm after the storm.

           ON ALLISON, drawn in by it. Captivated by the stillness.

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison sits on the couch, Harry on her lap. She’s 
           rattled; disoriented. A female officer, CHERYL MOODY (30’s), 
           sits opposite, interviewing. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        And you’re sure it was the same 
                        man?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Yes. He was at my work and then the 
                        memorial before that. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Memorial? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Not memorial...the, what do you 
                        call it? By the park, for Allison 
                        Adams. I saw him put the bear next 
                        to the flowers and candles. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        The same bear he gave to your son?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Yes. I mean, I...I don’t know. I’m 
                        assuming it’s the same. I was 
                        distracted by...there’s this tape 
                        I’ve been listening to in the car 
                        and the voice was saying...it 
                        was...

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Voice?

           A MALE OFFICER enters from outside, looks to Moody, shrugs: 
           didn’t find anything. There’s doubt on both their faces. 
           Allison sees it.

                                 OFFICER MOODY (CONT’D)
                        And you say, no one else saw him 
                        when he came to your work?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Well, no, I’m sure someone saw him, 
                        just not...there are cameras.
           Moody’s skepticism is palpable. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Well, we’ll be sure to check into 
                        all that.
                             (then)
                        You married, Allison? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No.

           Allison watches the male officer casually snoop family photos 
           on the mantel. Moody eyes the sleep deprived Harry. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Is there anyone you can call who 
                        can come over tonight?

           OFF ALLISON, dejected by how blasé they’re being--

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison re-tucks in a sleeping Harry. She kisses his 
           forehead. Strokes his hair.

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kim stands at the door as the two cops are leaving. They 
           speak in hushed voices. 

                                 KIM
                        Thank you so much for your help.

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Ma’am, is your daughter on any kind 
                        of medication that you’re aware of?

                                 KIM
                        No. Not that I’m aware of.

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Has she suffered panic attacks in 
                        the past or shown signs of 
                        paranoia, dramatic mood swings?

                                 KIM
                        No. I mean, she’s been more high-
                        strung lately. Her job is 
                        stressful. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Okay. Just keep an eye on her. 
           Kim looks down the hall to Harry’s room. 

                                 KIM
                        You think something might be wrong?

           Moody takes a weighty beat. Talks even quieter:

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        She said she saw the man’s face 
                        right outside the bedroom window.

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        Being on the second floor kinda 
                        makes that impossible.

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Unless he had a pretty big ladder, 
                        but none of the neighbors heard or 
                        saw anything. No track marks 
                        outside.

           Kim goes pale. Nods slowly. 

                                 KIM
                        I see. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Either way, it’d be good for her to 
                        get evaluated by someone. Being a 
                        single mom can be tough. I think 
                        she could really benefit from it. 

           Kim nods again, a bit dazed. 

           EXT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           The cops walk to their car at the end of the driveway. Moody 
           looks over her notes.

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Allison Adams.

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        Yeah. Weird coincidence, huh?

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        I dunno. Adams is a common enough 
                        last name. 

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        She’s batshit, right?
                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Hey. Don’t be a dickhead. Get in 
                        the car. 

           They load up. Moody’s deep in thought. Wheels spinning. They 
           drive away. 

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           OPERA streams from somewhere. We PAN past the stacks of mail, 
           the empty armchair, the shut off TV to find--

           Hermit Allison adding small details to the tree mural on her 
           wall. She looks like she’s been up all night. A table-lamp 
           sits tableless on the floor, illuminating the dark space. 
           Sunlight pierces along the edge of a closed curtain. 

           Hermit Allison adds another long branch with a thin brush. 
           Fine points a fresh leaf. Dabs at more paint.

           No curtains in here, but bars on the small, second floor 
           window. Hermit Allison fries strips of bacon on a hot plate. 
           They SIZZLE and POP. 

           She looks out the window above the sink. In the apartment 
           across the way, a MAN and WOMAN are fighting. It’s nasty. She 
           throws something and he YELLS LOUDLY. Allison spies, slight 
           twinge of fear.  

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Hermit Allison sits down with her plate of bacon and eggs. 
           Switches on the TV. Morning talk show hosts YAP. She squeezes 
           four full droplets of Nettle tincture in a glass of water. 
           Stirs it. Drinks. 

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - MORNING

           Hermit Allison washes her two dishes in the sink--fighting 
           couple now gone from across the way. 

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Hermit Allison returns to her station in front of the TV. 
           Morning news plays:
                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        The hunt for 9 year-old Allison 
                        Adams continues, marking day three 
                        since her disappearance last 
                        Thursday. Friends and family will 
                        gather Sunday night for a candle 
                        lit vigil hoping to raise awareness 
                        within the community. 

           An ant crawls across Hermit Allison’s cheek. She watches TV 
           for several beats before noticing. Eventually, she brushes at 
           it with her fingers and it crawls onto her hand. She sees it, 
           flings it away in disgust. 

           She looks down. Notices three or four more on the arm of the 
           chair. She looks past the chair to the floor: dozens laying 
           siege on a forgotten peach can. A trail runs all they way 
           from the can to the front door. Nice, organized line. Shit. 

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hermit Allison stands above the chair, cordless phone to her 
           ear. RING. RING. RING. Someone answers...

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        I need to add something to an 
                        order. 
                             (beat)
                        I don’t remember. I don’t have it.

                        It’s the same order I get every 
                        week and now I need to add 
                        something to it.

                        Yes, that’s right.

                        You already have it. Same place as

                        Well, I don’t know. Is there more 
                        than one kind of ant trap?

                        Look, listen, it doesn’t matter.

                        that’ll get rid of them, that’s

                        Uh-huh? Well, what kind of

                             (beat)
                        Is it toxic?

                        Of course toxic for the ants, 
                        genius. I mean, is it toxic for me? 
                             (beat)
                        No, uh-uh, I don’t like the sound 
                        of that. You know what, here’s what 
                        we’re gonna do. Throw in a few 
                        different kinds and I’ll figure it 
                        out when they get here. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m not worried about it.
                             (beat)
                        I’m not worried about it. Throw in 
                        one of every brand and I’ll figure 
                        it out. 
                             (beat)
                        Listen, I don’t care about being 
                        cost effective, Mr. So and So. Do 
                        you understand? I have an entire 
                        infantry of insects trespassing 
                        through my property, eating me out 
                        of house and home, and I want them 
                        not to be here. Do you get that? 
                             (beat)
                        Thank you. Thank you for being so

                        Oh, give me a fuc-- It’s the same

                        Just give me whatever you feel like 
                        giving me, okay? Paper or plastic, 
                        you decide. Same as always. 
                             (beat)
                        Uh-huh, that’s right. Thank you. 
                        Tell the girl to get here early if 
                        she wants a good tip.

           She hangs up. Out of breath. The most she’s spoken in a long 
           time. She watches the ants scurry to and fro. 
           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, HER BEDROOM - MORNING

           POV--glow in the dark stars on a ceiling. Lace curtains on a 
           window. Stuffed animals carefully arranged on a hope chest. 
           Large TV on a dresser, glittery stickers around its edges. A 
           GOLD CANARY flutters against the confines of a hanging cage. 

           Cheerleader Allison lies alone in bed. Looks around the room. 
           BREATHES heavy. 

           POV--Michael comes into FRAME above her. Shirtless. He smiles 
           down. 

           Allison and Michael make-out on her bed. Roll around. It’s 
           passionate. Sweaty hands rubbing bare skin. 

           We SNAP back and forth between DREAMLAND and REALITY. 
           Sometimes Michael is there with her, in other moments she’s 
           all alone. Touching herself. 

           Allison closes her eyes, kisses Michael. She pants. When she 
           opens her eyes again, a look of trepidation--

           POV--Mr. Fox is now above her. He smiles down, innocent eyed 
           and sweet. 

           Allison kisses him. They’re naked. She takes his hands, 
           places them over her neck. She MOANS. He SQUEEZES tighter and 
           tighter. The CANARY flaps wildly in its cage. 

           Back to reality, Allison touches herself beneath the covers. 
           It’s fast and fierce; eyes clenched. She CLIMAXES. 

           INT. ARCADE - DAY

           Kim, Nurse Allison and Harry wander the arcade floor. Kids 
           playing ski ball, whack a mole, etc. Harry is in heaven. They 
           pass two older boys playing a gruesome shoot ‘em up game. 
           BLOOD EXPLODES across the screen.

                                 KIM
                        Gosh, when did some of these get so 
                        violent?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        I don’t let him play any of the 
                        shooting games. Harry, please stay 
                        where I can see you.

                                 KIM
                        I mean, whatever happened to good 
                        old fashioned ring toss? Or pin the 
                        tail on the donkey?
           They round a corner to a room with a giant jungle gym of play 
           equipment--a maze of connecting tubes with slides and a ball 
           pit.

                                 HARRY
                        Oh, mom! Can I? Can I? Pleeeeease?!

           Nurse Allison gives a nod and Harry runs ahead to play.

           INT. ARCADE, JUNGLE GYM ROOM - DAY

           Kim and Nurse Allison sit off to the side on a bench. Harry 
           scampers around in the ball pit. Kim takes in her daughter. 
           Evaluating her. Careful beat. 

                                 KIM
                        How you doing?

           Nurse Allison pulls out of a slight daze. Looks at her mom.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        I’m still pretty shaken up. 

                                 KIM
                        Oh my goodness, I know. Me too. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        And I’m worried about Harry. Stuff 
                        like this is traumatizing for kids. 

                                 KIM
                        Oh, Harry’ll bounce back. Look at 
                        him. He’s already forgotten all 
                        about it. 

           Kim forces a laugh. Another delicate beat. 

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        How you doing in general? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        I’m fine. Why? 

                                 KIM
                        Just...it’s stressful, what you’re 
                        doing. I remember how it goes, 
                        raising a kid, working at the store 
                        until 3am. Its draining. There were 
                        some nights I would come home, 
                        crawl into bed and I could swear 
                        your father was there next to me. 
                        There were moments I could actually 
                        see him there. It was so eerie. 
                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Yeah.

                                 KIM
                        I would be so convinced he was 
                        actually there. 

           She laughs, casual. Allison just stares at her. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Are you trying to say I’m making it 
                        up?

           Kim looks truly horrified, almost hurt. 

                                 KIM
                        What? No! Not at all! Oh my gosh, 
                        Allie. What made you jump to that?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Then what are you saying?

                                 KIM
                        Nothing. Nothing, I was just trying 
                        to be encouraging to you. Of 
                        course, I don’t think you made it 
                        up. You saw something that really 
                        scared you.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Yeah, a man’s face. 

                                 KIM
                        Yeah. 
                             (then, very laid back)
                        I just think it’s important to go 
                        over every detail of it in your 
                        mind. Remember it as best you can. 
                        Try to replay it again. That’s all 
                        I’m saying.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        So, you’re saying you don’t believe 
                        me. 

                                 KIM
                        Not at all. Allie, would you knock 
                        it off. I’m just saying, you’ve 
                        been stressed lately and not as 
                        present as usual and I just, I 
                        wouldn’t fault you in a million 
                        years for mixing things up or 
                        seeing something that...
                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        ...that wasn’t real? 
                             (then)
                        That is so fucked.

                                 KIM
                        Allie.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No, it is. You think I’m crazy or 
                        that I’m delusional or--

                                 KIM
                        Well, now you’re just spinning 
                        everything I said. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        He gave Harry a stuffed animal, 
                        mom. He interacted with your 
                        grandson!

                                 KIM
                        Right. But Harry can’t remember who 
                        gave it to him. It could’ve been 
                        another parent or a teacher or--

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        This is unbelievable. You don’t 
                        believe me. 

                                 KIM
                        I believe that someone weird came 
                        to your work and that you got 
                        spooked by something outside the 
                        window.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        I don’t want to talk about this 
                        with you.

           Allison turns away, dead serious. Kim sighs. 

                                 KIM
                        Fine. Okay. I’m sorry I brought it 
                        up. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna get another diet Coke, 
                        you want anything?

           Allison shakes her head, eyes glued on the ball pit. Kim 
           sheepishly stands, exits. 
           Several tense beats. Allison slips inside herself, betrayed; 
           world closing in around her. She looks back to the ball pit 
           and goes cold--

           Harry isn’t in there anymore. She scans the play equipment 
           and suddenly goes numb--

           Through the mesh netting of the ball pit, she can see 
           something moving around--a tall, THIN FIGURE. Moving in and 
           out behind the columns. 

           Allison leaps to her feet. Goes up to the netting...just as 
           the figure disappears into another tunnel.  

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Harry! Harry!

           Allison races to the entrance of the jungle gym--peers up the 
           mouth of the slow inclining tunnel. It WHISPERS back at her, 
           all other sound DISTANT and ECHOY. She stares up. An almost 
           psychedelic swirling is happening. Lulling her forward. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                             (barely a whisper)
                        Harry...

           She steps right up to the mouth. Pokes her head in. A HUSHED 
           CHORUS of voices reverberates down from the top. Quietly 
           beckoning. Haunting. Other worldly. 

           In a trance, Allison begins her climb up the long plastic 
           tube. 

           INT. TUBING - CONTINUOUS

           Nurse Allison makes her way up--slow and steady--VOICES 
           MURMURING somewhere ahead. 

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                             (playful, echoing)
                        Come find me, Mommy.

           She hurries, scooting on hands and knees toward the sound of 
           his voice. 

           INT. TUBING LANDING - CONTINUOUS

           She reaches the top. Two new tubes--one leading up, another 
           leading down. Allison looks from one to the other.

           Harry GIGGLES from somewhere above. Allison turns to the tube 
           leading up. She crawls inside it....
           INT. MORE TUBING - CONTINUOUS

           She can see Harry’s little body up ahead, disappearing around 
           the tube’s bend. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Harry?

           She crawls faster--deeper into the labyrinth of colorful 
           plastic tubes.

           INT. ANOTHER TUBE LANDING - CONTINUOUS

           Nurse Allison reaches the top of this tube and Harry is 
           suddenly nowhere to be seen. Just three new tubes stretching 
           off in three different directions. All seemingly identical. 

           Allison looks at each entrance, no idea where to go. 

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                             (playful, echoing)
                        Mommy...

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Baby, where are you? 

           She leans in closer. Examines the tube to her left--A TRAIL 
           OF ANTS runs up it in an endless line. She cowers back, 
           horrified. 

           She looks between the tube in the middle and the tube on the 
           right. Distant SOUL MUSIC streams from the right tube. MIRROR 
           BALL light spins down from it’s top. Dancing flecks. 

           Allison settles for the silent tube in the middle. She begins 
           to climb...

           INT. MIDDLE TUBE - CONTINUOUS

           The walls seem to close in around her the further up she 
           goes. She squeezes onward--like Alice in the rabbit hole.

           Up ahead, Harry’s legs disappear over the lip of the tube.

           Allison gets to the top, barely maneuvers her way through the 
           tight opening--

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           --she’s home. Back in her son’s room. SMOKE WAFTS from 
           somewhere. She waves it away with her hand. 
           In the center of the room, FOUR COPS sit at a round table, 
           playing cards, smoking cigarettes. Officer Moody among them.

           Disoriented, Allison looks around the room.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Harry? 

           She looks under the bed. In the closet. Behind the dresser. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                             (to the cops)
                        Excuse me, have you seen my son? A 
                        little boy, about this high, sandy 
                        hair. 

           They ignore her. Play on in silence. Allison’s eyes dart to 
           the window. That window. Nothing but darkness. She ventures 
           further toward the cops.

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me?

           Officer Moody turns to look at her--dismissive; mocking. She 
           smirks, turns back to the game.  

           GIGGLING behind her. Allison spins around to see Harry 
           running out his bedroom door. She pursues after him--

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nurse Allison races into the living room. No sign of Harry. 
           The TV flickers.

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Mommy! I’m over here, mommy! 

           Allison turns to the TV: HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE of Harry riding a 
           bicycle in the driveway. The CAMERA work is shoddy. Shaky. 
           Harry looks right into the lens and waves.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hi, mommy!

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Harry! Baby, where are you?

                                 HARRY
                        I’m with daddy, mommy. 

                                 CAMERA MAN (O.S.)
                        Say: “we miss you, mommy!”
                                 HARRY
                        We miss you, mommy!

           The CAMERA MAN turns the camera onto himself--it’s the THIN 
           MAN! His lips curl up at the camera. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No! No! NO! 

           She clutches her mouth and stumbles backward. She falls--

           Long, free-fall into--

           DARKNESS. 

           INT. ARCADE, JUNGLE GYM ROOM - DAY

           POV--Blurred vision. FUZZY FIGURES crouch above us. Distant, 
           echoy VOICES. We FOCUS for a split second--an EMT coming down 
           on us with a breathing mask. 

           Nurse Allison lays on the floor of the arcade. Harry and Kim 
           crouch above her. EMTs work to revitalize her. 

                                 HARRY
                        Mommy! Mommy?!

                                 EMT
                        I’m gonna need you guys to stand 
                        back.

           Allison jolts on the floor as she comes to. She GASPS, 
           terrified. Looks around, frantic. 

                                 KIM
                        You had a panic attack, honey. Just 
                        a really bad panic attack. You’re 
                        okay. You’re okay now. 

           Allison’s eyes settle on Harry. He looks traumatized. She 
           shakes in the arms of the EMT. A CROWD has gathered: lookie-
           loos hoping to catch something gruesome. 

           For a split second we might notice a CHECKERED JACKET 
           disappear into the mass of people...

           EXT. DINER - DAY

           The missing poster of Allison Adams droops slightly on the 
           door. MUSIC hums from inside.
           INT. DINER - DAY

           An R&B OLDIE plays. Diner Allison moves away from the 
           jukebox, jives her way down the aisle of the restaurant. She 
           nods and hip swivels in time to the music, smiles as she 
           makes her way past various customers. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        How you doin’, baby?

           A woman smiles back.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Let me give you a little top off 
                        there, sugar.

           She pours coffee into a man’s cup. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Mmmm mmm. Milkshake make mama wanna 
                        boogie. 

           --to a booth of BOY SCOUTS all sipping milkshakes. They 
           laugh, smile.  

           Diner Allison dances her way to the back door. Eyes closed, 
           letting the music take her over. Total freedom. 

           INT. DINER - DAY

           New MUSIC plays. Something more subdued. Diner Allison tidies 
           up after the lunch crowd. 

           At the door, the busboy, BERTY (16), stares at the missing 
           poster of little Allison Adams, tub of dishes in his hands. 
           Diner Allison watches him. Takes in his sullen face. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Hey Berty, know what next month is?

                                 BERTY
                        No.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Next month. Take a guess.

                                 BERTY
                        I dunno, Miss Allison.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Next month is Miss Allison here’s 
                        birthday. Know how old she gonna 
                        be? 
                                 BERTY
                        No.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        50. 50 damn years-old. Can you 
                        believe it? You were nothin’ but a 
                        bunch of stardust when I came into 
                        this world. 

           Berty laughs politely. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        And you know what I’m gonna do?

                                 BERTY
                        What?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Imma buy myself a boat. Sail around 
                        the world. 

                                 BERTY
                        Really?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Absolutely. Gonna take some time 
                        off from this place. Get away from 
                        the day in, day out.

                                 BERTY
                        Wow.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Just me, the boat and the sea. And 
                        no one to tell me not to do it.

                                 BERTY
                        Do you know how to sail one?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        I’ve been watching some of those 
                        shows about it. You can learn about 
                        almost anything on the TV now a 
                        days. And of course, I’ll take 
                        lessons. Read some books. I’ll be 
                        alright. It’s something I’ve always 
                        wanted to do. 

           She takes a thoughtful beat. Gathers more dishes.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Only trouble out there’s the stuff 
                        mother nature throws at ya. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t think that’s all that 
                        troubling anyway. She knows what 
                        she’s doing. It’s the people mess 
                        it all up. 

                                 BERTY
                        Yeah.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Yeah. 
                             (then)
                        You know something, Berty? I have a 
                        pretty spectacular life. 50 damn 
                        years-old. 

           Berty only nods, awkwardly. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                             (re: poster)
                        Put some fresh tape on that thing. 
                        Don’t want it flapping off every 
                        time someone opens the door.

           Berty nods, snaps into action. Diner Allison HUMS and SINGS 
           to herself as she scrubs down the counter. 

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Hermit Allison sits in her chair. She stares down warily at 
           the ant infestation. CLOSE UP on their little bodies, tiny 
           legs CLICK, CLACKING across the floor. TEETH SINKING into 
           microscopic peach morsels. Scurrying to and fro--sharp notes 
           on VIOLIN. A dead one lies in the path of the others; crawled 
           over--already forgotten. 

           A KNOCK at the front door. Hermit Allison rises from her 
           chair, plods across the hardwood to the door. Looks through 
           the peep hole. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Who are you?

                                 DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)
                        I’m here with your groceries, Miss 
                        Adams. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Where’s the girl? 

                                 DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)
                        She’s out sick today, Miss Adams. 
                        I’m taking over all her deliveries 
                        for the day. 
                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        You get the ant traps? 

                                 DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)
                        Yes, Miss Adams. I can help set 
                        them up for you, if you like. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        That won’t be necessary. 

           Hermit Allison opens her door, still leaving the chain 
           latched so that it only opens a few inches. We see the 
           delivery guy’s face--

           It’s the Thin Man. He smiles, sweetly. Hermit Allison eyes 
           him suspiciously. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Alright, pass it through.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Oh, I don’t think it’ll fit, Miss 
                        Adams. 

           He tries, but the bag is clearly too large to squeeze through 
           the thin opening. She studies him, apprehensive. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. We can do it real fast 
                        like. 

           Hermit Allison hesitates, keeps her eyes on him. She timidly 
           undoes the latch. Grabs the grocery bag. Then quickly re-
           latches the door. He smiles at her.

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        There. That wasn’t so bad, was it?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Here.
                             (handing wad of cash)
                        Keep the change. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Thank you, Miss Adams. You have a 
                        nice day now. 

           She closes the door. 

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - DAY

           Hermit Allison goes through the bag of groceries. Puts things 
           away in the cabinets and fridge. 
           She takes out four different brands of ant traps. Studies the 
           back instructions on one; then another. She looks to the 
           ants, completely overwhelmed. She opens one of the boxes. 
           Pulls out the traps. Stares at it, daunted.

           Another KNOCK at the door. Allison turns: what now?

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Hermit Allison opens the door a crack, chain still latched. 
           The Thin Man smiles back at her. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I just had a thought. You’ll have 
                        to put one of the traps outside the 
                        door here on the porch to cut them 
                        off at the source.

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Okay...

           She looks down at the trail of ants coming in under the door.

                                 THIN MAN
                        And I thought you wouldn’t want to 
                        do it yourself since you don’t like 
                        going outside. I thought maybe 
                        you’d like me to do it for you. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Oh. Well. Okay. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        My dad used to be an exterminator, 
                        you see. That’s how I know so much 
                        about it. 
                             (a goofy laugh)
                        You have to be strategic about 
                        where you place them. 

           Hermit Allison nods, slowly--she’s in over her head. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        I really don’t mind helping you out 
                        a bit. I’ve got time before my next 
                        delivery. It’s no trouble. 

           She takes him in. Studies his face. He’s perfected a 
           bumbling, 1950’s charm. She’s skeptical, but in need. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Alright. But be quick about it. I 
                        have a lot to get done today. 
                                 THIN MAN
                        Of course, Miss Adams. You won’t 
                        even remember I was here. 

           And she unlatches the door and lets him inside. 

           INT. BRITNEY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON a young girl’s lips. Red lipstick being applied. POP 
           MUSIC plays. We PULL OUT to reveal--

           Cheerleader Allison, getting a makeover by three of her 
           friends: BRITNEY, MEGAN and TONYA (all 16). She sits on the 
           bed. A TV plays MTV music videos in the corner.  

                                 BRITNEY
                        Stop wiggling your lips. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        How much are you putting on?

                                 BRITNEY
                        Stop asking questions.

                                 MEGAN
                        You look hot. 

                                 TONYA
                        Yeah. Full on slutastic.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        I don’t want too much on. 

                                 MEGAN
                        He’s gonna like fall over when he 
                        sees you.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Shut up. He will not. 

                                 BRITNEY
                        Stop talking. You’re messing me up.

                                 TONYA
                        Why are you guys even going to that 
                        thing anyway? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Because Michael’s a good person. 

                                 BRITNEY
                        Tonya doesn’t know what that means.
           The girls all laugh--including Tonya. 

                                 TONYA
                        It’s like really unfortunate that 
                        you have the same name as that 
                        girl. It’s like super awkward. 

                                 BRITNEY
                        Oh my god, so my mom like flipped 
                        out when she heard about it on the 
                        news. She got home and was like 
                        crying and stuff.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        She was crying?

                                 BRITNEY
                        Yeah, like all panicked because she 
                        heard the girl’s name and thought 
                        it was you. 

                                 MEGAN
                        My mom thought that too.

                                 TONYA
                        It’s too dark around the eyes. 

                                 BRITNEY
                        I have to blend it more. Stop 
                        hovering.

           Megan looks at herself in a mirror hanging on the wall.

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m so mad at my boobs. What if 
                        they just stopped growing?

                                 BRITNEY
                        They didn’t stop growing.

                                 TONYA
                        They probably stopped growing.
                             (then, to Allison)
                        So. Do you think you guys will do 
                        it tonight? 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        No!

                                 BRITNEY
                        They’re totally gonna do it. After 
                        he sees how hot you look. 
                                 TONYA
                        That’s like super morbid. Did you 
                        ever think you’d be losing your V 
                        card at a vigil for a dead girl? 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        We’re not gonna... And she’s not 
                        dead.

                                 MEGAN
                        Just missing.

                                 TONYA
                        I feel like she’s dead.

                                 BRITNEY
                        Guys, come on. That’s really sad.

           They take it in. Indulge in the drama and sadness. A 
           collective: Mmmmmm.

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah.

                                 TONYA
                        Yeah.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                             (beat)
                        Can I look at myself now? 

           Britney steps away. Throws up her hands--her work finished. 
           Allison turns to look in the mirror hanging on the other side 
           of the room. Just as her face meets the glass-- 

           WHOOSH! The mirror FALLS FROM THE WALL. SHATTERS on the 
           floor. It’s sudden and scary. The girls jump back and SCREAM. 
           Then laugh.

                                 BRITNEY
                        Oh my god, you broke the mirror. 

                                 TONYA
                        I’m pretty sure Megan’s boobs broke 
                        the mirror. 

           They all laugh again--except Allison who stares at the wall 
           where the mirror was. Uneasy. Haunted. 

                                 BRITNEY
                        23 years bad luck!

           More LAUGHTER brings us--
           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The Thin Man crouches on the floor, spritzing Windex at the 
           trail of ants. Wiping them up with paper towel. Hermit 
           Allison watches in the doorway of the kitchen. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Careful not to warp the wood. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I won’t. Not to worry, Miss Adams.

           She watches him work for several beats of silence. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Must get awful lonely in here 
                        sometimes. I know I would.

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        You need more paper towel? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        No. I’m alright. 
                             (then)
                        What is that about, anyway? Sun 
                        allergy? Some kind of PTSD?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Excuse me?

                                 THIN MAN
                        Just curious why you’re all holed 
                        up like this. Patricia told me 
                        about you before I took her shift. 
                        Said you were a shut-in. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Well, that’s none of her business. 
                        None of yours either. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Of course not. I’m sorry I asked. 
                             (then)
                        Agoraphobic. That’s what she said 
                        you were. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Well, I’m not. She doesn’t know 
                        what she’s talking about. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I didn’t think so. She’s not 
                        exactly the sharpest knife in the 
                        drawer, if you know what I mean. 
                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        It’s called Aboulomania. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Aboul-what?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        It means it’s difficult for me to 
                        make everyday decisions. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Oh. I see. That’s gotta be tough. 
                        Why do you think?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Why do I think what?

                                 THIN MAN
                        Why is it difficult for you? To 
                        make everyday decisions? 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Because it’s a condition I have. 
                        It’s relatively common actually. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Right. I mean, I’ve never heard of 
                        it, but I believe you. And where do 
                        you think it came from?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        I don’t know.

                                 THIN MAN
                        What are you afraid will happen if 
                        you make a decision? 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        A million different things could 
                        happen. A trillion different 
                        things. An infinite number of 
                        outcomes for every decision we 
                        make. I don’t fancy that kind of 
                        responsibility. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Gosh. You’re right. I never thought 
                        about it like that. Now you’ve got 
                        me all freaked out. 

           He laughs. Allison watches him. Grows uncomfortable. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        I can take care of the rest now.
                                 THIN MAN
                        Oh. But I’m almost done.

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        You’ve shown me how. I can do the 
                        rest myself. I’ll let you carry on 
                        with your day. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        But it’s no bother, really. I’m 
                        enjoying our conversation. I’m 
                        fascinated by all this. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        I need to take my nap now, so you’d 
                        better go.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Are you saying that for every 
                        decision I make I’m creating 
                        another me? Like I could be that me 
                        over there, but by choosing to eat 
                        a...say, beef sandwich instead of a 
                        turkey one I’m somehow making a me 
                        that’s this guy right here--
                        crouching in your living room?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Yeah. Something like that. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        So, with what you’re doing, you’re 
                        only allowing one of you to exist? 
                        By limiting the number of decisions 
                        you have to make?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Sure.

                                 THIN MAN
                        So I’m like the fly in your 
                        ointment then?

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        What?

                                 THIN MAN
                        The fly in your ointment. By 
                        inviting me in you disrupted the 
                        flow. Because now anything could 
                        happen. I’m a wild card in an 
                        otherwise predictable scenario. 
           Allison is scared now. Her eyes drift to the phone on the 
           armchair--behind him. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        I really think you oughta go. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        But now I’m intrigued. What could 
                        happen? The possibilities are 
                        endless. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Get out. 

           He slowly stands. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Maybe I tell you about my Lord and 
                        Savior Jesus Christ. You repent and 
                        give your life to him, decide to do 
                        mission work in Mumbai.

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Please go.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Or perhaps I kiss you and suddenly 
                        you feel beautiful again. Wanted by 
                        a man. And you get a hankering for 
                        love at the ripe old age of 68.

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        If you don’t go, I’ll scream.

                                 THIN MAN
                        This is fun. You handed me the 
                        reigns for a bit and neither of us 
                        have any idea what’s going to 
                        happen.

           Allison opens her mouth wide and SCREAMS. The Thin Man 
           lurches forward, sprays the back of her throat with Windex. 
           She chokes. Sputters back, coughing. 

           She stumbles into the kitchen to grab a weapon, but he’s on 
           her FAST--

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - DAY

           He SHOVES her against the counter. She SCREAMS again. Tries 
           hitting him with a soup ladle. He grabs her by the wrists. 
           She knees him in the crouch. He grabs at her face, hair. 
           She YANKS away. He puts his hand down on the counter to 
           stabilize himself and suddenly lets out a loud, painful HOWL--

           His hand SIZZLES on the hotplate. He grabs at it. Giving 
           Hermit Allison just enough time to dart away--

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           She runs into the living room, scoops the phone up from the 
           armchair, races to the front entry. She turns back--the Thin 
           Man is gunning toward her from the kitchen.

           She’s caught between the front door and the hallway. She 
           looks between the two. Not sure where to go. The front door 
           stares back, ominously. 

           He’s almost on her. She makes her choice. Darts down the hall 
           to the bathroom--

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, BATHROOM - DAY

           Hermit Allison rushes in. The Thin Man is almost upon her. 
           But she closes and locks the door just in time. He starts 
           KICKING it from the outside. There’s no window in here. The 
           mirrored door on the medicine cabinet is missing. 

           Allison dials on the cordless phone. It RINGS.

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        911, what’s your emergency? 

           She’s just about to speak when--

           SMASH! The door is kicked open. The Thin Man snarls in the 
           doorway. She’s trapped against the tub. He takes confident, 
           slow strides toward her. She cowers. Drops the phone to the 
           floor. Shivers.

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Why are you doing this? Please. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I’m just trying to make your life a 
                        little more exciting. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        I have a fine life. A spectacular 
                        life. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Spectacular?
                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Yes. Yes, because it’s mine. I 
                        chose this life. Me! 

           He’s inches from her face now. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        You thought I couldn’t find you 
                        here. That you’d be safe.

           She nods, slowly. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Well. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        Please. Let me be. I beg of you. 
                        Just go and--

           In a SNAP move, he SLICES A BLADE across her throat. Her eyes 
           go wide. BLOOD SPURTS. She GURGLES. Grabs at her throat and 
           stumbles to the floor. 

           ON HER FACE against the tile--the life draining. We hear the 
           floorboards SQUEAK as the Thin Man makes his exit. Front door 
           OPENS and CLOSES in the entry. She CHOKES and GURGLES. The 
           discarded phone on the floor beside her: 

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?

           She BREATHES OUT one last time. Goes still. An ant CLICK-
           CLACKS across the floor--crawls up the side of her face. 
           Settles on her dead, open eyeball. 

           SIRENS sound somewhere in the distance...

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DAY

           Nurse Allison showers. Steam envelops around her. She stares 
           ahead, blankly. Zombiefied. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, ALLIE’S ROOM - DAY

           Nurse Allison changes into fresh clothes, hair still wet from 
           the shower. She looks for socks in her dresser drawer and--
           stops at something on top--

           Three framed photographs: Harry’s school photo. A picture of 
           Harry and Kim smiling. And one of Allison all alone, standing 
           beside an empty swing. 
           Allison picks up the one of herself and the swing. Studies 
           it. Confused. Disturbed. That empty swing. Her eyes drift 
           back to the picture of Harry and Kim. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Harry sits on the couch watching TV. Nurse Allison enters. 
           Her son stares up at her, wary. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Where’s nana?

                                 HARRY
                        She went outside. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Why?

           Harry shrugs. Continues to stare at her. Allison looks ill.

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DUSK

           Nurse Allison spreads mayonnaise on several slices of bread. 
           She’s in a kind of haze--going through the motions. Harry 
           still watches TV in the living room. Kim enters from outside. 
           Comes into the kitchen. Allison doesn’t turn.

                                 KIM
                        How you feeling?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        What were you doing out there?

                                 KIM
                        I was just on the phone. Work 
                        called. How was your shower?

           Allison keeps her back to her mom. Stares ahead, suspicious.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Why couldn’t you talk in here?

                                 KIM
                        I don’t know. The TV was loud.
                             (then)
                        How are you feeling?

           Allison is quiet. Distrust mounting. She continues making 
           sandwiches in silence. Kim lingers guiltily behind her.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)

           ON THE TV: Dozens of people gather at sunset in the park. 
           Someone strums on a guitar. People wear T-shirts with Missing 
           Allison Adam’s face on them. A NEWS ANCHOR stands in the 
           foreground, addresses the camera:

                        As you can see, dozens have already 
                        started arriving in the park here 
                        behind me. Tonight’s vigil will be 
                        held for community members to offer 
                        up prayers for the safe return of 
                        Allison Adams, the 9 year-old who 
                        went missing from the park on 
                        Thursday. 

           OFF HARRY’S FACE, taking it in. Worry in his little eyes--

           EXT. PARK, PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Fog rolls. The sun is setting fast. Do-gooders wearing 
           Allison Adams T-shirts over hoodies head up the hill to the 
           top of the park. News vans unpack gear. Reporters report.

           A dolled-up Cheerleader Allison pulls into the parking lot. 
           Britney sits beside her in the passenger's seat. Allison 
           sputters her way into a parking spot. 

                                 BRITNEY
                        Geez, break much? 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        How do I look?

                                 BRITNEY
                        Like a sex god. Let’s go.

                        I don’t look trashy?

                                 BRITNEY
                        No. Come on. 

           They get out of the car.

                        Trey said they’d meet us up at the 
                        top of the hill. Would you relax? 
                        You look spectacular. 

           Cheerleader Allison trails up the hill behind her friend. 
           Pulls selfconsciously at her short skirt.

           Officer Moody surveys the space. Kicks off an ant trying to

           Studies it. Her male partner looks through a pile of mail in

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        You see this? 

           She turns. He hands her an envelope: ALLISON ADAMS, electric 
           bill.

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        You gotta be fucking kidding me. 

           She looks back to the mural--a thin line of black paint 
           slowly drips from one of the branches. SLOW PUSH IN--

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Kim and Harry sit at the table eating sandwiches. They laugh 
           and kid each other. In the next room--

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           --Nurse Allison tidies up. Wired and stressed. She stops at 
           the sight of her mom’s purse on the entry table. Looks over 
           to the kitchen--her mom’s back is to her, laughing at 
           something funny Harry is doing.  

           Allison slyly lifts her mom’s phone from the purse. Scrolls 
           through recent calls: the latest one is an UNKNOWN NUMBER. 
           Allison looks back to the kitchen. Harry and Kim oblivious. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison hovers by the closed door, phone to her ear. 
           RING. RING. RING.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello? 

           Allison holds her breath. Listens. 
                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        Hello? Kim, are you there? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                             (whispering)
                        Yes. I’m here.

           Silence. Then--

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Well, look, Kim. I think you might 
                        be right. I think maybe we should 
                        take the boy away from her--

           Allison REELS. Gasps. Ends the call immediately. She holds 
           her mouth. Gags. Wards off a sudden urge to puke. 

           She turns to the mirror. The glass is still fogged from her 
           shower. 

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison opens the door from the bathroom and jumps 
           back, startled--

           Kim stands right outside the bathroom door. Smiling. 

                                 KIM
                        Is everything alright, sweetie? 

           Allison looks at her like she’s looking at a stranger. 

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        I was just gonna go outside to make 
                        another call.

           Kim holds up her phone. Allison looks down to her hand--it’s 
           EMPTY! No phone. It’s not on the counter. It’s somehow still 
           with her mom. She gapes up at her mother.

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        Sweetie, what is it? 

           Allison’s losing it. She pushes past her mom in a panic. 

                                 KIM (CONT’D)
                        Allie?

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison rushes toward her son.
                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Harry, we have to go. Get your 
                        stuff. We’re leaving.

           Kim follows after her.

                                 KIM
                        Allison, what are you doing? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Come on, Harry. Right now. We have 
                        to go.

           Kim comes right up behind her. Allison whirls around--

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you dare touch him! 

           She grabs her son’s hand and shoves past her mom.

           INT. NURSE ALLISON’S APARTMENT, HARRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison storms into the room, clutching Harry’s hand.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Sit on the bed. Stay there.

           Harry obeys, afraid. Allison grabs a duffle bag from under 
           his bed. Starts raiding his dresser drawers and filling the 
           bag with clothing. Kim arrives in the doorway.

                                 KIM
                        Allison, what on earth are you 
                        doing?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        You’re working with him, aren’t 
                        you? Trying to take Harry away from 
                        me! 

                                 KIM
                        Allie, what are you talking about?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Trying to make me feel crazy. 
                        Making secret calls. The picture!

                                 KIM
                        What?

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Yeah. I saw what you did to the 
                        picture. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT'D)
                        It used to be Harry in that swing. 
                        Now he’s gone. You’re trying to 
                        take him away from me.

                                 KIM
                        Allie, calm down.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No! I’m not gonna calm down! I’m 
                        taking my son and we’re going to 
                        get far, far away from this--

           BAM. Her hands HIT WOOD at the bottom of a drawer. LIGHTS 
           FLICKER. She looks--the drawer is empty. She looks up to the 
           bag. Riffles through it. It’s empty too. She look to her mom.

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? How did you do 
                        that?

                                 KIM
                        Allie, please.

           Allison opens drawer after drawer of Harry’s dresser. All of 
           them are empty.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        What is happening?! What the fuck 
                        is going on?

           She screams. Unraveling. 

                                 KIM
                        Honey, you’re scaring me. 

           Allison looks to the bed. Naked mattress. No Harry.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Where is he? Where did he go? 

           She shakes. Verge of a sob. Kim watches her, helpless.

                                 KIM
                        Sweetie. Allie. 

           LIGHTS FLICKER again. The room is now DANK. Dim and sad. No 
           colorful wallpaper or kids drawings on the wall. No toys or 
           stuffed animals. No smiley face night-light. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No, no, no. This isn’t happening. 

           Allison crumples to the floor. She WAILS. Kim crouches down, 
           cradles her. Lets her cry and cry. 
                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        This is a bad dream. This isn’t 
                        happening. 

           PULL OUT from the empty, lonely little room. That black 
           window above the bed. Nurse Allison struggles in her mom’s 
           arms. Writhes. Sanity completely unravelling...

           EXT. PARK, HILLTOP - NIGHT

           The vigil. Men, women and children huddle in a crowd holding 
           candles. A PASTOR (40’s) prays near the front: 

                                 PASTOR
                        And Lord, we just ask that you be 
                        with her now, Lord Jesus. That you 
                        send your angels of protection to 
                        comfort her. That you give her the 
                        strength to know that she is not 
                        alone, Father God. We ask that you 
                        bring her home to her family 
                        unharmed, Father. Swiftly and 
                        safely.

           He goes on... People sway, lift their hands. Some cry. It’s 
           cold. You can see a collective cloud of BREATH. 

           Cheerleader Allison stands on her toes, pokes her head above 
           the crowd. Searches. Britney and her boyfriend, TREY (17), 
           come up behind her.

                                 BRITNEY
                        Boo.

           Allison whirls around. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Ugh. Where were you guys?

                                 BRITNEY
                        Looks like lover boy had something 
                        else in mind. This was on the car. 

           She hands her a note scribbled on lined paper: “MEET ME AT 
           THE PAVILION. XX”

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        What is this?

                                 BRITNEY
                        Just go with it. It’s romantic. 
                        We’re gonna take off.
           Britney hangs on her boyfriend. Kisses his ear. They 
           disappear into the crowd. Allison looks back to the note.  

           EXT. PARK, WOODS - NIGHT

           Fog swirls the dead trees. Nothing but moonlight. Something 
           out of a del Toro flick. Cheerleader Allison trudges through 
           the woods, lit candle clasped in hand. 

           An owl HOOTS from above. Sounds of the CROWD die out. Allison 
           ventures deeper and deeper, her fear swelling. 

           EXT. PARK, PAVILION - NIGHT

           Cheerleader Allison breaks through the trees and arrives at 
           the over-grown pavilion--a large, gazebo-type structure 
           wrapped in vines. Giant bird cage. She approaches, timidly. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Michael? 

           No sign of anyone. She ventures up the CREAKING steps. 

           Suddenly, a SOUND behind her. She whirls around to look--
           something RUSTLING in the trees. Maybe just the wind. Allison 
           holds up her candle, a weak protection. She shivers on the 
           steps of the pavilion. Waits.

           INT/EXT. MOODY’S SQUAD CAR, HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Officer Moody sits in the driver’s seat. Her male partner 
           hovers outside by her open door. He smokes. She sifts through 
           a database on her computer. 

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        You really think this is a thing?

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Seems too weird not to check it 
                        out. Okay, looks like there are two 
                        other Allison Adams’ in the area. 

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        Should we tell Stone what’s up?

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        When’s the last time Stone listened 
                        to anything I had to say?

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        We could tell him it was my idea.
                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Let’s not. Say we did. 

           She plugs an unseen address into the computer. Pulls her door 
           closed.

                                 OFFICER MOODY (CONT’D)
                        You coming? 

           EXT. PARK, PAVILION - NIGHT

           Cheerleader Allison sits on the steps. Waiting. More MOVEMENT 
           in the tress. She cranes forward. Stands.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Hello?

           She takes slow, steady steps toward the entrance to the 
           woods. Stops just outside the brush. It’s too dark to see 
           much of anything. 

           Suddenly, a HAND is around her eyes. She gasps. Goes to 
           scream. She’s spun around to face--

           MR. FOX. He smiles at her like a goofy kid. 

                                 MR. FOX 
                        I see you got my note.

           She takes him in. Catches her breath.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        You scared me.

                                 MR. FOX
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. 

           He hands her a dewy American Beauty rose. She takes it.

                                 MR. FOX (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know if you’d come. You 
                        look beautiful. Like a queen. 

           She stares up at him, mix of caution and intrigue. He looks 
           dashing in the moonlight. 

                                 MR. FOX (CONT’D)
                        Queen Allison. Let’s go into your 
                        castle.

           He takes her hand and leads her toward the pavilion. She 
           trails a step or two behind, apprehensive, eyes shifting back 
           to the woods behind them.
           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Diner Allison sits behind the counter, practicing knots with 
           a string. A CUSTOMER approaches with his empty coffee cup.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Should I leave this here?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        There’s a sink in back. Rubber 
                        gloves and soap on the counter.

           He gapes at her. She looks up at him: really?

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Give it to me.

           She puts out her hand for the mug. Takes it.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Little Sunday night humor for ya.  

           He gives a fake, humoring laugh and leaves. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, yeah, you laughing now. You 
                        think it’s damn funny now. You see 
                        how it is when I’m not here fixing 
                        all your problems. Nobody gonna 
                        know how to do shit. 

           DING. A new customer enters--a teen girl, 90’s punk, 
           Wednesday Addams-vibe. This is CAMILLE (14). She wears a 
           baggy Missing Allison Adams T-shirt over a sweater. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Go on, sit anywhere you like.

           But the girl comes right up to the counter. Looks in at the 
           case of pies. Something ghostly about her. Anti-social. 
           Allison takes her in. Notices her Allison Adams T-shirt.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        You come from the park?

           The girl nods, eyes still on the pie case. She holds a blown-
           out candle from the vigil. 

                                 CAMILLE
                        How much for a piece of apple?
                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Apple? Hmmm. Well, now, let’s see. 
                        Just so happens apple’s on special 
                        tonight. 

                                 CAMILLE
                        It is?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Uh-huh. You keep spreading the word 
                        about that little girl and piece of 
                        pie won’t cost you a thing.

           Diner Allison gets a slice out of the case.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        You want ice cream with it? 

                                 CAMILLE
                        Yeah. But I can pay.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Pssh. I don’t want your money.

           She scoops some vanilla ice cream from the freezer and adds 
           it to the plate. Sets it down in front of the girl at the 
           counter. Camille awkwardly takes a seat.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        You come over here on your own?

                                 CAMILLE
                        Yeah.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        You gotta be careful out there.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I know.

           She eats. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        It’s a good thing you’re all doing. 
                        Spreading the word. Raising 
                        awareness.

           Camille notices Allison’s knot behind the counter.

                                 CAMILLE
                        What’s that? 
                                 DINER ALLISON
                        That? Oh, that’s a sailor’s knot. 
                        I’m practicing. 

                                 CAMILLE
                        For what?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Being a sailor.
                             (then)
                        You ever been on a boat before?

           Camille shakes her head, continues eating.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna sail around the islands 
                        of New Zealand. Hike the mountains. 
                        Explore some of them glow worm 
                        caves. Mmm mmm.

           She gives a hearty laugh. Camille takes a few more bites.

                                 CAMILLE
                             (simply)
                        It’s my little sister that’s 
                        missing.

           Allison stops, taken off guard.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        That little girl? Allison Adams?

                                 CAMILLE
                        Mhmm. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        I’m very sorry to hear that.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Everyone’s over there crying and 
                        praying and stuff. And I thought it 
                        was stupid so I left.

           Allison watches her. Measures her next words--

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Some people think it helps.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Yeah, well, I don’t believe in God. 
                        So.

           She takes another bite. Eats on in silence. 
           EXT. PARK, PAVILION - NIGHT

           Hot and heavy. Cheerleader Allison and Mr. Fox make-out under  
           the pavilion. He strokes her face, gentle. She SQUEEZES his  
           hand and pulls it away. He goes to stroke her face again and 
           she firmly pushes it down. 

           He pulls back. Looks at her. There are tears in her eyes.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                             (meek whisper)
                        I don’t want you to be sweet to me. 

                                 MR. FOX
                        What do you want? 

           She timidly takes both his hands, slowly brings them up to 
           her neck. Places them on her throat. He studies her and 
           grins. Applies some PRESSURE. She nods. He’s charged now. So 
           is she. He goes in for an aggressive kiss.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Diner Allison watches Camille peruse the diner. They’re the 
           only two there. Camille walks over to the jukebox in the 
           corner. Scans the list of songs.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Does this thing work? 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Sure does. 25 cents a song. You 
                        need a quarter?

           Camille ignores her, pulls out her own quarter. Drops it in. 
           Punches a code. 

           Silence. Then--SOOTHING, TRANCE-LIKE MUSIC. Camille sways.

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Good choice.

                                 CAMILLE
                        It’s my sister’s favorite.

           Then--

                                 THE BEATLES (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                        “Picture yourself in a boat on a 
                        river
                        With tangerine trees and marmalade 
                        skies...”
           Diner Allison watches as the girl gently sways in time to the 
           music. Eyes closed. 

                                 THE BEATLES (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        “Somebody calls you, you answer 
                        quite slowly
                        A girl with kaleidoscope eeeeeyes.”

           Camille turns her back on Allison. Allows two silent tears to 
           fall free.

           EXT. PARK, PAVILION - NIGHT

           One hand still on Cheerleader Allison’s throat, Mr. Fox 
           begins unbuckling the belt on his pants. It JANGLES. She 
           pulls away from him in sudden alarm. 

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Wait. Is this right?

                                 MR. FOX 
                        Do you want it to be?

           He continues with the belt. Pulls her in for another 
           passionate kiss. She closes her eyes, surrendering. 

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Diner Allison bobs her head to the MUSIC behind the counter. 
           Camille dances with greater abandon. 

                                 THE BEATLES (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                        “Look for the girl with the sun in 
                        her eyes
                        And she’s gone.
                        Lucy in the sky with diamonds!”

           EXT. PARK, PAVILION - NIGHT

           Cheerleader Allison continues to make-out with her partner in 
           the shadows. They both MOAN. When she pulls back to look at 
           him, we see--

           it’s young MICHAEL. He strokes her face. Gentle, sweet. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s wrong? Allie, are you okay?

           She blinks. Takes him in, slightly disoriented. “LUCY IN THE 
           SKY WITH DIAMONDS” HUMS, ECHOY in a dream-like distance.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have to.

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        No. No, I want this. 

           She’s been with Michael all along. Her mind is playing 
           tricks. Michael leans in, unbuttons the first few snaps of 
           her blouse. Softly kisses her neck. She quivers, BREATH 
           expelling in a cloud. She looks up, past him to see--

           MR. FOX looming in the entry to the pavilion. Just watching. 

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Diner Allison comes out from behind the counter. She and 
           Camille sway beside the jukebox. 

                                 THE BEATLES (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                        “Newspaper taxis appear on the 
                        shore
                        Waiting to take you away
                        Climb in the back with your head in 
                        the clouds
                        And you're gone.”

           EXT. PARK, PAVILION - NIGHT

           Cheerleader Allison and Michael kiss wildly. Her eyes darting 
           to the pavilion entry every so often--

           Mr. Fox lurks. Stoic and still. He gets CLOSER each time she 
           sees him. Michael remains oblivious, his back to the entry. 
           They kiss on. Allison takes one more look behind him and--

           Mr. Fox is GONE. The entry is empty. RELIEF washes over her 
           face. She pulls back to look at Michael and they smile at 
           each other, both giggly. He’s about to lean in for more when--

           SLOSH! A knife suddenly pierces into his back. He GROANS in 
           sudden pain, body stiffening. He tries to make sound, but 
           nothing comes out. Cheerleader Allison SCREAMS-- 

           INT. DINER - NIGHT (SIMULTANEOUSLY) 

           Dance party continues. Diner Allison and Camille rock out.

                                 THE BEATLES (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                        “Lucy in the sky with diamonds!
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE BEATLES (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Lucy in the sky with diamonds!
                        Ahhhhhhhh.”

           EXT. PARK, PAVILION - NIGHT

           --Michael’s eyes bulge. A trail of BLOOD OOZES from his 
           mouth. He throws a final, pleading look to Cheerleader 
           Allison and then--falls. Allison trembles up at--

           the THIN MAN, BLOOD SPLATTERED across his calm face. Serene 
           smile. He moves slowly toward her. She balls up, terrified, 
           whole body slipping into shock. 

           He takes a seat beside her. Wraps his arms around her, 
           lovingly. Cradles her. She starts to cry.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Shhhhhh. It’s okay. Everything’s 
                        okay now. There, there. You make me 
                        feel bad when you cry. You’re safe 
                        now. I’ve got you. You’re safe.

           She looks to the entry--the SILHOUETTE of Mr. Fox disappears 
           into the nighttime FOG. She and the Thin Man are now alone.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Chaos. Nurse Allison SCREAMS and writhes in bed. Doctors and 
           Nurses rally around her. Hold her down. She yells out--

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        My baby! Where is my baby?!

           Doctors SHOUT medical jargon to each other. One nurse injects 
           Allison with a shot.

           INT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Kim waits in a chair just outside the door. Patti (one of the 
           nurses) approaches with a cup of coffee. Hands it to Kim. 

                                 PATTI
                        You okay?

                                 KIM
                        Thanks.
                             (then)
                        She miscarried six years ago. It 
                        hasn’t been this bad in a while. 

           Patti just stares down at her. No idea what to say.
           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           The song has ended. Diner Allison and Camille are laughing. 
           Camille looks lighter somehow.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        You gotta laugh in the awful shit, 
                        you know what. 

           Camille nods, somewhat guiltily. 

                                 DINER ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        No one tells you that. 

           DING.

                                 MISSING ALLISON’S MOM (O.S.)
                        Camille!

           Diner Allison and Camille look to the open door--

           MISSING ALLISON’S MOM stands bundled up in a jacket, face 
           tear stained and panic stricken.

                                 MISSING ALLISON’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        Where on earth have you been?

           She runs to the girl. Wraps her arms around her. 

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        I’m sorry, ma’am. She just needed a 
                        break, that’s all.

                                 MISSING ALLISON’S MOM
                        Why didn’t you tell me where you 
                        were going? I’ve been worried sick. 
                        Do you have any idea what I’ve been 
                        going through? Your aunt’s out 
                        looking for you in the car. Oh, my 
                        baby.

           Camille holds her mother close.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        I’m sorry, ma’am. I should’ve 
                        called someone. 

           Missing Allison’s Mom turns to Allison. Walks up to her. 

           DINER ALLISON’S POV--Missing Allison’s Mom looks radiant. 
           Young and fresh--glowing like an old fashioned movie star in 
           SOFT FOCUS. She gives a warm, close lipped smile.
                                 MISSING ALLISON’S MOM
                        Well, you’re safe now. That’s all 
                        that matters.

           In classic mom fashion, Missing Allison’s Mom licks her hand 
           and scrubs at a smudge on Diner Allison’s face. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        Were you girls eating pie?

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Yes. We shared some. 

           Diner Allison looks at her with deep reverence. Mom smiles. 
           Grabs Camille’s hand, then Allison’s in the other. She looks 
           at them both. Angelic. Beaming. Then--

           DING. All three women turn to the door--

           the THIN MAN stands in the entrance. Blood on his shirt and 
           hands.  

                                 THIN MAN
                        I think I just hit an animal. 

           INT/EXT. MOODY’S SQUAD CAR, MOVING - NIGHT

           Moody and her partner follow the GPS down a dark, tree-lined 
           road. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Looks like we’re getting close.

                                 VOICE ON RADIO (O.S.)
                        Requesting all available units 
                        respond to a stabbing at Troubadour 
                        Park. Requesting all available 
                        units to Troubadour Park.

           Moody and her partner exchange glances.

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        Should we go?

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Hang on. Not yet. 

                                 VOICE ON RADIO (O.S.)
                        We’ve got two victims down: one 
                        male, one female, appear to be in 
                        their mid to late teens. Both 
                        unresponsive. Waiting on medical. 
           EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

           Diner Allison follows the Thin Man out to his car. She 
           watches his back. Cautious, on guard. He leads her around to 
           the front of his car.

                                 THIN MAN
                        It’s right over here.

           She steps in front of him to look. Headlights glow onto--

           Nothing. She whirls around just as he SWINGS forward with a 
           crowbar. She DUCKS. Pulls her gun. BANG! But she misses. He 
           SWINGS again. KNOCKS THE GUN from her hand. Kicks it under 
           the car. Allison cowers back.

           He charges her. She dodges his grasp. Takes off running into 
           the surrounding woods. He’s FAST behind her--

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Diner Allison charges ahead. Jumps over rocks and logs. The 
           Thin Man isn’t far behind. 

           LOUD RUMBLING! Allison looks back--

           It’s as if the forest is MELTING behind her. Folding into 
           itself. Disappearing into the earth. CRACKS and CRASHES as 
           trees FALL and are SWALLOWED UP into the ground. 

           She runs on. PANTS. He’s gaining. Allison looks back again--

           The dinner, glowing on the hillside through the trees. 
           Suddenly, it implodes, walls caving in on themselves as it 
           start to SINK. 

           Allison runs on. 

           Ahead, a dozen or so VIGIL PEOPLE wearing Allison Adams T-
           shirts trudge toward her, carrying candles. They SING softly. 
           Diner Allison darts her way around them, Thin Man still on 
           her tail.

                                 DINER ALLISON
                        Help me! Help me!

           She YELLS. But no one looks up. She’s invisible to them as 
           they pass her and vanish into the darkness. The Thin Man 
           smiles, getting CLOSER and CLOSER. 

           Allison continues to run for her life. She reaches a new area 
           of wood near a PATH. A bike lies abandoned to one side. She 
           watches it sink into the dirt as she runs past.
           “FARGO”-ESQUE LANDSCAPE SHOT: Allison running, Thin Man 
           several feet behind. Forrest CRUMBLING in their wake. Then--

           BANG! A shot rings out. 

           Diner Allison falls to the ground. The Thin Man freezes. 
           BANG! Another shot WHIZZES right past his face. He turns on 
           his heels, takes off into the darkness of the woods. 

           Allison lies in the dirt and pine needles--BLOOD FLOWS OUT 
           from her wound. She gasps. Her eyes plead up into the trees. 
           An owl HOOTS somewhere above. She BREATHES slowly. Strained. 
           In and out, in and out. Then, a steady surrender. A peace 
           eases onto her face. She goes still as the life drains.

           BREATHING and FEET RUNNING. Someone approaching quickly--

           It’s the Male Officer, Moody’s partner. He stops at Allison’s 
           body.

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        Shit! Shit! 

           Officer Moody runs up behind him. She PANTS. Sees Allison.

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Jesus Christ, did you do this? 

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        I didn’t mean to. It was an 
                        accident. It all happened so fast.

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Get the fuck away from her. Did you 
                        see where he went?

                                 MALE OFFICER
                        No. No. Fuck!

           He cries. Kicks a tree. Moody crouches down beside Diner 
           Allison’s body. Takes her pulse. Sees her blood soaked name-
           tag: ALLISON. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Shiiiiit. 

           OFF DINER ALLISON’S FACE, glassy, lifeless eyes--

           INT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Quiet. Eerily still. No one waiting outside the room anymore.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON NURSE ALLISON, sleeping. CHATTER on the TV. It’s 
           blue light flickers on her face. Her eyes slowly open. Squint 
           awake. She gazes around the room, piecing together where she 
           is. A sitcom plays on the TV:

           SITCOM MOM (60’s) sits on the couch with sleeping, SITCOM KID 
           (6) in her lap. SITCOM DAUGHTER (30’s) stands in the kitchen.

                                 SITCOM MOM
                        I did that pile of dishes in the 
                        sink. You’re almost out of soap. 

           LAUGH TRACK. Sitcom Daughter throws up her arms in annoyance. 

                                 SITCOM DAUGHTER
                        Mom!! You can go. I’ll put him to 
                        bed. 

                                 SITCOM MOM
                        Oh, I don’t mind. Really. 
                             (comedic beat)
                        How was work?

           More LAUGH TRACK. Sitcom Daughter falls against the counter, 
           dramatically. 

                                 SITCOM DAUGHTER
                        MOM!! I’m exhausted. 

                                 SITCOM MOM
                        Okay. Alright. I’ll get out of your 
                        hair.

           Nurse Allison stares at the TV. Perplexed. Deja Vu. She looks 
           around the room and suddenly stops dead--

           In the chair across from the bed is the stuffed PURPLE BEAR. 
           Her eyes go wide. She tries to sit up, but can’t. Her wrists 
           and feet are strapped securely to the bed. She pulls at the 
           confines, tries freeing herself in vain.

           JANGLING. The room’s doorknob slowly begins to turn. Allison 
           freezes; braces herself. LAUGH TRACK CACKLES loudly on the 
           TV. Allison holds her breath. Stares at the door as it opens. 
           A FIGURE stands in the doorway. We PAN UP the body to the 
           face of--

           the Thin Man. He wears a doctor’s smock and gloves. Blank 
           look on his face. He walks casually over to the bed. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        No, no, no, no.
                                 THIN MAN
                        How are you doing this evening, 
                        Allison? 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Where is he? You took my son! Where 
                        is he?

                                 THIN MAN
                        Are you building little fantasy 
                        worlds now, Allison? Been cooped up 
                        a bit too long, have you?

           Nurse Allison twists in the straps. SCREAMS.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Let me out of here! Let me out!

                                 THIN MAN
                        It’s time for your medicine. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        You did this. You took them all 
                        away from me. You killed them, 
                        fucker!

           She SPITS in his face. He blinks. Remains emotionless. Pulls 
           a rag and wipes the saliva off his cheek. He turns away. And 
           then turns back, giant syringe in his hand. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        No! No! Stop! Please! Let me keep 
                        this one! Please! Let me have it.

                                 THIN MAN
                        It’s time, Luce.

           She arches her back; SCREAMS. He sinks the needle deep into 
           her arm. 

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        Noooooooooooooo!

                                 THIN MAN
                        Wakey, wakey.

           The TV behind him drifts into SNOW. STATIC suddenly WHOOSHES 
           on the screen.

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The apartment is empty. Nothing but the trail of ants. The TV 
           goes FUZZY here too. STATIC.
           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The TV BLARES STATIC FUZZ here too. The room is empty, save 
           the GOLD CANARY going berserk in its cage. 

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           Diner Allison’s gym. Vacant. The small TV WHOOSHES with 
           STATIC in the corner, just like the others. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurse Allison and the Thin Man are gone. Just an empty bed 
           and a STATIC SCREAMING TV. HIGH-PITCH sound of interference. 

           Then, a signal starts coming through. A HIGH-PITCH noise. An 
           image flickers onto the screen--the same image we saw before 
           on the TV in Diner Allison’s gym:

           VIDEO FOOTAGE of that shabby FRONT DOOR, each pane of its 
           glass covered in newspaper. Stained carpet. Sunlight fighting 
           to pierce through. 

           INT. HERMIT ALLISON’S DUPLEX, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Same image comes on the TV here.

           INT. CHEERLEADER ALLISON’S HOUSE, HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           And here: A SHADOW moves in the room on the screen.

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           The image appears on the TV here too: the source of the 
           shadow enters--a WOMAN, skinny and pale. She stands, back to 
           us, facing the door. 

           The HIGH-PITCH interference noise grows LOUDER and LOUDER, 
           until--

           BAM!

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Silence. Everything is instantly grittier. Less polished. 
           Less vibrant. Less like a movie. This feels real.
           WE ARE INSIDE THE ROOM ON THE TV. SAME SHOT: on the door and 
           the woman’s back. Her long blonde hair. A dog BARKS somewhere 
           in the distance. Blue light from a TV flickers. An 
           INFOMERCIAL plays. 

           After several beats, the woman turns to us--

           MISSING ALLISON ADAMS (32--although her sun-less skin makes 
           her look much younger). She has timid, sad eyes; a palpable 
           heaviness. Stares ahead, BREATH HELD.

           INT. THE HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

           Newspaper covers the window here too. Missing Allison makes 
           bacon on a hot plate. SMOKE bellows as a piece burns. 

           The whole house is a stale, rotting mess. Sentences scribbled 
           in Sharpie on random patches of wall.

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison eats breakfast on the couch in front of the 
           TV. A game show plays. She watches, bored.

           INT. THE HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison throws up in the toilet. 

           She wipes around her mouth with toilet paper. Flushes. 

           She dowses her face with water from the sink. Looks up to the 
           mirror--but there is no mirror. Just a blank wall with the 
           outline of where a mirror used to be. The words: “WHO AM I?” 
           written in sharpie in the center.  

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison flips through a gossip magazine. She lands on 
           a picture of a beautiful young girl on a red carpet: 
           CHEERLEADER ALLISON, smiling glamorously. 

           Allison stares, then flips to the next page. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Missing Allison does dishes. Tries to tidy up what little she 
           can. 
           KEYS jangle. In the living room, the front door is unlocked 
           and opened. In walks--

           the THIN MAN, looking far less sinister than we’ve seen him. 
           Gaunt; bags under his eyes. Sickly. He carries two bags of 
           groceries. Allison barely turns. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Hey.

                                 MISSING ALLISON  
                        Hey. 

           He comes into the kitchen. Sets down the bags. They’re 
           awkward with each other--familiar, but disconnected. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Got some of the canned veggies you 
                        wanted. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        Thanks.

           Her voice is baby-ish, like a little girl’s.

                                 THIN MAN
                        They were on sale. Buy one get one 
                        free. Otherwise they’re expensive. 

           He takes one out of the bag.

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Do they go in the fridge or...?

           Allison looks at him. Shrugs. Takes the can from him, studies 
           the directions on the back. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison and the Thin Man watch TV. He’s sprawled 
           across the couch. She sits in the armchair in the corner.

           ON THE TV: Jimmy Fallon interviews a guest. The crowd LAUGHS 
           uproariously at a joke.

           The Thin Man cracks up too. His laughing morphs into a COUGH. 
           He takes a swig of his beer. Allison just stares at him.

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Missing Allison makes up the couch into her bed--lays out a 
           sheet, puts down a pillow. 
           We can hear the Thin Man PISSING in the other room.

                                 THIN MAN (O.S.)
                        Oh, FUCK! Lucy! Lucy, get in here!

           She stops. Hangs her head. Slowly walks into--

           INT. THE HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The Thin Man stands at the toilet. Look of pure horror on his 
           face. Missing Allison lingers in the doorway.

                                 THIN MAN
                        The water’s orange again. That’s 
                        not normal, is it? Look at it.

           Allison enters. Looks down at the toilet bowl. The water is, 
           indeed, a deep, reddy-orange. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                         Holy fuck. What’s happening to me? 

           Allison looks worried too. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON 
                        I think you should go see a doctor. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Fuck. Jesus, fuck. 

           He turns to her. Grabs onto her and cries on her shoulder. 
           She pats his back. Stares blankly ahead. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison sits on the couch eating cereal. She watches 
           a cooking show on the TV:

           DINER ALLISON stands in front of a live audience chopping 
           veggies. 

                                 DINER ALLISON 
                        You’re gonna wanna do thin slices. 
                        Just a little bit thicker than a 
                        coin. Like this. Look at that 
                        broccoli. Ain’t she a beauty? Mama 
                        loves her some nice, fresh 
                        broccoli. Mmm mmmm. 

           The audience LAUGHS. 

           Missing Allison watches, enraptured. 
           INT. THE HOUSE, KITCHEN - DUSK

           CLOSE ON a strainer--soggy, floppy broccoli dumped inside. 

           Missing Allison shakes it around until most of the water is 
           gone. She looks at it, somewhat disappointed. 

           She dumps it onto the hot plate. Moves it around with a 
           spatula, trying not to let it burn. 

           In the living room, a NEWS ANTHEM plays, followed by:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        In tonight’s news, it’s been 23 
                        years since the disappearance of 
                        Allison Eleanor Adams, the Modesto 
                        girl who went missing while on a 
                        bike ride in the winter of 1993. 

           Missing Allison freezes. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           ON THE TV: The News Anchor addresses the camera--

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        For decades, local law enforcement 
                        agents have been baffled by a case 
                        that--from its very start--turned 
                        up little to no leads. Tonight, 
                        dozens from the community are 
                        gathering to finally lay Allison 
                        Adams to rest once and for all. 

           The screen switches over to a woman with short-cropped hair: 
           ADULT CAMILLE (37), heavy set. Title underneath reads: 
           CAMILLE DUNNE, VICTIM’S SISTER. 

           Missing Allison watches numb in the doorway. 

                                 ADULT CAMILLE
                        Sure there’s still hope. I mean, 
                        there’s always gonna be that small 
                        shred of hope. But is that a good 
                        thing? I dunno. I’m 37 years-old 
                        and I have kids of my own now. It 
                        feels good to say goodbye, even if 
                        it’s just a headstone. It’s 
                        somewhere I can put all those 
                        feelings. 

           She speaks glibly; matter-of-fact. The News Anchor returns--
                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        And “just a headstone” it is. 
                        Allison’s family has--

           Missing Allison is hit with a sudden wave of nausea. She runs 
           from the room. 

           We hear her VOMITING in the bathroom while the news continues 
           to play. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison chokes down charred broccoli while watching a 
           sitcom. 

           KEYS jangle in the front door. The Thin Man comes home, 
           looking drained and depressed.

           Allison doesn’t look up. He bee-lines for the kitchen; gets a 
           beer. Returns and plops down on the couch. They watch TV for 
           several moments of silence. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I went to the doctor. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        What did they say?

                                 THIN MAN
                        Nothing. Just took some tests. It’s 
                        gonna be fucking expensive though. 
                        The blood work they have to do. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        But did they say you’ll be okay? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Yeah. Probably. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        Good. 

           They stare at the TV for several more beats.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Something smells like farts.

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        I burned the broccoli. 
                             (then)
                        There’s some more in the kitchen if 
                        you want it. 
                                 THIN MAN
                        Nah. I ate on the way home. 

           More silence. The sitcom plays on, LAUGH TRACK blaring. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Missing Allison does the dishes. The Thin Man sits at the 
           small kitchen table going over bills.

                                 THIN MAN
                        We’re gonna have to start cutting 
                        costs around here. First of all, I 
                        can’t get you anymore of those 
                        cans, Lucy. They’re just too 
                        fucking expensive.

           He wheezes out a string of COUGHS.

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        Okay. That’s fine.

                                 THIN MAN
                        And we both need to cut back on the 
                        water we use. That means no more 
                        long showers, you understand?

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        Yeah.

                                 THIN MAN
                        And I think we gotta take a break 
                        from cable for a while. Shit’s 
                        costing me an arm and a leg. 

           Allison stops cold. Turns to him.

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        What do you mean?

                                 THIN MAN
                        I mean, I pay too much for that 
                        crap. We’ll still have basic 
                        channels, but the rest of it’s 
                        gotta go. And you can’t leave it 
                        running all day like you do. It 
                        wastes energy. 

           Allison stands frozen, eyes locked on the sink.

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear what I said, Lucy?
           She bristles. Eyes still on the sink.

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                             (quietly)
                        I don’t want to be called that 
                        anymore.

                                 THIN MAN
                        What?

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        I don’t want to be called Lucy 
                        anymore.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Why not? You love Lucy. You chose 
                        Lucy.

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        I know, but I don’t like it 
                        anymore.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Well, what name do you want then?

           She’s quiet. Still doesn’t look up. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        What will I watch during the day? 

                                 THIN MAN
                        What?

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        If you get rid of the cable, what 
                        will I watch?

                                 THIN MAN
                        Jesus Christ, I’m not getting rid 
                        of the fucking TV. Just the cable. 
                        Don’t get your panties in a twist. 
                        Jesus. You know, I might be dying 
                        here and all you care about is the 
                        fucking television. 

           Allison immediately regrets it all. Looks up.

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        No. No, I don’t. I do care about 
                        you. I’m sorry. You can get rid of 
                        the cable. That’s fine.
                             (then, flat)
                        I just want you to get better. 
           He looks at her. He’s scared.

                                 THIN MAN
                        I could really use a hug right 
                        about now, Luce.

           She drys her hands. Walks over to him. Hugs him in his chair. 
           He buries his face in her shoulder. Smells her; drinks her 
           in. Allison’s face is blank. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        How come you always know how to 
                        make everything better, huh? 

           She’s quiet for a beat. Then--

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        I think I might need another 
                        pregnancy test. 

           He looks up at her, sudden hope in his eyes. She stares down 
           at him. Now she’s the scared one. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A smiley face night-light glows in an outlet, the flicker of 
           the TV the only other source of light. Missing Allison 
           watches from her bed on the couch. 

           ON THE TV: A Medical Procedure plays. NURSE ALLISON rushes 
           through the hospital doors with a patient on a gurney.

                                 NURSE ALLISON
                        John Doe, pined under a corner of 
                        the plane’s fuselage. Sustained 
                        crush injuries to his right torso 
                        and upper extremities. BP initially 
                        low, but now up to 90 over 60 after 
                        a liter of fluid and placing him on 
                        his side.  

           She’s sharp. Takes charge. A real hero. 

           Missing Allison watches, deeply engrossed. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison sits on the toilet. Eyes glued to the blank 
           spot on the pregnancy test. Slowly, a PLUS SIGN appears. 
           She’s pregnant. A small smile breaks across her face. 
           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The Thin Man lies back on the couch, waits. Missing Allison 
           exits the bathroom. She lingers awkwardly, then--

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        I’m pregnant. 

           The Thin Man beams. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I knew it! I knew it! This is God’s 
                        miracle. It’s His sign that I’m 
                        gonna be okay! 

           He rises slowly from the couch. Wraps his arms around her. 
           Allison stiffens in his grasp, but smiles nonetheless. 

           EXT. THE HOUSE, BACKYARD - DAY 

           The Thin Man leans in the door frame of the back door. Smokes 
           a cigarette. He watches as Missing Allison walks from the 
           house to a patch of dirt in the backyard. She carries a 
           modest bouquet of flowers. 

           Two homemade crosses stick up from the ground and lean 
           against a tall fence. A dead bouquet lies beside a muddy 
           Purple Teddy Bear. 

           Missing Allison kneels. Puts the fresh flowers in place of 
           the dead ones. Touches her palm to each cross. 

           The Thin Man watches impatiently. After a beat, Allison rises 
           and walks back to the house. She enters, passing the Thin Man 
           without so much as a glance. He chokes out a COUGH, flicks 
           his cig and closes the door behind them. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison and the Thin Man eat TV dinners in front of a 
           flickering TV. Another late night talk show plays. He eyes 
           her hungrily from across the room. Lustful.

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Missing Allison makes up her bed on the couch. The Thin Man 
           enters. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I was thinking maybe you sleep with 
                        me tonight. 
           She turns to him. Masks her dread.

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        We won’t be able to for too much 
                        longer. 

           He idles. Caresses the door frame with a finger. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, THIN MAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison lays naked on her back. The Thin Man thrusts 
           on top of her; his skinny, sagging body gyrates. She stares 
           up helplessly at the ceiling. Same blank face as always. He 
           GRUNTS and MOANS, eyes clenched. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, THIN MAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison lies in bed, a sleeping Thin Man spooning her 
           from behind. He SNORES. Sputters out a COUGH. Allison stares 
           straight ahead as a single tear falls. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           ON THE TV: CHEERLEADER ALLISON sits across from a HANDSOME 
           GUY (17) at a diner booth. A film in the style of “The 
           Notebook.”

                                 HANDSOME GUY
                        Gee, Betty, you sure do have 
                        beautiful eyes, you know that?

                                 CHEERLEADER ALLISON
                        Oh, Lon, stop it. Mrs. Highsmith is 
                        watching.

                                 HANDSOME GUY
                        I don’t care if the whole world’s 
                        watching, Betty. I love you.

           MUSIC SWELLS. 

           Missing Allison lies back on the couch staring wistfully at 
           the TV. She rubs her belly subconsciously with one hand.

           There’s a RUCKUS outside. Allison looks to the newspapered 
           window. An ANGRY VOICE cursing, having a fit. KEYS jangle in 
           the lock and the door bursts open--

           The THIN MAN blusters into the room.
                                 THIN MAN
                        Fuck! Fucking fuck. Shit. Cunt. 
                        Fucker. FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!

           He slams the door behind him. KICKS at a chair. SLAMS over a 
           lamp. PUNCHES the wall. A full-on rampage. Allison recoils on 
           the couch, petrified. Watches him in complete stillness. 

           The Thin Man falls to his knees. Cries, spits, SCREAMS--

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, fuck!

           He folds his body over. WHISPERS into the floor. Rocks back 
           and forth-- 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                             (whispered chant)
                        Jesus and Mary. Jesus and Mary. 
                        Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me. 

           He calms. Gently soothes himself with the rocking. Allison 
           holds her breath. He slowly looks up at her, tears in his 
           eyes. The panic of a child.

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m fucked. Totally fucked. 

           She just stares. Afraid to do anything.

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        The doctor says I have it in my 
                        prostate and now it’s spreading to 
                        my lungs. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                             (carefully)
                        What is?

           He suddenly grits his teeth. Body vibrating. Seething. He 
           picks up one of Allison’s heavy text books and HURLS it at 
           the TV. CRASH! 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Fuck! FUUUUUUUUUCK!!

           The top corner of the screen loses picture--PIXELS JUMBLE. 
           Distort. Allison tenses. The Thin Man crumples again. SOBS. 

                                 THIN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Get it out of me. Get it out of me. 
                        Oh God, please don’t let me die. 

           Allison stares at him, genuinely terrified. 
           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           The Thin Man sits catatonic in front of the TV. A mindless 
           game show plays. The screen FLICKERS IN AND OUT, damaged from 
           his outburst.

           Missing Allison enters and sets a plate of bacon and eggs in 
           front of him. He doesn’t move. Just stares forward in a daze. 

           Eventually, Allison kneels beside him. Picks up the fork and 
           gently inserts small bites into his mouth. He chews. Drools. 
           A mother and her child.

           INT. THE HOUSE, THIN MAN’S ROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison tidies up the bedroom. Weekly, monotonous 
           chores. Organizes paperwork, cleans dust off the windowsill. 

           She pulls the sheets off the bed. Takes off the mattress 
           cover--reveals a large, RUSTY STAIN on the mattress. Remnants 
           of where a POOL OF BLOOD once was.

           She stares at it for a moment. Then carries on. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison showers. Clutches a barely showing belly. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The broken TV plays. Lines run up and down the screen. 

           Missing Allison crouches beside the Thin Man. Feeds him small 
           bites of cut-up chicken. He plays into the drama of his 
           diagnosis--forlorn, hard-done-by expression on his face. 

           Allison studies him, timid. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        I think I’m probably two months 
                        along.

           He stays silent, eyes hazy. She feeds him some soup. He 
           SLURPS. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking maybe this time we 
                        could go to a hospital. 

           He goes still.
                                 MISSING ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        If you thought that would be okay. 

           Suddenly, his hand LURCHES up. Grabs a chunk of her hair and 
           pulls. Allison SCREAMS in pain. He stares down at her. Twists 
           her hair. Pulling at the roots. She trembles.

                                 MISSING ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        You’re hurting me.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Selfish bitch. How fucking dare 
                        you? 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry. 

           He releases her. SHOVES her head away. She grabs at it. 
           Slowly crawls backwards.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Don’t you treat me like that. I 
                        don’t treat you like that, do I? 
                        Disrespecting me. 

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                        No. No. I just thought...since you 
                        need your rest. To get better.

                                 THIN MAN
                        The baby will make me better. 
                             (then)
                        It’s a miraculous thing, Lucy. Fuck 
                        doctors. Fucking ignorant doctors. 
                        They don’t know about what God has 
                        decreed when He said it. “For unto 
                        us a child is given and whosoever  
                        believeth in Him shall not perish 
                        but have everlasting life.” 
                        Everlasting life, is what it says. 
                        And they’ll see. It’ll be pretty 
                        miraculous to them when they see 
                        it. What God has blessed me with, 
                        with this baby. I’ll be healed, God 
                        said. And none of them will know 
                        how I made it all happen. How I put 
                        it all together. 

           He stares up, palms out to the heavens. A “god” of his own 
           making. Allison quivers on the floor.
           INT. THE HOUSE, THIN MAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison lies naked on her back again. The Thin Man 
           has sex with her. GRUNTS and GROANS. He orgasms. Doubles over 
           in pain. CRIES OUT-- 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Ow. Fuck. Jesus.

           He falls on top of her. PANTS, sweaty and seizing. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, THIN MAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison wakes up in bed. Turns to her side--he’s 
           gone. The sound of HACKING in the bathroom. Deep, ugly COUGHS 
           that just won’t stop. 

           She lies there, trembling in the dark. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Missing Allison sits on the couch watching the distorted TV:

           A sailboat glides across the sea. A Discovery program. 

           VOICES trail down the hall. Allison keeps attention split 
           between the TV and hallway--

                                 THIN MAN (O.S.)
                        Oh, that’s just my old guitar 
                        cases. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        And what about in this closet? 

                                 THIN MAN (O.S.)
                        More meds. They’ve got me on all 
                        these pills now, Cheryl. This pill 
                        with breakfast, that pill before 
                        bed. I mean, shit. Now, they’ve got 
                        me on an inhaler. I need help even 
                        breathing now.

           The Thin Man enters the room, followed closely by--

           OFFICER MOODY, his parole officer. She gives a polite nod to 
           Allison, who quickly everts her eyes. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        What happened to the TV?
                                 THIN MAN
                        Oh, that. You’ll laugh. I fell on 
                        it. It’s these goddamn pills, 
                        Cheryl. Make me lose my balance. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        You fill out all the paperwork for 
                        Friday?

                                 THIN MAN
                        Yes, siree. Got it in here.

           He limps his way past them into the kitchen. Allison is left 
           alone with Moody. Moody looks to her--

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        You’re the niece, right?

           Allison just stares--a silent, subtle plea: help me. Then she 
           nods. Moody takes her in, leery. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Here ya go. Fresh off the presses.

           The Thin Man returns, paperwork in hand. Moody turns her 
           attention to him and Allison goes back to being invisible. 

                                 OFFICER MOODY
                        Okay. Great. I’ll meet you at the 
                        courthouse at 9:45. Don’t be late 
                        or you’ll piss me off. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        Wouldn’t dream of it.

           She opens the front door. The Thin Man follows her out. 
           Allison watches them through a small tear in the newspaper--
           Moody walks down the path, the Thin Man smiling and waving 
           her off. 

           Allison turns back to the TV. Life sludges on. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Missing Allison makes a sandwich. Carefully spreads Mayo on 
           bread. She notices a small area of mold on one of the slices. 
           Cuts it off. Inspects the rest and then continues spreading. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison watches TV while eating her sandwich. Lines 
           run through the screen, picture going in and out.
           ON THE TV: A talk show HOST interviews a wheelchair bound 
           HERMIT ALLISON. Title card underneath reads: DR. McKENZIE 
           HOLT, physicist. 

                                 HERMIT ALLISON
                        I think when we talk about Daughter 
                        Theory it matters just as much on a 
                        metaphorical level as it pertains 
                        to any kind of physical reality. 
                        You can look at me, for example, in 
                        this chair, and see someone with a 
                        life stolen out from under them. 
                        Someone gypped by the gods out of a 
                        career as a mountain climber or 
                        cross-country skier. But does that 
                        mean this life has any less or more 
                        validity than the others? That 
                        choice is still mine. Some drunk 
                        driver doesn’t get to dictate that 
                        for me. Or you look at someone--

           The TV BLANKS OUT--the distortion worse than before. Missing 
           Allison sits up, concerned. The picture POPS back on in 
           quick, disjointed BURSTS:

                                 HERMIT ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        --services that don’t--without a 
                        hope of--another example would be--
                        takes light years to even--for--
                        some--

           Missing Allison gets up. Kneels in front of the TV and hits 
           the side of it. Nothing changes--it continues on in 
           disjointed fragments. She hits the side again and suddenly--

           the screen FIZZLES into DARKNESS. Dead picture and sound.

           Missing Allison stares at the black, silent box in front of 
           her. It’s gone for good. She stares at HER FACE BEING 
           REFLECTED in the glass. Holds her gaze--the first time she’s 
           seen herself in years. One one thousand. Two one thousand. 
           Three one thousand. Long EXHALE OF BREATH. 

           INT. THE HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison showers. Her belly a bit more distended than 
           before.

           INT. THE HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison dries off in front of the mirror-less wall. 
           Her eyes settle on the words written in its center: WHO AM I? 
           INT. THE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Missing Allison lays back on the couch, the TV still black 
           and dead. Allison runs her fingers over her belly, gentle 
           caressing. BREATHES up and down, up and down. Then, very 
           softly--

                                 MISSING ALLISON
                             (singing quiet)
                        “Picture yourself in a boat on a 
                        river
                        With tangerine trees and marmalade 
                        skies
                        Somebody calls you, you answer 
                        quite slowly
                        A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.”

           INT. THE HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

           Missing Allison sits at the table. Eats a bowl of cereal. 
           COUGHS of the Thin Man echo from the bathroom. 

           It’s quiet in the house without the TV whirring. Allison 
           stares ahead, deep in thought. Her eyes drift to the 
           newspapered front door--light glows from the outside. 
           Beckoning. 

           The COUGHING in the bathroom gets more aggressive. Then the 
           sound of someone FALLING. The Thin Man GRUNTS and GASPS--

                                 THIN MAN (O.S.)
                             (wheezing)
                        Lucy! Lucy, help me! 

           ON ALLISON--dead center between the BATHROOM DOOR and the 
           FRONT DOOR. 

           We see just the tips of the Thin Man’s fingers grasping at 
           the bathroom tile through the cracked door. The glowing front 
           door on the other side of the room.

           Allison looks between the two. 

           We PULL AROUND BEHIND HER (ala the OPENING SHOT of the little 
           girl on the bike caught at the fork in the road. Same image)--

           The FRONT DOOR or the BATHROOM. The Thin Man’s unanswered 
           CRIES. Which way to go? Long HOLD. Then--

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
