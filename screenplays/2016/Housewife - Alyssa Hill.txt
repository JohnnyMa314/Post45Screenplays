           An upbeat 60s tune and a --

           Montage of 60s ADVERTISEMENTS:

           A cartoon of a woman holding a smoking pan, her husband next 
           to her with the speech bubble: “It’s okay honey, you didn’t 
           burn the beer!”

           A bright photograph of a woman mopping her floor in a skirt 
           captioned: “Clean and wax my floors standing up!”

           A photograph of a woman drawing a lipstick heart on her new 
           washing machine as her husband and kids look on, smiling.

           A ketchup ad: “You mean a woman can open it?”

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE UP on: a woman’s HANDS.

           Water from a FAUCET pours over them. 

           She adds soap, and SCRUBS. Hard. 

           The bubbles fall away under the running water.

           She dries them with a pink towel, and turns them over, 
           inspecting. Are they clean yet?

           She lathers lotion over hardened callouses.

           We’re in a sparkling clean --

           BATHROOM

           CLOSE UPS continue as the woman puts herself together: 

           Curlers out.

           Hairspray in.

           Powder and blush.

           Lipstick on.

           She looks in the MIRROR at the finished product and we see her 
           fully for the first time:

           HERMINE RYAN (45) - a housewife. 

           She is tall, has strong facial features and a stern mouth. Her 
           blonde hair is starting to turn grey. 
           The intensity of her stature is offset somewhat if not 
           completely by her outfit: pink and white striped shorts and a 
           matching blouse. 

           BEDROOM

           She MAKES THE BED.

           She tucks the bedspread in tight under the mattress, folds the 
           top over just so, and smooths the surface. Pat, pat.

           Then heads down the --

           HALLWAY

           She passes a hanging PORTRAIT. A STERN-LOOKING MAN (her 
           husband RUSSELL). She swipes her finger along the FRAME, 
           checking for dust. 

           But it’s perfectly clean. 

           She reaches the --

           LIVING ROOM

           Impeccably tidy like the bedroom. It’s modest but decorated in 
           the style of the day: olive and brown tones, wood furniture, a 
           faux leather couch, shag rug. 

           As she passes the coffee table, Hermine notices a MARK.

           She disappears into the --

           KITCHEN

           Pastel appliances with rounded edges and spotless counters. 

           From under the sink, she grabs a RAG and goes back to -- 

           LIVING ROOM

           She tries to wipe off the spot she saw.

           It doesn’t work. 

           She SCRUBS harder. But it won’t budge. She runs her hand over 
           it, then her NAIL.

           It’s a SCRATCH.
           She looks around...

           And picks up an issue of GLAMOUR MAGAZINE. She positions it 
           over the spot to cover it up. On the COVER, a woman with a 
           YELLOW HEADSCARF smiles, chin in her hands, next to the 
           question: 

           How Modern Are Your Morals?

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           An outer borough where the buildings sit low and unassuming. 
           Stairs lead from the sidewalk up to working class dwellings. A 
           neighborhood you probably wouldn’t pass through. And wouldn’t 
           remember if you did.

           Super: Queens, July 1964

           A few FORD cars are parked on the street, but no traffic goes 
           by. The summer heat has everything at a standstill. 

           Then a shift. 

           A MAN walks toward the house. 

           JOSEPH LELYVELD (26) is lanky with a nose that gives him a 
           hawkish appearance. His sports jacket is a little too big, but 
           his walk is confident. 

           A NOTEBOOK in his hand. A PEN in his pocket.

           INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           KNOCKING.

           Hermine pulls back the CURTAIN to look outside. She sees 
           Joseph with his notebook on her doorstep.

           She closes the curtain before he can see her.

                                 HERMINE
                           (calling out)
                        Who is it?

           She speaks with a European ACCENT.

                                 JOSEPH (O.S.)
                        I’m with the New York Times.

           Her face clouds with worry. 
                                 HERMINE
                           (to herself)
                        My God. This is the end of 
                        everything.

           Hermine looks around her house, as if taking a final glance 
           into an open casket.

           Then she takes a deep breath, and reaches for the DOOR. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Hermine’s REFLECTION in the shiny OVEN.

           Super: Three weeks earlier.

           She sets the TIMER. 

           The hand starts to TICK in a circle, COUNTING DOWN...

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Hermine comes in from the kitchen. She serves ICED TEA to two 
           other HOUSEWIVES (30s) sitting on her couch: 

           MAYLENE - the leader of the group, perfectly primped; a short-
           sleeved dress covers her slim body collar bone to knees, her 
           hair styled in a sleek bob with bangs.

           SHERRY - shorter, plump, her hairstyle and dress are less 
           flattering.

           Besides her ACCENT, Hermine fits right in. 

                                 MAYLENE
                        Hermine, your house is cleaner 
                        every time I come here.

                                 SHERRY
                        It’s perfect.

                                 MAYLENE
                        What’s your secret?

                                 HERMINE
                           (flattered)
                        No secret.

                                 MAYLENE
                        If you’re using any fancy European 
                        products I expect you to share.
           The ladies laugh.

                                 HERMINE
                        Can I get anything else?

           She is already putting an EXTRA PILLOW behind Sherry. 

                                 MAYLENE
                        Hermine! No more fussing, come 
                        sit.

           She SITS in a chair across from them. 

           Behind her, a CLOCK. The MINUTE HAND ticks forward, the second 
           hand keeps steadily SPINNING...

           On the coffee table is a plate of COOKIES. Sherry REACHES for 
           one. 

                                 MAYLENE
                        Sherry!

           She SLAPS her hand away.

                                 SHERRY
                        What?

                                 MAYLENE
                        We’ve had enough.

           Sherry folds her hands in her lap, embarrassed.

                                 HERMINE
                        There are more in the oven. You 
                        must take some home.

           Sherry SMILES at Hermine, grateful for the gesture. 

                                 HERMINE
                        The bake sale.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Yes. I know it’s still a few weeks 
                        away but I want us to be prepared. 
                        We’ve agreed Hermine’s recipe is 
                        the best. Naturally.

           Hermine beams.

                                 MAYLENE
                        By the way, I think I have that 
                        same plate.
                                 HERMINE
                           (she knew that)
                        Really?

                                 MAYLENE
                        Macy’s?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Don’t we have good taste? (back to 
                        business) So you’ll be in charge 
                        of the baking. Fifteen batches at 
                        least.

           Hermine nods, taking her orders seriously.

                                 MAYLENE
                        I’ll coordinate with the church, 
                        and spread the word. Sherry, make 
                        a sign and bring some sort of box 
                        for the money.

                                 SHERRY
                        Yes!

                                 MAYLENE
                        There are plenty of tables but 
                        we’ll need to get them out of the 
                        classrooms.

                                 SHERRY
                        I’ll bring Willy to help. Excuse 
                        to get him away from that Gina.

                                 MAYLENE
                        He’s still running around with 
                        her?

                                 SHERRY
                        Yes, unfortunately. And he says he 
                        goes by William now.

                                 MAYLENE
                           (laughs)
                        But he’s Willy!

                                 SHERRY
                        I know.

                                 MAYLENE
                        That girl...

           Maylene’s eyes go big, don’t even get me started. 
                                 SHERRY
                        She is pretty...

                                 MAYLENE
                        He could find better.

                                 SHERRY
                        Well, of course.

                                 MAYLENE
                        You tell him, you tell Willy -

                                 HERMINE
                        You should call him William.

           The conversation HALTS. 

           Maylene turns to Hermine. Sherry’s eyes DART between them, 
           worried.

           But Hermine doesn’t back down. 

                                 HERMINE
                           (gentle but stern)
                        If he wants to be William now. You 
                        should call him William.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Well.

           Maylene clears her throat, smooths her skirt.

                                 MAYLENE
                        You’re right. Of course, you’re 
                        right Hermine. Always such a nice 
                        person.

           They share a smile. And Sherry feels empowered to take a 
           COOKIE.

                                 MAYLENE
                        We should talk to the other 
                        ladies. Maybe tomorrow.

                                 HERMINE
                        Tomorrow I have -

                                 MAYLENE
                        Oh, that’s right!

                                 SHERRY
                        Have what?
                                 MAYLENE
                           (ignoring Sherry)
                        How do you feel?

                                 HERMINE
                        Nervous.

                                 MAYLENE
                        You’ll do fine! It’s a formality, 
                        I’m sure. You’re married, you have 
                        a house, go to church. You’re 
                        already American.

           Sherry realizes what they’re talking about. 

                                 SHERRY
                        Oh! For your citizenship. You 
                        should bring these cookies. Then 
                        they’ll definitely give it to you!

                                 MAYLENE
                           (scolding)
                        Sherry. This is serious.

                                 SHERRY
                        I was only joking.

           Sherry shrinks down into her seat.

                                 HERMINE
                        I feel American but - They can say 
                        no.

                                 MAYLENE
                        How can we help? Is there 
                        something you need to study?

                                 HERMINE
                        The test is finished. Now is 
                        interview. If they like you.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Well, everyone likes you!

                                 SHERRY
                        Everyone!

           Her friends LEAN toward her, adamant in their support.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Trust me, you’re the kind of 
                        person they want here. Lord knows 
                        there’s plenty we don’t.

           Hermine basks in the compliment.
                                 MAYLENE
                        I’ll go tell them that myself if I 
                        have to.

           She leans back, CROSSES her ANKLES, and takes a SIP from the 
           glass in front of her.

           Hermine does the same, MIMICKING her posture.

           INT. INS - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 

           A bare but official looking space. An AMERICAN FLAG stands in 
           each corner. A SEAL displayed prominently on the wall: 

           IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICES

           Hermine sits at a TABLE, her hands GRIPPED in her lap.

           Across from her is ANTHONY DEVITO (40s) - a gruff Italian New 
           Yorker. He doesn’t try to hide his bald spot, or suck in his 
           gut.

           In front of him, a FILE.

                                 DEVITO
                        Mrs. Ryan.

                                 HERMINE
                        Hello.

           She clears her throat.

                                 HERMINE
                        It is nice to meet you.

                                 DEVITO
                           (flipping through)
                        Got all your papers here. Test, 
                        application... Austria, huh?

                                 HERMINE
                        I live there before, yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        And now you’re in Queens.

                                 HERMINE
                        We have a house.

                                 DEVITO
                        You like the Mets?

           Hermine isn’t sure how he wants her to react, so she stays 
           quiet.
                                 DEVITO
                        I like that Kranepool. He’s from 
                        New York, you know.

           She gives him a polite SMILE.

                                 DEVITO
                           (back to the file)
                        Okay. Been livin’ here for five 
                        years... with your husband.

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        Tell me about him.

           She’s thrown off by the question. 

                                 HERMINE
                        My husband?

                                 DEVITO
                        How did you two meet?

                                 HERMINE
                        He came to the hotel where I work.

                                 DEVITO
                        In Austria?

           She NODS.

                                 DEVITO
                        He’s currently employed?

                                 HERMINE
                        Construction.

                                 DEVITO
                        And you work in the home?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes.

           He smiles, approves. 

                                 DEVITO
                        A few more here.

           He starts reciting the required questions: 
                                 DEVITO
                        Have you ever applied for U.S. 
                        citizenship before under this or a 
                        different name?

                                 HERMINE
                        No.

                                 DEVITO
                        Have you ever participated in a 
                        group with communist sympathies in 
                        your country of origin or any of 
                        previous residence?

                                 HERMINE
                        No.

                                 DEVITO
                        Have you ever been convicted of a 
                        crime?

                                 HERMINE
                        No, sir.

           Hermine answers that last question with conviction.

                                 DEVITO
                           (leaning back)
                        Tell me.

           Hermine looks worried, not sure what he means.

                                 DEVITO
                        How do ya like it here? Livin’ 
                        here.

                                 HERMINE
                           (relieved)
                        This is a dream. In America you 
                        have...

           She searches for the words.

                                 HERMINE
                        You can be anyone you want to be.

           Devito nods. 

                                 DEVITO
                        Alright.

           He starts shuffling through papers, STAMPING. 

           Hermine can’t tell if the stamps are good or bad. So she finds 
           something to say.
                                 HERMINE
                        On your shirt.

                                 DEVITO
                        What?

                                 HERMINE
                        You have a -

           She reaches out toward his sleeve where a loose THREAD is 
           hanging off. 

                                 DEVITO
                        Oh.

           She expertly TIES IT OFF and pulls it out, without fraying the 
           shirt more.  

                                 HERMINE
                        There.

                                 DEVITO
                        Thank you.

           He STACKS the papers in her file definitively, smiling.  

                                 DEVITO
                        It was very nice to meet you, Mrs. 
                        Ryan.

           She smiles back. 

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

           Hermine walks down a bustling avenue. 

           TAXIS honk and lurch by. 

           She’s dressed just like the rest of the women in the crowd -- 
           dress, hat, holding a dainty purse.

           A SMILE splits across her face. She beams with accomplishment.

           INT. MACY’S - DAY

           The department store at its peak. A PIANO PLAYER plays. RED, 
           WHITE and BLUE streamers decorate the walls for the FOURTH OF 
           JULY. Women looking their best browse MAKE UP and PERFUME. 

           Hermine looks around the colorful DISPLAYS of women’s 
           clothing, but doesn’t touch anything. 

           A SALES GIRL with a neat pony tail approaches.
                                 SALES GIRL
                        Can I help you find something?

                                 HERMINE
                        A dress.

                                 SALES GIRL
                        Alright. For a holiday party?

           Hermine takes out HOUSEWIFE MAGAZINE from her purse. She turns 
           to a marked page and shows the sales girl a MACY’S AD.

           In it, a MODEL poses in a stylish living room wearing a RED 
           DRESS. She’s glowing, the quintessential American housewife.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Hermine finishes putting on the same RED DRESS. With her 
           angular features, she’s not delicate like the model, but it 
           fits. She admires herself...

           Then notices a SMUDGE on the MIRROR.

           She tries to wipe it off with her finger. But it doesn’t work. 
           Even with spit. 

           She SEARCHES her purse. 

           Nothing useful.

           She SPINS around the dressing room. She has to find something. 

           With no other option, she takes the dress she wore into the 
           store off the hook and starts SCRUBBING the glass. 

           INT. MACY’S - DAY

           Hermine approaches the register still wearing the red dress.

                                 HERMINE
                        I wear it now.

           The sales girl smiles politely and RINGS HER UP. A LARGE CLOCK 
           TICKS on the wall behind her. 

           Hermine starts counting out MONEY. The dress she wore on the 
           way in is STUFFED in her PURSE.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME

           The MIRROR is CLEAN.
           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           A sea of desks and men. 

           Crowded and loud. REPORTERS in white collared shirts surround 
           communal tables covered with filing trays and PAPERS. They 
           hunch in their chairs writing, making calls. Or stand up 
           talking, smoking. 

           It’s frenetic. A time when reporters were on top of the world. 

           Within the chaos we find JOSEPH - the man who knocked on 
           Hermine’s door in the opening sequence. 

           He crosses the room and sits down at this desk. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        What are you hiding from?

           He’s talking to his colleague, TOMMY (20s), who sits scrunched 
           UNDER Joseph’s desk with a PAD of paper, doodling.

                                 TOMMY
                        I just like it under here.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Bullshit.

                                 TOMMY
                        I don’t have any space over there.

                                 JOSEPH
                        But you have space under there?

                                 TOMMY
                           (fine)
                        I’m avoiding that secretary.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ah.

           Tommy taps a pack of CIGARETTES. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        You can’t smoke under there.

                                 TOMMY
                        Rosenthal doesn’t give a shit.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I give a shit if you light my dick 
                        on fire!
                                 TOMMY
                        Fine. Ugh my head. I need to lay 
                        down.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Lie.

                                 TOMMY
                        What?

                                 JOSEPH
                        You need to lie down.

           Tommy FLICKS his lighter on. Joseph KICKS him.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Don’t you have work to do?

                                 TOMMY
                        Three dead guys, one dead lady.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Alright then.

                                 TOMMY
                        One guy died in the subway. He 
                        rode the line like three times 
                        before someone -

                                 JOSEPH
                        You haven’t written that one yet?

                                 TOMMY
                        Some of us want to get to know the 
                        people we write about.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Your people are dead!

                                 TOMMY
                        Exactly, they had a whole life.

                                 JOSEPH
                        This is why I will get a bigger 
                        desk while you’re still sitting 
                        under this one.

           The bristly metro editor ABE ROSENTHAL (50s) struts by.

                                 ABE
                        Lelyveld, great work on that 
                        banker. You ready for the next 
                        one?
                                 JOSEPH
                           (standing)
                        Always.

                                 ABE
                           (noticing Tommy)
                        Mr. Schiller.

           From his desk cave, Tommy gives a little WAVE.

           EXT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Joseph exits, the big prestigious letters of the newspaper’s 
           LOGO above him.

           He tucks his NOTEBOOK under his arm and walks with purpose 
           down the street, joining the THRONG of people going somewhere. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Hermine has an APRON tied over her new dress. On the counter, 
           the same Housewife Magazine is spread open and she follows a 
           RECIPE for a classic CHICKEN dinner. 

           She sets the table for TWO and ARRANGES her citizenship 
           approval DOCUMENTS in the CENTER. 

           The sound of the FRONT DOOR OPENING.

                                 RUSSELL (O.S.)
                        Hello.

           Her husband, RUSSELL RYAN (40s) - the man in the portrait - 
           takes off his WORK BOOTS by the front door and steps into the 
           kitchen.

           He’s burly, closely cut BLONDE HAIR starting to recede. The 
           kind of guy who might be intimidating in a different setting. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Hello, honey!

           She can’t contain her SMILE.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Is that a new dress?

           He gives her a peck and gets a BEER from the fridge. Then 
           notices the PAPER on the table. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        What’s that?
           He picks it up. 

           Hermine waits, giddy.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Oh my god. You got it? You got it!

           He SWEEPS her off her feet and SPINS her around. They start 
           LAUGHING.

                                 RUSSELL
                        My American wife! My American 
                        wife!

           He puts her down.

                                 HERMINE
                        My American husband.

           They kiss deeply.

                                 RUSSELL
                        I love you.

                                 HERMINE
                        I love you too.

           She looks into her husband’s eyes. Behind her, the OVEN TIMER 
           is COUNTING DOWN... 

           INT. JOSEPH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A small Manhattan walk-up. The door opens to a living space/
           kitchen, one bedroom off to the side.  

           Cut-out ARTICLES cover one wall - a shrine to Joseph’s work. 
           He stands in front of it, pinning up another STORY.

           His wife CAROLYN (20s) sits at the table READING.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Your mom called.

           Joseph GRUNTS in response.

           She looks at him, gauging whether or not to continue.

                                 CAROLYN
                        She wants you to call your dad.

                                 JOSEPH
                        If she has something to say to him 
                        she can call him herself.
           Joseph BANGS the chair as he sits down at the table. Carolyn 
           closes her BOOK and goes to sit on his lap. She STROKES his 
           hair and they KISS. 

           She wraps her arms around him. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I read that follow up about Horace 
                        Brown in the paper today.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Who?

                                 CAROLYN
                        The landlord from Brooklyn.

           It’s not registering with him.

                                 CAROLYN
                        The one you wrote a month ago.

           Joseph still doesn’t know what she’s talking about. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        This one!

           She jumps up and POINTS to the article on the wall. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh.

           He still doesn’t seem to remember. He’s moved on. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Alone after dinner, Hermine finishes DRYING the DISHES. 

           She picks up the DOCUMENT from the table and looks at it 
           again, satisfied.

           Your application for citizenship of the United States of 
           America has been hereby approved...

           She delicately FOLDS it back up.

           She bends down and opens the cabinet under the SINK to put 
           away her RAG. 

           Behind the CLEANING supplies, she sees a WOOD BOX. She looks 
           around. Then takes it out.

           Did she know it was there? Or did she just find it?

           Inside: FOREIGN COINS and a METAL OBJECT. It looks like an 
           antique pin with SPIKES, but we can’t tell exactly what it is.
           She reaches for it... 

                                 RUSSELL (O.S.)
                        Hermine?

           She shoves the BOX back underneath the sink, and SHUTS the 
           cabinet in a hurry. 

                                 HERMINE
                        I will be right there.

           She collects herself from the scare. Hand still on the cabinet 
           door, making sure it stays shut.

           INT. TEMPLE - NIGHT 

           The carved ARC that holds the Torah stands proud under the 
           ETERNAL LIGHT.  A RABBI and a CANTOR - two men in their 50s - 
           lead a service for the congregation seated in front of them. 

           Joseph watches from out in the --

           INT. HALLWAY - TEMPLE - SAME 

           -- looking through a WINDOW in the DOOR, listening to the 
           MUFFLED SINGING. He isn’t going in.

           The song ends and the congregation rises.

           As the temple-goers EXIT, Joseph busies himself looking at 
           PHOTOS on the wall. FADED IMAGES of Hebrew school students.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You didn’t come in for the 
                        service.

           Joseph turns to see his father - Rabbi ARTHUR LELYVELD (50s) - 
           behind him, a TALLIS over his shoulders, YARMULKE on his head. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Dad.

           An awkward beat.

           They shake hands.

           INT. RABBI’S OFFICE - DAY 

           A cramped room with an angled roof, FILLED with disorganized 
           PAPERS and STACKS of JEWISH TEXTS. 

           His father struggles to pull a BOX off a top shelf. Joseph 
           doesn’t try and help.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Cleaning out the house. Your 
                        mother told you I’m selling it?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Where are you going to go?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Down south for a while.

                                 JOSEPH
                        More strangers in need of your 
                        help?

           It’s an accusation. But his father ignores it. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Mississippi. The students down 
                        there have organized a really 
                        impressive effort to register 
                        voters. You should come see it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I have a job.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I know. I read your last story.

           Joseph waits for him to say something more. But he doesn’t.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Well, I started the next one.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I figured.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What does that mean?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Nothing.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay.

                                 ARTHUR
                           (decides say it)
                        If you’d really take time to get 
                        to know these people instead of 
                        moving on -

                                 JOSEPH
                        You mean like you’re moving on?

           Arthur shakes his head a little. Joseph just wants to leave. 
                                 JOSEPH
                        You asked me to come here. What do 
                        you want?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I wanted to give you this.

           He HANDS him the BOX.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What is this?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Stuff I saved. Thought you might 
                        want some family memories.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (scoffs)
                        Family memories?

           His dad turns away, hurt.

           INT. JOSEPH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joseph sits in a chair, hunched over the BOX his dad gave him. 
           It’s full of PHOTOS and handwritten LOVE LETTERS. He RUMMAGES 
           through it.

           Carolyn comes in from the bedroom.

                                 JOSEPH
                        There’s not one picture of all of 
                        us together. Why would he think 
                        I’d want this crap?

                                 CAROLYN
                        He’s trying.

           She comes to stand next to him and picks up one of the 
           letters. 

                                 CAROLYN
                           (reading)
                        All my love, always, Arthur.

           Joseph SCOFFS.

                                 CAROLYN
                        He wrote this to your mom?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Such bullshit.
                                 CAROLYN
                        Joseph.

           Joseph takes out another one. Reads: 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Our love is forever, no matter 
                        what life brings.

           He DROPS it back in.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Look how that turned out.

                                 CAROLYN
                        What are you going to do with all 
                        of it?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Get rid of it.

           He carries the BOX over to the door and DROPS it there. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Really?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Even if he died I wouldn’t want 
                        this stuff.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Don’t say things like that.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What? It’s true.

           She still has the letter in her hand. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        These are proof they were in love 
                        once.

                                 JOSEPH
                        They’re proof my dad was 
                        irrational.

                                 CAROLYN
                           (teasing)
                        Come on. You don’t love me like 
                        that?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Blindly? No. And you wouldn’t want 
                        me to.
           She laughs. She gets him.  

           INT. MAYLENE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Similar to Hermine’s living room with a more feminine look, 
           and everything is a little higher-priced.

           Maylene lies on the couch WRAPPED in blankets. Her nose and 
           eyes are red; she’s SICK with a very bad cold.

           Hermine brings in a CUP of TEA.

                                 MAYLENE
                        I’m so sorry. You were the only 
                        person I knew I could call.

                                 HERMINE
                        I am happy you call. We should 
                        take temperature again.

           She hold up a THERMOMETER and sticks it in Maylene’s mouth.

           After a few moments she takes it out and looks at the number.

                                 HERMINE
                        It is better a little.

                                 MAYLENE
                        This is awful. I’m going to get 
                        you sick!

                                 HERMINE
                        No, do not worry.

           She SITS next to Maylene and puts a cool RAG on her forehead. 
           Maylene GROANS.

                                 MAYLENE
                        What time is it? I have to make 
                        dinner...

                                 HERMINE
                        Meatloaf is in the oven. Dishes 
                        are washed.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Oh, thank you, Hermine. You’re a 
                        lifesaver. What did I do before 
                        you lived next door? You’re such a 
                        good friend. And a good nurse!

           Maylene laughs weakly. 

           Hermine smiles, thrilled with that compliment. 
           Maylene closes her eyes and takes Hermine’s HAND. Hermine 
           MOVES AWAY as soon as Maylene touches her. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Rest.

           Hermine TURNS ON Maylene’s TV. The CLOCK on the NEWS counts 
           down... 

           INT. JOSEPH’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A stark contrast to the housewives’ clean world. Dishes in the 
           sink. Paint chipping off the walls. One window curtain shorter 
           than the other. Dusty shelves covered with junk -- mismatched 
           dishes, candles, BOOKS.

           Joseph enters with GROCERIES. He kicks a week’s worth of 
           UNREAD NEWSPAPERS on his way in. He looks around, disgusted.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Mom!

           His MOTHER (50s) comes out of the bedroom with bags under her 
           eyes, a BOOK in her hand.

                                 MOTHER
                        Joseph!

                                 JOSEPH
                        What are you doing?

                                 MOTHER
                        Reading.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Not the paper obviously.

           He starts FILLING the fridge with the food he brought.  

                                 MOTHER
                        I didn’t know you were coming.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (impatient)
                        Same thing every week.

                                 MOTHER
                        Is it Sunday already?

           Joseph doesn’t answer. The distance between them is wider than 
           the length of the kitchen. 
                                 JOSEPH
                        I saw dad.

                                 MOTHER
                           (uninterested)
                        Oh.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (accusatory)
                        He’s getting rid of all the stuff 
                        from the house.

           She sighs. 

                                 MOTHER
                        I know you’re sensitive about 
                        that, Joseph, but he’s the one who 
                        decided to sell it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You left. Then he decided to sell 
                        it.

           He closes the fridge and looks at the DISHES in the sink. But 
           he doesn’t do anything about them.

                                 JOSEPH
                        See you next week.

           He heads to the door. 

           INT. JOSEPH’S EDITOR’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Joseph looks out the window, down at the streets filled with 
           exciting, promising energy. 

           The blue-green STATUE OF LIBERTY stands proud on the water. 
           The sun shines a spotlight on midtown’s buildings. 

           The city where everyone can be anyone they want to be.

                                 ABE (O.C.)
                        Not yet.

           Joseph turns to his editor who speaks to him from behind a big 
           DESK. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        What?

                                 ABE
                        The view. You’ll have it 
                        eventually. But not yet.
           Joseph smiles good-naturedly and sits down across from him. 

                                 ABE
                        You’re still young, Lelyveld. But 
                        you’re impressive. I don’t come 
                        across many reporters I can count 
                        on like you.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 ABE
                        Not only are you a machine, you -

           RING!

           He holds up a hand, hold on one second.

                                 ABE
                        Rosenthal. - What kind of tip?

           He listens. 

                                 ABE
                        A what?!

           Abe’s eyes go WIDE.

                                 ABE
                        Here? Living in New York? - You’re 
                        sure? - That can’t be - The source 
                        is reliable? - Holy shit.

           Abe starts WRITING DOWN what he’s been told.

           Joseph leans forward, excited. Only something really big could 
           make his boss react like that.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Joseph’s WATCH. The second hand TICKS around... 

                                 TOMMY
                        No way.

           Joseph grabs his notebook and jacket from his desk, in a 
           hurry. Tommy leans over in a chair, rapt.

                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s what they said.
                                 TOMMY

                                 TOMMY
                        But that would be -

                                 JOSEPH
                        Huge.

                                 TOMMY
                        Crazy!

           Tommy tries to process what he’s just heard. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Huge!

           He waves the paper with the TIP written on it at Tommy: Ryan, 
           Maspeth Queens

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           EGGS cracked into a bowl.

           FLOUR measured into a cup.

           BATTER stirred with a wooden spoon.

           Hermine floats around her kitchen, BAKING with a grace and 
           efficiency we can’t help be attracted to. 

           She’s wearing the pink and white striped outfit. We are back 
           at the day where we started.

           PRE-LAP: KNOCKING.

           EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY

           Joseph waits in front of a different house. A teenage BOY 
           opens the door. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Is this the Ryan residence?

                                 BOY
                        Yeah, who’s askin’?

           A WOMAN, his mother, appears. 
                                 WOMAN
                        Vincent!

           She SHOOS him out of the way.

                                 WOMAN
                        Can I help you?

                                 JOSEPH
                        My name’s Joseph Lelyveld, I’m 
                        with the New York Times. I’m 
                        looking for a Mr. Ryan.

                                 WOMAN
                        My husband passed away six years 
                        ago.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh. I’m sorry.

                                 WOMAN
                        Thank you.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Was he born here?

           She’s startled by the blunt question about a dead man. 

                                 WOMAN
                        In Kentucky.

                                 JOSEPH
                        He was American.

                                 WOMAN
                        Yes.

                                 JOSEPH
                        And he never left the country?

                                 WOMAN
                        No... what’s this about?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m looking for someone with the 
                        last name of Ryan in this 
                        neighborhood. It’s common, I know, 
                        but do you know any other 
                        families? Maybe with a European 
                        accent?

                                 WOMAN
                        What’s this about?
                                 JOSEPH
                        It’s important.

                                 WOMAN
                        The Ryans on 72nd street...

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thank you.

           He’s already hurrying away.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Hermine FOLDS LAUNDRY. The TV is on. A black and white COCA-
           COLA AD plays: a pretty HOUSEWIFE is directing two goofy 
           MOVERS as they set up her new living room. 

           When they finish, she rewards them with a BOTTLE of Coke. And 
           has one herself. She smiles at the camera.

                                 TV HOUSEWIFE
                        The refreshing-est!

                                 HERMINE
                        Refreshing-est. Refreshingest.

           She repeats the line, trying to match the actress’ accent.

           KNOCKING.

           Again, Hermine looks out the curtain.

                                 HERMINE
                        Who is it?

           EXT. RYAN HOUSE - SAME

                                 JOSEPH (O.S.)
                        I’m with the New York Times.

           Joseph CRANES to get a view inside, PEN already at the ready. 
           He hears the LOCK click open on the other side of the door...

           The moment of truth.

           Hermine OPENS the door, her face weighted with sadness.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Mrs. Ryan?
                                 HERMINE
                           (ad admission)
                        Yes.

           She looks resigned.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m looking for your husband. Is 
                        he home?

                                 HERMINE
                        My husband?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes. I need to ask him a few 
                        questions.

                                 HERMINE
                           (double checking)
                        My husband.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

           Hermine’s face changes. She plasters back on a smile. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Please, come in.

           Perhaps this isn’t the end after all. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joseph steps into the perfectly tidy room. He notices the 
           kitchen, the table neatly SET FOR TWO. No dishes in the sink. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        You have a lovely home.

                                 HERMINE
                        Thank you. Make yourself 
                        comfortable. I can get you 
                        something to drink?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m fine thank you. You said your 
                        husband is home?

                                 HERMINE
                        Water, tea, coffee. I can make 
                        lemonade.
                                 JOSEPH
                        No, really, thank you. Your 
                        husband. Is he -

                                 HERMINE
                        Excuse me. I have cookies in the 
                        oven.

           She leaves to the kitchen.

           Joseph is left alone to take in the details of the room. The 
           old issue of Glamour Magazine, a PAINTING on the wall. He jots 
           down some NOTES:

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME

           Hermine STEADIES herself against the counter. She takes a deep 
           BREATH. And checks her REFLECTION in the MICROWAVE. 

           She’s the perfect housewife. 

           And she’s going to prove it.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Hermine returns, plate of COOKIES in hand.

                                 HERMINE
                        I prepare for bake sale. But there 
                        are more.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Mrs. Ryan, it’s very important I 
                        speak to your husband.

                                 HERMINE
                        He is not home now.

           Joseph gets uncomfortable once he knows he is alone with her.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Do you expect him home soon?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes. Soon.

           She puts down the cookies on the coffee table and takes a seat 
           on the couch.
                                 HERMINE
                        Sit.

           It’s a command. So Joseph does.

                                 HERMINE
                        Your name?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Joseph Lelyveld. I’m a reporter 
                        with the New York Times.

           He’s anxious to start.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Maybe I could ask you a few 
                        questions, while we wait for him.

                                 HERMINE
                        Questions about my husband?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

                                 HERMINE
                        Okay. My husband is a good man.

                                 JOSEPH
                        How long have you been married?

                        Five years.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Five years... and where did you 
                        meet?

                                 HERMINE
                        In Austria.

                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s where you’re from?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes. This painting.

           She points and Joseph looks up at the painting. It’s a 
           LANDSCAPE - a beautiful LAKE surrounded by trees.

                                 HERMINE
                        This is where.

                                 JOSEPH
                        It looks beautiful.
                                 HERMINE
                        It was lovely. But I am in America 
                        now. And this is better. I have 
                        husband. A house to clean. This is 
                        dream for every woman.

           She smiles and holds up the PLATE of cookies.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh, no thank you.

                                 HERMINE
                        Try one.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m fine, really, thank you.

                                 HERMINE
                        Eat.

           This time he’s caught off guard by the force of her command, 
           but he OBEYS because her voice has that affect.

           She watches him CHEW, expectant.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Delicious.

                                 HERMINE
                           (proud)
                        American recipe.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thank you.

                                 HERMINE
                        Your mother makes cookies?

           Joseph almost laughs. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        No. She uh - no.

                                 HERMINE
                        Your wife?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Not often.

                                 HERMINE
                        Then you will take some.

           She gets up.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh, no, you really don’t have to.

                                 HERMINE
                        Young men need food.

           She leaves and returns soon after with a smaller PLATE, filled 
           with cookies and covered with PLASTIC WRAP.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thank you. That’s very kind.

           They sit in silence for a moment. Something about the way she 
           looks at him makes him nervous. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        You said Mr. Ryan would be home 
                        soon?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes. Yes. Where are you from?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh.

           He’s used to asking the questions not answering them. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Nebraska.

                                 HERMINE
                        Nebraska.

                                 JOSEPH
                        The midwest.

                                 HERMINE
                        A small town?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes, actually.

                                 HERMINE
                        Then you come to New York.

                                 JOSEPH
                        My parents moved us here when I 
                        was a kid.

                                 HERMINE
                        It is a good place here. Many 
                        opportunity.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

                                 HERMINE
                        Newspaper writer is good job.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

                                 HERMINE
                        New York Times. This is big, 
                        important paper.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

                                 HERMINE
                        You must be important too.

           The flattery works. They share a smile. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           The plate of cookies is EMPTIER. 

           Hermine and Joseph are LAUGHING. He’s sitting back into the 
           cushions, relaxed, and completely charmed by her.

                                 HERMINE
                        That is good story. You should 
                        write it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I have to write yours about the 
                        tiger.

           Joseph reaches toward his NOTEBOOK...

           But his hand passes over it and grabs a cookie instead.

                                 HERMINE
                           (noticing his sleeve)
                        Your jacket. It is too big. The 
                        arm. I can fix for you.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh no - I don’t need -

           She’s already up, taking it OFF his shoulders. She’s made it 
           into his personal space. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Someone needs to do this.

           She takes out a SEWING MACHINE from the cabinet and holds the 
           sleeve of the jacket up next to Joseph’s arm to measure.
           She clicks the machine on and positions the foot over the 
           fabric. The NEEDLE chugs along the new seam with a mechanical 
           NOISE. 

           He watches her work. It’s intimate.

           She finishes one side and starts lining up the other.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You must be a very good mother.

           She looks up at him.

                                 HERMINE
                        I do not have any children.

           There’s no sadness in her voice.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh.

           She goes back to SEWING the second side. 

           When she’s finished: 

                                 HERMINE
                        Stand.

           He does and she helps him put the jacket back on.

                                 HERMINE
                        Better. See?

           He moves his arms, feeling it on his body. 

           It does feel better. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thank you.

                                 HERMINE
                        You are welcome. You are nice 
                        young man.

           Her hand lingers on his shoulder in a motherly way.

           Suddenly Joseph realizes he’s not acting like a reporter. He 
           steps back. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I - I should go. Is there a better 
                        time I can come back, when your 
                        husband will be home? I really 
                        need to speak to him. Tomorrow, 
                        maybe -
                                 HERMINE
                        Tomorrow. For dinner. This will be 
                        good.

           She hands him his cookies. She is in control.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay. Thank you for - everything.

           He TRIPS over himself on the way to the door.  

                                 HERMINE
                        It was nice to meet you, Joseph.

           She CLOSES the door behind him. 

           EXT. RYAN HOUSE - DAY

           Hermine LOCKS the door and WATCHES through the curtains as 
           Joseph walks down the street. Relieved he’s gone. For now. 

           EXT. RYAN HOUSE - SAME

           Cookies in hand, Joseph walks away. But he feels Hermine’s 
           eyes behind him. He LOOKS BACK at the house...

           No Hermine in the window. Just a lightly SWINGING CURTAIN.  

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

           DEVITO - the INS agent who conducted Hermine’s citizenship 
           interview - stands on the corner at a HOT DOG stand. 

           The VENDOR behind the cart is an older man who speaks with a 
           Polish ACCENT. 

                                 DEVITO
                        Just one today. Tryin’ to cut 
                        down.

           He holds out a DOLLAR BILL. The vendor hands him the HOT DOG 
           and starts to count out CHANGE.

           Devito MUMBLES with his mouth full and shakes his head, taps 
           his finger on the front of the BILL.

                                 VENDOR
                        Washington.
                                 DEVITO
                           (swallowing)
                        Hey, hey! Keep the change.

           The vendor nods with gratitude and puts away the bill. 

                                 VENDOR
                        This time your turn.

           Devito grabs NAPKINS to wipe his face and hands.

                                 DEVITO
                        What?

                                 VENDOR
                        You learn something. About my 
                        country.

                                 DEVITO
                        Okay.

                                 VENDOR
                        Kolobrzeg.

                                 DEVITO
                        Kol-o-je-berg.

                                 VENDOR
                        Where I am from in Poland. 
                        Kolobrzeg.

                                 DEVITO
                        Kolj-Berg.

                                 VENDOR
                        Better.

                                 DEVITO
                           (waving him off)
                        I’ll work on it.

           He throws away his napkin and heads back toward the BUILDING 
           with the sign: 

           IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICES

           INT. INS - MAIN OFFICE - DAY

           A plain looking government office. Quiet cubicles behind a 
           front desk.

           Devito STRUTS down the hall toward the seated RECEPTIONIST - 
           an older WOMAN with BIG HAIR, chomping GUM leisurely. 
           He notices MUSTARD on his shirt. He tries to RUB it off and 
           makes it WORSE. 

                                 DEVITO
                        Damn.

           Suddenly, Joseph POPS UP out of a waiting chair.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Anthony Devito?

           Devito looks up from his shirt STAIN.

                                 DEVITO
                        Yeah. Who are you?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Joseph Lelyveld, New York Times. I 
                        need to speak with you. 
                        Immediately.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        He said it’s about a Nazi.

                                 DEVITO
                        A Nazi?

                                 JOSEPH
                        A Nazi. Here in New York.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. INS - HALLWAY - DAY

           Joseph follows Devito, almost crashing into him every few 
           steps because he walks so much faster than Devito’s lumbering 
           gait.

                                 DEVITO
                        You do know what you’re saying 
                        sounds absurd.

                                 JOSEPH
                        The tip came from a reliable 
                        source.

                                 DEVITO
                           (repeating it again)
                        There’s a Nazi living in Queens.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (urgent)
                        Yes.
                                 DEVITO
                        Come on!

           He lets out a laugh. Not taking this seriously. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thousands of people immigrate 
                        here. It’s possible -

                                 DEVITO
                        If they’re here, they didn’t come 
                        through this office. There’s no 
                        way we would let that in here. 
                        There are requirements, 
                        applications. An interview in 
                        person.

           They reach their destination: a bank of FILE CABINETS.

                                 DEVITO
                        It’s just not possible.

           Devito opens a DRAWER.

                                 JOSEPH
                        If it is true, would your agency 
                        revoke citizenship right away?

                                 DEVITO
                        We don’t - I’ve worked here 
                        fifteen years and never seen that 
                        happen.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Never?

                                 DEVITO
                        Look, kid. If someone lied on 
                        their forms, or in the interview, 
                        somethin’ like that, then that 
                        puts their citizenship up for 
                        review, of course.

                                 JOSEPH
                        But it wouldn’t be taken away?

                                 DEVITO
                        Withdrawal of citizenship is very 
                        not common.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Uncommon.
                                 DEVITO
                        What?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Nothing. So you don’t think 
                        citizenship would be taken away, 
                        even in this case?

                                 DEVITO
                        In this case, it sounds like 
                        someone’s playin’ a prank on you.

           Devito starts going through the FILES. 

                                 DEVITO
                        What’s this guy’s name?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Last name Ryan. Came from Canada 
                        around five years ago, lives in 
                        Queens. Country of origin would be 
                        Germany or Poland, Europe 
                        somewhere.

           Joseph is taking NOTES so he doesn’t see Devito TAKE OUT the 
           ONLY FILE LABELED RYAN.

           CLOSE UP on the line of the file that reads Country of Origin: 
           Austria.

           Devito’s FACE GOES WHITE. 

                                 DEVITO
                        Yeah, uh, nothin’ down here.

           He DROPS the FILE back into the OPEN DRAWER, as if it’s on 
           fire. Joseph never sees it. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Nothing under the name Ryan?

                                 DEVITO
                           (making something up)
                        There’s more I can look through... 
                        I’ll, uh, I’ll get back to you by 
                        tomorrow.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Tomorrow? This is important.

                                 DEVITO
                        Yeah, of course.
                                 JOSEPH
                        He has a wife. She could be in 
                        danger or -

                                 DEVITO
                        A wife...

                                 JOSEPH
                        We’re talking about a fucking 
                        Nazi!

                                 DEVITO
                           (to himself)
                        A Nazi.

           Devito looks down into the open drawer. At the file he won’t 
           let Joseph see. 

           The NAZI stares back at him from the FACE in the file’s 
           photo...

           HERMINE.

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           Hermine’s real FACE --

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY 

           -- at the BAKE SALE.

           Hermine, Maylene, Sherry, and other CHURCH WOMEN of different 
           shapes and sizes stand behind a TABLE covered with CAKES, 
           CUPCAKES, and of course COOKIES.

           Other church members enjoy their treats on the small lawn in 
           front of the steeple. 

           A sign hangs with RIBBON between two chairs:

           Help the Ladies of St. Agnus Build a Church Garden

           Hermine hands a CUP of LEMONADE to a WOMAN who puts a QUARTER 
           into the money BOX.

                                 HERMINE
                        It is refreshing-est.

           Maylene serves a PRIEST two cupcakes.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Only two, Father?
                                 PRIEST
                           (laughs)
                        This is wonderful. We certainly 
                        appreciate your service, Maylene.

                                 MAYLENE
                        I couldn’t have done it without 
                        Hermine. Have you tried her 
                        cookies?

                                 SHERRY
                        Hermine, we’re out of lemonade. Is 
                        there more?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes, inside.

           Hermine is the Housewife of the Hour.

           An older MAN comes up to buy a treat. Hermine notices the NEW 
           YORK TIMES tucked under his arm.

           She starts to PANIC inside.

                                 HERMINE
                        One minute.

           Hermine walks away from the table, trying to compose herself.

           And all of a sudden she sees a WOMAN IN BLACK, standing by a 
           tree. She has brown hair and wears a shapeless black SMOCK and 
           NO SHOES. She doesn’t look like she belongs here.

           Hermine’s face GOES WHITE at the sight of her.

           The Woman In Black stares unblinking, eyes steady, intent, 
           expectant, as if waiting for Hermine to say something. Then 
           starts WALKING slowly, steadily toward her...

           Hermine’s eyes fill with fear, she can’t breathe, starts 
           sweating.

           The Woman In Black walks through playing CHILDREN who don’t 
           seem to notice her. In Hermine’s mind, their HAPPY YELPS 
           become TERRIFIED SCREAMS and their play appears VIOLENT:

           A little girl DRAGS her helpless DOLL along the ground. 

           A little boy YANKS viciously on a little girl’s HAIR.

           Another boy STOMPS forcefully on a MOUND of DIRT.

           She SHUTS HER EYES, tries to catch her breath.
                                 CHURCH LADY
                        ... your secret.

           Hermine OPENS her eyes. 

           The Woman in Black is GONE. 

           An older CHURCH LADY is trying to get Hermine’s attention.

                                 CHURCH LADY
                        Ms. Hermine?

           Hermine forces herself to focus.  

                                 CHURCH LADY
                        I hear these delicious cookies are 
                        yours. You must give me this 
                        recipe. Unless it’s your secret!

                                 HERMINE
                        No. Yes. Thank you.

                                 CHURCH LADY
                        Are you alright, dear?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes.

           The woman smiles and walks away. 

           Hermine checks her HAIR, collects herself. 

           Then a LITTLE GIRL runs up to her, CRYING.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I got an owie!

           The girl holds up her HAND where BLOOD is starting to flower 
           out of a SCRAPE.

           Hermine STARES at the girl as she WAILS.

           Then she SNAPS.

           She GRABS the girl’s hand viscously.  

                                 HERMINE
                        SHUT UP!

           Her intensity immediately STUNS the child. 

           Her eyes are on fire - a side of Hermine we haven’t seen yet.
                                 MOM
                        There you are.

           The girl’s MOM swoops in and picks her up. 

                                 MOM
                           (to Hermine)
                        I’m so sorry.

           Hermine quickly COMPOSES herself.  

                                 HERMINE
                        No. No. No problem.

           She exchanges SMILES with the mom who then carries her 
           daughter away. The little girl looks over her mom’s shoulder, 
           eyes locked in HORROR on Hermine. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           In the dark, Hermine tip toes quietly to the cabinet under the 
           sink. She slides over the bottles of chemicals silently, and 
           eases out the WOOD BOX.

           She opens it and lifts out the METAL OBJECT. 

           It’s hers. She SHINES it gingerly with the thin fabric of her 
           NIGHT DRESS. 

           It has something inscribed on it in GERMAN.

           She stands. And holds it over the TRASH. Giving it one last 
           look, dangling it, about to drop it in and be rid of the 
           proof...

           But she can’t do it. 

           She wraps it back up into her hand.

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Joseph and Abe pass each other in the WALKWAY.

                                 ABE
                        Find that Nazi yet, Lelyveld?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Not yet.

                                 ABE
                        Fishing trip?
                                 JOSEPH
                        No. He’s here. I met his wife.

                                 ABE
                           (stops)
                        You’re shitting me.

           Joseph shakes his head.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Going back tonight when he gets 
                        home from work.

                                 ABE
                        Jesus.

           Joseph nods as Abe absorbs the gravity that the tip was real.

                                 ABE
                        Well get it done then!

           Abe walks away shaking his head. 

           Joseph reaches his desk. Tommy is sitting ON it this time. 

                                 TOMMY
                        You’re going back tonight?

                                 JOSEPH
                           (sitting)
                        She said he’d be there.

                                 TOMMY
                        What’s she like?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Normal. Their house is... clean.

                                 TOMMY
                        Do you think she knows?

                                 JOSEPH
                        No. I don’t think so. No, she 
                        can’t. She was so... normal. And 
                        kind. She’s like a... mom.

                                 TOMMY
                        Your mom?

                                 JOSEPH
                        No.

           Joseph almost seems sad at the answer. 
                                 JOSEPH
                           (quickly)
                        Like one on TV or something. She 
                        doesn’t know.

                                 TOMMY
                        But she’s married to him! If I was 
                        in the same room as a Nazi I’d 
                        know.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I know.

           He shakes his head. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Think you can get more of these 
                        while you’re there?

           He’s EATING the COOKIES Hermine gave Joseph.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Hermine makes her way around the aisles with a CART and LIST, 
           passing other HOUSEWIVES.

           Next on her list is FLOUR.

           It’s UP HIGH. She steps onto the bottom shelf and reaches... 

           A WORKER hurries up to help her.

                                 WORKER
                        I’ll get that for you, ma’am.

           He grabs it down. 

                                 WORKER
                        A lady can’t do that.

           He gives her a friendly smile and a WINK. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Thank you.

           She returns the smile. But there is tension in hers. 

           Then, past him, at the other end of the aisle, Hermine sees 
           the WOMAN IN BLACK again. Walking toward her slowly, staring 
           intently.

           Hermine YANKS her cart around and CRASHES into the SHELVES, 
           trying to get away from the hallucination as fast as possible.
           EXT. RYAN HOUSE - DAY

           Joseph is back. He has his notebook along with Hermine’s 
           PLATE. The sun is low in the sky, the day about to turn into 
           darkness.  

           He KNOCKS.

           He can’t stand still as he waits. He checks his TICKING WATCH. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Hermine opens the door, wearing the RED DRESS and low heels, 
           ready to perform.

                                 HERMINE
                        Hello!

           She smiles big and fake.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hello, Mrs. Ryan.

                                 HERMINE
                        Come in, come in.

           Joseph steps over the threshold.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I brought your plate back.

                                 HERMINE
                        Thank you.

           He hands it to her.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Is your husband home?

                                 HERMINE
                        Let me take this.

           She steps toward him to take his jacket. But he moves away, 
           keeping his distance.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        I really need to speak to your 
                        husband.

                                 HERMINE
                        He will be home for dinner. Any 
                        minute. Come.
           She turns to the --

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           With no other choice, Joseph follows her. There’s a THIRD 
           PLACE SETTING on the table. Hermine has orchestrated it all.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh, no, if that’s for me I can’t -

                                 HERMINE
                        You are here for dinner.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m just here to speak to your 
                        husband.

                                 HERMINE
                        Dinner while you speak.

           She busies herself CARVING pot roast with a SHARP KNIFE. The 
           OVEN TIMER is on. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s very generous but -

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes. We have potatoes and pot 
                        roast. American recipe. You take 
                        some home too.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (a little too loud)
                        No!

           She turns to face him. Her face is calm. But she’s still 
           HOLDING THE KNIFE. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m sorry.

           He gathers himself.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I should tell you why I’m here.

                                 HERMINE
                        I know why you are here.

           He’s surprised. She’s looking at intensely.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You do?
                                 HERMINE
                        Yes.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You know about your husband’s 
                        past?

           Choosing her words carefully:

                                 HERMINE
                        My husband is a good man.

           She waits for him to make his move.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Do you know who - what your 
                        husband did?

                                 HERMINE
                        This is what you are here to write 
                        about.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

           Is she stroking the knife? 

                                 HERMINE
                        What will this do?

                                 JOSEPH
                        If your husband was a...

           Joseph is confused. Does she know? He doesn’t want to say it 
           out loud.

                                 HERMINE
                        This was a different country. That 
                        was a different life.

           She does know. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        If your husband was a member of 
                        the Nazi party he could be 
                        punished. People need to know the 
                        truth.

           The knife in Hermine’s hand catches the light a little...

           But she simply turns back around. 

                                 HERMINE
                        It is the past.
                                 JOSEPH
                        These are serious allegations.

                                 HERMINE
                        Perhaps there is more you do not 
                        know.

           The sound of the FRONT DOOR OPENING.

                                 HERMINE
                           (calling)
                        Honey, we have a guest!

           Hermine and Joseph wait in tense silence as Russell takes off 
           his shoes.

           Then he enters the kitchen.

                                 HERMINE
                        This is Joseph.

           Joseph takes in Russell’s size, and straightens his posture.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Joseph Lelyveld. New York Times.

                                 RUSSELL
                           (offering his hand)
                        Nice to meet you.

           Joseph is thrown when he hears Russell’s voice. He slowly 
           SHAKES his hand.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Nice to meet you...

           He looks Russell up and down, trying to piece it together.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You’re American.

                                 RUSSELL
                        What?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I -

           Russell goes and gives Hermine a KISS and stands with his arm 
           around her.

                                 RUSSELL
                        New York Times. You here about 
                        that union crap?

           Joseph looks from one to the other. With them next to each 
           other it’s obvious. She looks European, she has the accent...
                                 JOSEPH
                        Mr. Ryan have you ever been to 
                        Europe?

                                 RUSSELL
                        Once. That’s where I met Hermine. 
                        Beer?

           It’s not him who’s a Nazi. 

           IT’S HER.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (to Hermine)
                        You.

           Hermine looks straight back at him.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (barely audible)
                        It’s you.

           Silence, their eyes locked.

           DING!

           The oven TIMER finally GOES OFF. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Dinner is ready.

           Joseph’s eyes go wide as he processes what’s really been going 
           on this whole time. 

           Russell opens BEERS. Hermine brings the POTATOES from the oven 
           to the table.

           They both sit.

                                 RUSSELL
                        You’re in for a treat. My wife is 
                        an excellent cook.

           Joseph hesitates. But he’s trapped in the middle of a story.

           So he SITS with them.

                                 HERMINE
                        Pray?

           They all take HANDS. To someone looking in through the window 
           they could be parents and their son sitting down for dinner.

           Russell CLOSES his eyes and starts to speak.
                                 RUSSELL
                        Lord we thank you for this food, 
                        for this roof, for this company.

           Hermine and Joseph keep their eyes OPEN, glued on each other. 
           Officially facing off.  

                                 RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        We send our prayers to all those 
                        who are less fortunate and pray 
                        for the peace of all men, women, 
                        and children. Amen.

                                 HERMINE
                        Amen.

           She and Russell start to eat, but Joseph doesn’t.

                                 HERMINE
                        Eat.

           Again, she says it as a command. 

           He looks at the food like it might be poisoned. But Russell is 
           eating. Hermine takes a SLOW BITE, as if to say, See? It’s 
           safe.

           Joseph starts to cut into his meat. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        So, Joseph, what brings you to 
                        Maspeth?

           He sounds kind. But Joseph still doesn’t know what to think of 
           the Nazi’s husband. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I - uh - an assignment.

                                 HERMINE
                           (quickly)
                        But he did not find who he was 
                        looking for.

           Her eyes frantically flash from Joseph to Russell. Her husband 
           doesn’t know. 

           Joseph decides to play along with her for now. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Right. A story about -

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        An oven salesman.
                                 RUSSELL
                        An oven salesman?

                                 JOSEPH
                        But they must have given me the 
                        wrong address because only a woman 
                        lived there. I’ve never heard of a 
                        lady oven salesman.

           Russell GRUNTS in agreement. Mouth full.

                                 HERMINE
                        Maybe the oven salesman used to 
                        live there and now he does not. 
                        Maybe he does not sell ovens 
                        anymore.

                                 JOSEPH
                        But he did sell ovens. So he is 
                        still an oven salesman. Russell 
                        what do you do?

                                 RUSSELL
                        Construction.

                                 JOSEPH
                        And if you don’t go to work for a 
                        few months you’re still a 
                        construction worker right?

                                 RUSSELL
                        Sure.

           Russell is oblivious to what Hermine and Russell are really 
           talking about.

           Joseph’s blood is boiling; Hermine is trying hard to get 
           across to him. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Maybe that is not what he wanted 
                        to do but he did not have a 
                        choice.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You always have a choice.

                                 HERMINE
                           (agitated)
                        Americans do, yes.

                                 RUSSELL
                        And now that’s you too, honey.

           He raises his BEER.
                                 JOSEPH
                        What?

           Russell takes his wife’s hand, looks at her lovingly.

                                 RUSSELL
                        She’s a citizen now. As of a few 
                        weeks ago.

           Joseph almost CHOKES.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Are you alright?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I, uh, I have to catch the train 
                        back.

           He CLAMBERS out of his seat, dropping his napkin. 

           Russell looks up, confused.

           EXT. RYAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joseph stumbles out the front door, SLAMMING it behind him. He 
           SCRAMBLES down the street between the looming street lights, 
           not looking back. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hermine LOCKS the front door. She lingers there for a moment, 
           defeated.

                                 RUSSELL (O.S.)
                        Honey?

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Hermine comes back to her seat at the table. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Strange guy.

           He takes a bite.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Nice and all, but something off 
                        about him.

                                 HERMINE
                        Hm.
                                 RUSSELL
                        Why exactly was he here?

           Hermine takes a bite. She doesn’t want to talk.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Everything alright?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes.

           She FORCES a smile. Russell goes back to eating, unconcerned.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hermine is tense. Now that Joseph knows it’s only a matter of 
           time until her world falls apart. 

           Russell sits next to her on the COUCH, his arm relaxed around 
           her, eyes SUCKED into the TV’s light. 

           Universal Cable News is on. BLACK AND WHITE video of the 
           outside of a DALLAS COURTHOUSE. The echoing voice of an 
           ANCHOR:

                                 ANCHOR
                        The trial of Jack Ruby continues 
                        today in Texas. The man who shot 
                        Lee Harvey Oswald, President John 
                        F. Kennedy’s assassin. Some are 
                        asking, should he be held 
                        responsible? Or given the 
                        circumstances, forgiven?

           Russell CHANGES the channel.

           A COMMERCIAL:

           A MOM standing in a LAUNDRY ROOM with a BASKET of clothes. 

                                 MOM’S VOICE
                        It’s dirt that gets down deep into 
                        fabric that’s hardest to get out. 
                        But you can fight it. How? Use 
                        Faultless starch!

           Outside, a DAUGHTER wearing a WHITE DRESS plays JUMP ROPE. 
                                 MOM’S VOICE
                        To dad’s shirts.

           The mom holds up and examines a WHITE MEN’S JACKET.

                                 MOM’S VOICE
                        Another star product from 
                        Faultless.

           A BLUE STAR LOGO fills the screen.

           A final shot of the Mom SPRAYING STARCH on the jacket.

           We see Hermine’s face change, SUCKED IN. The commercial’s 
           message speaking directly to her. 

           Montage:

           The next day Hermine GETS READY.

           Picks a dress.

           Takes out curlers.

           Puts on lipstick.

           Takes her purse out the door. 

           INT. SUBWAY - DAY

           Hermine sits on a crowded train. Her ankles glued together, 
           her hands folded over her purse in her lap. The rattling of 
           the train SHAKES her hair-sprayed CURLS.

           Across from her, a group of ORTHODOX JEWISH MEN stand holding 
           the pole. Long black coats, black hats, glasses. One has a 
           HEBREW BOOK in his hand. The rattling of the train SHAKES the 
           CURLS on either side of their faces.

           We watch Hermine watch them.

           Her hands CLENCH a little around her purse.

           But her face stays calm.

           Then the train comes to a stop. The metal doors swish open.

           And Hermine exits.
           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Hermine rides up with a stylish young WOMAN who’s holding a 
           stack of PAPERS. 

           After a few moments of silence: 

                                 WOMAN
                        I like your dress.

           Hermine turns to her.

                                 HERMINE
                        Thank you.

           The elevator DINGS to a STOP and the DOORS OPEN to -- 

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Hermine steps out into the office. She looks around. Then 
           approaches the FRONT DESK.

           From his seat, Joseph SEES her talking to the RECEPTIONIST. He 
           does a DOUBLE TAKE, processing that she’s there. 

           Then SHOOTS UP from his chair. 

           EXT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Joseph FORCES Hermine out of the building by her arm. They 
           stop in the middle of the FOOT TRAFFIC outside and he pulls 
           far away from her. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        What are you doing here?

           His gaze darts around them at all the PEOPLE milling about. 
           Business men, family tourists, street vendors, a homeless guy 
           in an army uniform. 

                                 HERMINE
                        To speak to you.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You can’t be here.

                                 HERMINE
                        You came to Queens to speak to me, 
                        yes?
                                 JOSEPH
                        You let me think it was your - It 
                        was you!

           He’s spitting out the words but he still barely believes them.

                                 HERMINE
                        Sit.

           He hears the power in her voice again and looks at her like 
           she’s a plague.

           But then she softens:

                                 HERMINE
                        Please. People will be looking.

           They sit on a BENCH. She begins her plea.

                                 HERMINE
                        What you think about me...

                                 JOSEPH
                        You’re a Nazi.

                                 HERMINE
                        This was many years ago.

                                 JOSEPH
                        But you were, weren’t you?

                                 HERMINE
                        Everyone was. These were the jobs. 
                        How you survive.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You worked at a concentration 
                        camp.

                                 HERMINE
                        You must understand -

                                 JOSEPH
                        What is there to understand?

                                 HERMINE
                        I was a nurse.

                                 JOSEPH
                        A nurse?

                                 HERMINE
                        Yes. A nurse.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Is that true?

                                 HERMINE
                        Why would I lie?

                                 JOSEPH
                        You lied before.

                                 HERMINE
                        I did not lie. Everything I told 
                        to you is true. I am from Austria. 
                        The Anschluss made us part of 
                        Germany. I met my husband when he 
                        was for vacation. We were married 
                        in Canada. Then we came here. Now 
                        I am American citizen.

           He wants to believe her. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        A nurse for who? The guards?

                                 HERMINE
                        I did not hurt anyone.

                                 JOSEPH
                        But you knew what they were doing.

           Hermine shifts, trying to stay calm.

                                 HERMINE
                        What would you do? If this was 
                        your choice? We were very poor.

           Her English gets choppier as she tries to convince him, make 
           him understand. 

                                 HERMINE
                        My father was a butcher. When I 
                        was child I was sad for the 
                        animals in his shop. Once maggots 
                        got into the leg of a pig. I 
                        cried. If he could not sell it we 
                        would eat only broth. But he just 
                        cut the bad leg away. He say you 
                        cannot think of animals as one 
                        being. Only parts. If a pig has 
                        one bad part, you can cut away. 
                        And the rest is still good. 
                        Perhaps humans are like this too. 
                        We have different parts. Maybe 
                        there is one bad part. But the 
                        rest is still good. What do you 
                        think of this?
           Joseph looks sickened. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        No... No.

                                 HERMINE
                        At the camp we could see the 
                        downtown. See. Right there. Very 
                        close. This means they could see 
                        too. The trucks come. They could 
                        hear too. The screams. They could 
                        smell too. The burning. Do you 
                        punish all of them also?

           This affects Joseph. Where do we draw the line of 
           responsibility? 

                                 HERMINE
                        You think you would not work at 
                        the camp. Fine. What if you were 
                        in the downtown? What would you 
                        do?

           He doesn’t know the answer to that. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Would you do what everyone else 
                        was? Or be in danger?

           We see the struggle on Joseph’s face. Is there a grey area?

                                 HERMINE
                        What do you want from me? Do you 
                        want me to tell you I have 
                        nightmares? I do.

           Is she telling the truth? 

           Then like it’s the ultimate excuse: 

                                 HERMINE
                        I did not have children.

           He doesn’t know what to say. He’s doesn’t know how to feel.

                                 HERMINE
                        Joseph -

           He CRINGES at her saying his name. 

                                 HERMINE
                        I make good house. I am good wife. 
                        Look at me.

           He does. But the answer is not in her face. 
                                 JOSEPH
                        Your husband doesn’t know.

                                 HERMINE
                        You will ruin his life. He is a 
                        good man. He is innocent.

                                 JOSEPH
                        All those people were innocent.

                                 HERMINE
                        I was a nurse. Fifteen or sixteen 
                        years later you want to punish me 
                        for this?

           Silence. 

           Then:

                                 JOSEPH
                        My father is a rabbi.

           He waits for her reaction.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Does that bother you?

           Hermine CLENCHES her purse in her lap a little.

                                 HERMINE
                        No. We are in America. You 
                        understand.

                                 JOSEPH
                        No. I don’t.

           He looks away, agitated again. She changes tactics.

                                 HERMINE
                        Please do not write this. I am 
                        begging you. We are not a story. 
                        We are people.

           Joseph makes eye contact with her again.

                                 HERMINE
                        Please. I was only a nurse.

           He does still see a person...

                                 JOSEPH
                        I have work to do.

           He gets up quickly and gets the hell away from her.
           Hermine watches him go. She looks defeated. To a passerby: a 
           sweet, sad lady sitting on a bench alone. 

           INT. INS - DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           The department’s DIRECTOR sits behind a DESK piled high with 
           DISORGANIZED PAPERWORK - a picture of bureaucracy at work. 

           Devito leans into the office, red in the face. 

                                 DEVITO
                        I left you a message.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Devito.

                                 DEVITO
                        I need to talk to you about 
                        somethin’.

           He holds up the FILE in his hand -- Hermine’s.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        I got your message.

           He’s not inviting him in. Or even looking up from the 
           paperwork on the desk in front of him.

                                 DEVITO
                        You did? Good. Then you know we 
                        need to open a review right away. 
                        This woman -

           Devito steps in, but his boss puts his HAND UP to stop him.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Is not a priority right now.

                                 DEVITO
                        Not a priority? She lied on her 
                        forms. And the interview. She’s a 
                        Nazi for God’s sake!

                                 DIRECTOR
                        We don’t even know if that’s true.

                                 DEVITO
                        The New York Times came. They’re 
                        gonna follow up. And if we don’t -

                                 DIRECTOR
                        It’s not something we need to 
                        address right now.
                                 DEVITO
                        But she -

                                 DIRECTOR
                        You’re not hearing me!

           He brings his voice back down, lower than before. 

                                 DIRECTOR
                        You know as well as I do what a 
                        sensitive time this is. If people 
                        start thinking this office doesn’t 
                        know how to keep the bad guys 
                        out...

                                 DEVITO
                        Sir -

                                 DIRECTOR
                        For the public’s sake we ignore it 
                        for now.

           He gives Devito a stern look.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        It’s probably not true anyway.

           Off Devito’s unsettled look...

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           The office EMPTIES at the end of the day.

           Joseph is still at his DESK with STACKS of PAPER and BOOKS, 
           including THE BLACK BOOK - an aggregated testimony of crimes 
           committed against the Jews during the Holocaust.

           His face is contorted in concentration. He takes NOTES:

           Simon Wiesenthal

           Maidanek, Ravensbruck

           Extermination

           All female camps

           Then something catches his EYE. 

           Joseph STARES at his paper... 

           Is it possible?
                                 JOSEPH
                           (to himself)
                        No... No.

           He FLIPS back in his notes to where he wrote:

           NURSE. 

           He reads slowly from the BLACK BOOK:

                                 JOSEPH
                        From 1942 onward, Maidanek 
                        employed female overseers...

           His FINGER finds her name.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hermine Braunsteiner.

           It’s like a slap in the face.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (to himself)
                        She was a guard?

           Then louder to no one in particular:

                                 JOSEPH
                        She said she was a nurse.

           RING!

                                 JOSEPH
                           (distracted, answering)
                        Lelyveld.

           Switch back and forth where appropriate with:

           INT. INS - MAIN OFFICE - DAY 

                                 DEVITO
                        Anthony Devito calling.

           He’s hunched over his desk, speaking in a HUSHED voice. 

                                 JOSEPH
                           (jumping in)
                        Hermine Ryan.

                                 DEVITO
                        You -
                                 JOSEPH
                        I spoke to her. She’s a citizen. 
                        Your office -

                                 DEVITO
                        Listen, I’m not supposed to be 
                        talkin’ to you -

                                 JOSEPH
                           (barreling ahead)
                        Mrs. Ryan claims she was only a 
                        nurse in the Nazi party. But I 
                        found her name in our library 
                        records and she’s listed as a 
                        guard. If she was a guard, she 
                        wasn’t some kind of bystander... 
                        she’s a war criminal.

           Silence. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Mr. Devito?

                                 DEVITO
                        Am I speaking anonymously?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Why?

                                 DEVITO
                        My agency... Doesn’t want to move 
                        forward with investigating right 
                        now. But they’ll have to when 
                        there’s a story in the news.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Do you have any information as to 
                        whether she was a guard or a 
                        nurse?

           All he cares about is the answer to this question.

                                 DEVITO
                        Applicants are asked if they have 
                        ever been convicted of a crime on 
                        their forms and in the interview. 
                        She answered no.

                                 JOSEPH
                        So either she wasn’t or she lied.

                                 DEVITO
                        Write the story. Then I can find 
                        out.
           He HANGS UP.

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - SAME

           Joseph gets back to work, determined. He opens a GEOGRAPHY 
           BOOK to the page on MAIDANEK, Poland. One PHOTO looks 
           familiar. Lake and trees... just like the landscape PAINTING 
           Hermine showed him.

           He gets CHILLS.

           His editor passes by on his way out, RAPS on Joseph's desk. 
           Joseph SNAPS out of it.

                        I need one more day.

           Abe STOPS in his tracks.

                                 ABE
                        You kidding me?

                                 JOSEPH
                        There are reports that she was a 
                        guard but she told me she was a 
                        nurse.

                                 ABE
                        Either way she was a Nazi right?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes but - This woman... she’s 
                        married. She has -

                                 ABE
                        She worked for Hitler! I don’t 
                        care if she was his right hand man 
                        or his mistress! Write what you 
                        know and get it in tonight.

           He leaves Joseph with a job to do. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Hermine does the dishes after dinner. SCRUBBING extra hard. 
           A RECORD scratches, slow JAZZ comes on. 

           Russell comes in from the living room and KISSES her shoulder.

                                 RUSSELL
                        You don’t have to finish all that 
                        now.

           She lets out a little laugh.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Come on. Dance with me.

           He gets her to turn around. They start dancing. At first her 
           eyes flit to the dirty dishes, but eventually they settle on 
           him. 

           They rock back and forth. It’s sweet, and romantic. 

           She leans her head on his chest.

                                 HERMINE
                        You love me.

           It’s a statement. She is reminding herself, convincing 
           herself. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Mmm, hmm.

           He’s humming along to the song. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Why?

           He laughs. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Tell me.

           She actually wants an answer. He gets serious. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        When we first met, we were in the 
                        lobby of the hotel and there was 
                        that painting. Do you remember? 
                        And you were telling me about it, 
                        describing it in German. I had no 
                        idea what you were saying. But I 
                        knew it was beautiful.

           She looks up at him. Is that genuine love in her eyes?
                                 HERMINE
                           (pulling away)
                        Sit.

           She motions to the table. 

           She has to tell him.

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT

           Most of the lights are out. The office is empty. It’s eerie. 
           REFLECTIONS bounce off the glass windows. Joseph is the only 
           one there. He has turned in the story, and is clearing off his 
           desk. 

           RING!

                                 JOSEPH

           Silence.

                        Hello?

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Russell clears his throat.

                                 RUSSELL
                        This is Russell Ryan.

           He’s standing in the dark by the couch. His face is heavy.

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - SAME

                                 JOSEPH
                           (surprised)
                        Mr. Ryan.

           He gets his PEN and NOTEBOOK in front of him.

           (Switch back and forth where appropriate.)

                        My wife. She -

                                 JOSEPH
                        She told you.
                                 RUSSELL
                        What she did before... She didn’t 
                        have a choice. She’s a good 
                        person.

                                 JOSEPH
                        She’s a Nazi.

                                 RUSSELL
                        My wife wouldn’t hurt a fly. She 
                        was doing her duty to her country. 
                        It was her job.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Do you know what her role was?

                                 RUSSELL
                        I know there’s no more decent 
                        person on this earth. You can’t 
                        write this.

                                 JOSEPH
                        It’s my job.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Who is doing this? Who told you? 
                        Why? Didn’t they ever hear the 
                        expression let the dead rest?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes, I think they did.

           Beat.

                                 RUSSELL
                           (imploring)
                        You met her. You talked to her. 
                        You know she could not have really 
                        hurt anyone. You met her.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I did.

                                 RUSSELL
                        You know her.

           Joseph’s not sure about that.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        Mr. Ryan, you didn’t know this 
                        about your wife when you married 
                        her?
                                 RUSSELL
                        No.

                                 JOSEPH
                        When did she tell you the truth?

                                 RUSSELL
                        Tonight.

                                 JOSEPH
                        And you called me right after?

                                 RUSSELL
                        Yes.

           Beat.

                                 RUSSELL
                        I love my wife.

           This touches Joseph. And confuses him. She is loved. Even now.

           Is he sure he should publish this? 

           INT. PRINTING ROOM - NIGHT

           Joseph BARGES in. The PRINTING MACHINES are clanging. LAY OUT 
           GUYS and the NIGHT EDITOR buzz around the room.

           Joseph goes up to the Night Editor.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I need to pull my piece.

                                 NIGHT EDITOR
                        What? Which one?

           They have to yell over the noise.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hermine Ryan.

                                 NIGHT EDITOR
                        The Nazi lady?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yeah.

                                 NIGHT EDITOR
                        That’s front page.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I need to fact check.
                                 NIGHT EDITOR
                           (laughing)
                        Why? A Nazi’s not going to win a 
                        libel case.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I just got another call.

                                 NIGHT EDITOR
                        Aren’t you Jewish? And you’re 
                        worried about fact checking this?

                                 JOSEPH
                        We would for anyone else.

           The night editor looks at Joseph, skeptical and annoyed.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           THWACK!

           The sound of a NEWSPAPER hitting the door.

           Hermine throws open the door, GRABS it and TEARS it open, 
           scrambling through the pages to see...

           Nothing.

           The WOMAN IN BLACK comes up behind her, her hand REACHING...

           But it’s really RUSSELL.

           His HAND lands on her shoulder, reassuring. But they can’t 
           look at each other.

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Joseph is still at his desk. He’s been there all night. His 
           clothes from yesterday are wrinkled, his hair is a mess. His 
           eyes are exhausted. He didn’t sleep.

                                 ABE
                        WHAT THE HELL?!

           Abe comes flying from down the hall and SLAMS the day’s PAPER 
           on the table.

                                 ABE
                        I get you on the front page and 
                        you get yourself taken off?
                                 JOSEPH
                        I needed more time to -

                                 ABE
                        When have you ever needed more 
                        time? Now I got advertisers up my 
                        ass, and there’s still a goddamn 
                        Nazi living in Queens!

           He sucks in a breath. 

                                 ABE
                        We’re running it tomorrow. Inside.

           Beat.

                                 ABE
                        And I’m sorry about your father.

           Joseph looks up, totally caught off guard. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        What?

           Off of Abe’s alarmed expression...

                                 JOSEPH
                        What?

           Joseph GRABS the newspaper off the desk and starts RIPPING 
           through the pages. 

                                 ABE
                           (quietly)
                        Sixteen.

           Joseph finds the page. 

                                 JOSEPH

                        pulled up... and beat them with 
                        tire irons. The victims included 
                        three African American... and a 
                        Rabbi from New York City.

           Joseph is STUNNED. 

           Abe awkwardly reaches out to put his HAND on Joseph’s 
           SHOULDER. 
           INT. JOSEPH’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Joseph BURSTS in.

           His mother is at the table, crying. Carolyn is already there 
           comforting her. 

                                 JOSEPH
                           (frantic)
                        Did he call? Did someone call?

                                 MOTHER
                           (between sobs)
                        Yes.

                                 CAROLYN
                           (taking over)
                        He’s in the hospital. It’s bad. 
                        But he’s stable. They think he’ll 
                        be alright.

           Joseph COLLAPSES into a seat. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I can’t believe - I said - before 
                        he left -

           He takes Carolyn’s hand and tries to let his mind catch up 
           with what just happened. 

           After a few moments:

                                 MOTHER
                           (wiping her eyes)
                        When he gets back here, I’m going 
                        to go home. I’m going to take care 
                        of him. The house. Be a good wife.

           Carolyn listens sympathetically. But Joseph almost LAUGHS.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You can’t. You’re not a housewife.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Hermine MAKES THE BED as Joseph’s voice reads the PRINTED 
           ARTICLE.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        A private investigator of Nazi war 
                        crimes has identified a Queens 
                        housewife as a guard in the death 
                        camp at Maidanek, Poland, in World 
                        War II. The investigator was Simon 
                        Wiesenthal who had a key role in 
                        tracing Adolf Eichmann in 1960.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           She takes out her CURLERS.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        The woman, the former Hermine 
                        Braunsteiner, is now an American 
                        citizen. She lives in Maspeth, 
                        Queen with her husband Russell 
                        Ryan.

           And starts to put on her MAKE UP. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Hermine CLEANS.  

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        According to the source, the woman 
                        served a prison sentence for her 
                        activities at another 
                        concentration camp. But the 
                        Immigration and Naturalization 
                        Service here said that when she 
                        entered the United States she 
                        denied she had ever been convicted 
                        of a crime.

           As she leaves the room, she moves the old MAGAZINE from the 
           coffee table.

           Underneath, the SCRATCH is still there. 

           INT. INS - MAIN OFFICE - DAY

           Devito reads the paper, his FEET up on his desk. 
           PAGE 10:

           Former Nazi Camp Guard Is Now a Housewife in Queens

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        The identification was made by Mr. 
                        Wiesenthal in letters sent from 
                        Vienna to Israeli authorities in 
                        Tel Aviv. Mrs. Ryan, at her home, 
                        declared, that she had no 
                        authority and had worked only in 
                        the infirmary.

           Devito closes the paper and STANDS, ready to get to work.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           A young boy on a BICYCLE rides down the street throwing PAPERS 
           at doorsteps.

           THWACK.

           THWACK.

           Maylene and other NEIGHBORS open their doors and pick them up. 

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        Mr. Wiesenthal said she was 
                        sentenced in 1953 to three years 
                        imprisonment as a minor offender 
                        as an overseer of the Ravensbruck 
                        concentration camp. Little is 
                        known about her activity at the 
                        second camp, Maidanek.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Hermine sits at the table. UNOPENED NEWSPAPER waiting in front 
           of her.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        An official of the Immigration and 
                        Naturalization Service said that 
                        the fact that she had falsely 
                        sworn that she had never been 
                        convicted of a crime might be 
                        grounds for a review of her 
                        citizenship. But he indicated that 
                        such reviews rarely result in the 
                        withdrawal of citizenship.

           Hermine opens the paper. She finds the article about her and 
           looks at it. Her eyes don’t read. They just look. 
                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        For her part, Mrs. Ryan stated, “I 
                        was a nurse. Fifteen or sixteen 
                        years later you want to punish me 
                        for this?”

           She closes the paper neatly. All of her emotions stay locked 
           inside. 

                                 JOSEPH (PRE-LAP)
                        There’s a typo!

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Joseph JABS his finger at the page. Tommy has a seat pulled up 
           next to him. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ater? Ater?

                                 TOMMY
                        Calm down.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Calm down? That’s a quote. That’s 
                        something she said.

                                 TOMMY
                        So they’ll make a correction. 
                        What’s the problem? This. Is. 
                        Huge.

           He SHAKES the paper in Joseph’s face. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        This story will ruin their life.

                                 TOMMY
                        She deserves it! You don’t 
                        actually believe she was only a 
                        nurse do you?

           He doesn’t. But he doesn’t want to admit it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m just saying I should have... 
                        we should get it right.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Hermine stands in an aisle with a BASKET. She fills it with 
           small bags of SEEDS. 
           Another WOMAN pushes her CART down the aisle. But then she 
           sees Hermine and quickly TURNS AROUND.

           Hermine tries to shrug it off.

           She goes to the FRIDGE and gets out bottles of COKE. 

           WHISPERING.

           She looks to her right and sees two women peeking at her, 
           talking in hushed voices. One has the NEWSPAPER under her arm. 

           Hermine looks to her left.

           More STARING SHOPPERS quickly avert their gaze.

           Hermine tries to stay calm, goes to the register.

           The TELLER clocks her as the current CUSTOMER finishes paying.
           When it’s Hermine’s TURN, he puts out an AISLE CLOSED sign and 
           walks away. 

           Hermine can feel all the EYES glaring, SURROUNDING her. 

           She abandons her groceries and LEAVES the store in a hurry.

           Hermine walks across the lawn, tense.

           Groups of women TURN and watch her pass. Their voices HUSH. 
           They move closer together.

           Hermine’s cheeks flush but she keeps walking.

           Moms are SHIELDING their CHILDREN, pulling them away from 
           Hermine as she passes.

           She approaches the side of the chapel where there is now a 
           small patch of DIRT for a garden. Several of the CHURCH WOMEN, 
           including Maylene and Sherry, are there in SUN HATS and 
           GARDENING GLOVES. They have tiny SHOVELS and FLOWERS in 
           PLASTIC POTS, waiting to be planted.

           When Hermine gets closer, a TEENAGE GIRL taps her mom on the 
           shoulder. There’s COMMOTION and a rippling MURMUR as everyone 
           notices her, gets up and moves AWAY. 

           Except Maylene. She stands up and crosses her arms, defiant.

                                 MAYLENE
                        You get away from here.

           Her voice is shaking.
                                 HERMINE
                        Maylene...

                                 MAYLENE
                        Get away.

                                 HERMINE
                        Please.

                                 MAYLENE
                           (getting worked up)
                        We let you into our church, into 
                        our homes. You’re a liar. You’re 
                        the devil.

           Her eyes WELL UP with tears of betrayal. 

           Hermine looks around, mortified. She catches Sherry’s eye. 
           Sherry AVERTS her gaze. 

                                 MAYLENE
                        You’re sick.

                                 HERMINE
                        I can explain.

                                 MAYLENE
                        Go away. You’re not one of us.

           There’s nothing that could hurt Hermine more. She backs up, 
           and starts to walk away. JUDGING EYES from the rest of the 
           community burn into her from all sides. 

           She starts to RUN.

           She FALLS.

           When she picks herself up she is covered in GRASS STAINS and 
           dirt, there’s a hole in her blouse, her hair is knocked out of 
           place, face red.

           She doesn’t look like a housewife anymore.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           The skeleton of a building is waiting to be filled. 
           CONSTRUCTION GUYS work on and around it -- blue shirts, grey 
           pants, hard hats. 

           Russell is on the TOP LEVEL. SMALL WIRES in his hands.

           A muscular CONSTRUCTION GUY walks behind him, carrying a pile 
           of METAL BARS. He’s gruff and hairy, and only wearing his 
           undershirt.
                                 CONSTRUCTION GUY
                        Watch out.

           Russell SCOOTS over to let him pass. Not offended.

                                 CONSTRUCTION GUY
                        Nazi fucker.

           Russell drops what he is doing.

                                 RUSSELL
                        What’d you say?

           The guy ignores him, puts down the METAL BARS, and starts 
           separating them. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        Hey. Hey!

           This time the guy turns around. 

                                 CONSTRUCTION GUY
                        You want me to say it louder?

           Russell CHARGES him, grabs his collar and knocks him up 
           against the LEDGE. He’s twice Russell’s size but helpless once 
           he is off balance. The other guys see the rush happen and 
           SHOUT, but they can’t intervene or someone will fall.

                                 CONSTRUCTION GUY
                        What the - !

                                 RUSSELL
                        Don’t fucking talk about my wife. 
                        Ever. Again.

           He gives one more SHAKE. Then lets go and the guy pulls 
           himself forward. A few of the other guys rush over. They stare 
           at Russell walking away, taking off his HARD HAT, ostracized 
           and probably fired.

           EXT. RYAN HOUSE - DAY

           People start to CROWD on the sidewalk. Some hold signs:

           GET OUT, NAZI SCUM

           GO HOME, HITLER

           MURDERER

           Some just watch and GOSSIP.  

           Hermine PEEKS out at the commotion through her CURTAIN.
           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           There’s a bag of TRASH sitting by the door. But she can’t go 
           out there right now. She can’t finish cleaning.

           Her eyes dart from the trash to the MOB outside. Their YELLING 
           fills her head. Her breath gets shorter. The trash sitting 
           there is UNBEARABLE.

           Her world is crumbling. 

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Hermine SWOOPS in and opens the cabinet. She GRABS out the 
           WOOD BOX. She takes out the METAL OBJECT.

           She FUMBLES the box and it BANGS to the floor.  

           She CLUTCHES the metal object in her SHAKING HANDS like she’s 
           praying, WHISPERING to herself. 

           She DROPS the metal object with a CLANG.

           She drops to her KNEES and KNOCKS through the BOTTLES of 
           cleaning supplies under the sink. She YANKS out the BLEACH and 
           a rag. 

           She frantically starts CLEANING. SCRUBBING madly at an already 
           shining kitchen.

           Her curls fall out of the place, her face gets red, her upper 
           lip sweating. 

           She catches her REFLECTION in the shine of the oven. What does 
           she see? The Nazi? The Housewife?

           She grabs the BLEACH...

           And DRINKS it. 

           INT. INS - MAIN OFFICE - NIGHT

           Devito approaches his desk where the DIRECTOR is standing, 
           waiting for him.

                                 DEVITO
                        You saw the article?

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Yeah. You, uh, got the go ahead.
           The director rubs his head, stressed.

                                 DEVITO
                        Great. And you’ll assign another 
                        investigator?

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Yeah, yeah. We’re working on it.

           He doesn’t sound very convincing.

                                 DEVITO
                        Can you believe it? A fuckin’ 
                        Nazi.

           But his boss is already walking away.

           Devito is on his own. 

           He sits down and starts organizing the PAPERS on his desk. He 
           has Joseph’s ARTICLE. He has UNDERLINED the part about her 
           previous conviction.

           He picks up his PHONE and dials.

                                 DEVITO
                           (on phone)
                        Anthony Devito, calling from 
                        Immigration. I need to speak with 
                        someone about getting criminal 
                        records from -  Austria, right, 
                        yes.

           Each time he stops talking to listen he ESCALATES.

                                 DEVITO
                        Who already called? - Well then 
                        you’re sending them? - What do you 
                        mean can’t? - Jeopardize what 
                        agent? - Hello? - Hello?!

           He SLAMS down the phone.

                                 DEVITO
                        Dammit!

           He looks around.

           Something is not right.

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Joseph is at his desk. He looks tired, distracted. Between his 
           dad and Hermine his grip on reality has been shaken.
           His PHONE is to his ear. Waiting...

                                 JOSEPH
                        Dad? - Hi. - How are you feeing?

           He’s being delicate, overly friendly in the wake of his 
           father’s assault.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Work is good, sure. I just 
                        finished another story.

           Joseph looks at his ARTICLE on Hermine, open in front of him. 

           He’s lost in his own mind for a moment...

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m still here.

           Beat. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Actually, I’m not sure if I’m 
                        finished. This woman, she -

           He tries to get a grip on his thoughts.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Dad, the people who did this to 
                        you... Do you think they could 
                        change?

           He listens, hoping for an answer.

           EXT. STREET - DAY 

           Joseph WALKS, focused.

           Up ahead: the SUBWAY ENTRANCE to QUEENS.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 

           Joseph sits at the table with his NOTEBOOK out. Hermine is 
           taking a CAKE out of the oven. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I have to say I’m surprised you 
                        let me in.

                                 HERMINE
                        You were doing your duty. I 
                        understand.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Mrs. Ryan... I heard you had to go 
                        to the hospital.

           She PERCHES the CAKE on a very tall, bright yellow STAND, and 
           starts to FROST it with PINK ICING, using a very LARGE, very 
           SHARP KNIFE that looks CARTOON-LIKE. 

                                 HERMINE
                           (simply)
                        I was a nurse.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You told me that.

           They sit in silence.

                                 HERMINE
                        You are here to ask me more 
                        questions?

                                 JOSEPH
                        To follow up.

                                 HERMINE
                        First I ask you question.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay.

                                 HERMINE
                        What did you think of me? When you 
                        met me.

           He considers how to answer.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I thought you had a lovely home.

                                 HERMINE
                        Good.

           Joseph starts to WRITE something...

           The KNIFE STABS into his hand!

           BLOOD spills onto the PAPER as he gets up in SHOCK and then  
           starts to SCREAM.

           Hermine takes the knife and STABS him again. 

           In the BACK.

           BLOOD splatters on her APRON and soaks into her OVEN MITS.
                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Hermine WAKES from her DREAM.

           The room is mostly bare. She’s in a metal bed. The IV in her 
           arm connects to a bag hanging from a rod.

           Her head is to the side, facing two visitor’s chairs. 

           In one, the WOMAN IN BLACK sits staring at her. On the other, 
           a plate of FRESH COOKIES.

           Hermine’s eyes DRIFT closed. 

           LATER --

           Hermine wakes up again. 

           The CHAIRS are empty. No woman. No cookies.

           She stirs and turns herself to the other side, where Russell 
           sits, CARESSING HER HAND.

                                 RUSSELL
                        I’m here.

           Hermine shuts her eyes.

                                 RUSSELL
                        How are you feeling?

           She opens them. He’s still there. 

           A NURSE comes in and silently checks Hermine’s PULSE and BLOOD 
           PRESSURE. Hermine watches her, getting agitated. 

           When she’s gone: 

                                 HERMINE
                        I do not want that nurse.

                                 RUSSELL
                        What?

                                 HERMINE
                        She does not know what she is 
                        doing.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Yes she does.
                                 HERMINE
                        I was a nurse.

                                 RUSSELL
                        It’s okay.

                                 HERMINE
                        I was a nurse.

                                 RUSSELL
                        I know.

           He takes her hand but she doesn’t reciprocate.

                                 RUSSELL
                        They said you - you did this to 
                        yourself.

           She doesn’t say no.

                                 RUSSELL
                        That you drank... Why? Why would 
                        you do that?

           They look at each other, both pained.

                                 HERMINE
                        I needed to clean.

           Is she talking about the house? Herself? 

           Russell looks at his wife. Does he even know her? He looks 
           like he might break down...

           But he doesn’t. 

                                 RUSSELL
                           (resolved)
                        He did this. That reporter. We’re 
                        going home. I won’t let anything 
                        else happen to us.

           He grabs onto her hand. Hard.

           EXT. RYAN HOUSE - DAY

           The mob is gone. But as Joseph approaches from down the block,  
           three TEENAGERS run up and throw ROCKS at the Ryan’s windows, 
           then run away. 

           Maylene and Sherry stand outside next door. Joseph heads over 
           to them. 
                                 MAYLENE
                           (whispering)
                        I heard she tried to kill herself 
                        yesterday.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Excuse me. Do you live here?

                                 MAYLENE
                        I do. Yes.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Joseph Lelyveld. New York Times. 
                        Do you know the Ryan’s well?

                                 MAYLENE
                        Since they moved in.

                                 SHERRY
                        She was our friend. Part of our 
                        church group.

                                 MAYLENE
                           (shaking her head)
                        To think, right next door. Someone 
                        who was in the... what are they 
                        calling it now? The Holocaust. My 
                        name is Maylene Wright. With a W.

           But Joseph isn’t taking any notes.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Can I ask, what were your 
                        impressions of Hermine?

                                 SHERRY
                        Her house was always so clean...

                                 MAYLENE
                        I knew. This, no. But something. 
                        There was something about her. I 
                        don’t know what it was -

           Who is she kidding?

                                 MAYLENE
                        No. I would have never thought 
                        that Hermine could do something 
                        like that. She is - was - a lovely 
                        woman. A good friend.

           It hurts her to say it.  

           Joseph looks at them, relieved he wasn’t the only one who 
           Hermine tricked. 
                                 JOSEPH
                        Thank you.

           He heads up to the Ryan’s door.

           He’s going to figure her out, once and for all.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Hermine sits at the kitchen table, dazed.

           The WOOD BOX has been picked up. It’s sitting open in front of 
           her. She picks up the METAL OBJECT and FONDLES it between her 
           fingers.

           KNOCKING.

                                 JOSEPH (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Ryan? Hermine!

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She puts the metal object DOWN on the COFFEE TABLE on her way 
           to the door.

           She opens it a little and sees Joseph standing there.

                                 HERMINE
                        What do you want?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I -

           He hesitates. 

                                 HERMINE
                        You wrote the story. It is over.

           She goes to shut the door. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I need to talk to you again. I - 
                        the paper has a few more 
                        questions. We want to give you a 
                        chance to comment.

           She looks at him. Intimidating. 

                                 HERMINE
                        You are not here for the paper.

           She sees right through him.
                                 HERMINE
                        You are here for yourself.

           She leaves the door open and walks away. He can come in if he 
           wants. 

           And he does. He crosses the threshold one more time.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Is your husband -

                                 HERMINE
                        He is at work. If he is not fired. 
                        He says we need money for lawyer.

           He shuts the door. She sits on the couch. Waiting for him to 
           say what he wants to say. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Well.

           He stands tall to confront her.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        You told me you were a nurse.

                                 HERMINE
                        I was.

                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s not what our source said. 
                        And there are records. You were a 
                        guard.

           She looks at him, debating if he can still be manipulated.

                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s why you were in jail for 
                        three years in Austria. Isn’t it? 
                        That’s the truth.

           Fine. He knows. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Three years. Can you believe this? 
                        And now they want something more 
                        from me.

           She gets up and starts FUSSING around the room, fluffing 
           pillows, straightening frames.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You killed people.
                                 HERMINE
                        No.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You were a guard in a death camp.

                                 HERMINE
                        You think a woman had power? I had 
                        no power.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You’re lying!

                                 HERMINE
                        It is the past.

                                 JOSEPH
                        My father was almost killed by 
                        people like you!

                                 HERMINE
                        I am a housewife.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You’re a Nazi! Tell the truth!

           She stops moving and looks at him. Her voice gets low and 
           authoritative.  

                                 HERMINE
                        You do not know war in America. 
                        You send men to war but war is not 
                        here. Not in your streets, in your 
                        home. You do not have to see war. 
                        Have to live war. If war was right 
                        here, what would you do? You do 
                        not know. That is the truth.

           This lands with Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Who are you?

           He’s not yelling anymore. But desperate for an answer.

                                 HERMINE
                        What do you think?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Are you the lady who sat right 
                        there and, and fixed my jacket. Or 
                        are you a murderer? Which is it?

           She maintains power in her calmness. 
           She walks closer to him, right in front of him.

                                 HERMINE
                        You came here today. Are you 
                        afraid of me?

           She looks into his eyes, inches away from his face. And for 
           the first time she does SCARE him. 

           DING!

           The OVEN TIMER.

           At the sound, her face switches back to her habitual polite 
           smile. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Cookies.

           She leaves for the kitchen.

           Joseph paces. He wipes his sweaty palms on his pants.

           He looks around. It still looks like a normal house. But then 
           he sees something shiny on the COFFEE TABLE...

           The metal object.

           He picks it up and we see it up close for the first time:

           A gold PIN with POINTS sticking out on all sides. Something in 
           GERMAN inscribed on the front. 

           It’s a MEDAL. 

           And when he turns it over...

           A SWASTIKA engraved on the back.

           Hermine returns with a plate of COOKIES.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What is this?

           He holds up the MEDAL.

                                 HERMINE
                        What are you doing with that?

                                 JOSEPH
                        What is this?

                                 HERMINE
                        Give that to me.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Is this a medal?

                                 HERMINE
                        Give it to me.

                                 JOSEPH
                        It is, isn’t it?

                                 HERMINE
                        Please.

                                 JOSEPH
                        They don’t give medals to nurses. 
                        They don’t give medals to guards 
                        who didn’t do anything.

                                 HERMINE
                        Stop. Enough.

           She STEPS toward him.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What did you do to get this?

                                 HERMINE
                           (trying to contain herself)
                        I -

                                 JOSEPH
                        Tell me the truth!

           He brandishes it at her. 

                                 HERMINE
                        Put it down.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Unless it’s not yours. Unless this 
                        isn’t yours.

           Then she CRACKS, LOSES IT.

                                 HERMINE
                        I EARNED THIS!

           She FLIES toward him in a fit of RAGE and RIPS the medal from 
           his hand. Almost knocking him over.

                                 HERMINE
                        I earned this!

           She starts ranting in GERMAN. Pure rage. 

           She grips the medal in her FIST. 
           The sharp points STAB into her palm so hard red BLOOD starts 
           to cover her hand and spill off the medal onto the carpet.

           Joseph is paralyzed. He watches in horror as the monster comes 
           out. It’s been there all along. But he can finally see it. 

           He stumbles back, terrified.

           He gets himself out the door and pushes it closed with a -- 

           INT. INS - DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           -- SLAM!

           Devito’s PALMS hit his boss’s DESK.

                                 DEVITO
                        We can’t do that!

           He’s livid, pacing.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        It’s done.

                                 DEVITO
                        So that’s it? She just gets to 
                        stay here and live her life?

                                 DIRECTOR
                        If she agrees to give up her 
                        citizenship, yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        No. It’s not right. This agency’s 
                        job is to uphold the values of 
                        this country. We can’t just sweep 
                        something like this under the rug!

                                 DIRECTOR
                        This goes above you and me.

                                 DEVITO
                        Bullshit!

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Enough.

           He stands. A signal for Devito to leave. Devito can’t believe 
           this is happening.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Hermine sits at the table, staring ahead, blank. She can hear 
           Russell in the other room.
                                 RUSSELL (O.S.)
                        Thank you.

           The sound of him HANGING UP the phone. 

           Russell comes in. He sits down, takes Hermine’s hands. One of 
           which is BANDAGED.

           She can’t look at him.

                                 RUSSELL
                        That was the lawyer.

           She doesn’t say anything. 

                                 RUSSELL
                        They offered not to extradite if 
                        you give up your citizenship.

                                 HERMINE
                        What is extradite?

                                 RUSSELL
                        They send you back to Germany or 
                        somewhere for a trial.

                                 HERMINE
                        They can do this?

                                 RUSSELL
                        Maybe. We would have to go to 
                        court.

           Hermine keeps her eyes down. The monster is gone again. She 
           looks weak and vulnerable.

                                 RUSSELL
                        But they don’t want to do that 
                        either. That’s why they’re 
                        offering you this.

                                 HERMINE
                        I will not be American citizen 
                        anymore.

                                 RUSSELL
                        No. But they won’t make you leave. 
                        You can stay. It will be...

           They both know it won’t be the same.

                                 RUSSELL
                        We can stay.
                                 HERMINE
                        But - the citizenship...

                                 RUSSELL
                        Please.

                                 HERMINE
                        I earned this.

           She says it softly. She doesn’t have the energy to fight 
           anymore.

           EXT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT

           Joseph walks out of the office and down the steps. It’s dark 
           and quiet. No one else around.  

           He passes a BENCH. 

           From which a DARK FIGURE rises...

           Follows him...

           And GRABS his arm.

           Joseph JUMPS!

                                 JOSEPH
                        Holy -

                                 DEVITO
                           (whisper yell)
                        It’s me.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What the hell - Were you waiting 
                        for me?

                                 DEVITO
                        I need to talk you.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Now?

                                 DEVITO
                        They’re sabotaging me.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What? Who?

                                 DEVITO
                        My department. Maybe the CIA too.

           He sounds crazy.
                                 JOSEPH
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DEVITO
                        The Nazi. Her criminal records 
                        from Austria? I couldn’t get them.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Why not?

                                 DEVITO
                        The embassy said they were told 
                        not to attempt to access them. 
                        That they’d be putting an agent 
                        there at risk.

                                 JOSEPH
                        That doesn’t make any sense.

                                 DEVITO
                        Exactly. And now they’re making 
                        her a deal.

                                 JOSEPH
                        A deal?

                                 DEVITO
                        She gives up her citizenship and 
                        they don’t deport her.

                                 JOSEPH
                        They can’t do that! Why?

                                 DEVITO
                        Shh! Don’t you get it? The United 
                        States has never extradited a 
                        citizen. You think they want to 
                        start now? To West Germany?

                                 JOSEPH
                        She lied. She murdered people.

                                 DEVITO
                        And now she’s a little lady who 
                        wears dresses from the Macy’s 
                        catalogue.

           Joseph takes all this in. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        What am I supposed to do?

           Devito looks around, paranoid.
                                 DEVITO
                        I’m still going to work it on my 
                        own. But I need help. Resources. 
                        You can reach out as the press.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I -

           His mind flashes to:

           Hermine touching his shoulder.

           Hermine screaming, stabbing her own hand with the medal.

           He wants nothing to do with this.

                                 JOSEPH
                        No. No. I can’t. I have other 
                        assignments. I’m sorry. I did my 
                        job. You guys do yours.

           He heads down the steps, leaving Devito standing alone.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hermine SCRUBS the BLOOD STAIN on the carpet from where she 
           cut her hand. She is working herself up into a SWEAT.

           But this time it really WON’T COME OUT.

           INT. JOSEPH’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Joseph is READING at a CLEAN kitchen table. His mother fusses 
           over the oven. She’s in a dress. Totally put together. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Your father will be home soon.

           She wipes her hands and walks behind him. 

           CLOSE UP on Joseph as she puts a PLATE down in front of him...

           It’s COOKIES.

           He WHIPS around.

           And sees his mother is HERMINE, smiling with malice. 

           INT. JOSEPH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joseph STARTS awake.
           Sweating, panting.

           He calms himself, registering the room around him, Carolyn 
           SLEEPING next to him. He lays back down. 

           But he can’t get Hermine out of his head.

           INT. INS - MAIN OFFICE - DAY

           Devito’s phone RINGS.

                                 DEVITO
                           (answering)
                        Devito.

           On the other end  --  

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES - SAME

           Joseph calls from his desk.

                                 JOSEPH
                        She’s - She can’t stay here.

           Beat.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I want her far away.

           INT. JOSEPH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Devito and Joseph take over the small kitchen table with piles 
           of FILES and PAPERS.

           Among their documents are black and white IMAGES of the 
           atrocities of the Holocaust: 

           Emaciated people.

           Allied tanks passing PILES of bodies.

           BARBED WIRE fences with gas chambers in the distance.

                                 DEVITO
                        Jesus. I can’t look at this stuff.

                                 JOSEPH
                        We have to.

           Carolyn brings three COFFEES to the table and joins them. 
                                 JOSEPH
                        The camp was in Poland, but under 
                        the control of the German state.

                                 DEVITO
                        Well we need at least one of them 
                        to file an extradition request.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What do they need?

                                 DEVITO
                        Proof.

           INT. JOSEPH’S APARTMENT - DAWN

           The PHONE sits in the center of the kitchen table. No one is 
           in the room. Outside the little window, the sky is still dark, 
           the sun isn’t up yet.

           RING!

           Joseph stumbles in from the bedroom in his UNDERWEAR.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (answers)
                        Hello? - Mr. Wiesenthal! - No not 
                        at all. I understand. The time 
                        difference...

           He rubs his eyes. Looks for something to WRITE ON. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Our correspondent in Tel Aviv told 
                        me how I could get in touch with 
                        you.

           There’s only documents and photos on the table. He can’t find 
           anything... 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I - uh - I wanted to speak to you 
                        about Hermine Braunsteiner -  We 
                        did yes. We want her to stand 
                        trial.

           ... so he PULLS one of his old ARTICLES off the wall. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Absolutely. We’re working on 
                        building the case but we could use 
                        your help. How did you first hear 
                        about her?
           Joseph listens and takes NOTES on top of his old story.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Do you have any way of contacting 
                        them? If there was any way to get 
                        written testimony...

           MONTAGE:

           Carolyn FUMBLES to open the front door, her hands filled with 
           LETTERS.

           Joseph sits at the table, carefully opening DOZENS of LETTERS 
           one by one. Some are not in English but the words - the truth 
           - is there. 

           Devito SHOVES take out FOOD from a CONTAINER into his mouth, 
           almost dripping SAUCE onto a letter. But Joseph moves it out 
           of the way just in time.

           LETTERS form a STACK that GROWS and grows on the table. And 
           then starts SPILLING over into BOXES.

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The lights are dimmed. Hermine finishes the DISHES.

           Then she feels Russell’s eyes behind her.

           She stands silent and still, and then:

                                 HERMINE
                        You want to know if there was 
                        more.

                                 RUSSELL
                        No.

           He hangs his head. Ashamed. 

                                 HERMINE
                        You can ask.

           She waits for him to make his move.

                                 RUSSELL
                        In the hotel, when we met... When 
                        you were telling me about the 
                        painting...

           Beat.
                                 RUSSELL
                        You could have been saying 
                        anything.

           She finally turns to him. Goes to him, takes his HANDS.

                                 HERMINE
                        I am your wife. There is no more.

           INT. JOSEPH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joseph is at the table with a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. He looks 
           haggard, eyes RED.

           He has one of the hundreds of VICTIM LETTERS in his hand.

           Carolyn walks carefully in behind him. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        You coming to bed?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yeah.

           But he doesn’t move.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Everything alright?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I keep reading these, these 
                        horrible things that these people 
                        suffered. And I keep waiting to 
                        feel shocked. Shocked that people 
                        did that. That a human was capable 
                        of doing that to another human. I 
                        don’t want to believe that. But I 
                        do. You know the time in all this 
                        when I felt shock, the one thing I 
                        couldn’t believe, was when...

           He trails off into silence. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        When what?

                                 JOSEPH
                        When he called me.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Who?
                                 JOSEPH
                        Her husband.

           Beat.

                                 JOSEPH
                        And told me he still loved her.

           Carolyn puts her hand on his shoulder. And he pulls it down 
           over his HEART.

           EXT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

           Devito sits on a BENCH. Joseph joins him. 

                                 DEVITO
                        We got a court date.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Finally!

           Devito shakes his head, somber. 

                                 DEVITO
                        I talked to a prosecutor friend of 
                        mine, used to be an investigator 
                        with us. We won’t be able to use 
                        the victims’ letters.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What? What about the ones that 
                        mention her directly?

                                 DEVITO
                        For probable cause they’ll want 
                        someone to testify in person.

                                 JOSEPH
                        They can’t do that, they’re in 
                        Europe.

           Devito looks at him. Obviously.

                                 JOSEPH
                           (frantic)
                        But these people - Their stories - 
                        If they don’t allow evidence like 
                        this then their system doesn’t 
                        even work.

                                 DEVITO
                        It’s working just how they want it 
                        to.
                                 JOSEPH
                        What are we going to do?

                                 DEVITO
                        What can we do?

           They look ahead. Devito jaded, Joseph dejected.  

           INT. JOSEPH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joseph sits at the table alone, jaw clenched. He FLIPS through 
           the LETTERS one by one, looking at all the people’s words that 
           won’t get to be heard.

           Then he STOPS on one. He leans forward URGENTLY. He traces his 
           finger over the ENVELOPE, zeroing in on the RETURN ADDRESS in 
           PARIS, but an AMERICAN STAMP.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Classic 60s decor. A counter with round blue stools. A 
           checkered tile floor. Menu items spelled out in rubber letters 
           stuck to a board. Pop music playing.  

           Joseph sits in a plastic booth, tapping his feet, impatient. 

           BELLS jingle.

           The front door opens. A lithe woman enters and looks around 
           nervously. She’s dressed conservatively despite the heat. 

           IT’S THE WOMAN IN BLACK.

           Her face is aged from the one in Hermine’s apparition, 
           wrinkles claw toward her eyes. But it’s her.

           Joseph stands as she slides into the bench across from him. 
           This is RACHEL BERGER (early 40s). 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Rachel Berger? Joseph Lelyveld. 
                        Thank you for meeting me.

           She looks at him, keeping her words to herself for now.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        You should know, I’m a reporter. 
                        But I’m not here in that capacity 
                        today.

                                 RACHEL
                        How did you find me?
           She speaks with a FRENCH ACCENT.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Why were you hiding?

           She doesn’t trust him.

           He takes out her LETTER.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You sent us this letter but wanted 
                        us to think you were in Paris.

           She looks at the letter between them.

                                 RACHEL
                        This is the truth.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I know it is.

                                 RACHEL
                        I do not have anything more to 
                        say.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay.

           He needs to keep her here until he explains.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ms. Berger -

                                 RACHEL
                        Mr. Wiesenthal said she is going 
                        to trial. That you will read 
                        these.

                                 JOSEPH
                        She is going to trial. We want her 
                        sent back to Germany. To put her 
                        in prison. But they won’t let us 
                        read these. We need someone to 
                        testify in person.

           Beat. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Did you read this?

           She looks at her letter.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.
           He looks at Rachel with something beyond sympathy in his eyes. 
           But he knows there is nothing he can say.

                                 RACHEL
                        You know I cannot go. Be in the 
                        same room with her.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I know it’s asking a lot...

                                 RACHEL
                        I am sorry.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Don’t you want to see her put 
                        away? She deserves to be punished.

                                 RACHEL
                        What will this change?

           She looks at him. In her eyes is a pain that won’t be cured. 
           No matter what happens to Hermine. 

           He re-phrases:

                                 JOSEPH
                        This deserves to be heard.

           He holds up her LETTER. 

           But Rachel still looks unsure. 

           INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

           A wood-paneled room. 

           JUDGE MISCHLER (60s) presides up front. No jury.

           Devito sits at the prosecutor’s table. 

           Hermine and her ATTORNEY sit at the other table. She is 
           poised, wearing a crisp DRESS, her hands folded neatly. 

           Russell sits right behind her in the FRONT ROW.

           Joseph sits in the BACK, among other spectators.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Your honor, both components of 
                        this extradition equation are 
                        faulty. The validity of the 
                        country’s right to file this case 
                        should not be ignored.
                           (MORE)
                                 ATTORNEY (CONT’D)
                        The location in question is a 
                        Polish city.

                                 DEVITO
                        Which was occupied and controlled 
                        by Germany.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Germany, West Germany, occupied 
                        Poland, occupied Austria... the 
                        countries’ boundaries were not 
                        clear at the time of the alleged 
                        crime.

                                 JUDGE
                        I believe multiple countries tried 
                        to file this request.

           Hermine looks composed in her seat, harmless. But inside her 
           mind is agitated.

           Hermine’s POV: The dust on the table.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Furthermore, my client cannot be a 
                        fugitive. She is a citizen of the 
                        United States. She did not leave 
                        her country to escape prosecution.

                                 DEVITO
                        Mrs. Braunsteiner obtained that 
                        citizenship, which she 
                        subsequently surrendered, by 
                        providing false information. She 
                        did not report her previous 
                        criminal record at the time of her 
                        application as is required by law. 
                        She was in fact convicted of 
                        crimes. We have information that 
                        she served three years in an 
                        Austrian jail for manslaughter, 
                        assault, and infanticide.

           A water stain on the tile.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        The actions in question should be 
                        exempt from political 
                        transgression. Mrs. Ryan was 
                        living within a state of war.
                                 DEVITO
                        I don’t think it’s far reaching to 
                        say what the Nazi party did was 
                        beyond war.

           A crack in the ceiling.

                                 JUDGE
                        I do find troubling the defense’s 
                        motion to dismiss based on the 
                        issue of double jeopardy. If the 
                        defendant already served time her 
                        for actions.

                                 DEVITO
                        She was charged with crimes in 
                        Austria. The extradition is being 
                        filed by West Germany.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        As I said before, the boundaries 
                        of these countries at the time of 
                        the crime were hardly concrete.

           The judge holds up his hand to let Devito continue.

                                 DEVITO
                        She worked at two camps. She was 
                        tried and convicted of crimes at 
                        Ravensbruck. Charges have never 
                        been brought against her for 
                        crimes committed at Maidanek.

           A button missing from Devito’s sleeve.

                                 JUDGE
                        And you have official records of 
                        these crimes?

                                 DEVITO
                        No, your honor. But we do have 
                        hundreds of statements from 
                        witnesses, victims of the camp, 
                        recounting their treatment there, 
                        some including specifics of Mrs. 
                        Braunsteiner’s heinous acts.

           He holds up the STACK of LETTERS.

           The judge considers.

                                 JUDGE
                        Unless these witnesses are 
                        present, the court cannot hear 
                        these accounts.
                                 ATTORNEY
                           (to Devito)
                        That’d be hearsay, counselor.

                                 JUDGE
                        Are any of the witnesses here 
                        today?

           Russell looks HOPEFUL. 

           Joseph HOLDS HIS BREATH.

                                 DEVITO
                        Yes, your honor. One.

           Hermine becomes ALERT.

                                 DEVITO
                        Rachel Berger.

           Rachel RISES from the crowd, glancing at Joseph for 
           encouragement. As she crosses the room, Hermine’s eyes HARDEN 
           with hatred.

           Rachel takes the witness seat.  

                                 DEVITO
                        Thank you for joining us here 
                        today, Ms. Berger. You live in New 
                        Jersey, is that correct?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        How long have you lived there?

                                 RACHEL
                        Fifteen years.

                                 DEVITO
                        And you’re a naturalized citizen?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        A legal one.

           He pauses for effect. 

                                 DEVITO
                        Where did you live before you came 
                        to the United States?
                                 RACHEL
                        Paris.

                                 DEVITO
                        You were born there?

                                 RACHEL
                        I was born in Poland.

                                 DEVITO
                        Ms. Berger, have you ever seen the 
                        defendant before?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

           She keeps her eyes GLUED to Devito, not letting herself look 
           at Hermine and lose her nerve. 

                                 RACHEL
                           (hushed)
                        Kobyla.

                                 DEVITO
                        I’m sorry?

                                 RACHEL
                        This is what we call her. Kobyla.

                                 DEVITO
                        To clarify for the court, you’re 
                        talking about this woman, Hermine 
                        Braunsteiner.

           He motions, but Rachel doesn’t still look. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        And when was the last time you saw 
                        Mrs. Braunsteiner?

                                 RACHEL
                        Twenty years ago. I was a prisoner 
                        at a concentration camp in Poland.

                                 DEVITO
                        And she worked at that camp.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.
                                 DEVITO
                        What was her position?

                                 RACHEL
                        She was a guard.

                                 DEVITO
                        What did she do as a guard?

                                 RACHEL
                        The lines. People to the right. 
                        People to the left.

                                 DEVITO
                        Where were these people going to 
                        the right and the left?

                                 RACHEL
                        Right to the factory. Left to... 
                        the gas.

                                 DEVITO
                        She sent people to die.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

           He lets this land.

           Hermine’s KNUCKLES CLENCH white, her NAILS dig into her own 
           skin. Her facade is crumbling around her and there’s nothing 
           she can do about it. 

                                 DEVITO
                        How many people would you say she 
                        sent to be killed?

                                 RACHEL
                        I came on train with one hundred 
                        people. Half of us to the right. 
                        More came other days.

                                 DEVITO
                        This was part of her job, this 
                        selection process. And there were 
                        other guards who did the same 
                        thing?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        But Hermine Braunsteiner, she 
                        stood out to you, is that right?
                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        Why is that?

           She takes a deep breath, steeling herself. 

                                 RACHEL
                        She used a whip.

                                 DEVITO
                        You saw her whip women?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.

                                 DEVITO
                        And did she ever beat you?

                                 RACHEL
                        No.

           She’s holding something back. 

                                 DEVITO
                        But she did terrorize you.

           Joseph LEANS forward.

                                 DEVITO
                        Can you tell the court what 
                        happened?

           Rachel takes a breath.

                                 RACHEL
                        We were working. Moving sacks from 
                        the factory.

           She seems to drift off during her story. Like she can’t bear 
           to be present while telling it. 

                                 RACHEL
                        My daughter. She was so young but 
                        working too. A woman with us fell. 
                        She was old and bleeding. I ripped 
                        a piece of cloth from my dress and 
                        try to help her. She - Kobyla - 
                        she saw me and screamed to stop. 
                        But I had to help her. So I did 
                        not stop. She came over. Took out 
                        her whip. Raise it at me.

           Rachel raises her arm. She’s trying to stay strong. But the 
           story is taking her back there.
                                 RACHEL
                        But then she see my daughter. She 
                        put her whip away. Instead she 
                        grab my daughter by the hair. 
                        Throw her down in front of me and 
                        kick her. And kick her.

           She breaks down.

                                 RACHEL
                        And... I try - could not...

           TEARS are streaming down her face, but she makes herself 
           finish the story.

                                 RACHEL
                        The spikes on her boots. This is 
                        why we call her Kobyla. Stomping 
                        mare.

           Stunned silence.

                                 RACHEL
                        When my daughter was... not 
                        moving, she take out a knife and 
                        cut her own wrist. She look at me 
                        and says, ‘Rette Mich. Save me. 
                        You want to act like a nurse, 
                        here. Save me. Or I will kill you 
                        too.’

           Beat.  

                                 RACHEL
                           (barely audible)
                        And I did.

           The room is frozen.

                                 RACHEL
                        I saved the woman who killed my 
                        daughter.

           Not even Joseph’s pen moves. 

           Russell shuts his eyes and hangs his head. 

           Rachel forces herself to look at Hermine.

           Hermine AVERTS her gaze. Her evil finally exposed.

           EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY

           Rachel walks down the STAIRS. Her head held high.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Rachel. Rachel!

           He runs after her, calling out. 

           But she DISAPPEARS into the CROWD. 

           Joseph looks out at the hundreds of people passing by, each 
           going somewhere, each with their own past, each with something 
           unknown within.

           INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

           The final day of the trial. Everyone in their normal seats. 
           PRESS present. A palpable anticipation.

                                 JUDGE
                        Will the defendant please rise.

           Hermine STANDS. As she does, she looks behind her. She and 
           Joseph make EYE CONTACT. She’s not scared, or sad. She is 
           simply resigned.

           After a moment she TURNS to face the front, her BACK to 
           Joseph. Shoulders back, hands folded politely. 

                                 JUDGE
                        I hereby grant the extradition of 
                        Hermine Ryan to the requesting 
                        nation of West Germany...

           INT. RYAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Russell is DRUNK, bottle in hand. 

                                 JUDGE (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Ryan is hereby remanded to 
                        police custody until such transfer 
                        can be arranged. Upon extradition 
                        she will not be permitted to re-
                        enter the United States...

           The judge’s voice fades, leaving a void of silence.

           Russell looks around the house. It’s a foreign place without 
           his wife in it.

           His eyes land on the BLOOD STAIN on the carpet...

           A sickened, animal YELL escapes from him. 

           He FLIPS the coffee table and starts to SMASH everything in 
           the room. He FALLS on his knees and rips the cushions off the 
           couch. He SCREAMS and THRASHES until his face is red.
           And then the TEARS come.

           Russell is alone, deflated, shaking on the floor. 

           His dropped bottle SPILLS all over the carpet next to him. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Inside a black FORD with government PLATES. Devito and Joseph 
           look out the window at a small PLANE. The BOARDING STAIRS 
           down, waiting.

                                 DEVITO
                        She’s probably not the only one 
                        here.

                                 JOSEPH
                        She’s the one we found.

                                 DEVITO
                        Maybe that’s what we get for 
                        opening our doors to people.

                                 JOSEPH
                        We also opened our doors for 
                        Rachel Berger.

           They sit in this. Still struggling with it all.

                                 DEVITO
                        When I did her interview she 
                        seemed normal. Nice.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I was in her house.

                                 DEVITO
                        I thought you would be able to 
                        tell, ya know?

           Joseph knows exactly what he means.

                                 DEVITO
                        Let me ask you somethin’. You 
                        think anyone could do that?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Do what?

                                 DEVITO
                        Be like her. Do those things. If 
                        they were in that situation.

           Joseph stays silent. He thinks the answer is yes. But he 
           doesn’t want to say it out loud.
                                 DEVITO
                        Or she’s just crazy. Has split 
                        personalities.

           Devito’s trying to convince himself. But they both know it’s 
           not the truth.

           Another CAR pulls up.

           Hermine gets out, escorted by two AGENTS. WIND blows her hair 
           and she tries to fix it, still concerned with her appearance.

           EXT. TARMAC - SAME

           Joseph gets out of the car. 

           Hermine sees him and says something to her escorts. They let 
           her walk over to him alone.

           When she and Joseph are face to face they stand in silence. 
           It’s not tense like before. They’re still opponents, but the 
           match is over.  

                                 HERMINE
                        Is that coffee? On your shirt.

           Joseph looks down at a light brown STAIN over his heart. Then 
           back up at her.

           Beat.

                                 HERMINE
                        I wanted to be a nurse.

           Finally she is telling the truth.

                                 HERMINE
                        I could not afford the school. I 
                        went to work as maid. When the war 
                        began... the party paid four times 
                        what I make.

                                 JOSEPH
                        And you became a murderer.

           She almost shrugs. As if it’s just the way her story went. Not 
           what she chose. 

                                 HERMINE
                        I knew you would come. To my door.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You thought someone would find 
                        you?
                                 HERMINE
                        Yes. One day.

           She looks down at his SHIRT again.

                                 HERMINE
                        Soda water is a good trick.

           She walks away and is escorted up into the plane. She doesn’t 
           look back.

           But Joseph can’t look away.

                                                                FADE OUT.

           INT. GERMAN PRISON CELL - NIGHT

           Hermine, dress replaced by a plain UNIFORM, sits on a hard 
           bed, locked inside walls of grey.

           Her face is expressionless.

           Then she starts to laugh.

           And cry. 

           A wave of sorrow, anger, guilt, relief.

           Alone, she can finally let go.

           DAY

           Hermine wakes up in the bare cell. She takes a moment to 
           adjust where she is. 

           Her hair is wild. No make up. She is stripped. Raw.

           The Nazi in her is real. 

           She gets up and MAKES THE BED.

           Tucks the edge of the sheet under, folding, smoothing, pat 
           pat. Same as at home. 

           She reaches UNDER the mattress and takes out a SHARP OBJECT. A 
           piece of wood filed into a WEAPON.

           She takes it in her hand...

           Is she going to hurt herself? Someone else?

           No. 
           It’s a NEEDLE. 

           She pulls a piece of THREAD from the seam of the sheet, and 
           starts to fix a tiny HOLE in the pillowcase. 

           The housewife in her is real too.

           Over the image of her sewing...

           POST SCRIPT:

           Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan was the first U.S. citizen 
           extradited for war crimes. 

           Along with several other women, she stood trial for the deaths 
           of over 200,000 Maidanek prisoners in Germany’s longest and 
           most expensive Nazi trial.

           She received a life sentence.

           Anthony Devito and his partner in the case, Vincent Schiano, 
           left the INS shortly after Hermine’s extradition. 

           Later, the DOJ office of Special Investigations was 
           established to seek out and deport war criminals.

           The reporter, Joseph Lelyveld, eventually became the executive 
           editor of the New York Times.

           Hermine was released after 15 years for health reasons. She 
           died three years later in 1999.

           Her husband Russell Ryan never left her.

           He was last seen pushing his wife in a wheelchair through a 
           market in Germany, asking her if she wanted some flowers.

                                    THE END.
