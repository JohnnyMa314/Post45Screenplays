                  THE TIME TRAVERLER’S LA RONDE

            Los Angeles, CA 90034                 
           EXT. NAPA VALLEY VINEYARD - DUSK

           LEONARD SULLIVAN (39) has a look about him that suggests he’s 
           made peace with being alone. His skin is warm from the sun, 
           and he wears a thick unruly beard, jeans, and a dirty 
           flannel. He walks through the vineyard, checking his grapes, 
           bending down to rub his fingers through the dirt, touces the 
           leaves, smells the vine...

           This is his sanctuary. He walks on, as we move to a--

           WIDER ANGLE-- and see, throughout the vineyard,  A DOZEN 
           HOVERING DRONES surveying the vines and conducting targeted 
           waterings.

           That’s odd. And then we see why:

           CARD: NAPA VALLEY - AUGUST 2154 Then under it: 

           ULTIMATE DATE -- NOVEMBER 499 AT (AFTER TIME) 

           Leonard walks. Alone.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Leonard watches TV. Or rather, he watches a HOLOGRAPHIC 
           SCREEN projected at the foot of his bed.

                                 REPORTER
                        The Quintennial Cup continues 
                        tomorrow with the semi-final match 
                        as German Captain Rolf Mueller 
                        leads the underdog nineteenth 
                        century team against Brazilian 
                        super star Paolo Johnson for the 
                        twenty-first century...

           SOUND OF DINNNNG. 

           Above the B-ROLL of the Brazilian super star Paolo Johnson, 
           the text: NEW VIDEO MESSAGE FROM: MINISTRY OF HEALTH.

           Leonard waves his hand toward the hologram. It shrinks in 
           size as it glides toward him. Leonard taps the surface of the 
           hologram, opening his VIDEO MESSAGES. He presses PLAY.

           FULL SCREEN VIDEO: 

           The VIDEO has an opening title card that reads: MINISTRY OF 
           HEALTH.

           A quick PIANO INTRO accompanies the text. Over the piano we 
           hear a voice-over say...
                                 VOICE-OVER
                        This is a message from the Ministry 
                        of Health’s Inter-Time Hospital and 
                        Research Facility.

           The video cuts to a young man sitting at a desk. (He’s 
           dressed, for reasons that might not be clear to us now, in 
           attire we recognize as EARLY 1960’s.)

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Hello. This is a message for 
                        Leonard Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan, I’m 
                        calling from the ID ward of the 
                        Inter-time Hospital and Research 
                        Facility. The doctor would like to 
                        meet with you...

           That gets Leonard’s attention.

                                 YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        ...regarding your father’s 
                        condition. There is some urgency to 
                        the matter so please do schedule a 
                        time as quickly-

           HOUSE - LATER

           Leonard, holding his phone, paces in his boxers and a white 
           shirt. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Yes. Yes. Yes, I-
                             (beat)
                        Yes. Can I just ask? Is he okay, my 
                        dad? Is he healthy? Or as healthy 
                        as we can-
                             (beat)
                        Yes. No, no. I can be there 
                        tomorrow. Are you in the same 
                        location? In Paris? 
                             (jotting down an address)
                        Okay. And when are you located now?

           EXT. HYPERLOOP TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING

           Leonard, standing before the NAPA VALLEY platform sign, 
           watches as the train comes to an incredibly fast but graceful 
           stop.

           INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Leonard enters. There are seats available, but he settles for 
           standing room. The train starts again. Outside the window, 
           the exterior blurs. This train moves.
           We see some of the other passengers using their holographic 
           devices to display various videos in front of them. Some of 
           them use it to read the newspaper, swiping their hands to 
           turn the page, but most are watching a soccer match. At once, 
           they all groan at a shot just barely missed.

           Leonard notices one woman using her device to read a book. 
           She’s pretty. She looks up and notices him. He’s nervous and 
           looks away. He turns back. She’s shifted her body away from 
           him.

           The train stops again. 

           We see the platform sign. SAN FRANCISCO. Yes. We just 
           travelled from Napa Valley to San Francisco in the course of 
           one awkward interaction and a missed goal.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - HYPERLOOP PLATFORM

           Leonard crosses the platform where SELF DRIVING TAXIS 
           attached to monorails are lined up for commuters. Leonard 
           enters one.

           INT. SELF DRIVING TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           The inside of the car is almost unrecognizable to us. No 
           steering wheel, no dashboard, just two pairs of seats facing 
           each other with a table in the middle. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Air and time port.

                                 TAXI
                        Destination. Air and Time Port.

           The car ascends the monorail above the city. Roads and 
           streets have been replaced with tree-lined walking trails, as 
           though buildings had sprung up organically inside of a giant 
           park.

           Outside, we see San Francisco’s FERRY BUILDING. Behind that, 
           the BBAY BRIDGE; behind that, an impossibly huge projection 
           of the SOCCER MATCH being DISPLAYED AGAINST THE SKY over the 
           bay.

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - LATER

           Leonard walks through the terminal alone. We notice lots of 
           families. People laughing on benches. People using their 
           devices to display video calls. And Leonard, alone.

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

           Leonard puts on his seat belt as the engine revs up.
                                 PILOT (INTERCOM)
                        Flight 1296 San Francisco to Paris. 
                        Please prepare for take off.

           The plane, with no acceleration at all, just explodes off the 
           tarmac. The passengers shake.

           Leonard closes his eyes. The sunlight outside dips in, then 
           out, from the window. 

           Leonard takes a deep breath, then... 

           Darkness... for just a moment before the cabin lights fade 
           up.

           It’s calm now. Leonard exhales as we notice he...

           Floats. Weightless. We’re in Zero-G.

           He looks outside. There’s earth, the eastern United States, 
           the Atlantic Ocean, Europe... Then, just like that-

                                 PILOT (INTERCOM) (CONT’D)
                        Passengers, please prepare for 
                        landing.

           Leonard takes another deep breath and...

           We’re back inside the atmosphere. The chaos returns. Leonard 
           closes his eyes.

           INT. AIRPORT - MORNING

           Leonard follows a sign toward: TIMEPORT. He passes families, 
           couples, and people on the phone laughing. 

                                 CONDUCTOR (PRE-LAP)
                        Weather for Pairs, France on the 
                        date of July 15th, 1962 will be 
                        unseasonably cool with a high of 20 
                        degrees occurring just after 1500.

           INT. TIME MACHINE - AFTERNOON

           The time machine looks like a train car made entirely of 
           glass. Seats face toward the center where we find a small 
           control panel. 

           The panel is currently occupied by a CONDUCTOR- who in this 
           moment is standing and speaking to the few passengers dotted 
           throughout the vessel. None of whom seem particularly 
           impressed by what’s about to happen...

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Sixteen minutes of light rain will 
                        begin at 1722.
           Through the machine’s glass floor, we see what looks like a 
           complicated SERIES OF CIRCULAR TUBES.

           We begin to hear a WHIRRING NOISE... What looks like a BALL 
           in one of the tubes begins looping around.

                                 CONDUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        On this date in original history 
                        the Tour De France concluded in 
                        Paris. It was won by Jacques 
                        Anquetil. 

           The ball ACCELERATES. It no longer looks like a moving 
           object...just a solid circle. 

                                 CONDUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You’re traveling through time with 
                        Aevum Timelines. My name is 
                        Francois Greene and I am your 
                        conductor. Please relax, and 
                        prepare for travel...

           Something POPS. Then a CRACK. A flash of light. 

                                 CONDUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        The next time you see me will be 
                        exactly one minute in the future, 
                        and roughly six centuries in the 
                        past.

           The WHIR crescendos into a howling SHRIEK. The POPS and 
           CRACKS increase, more light streaks, and then SNAP-

           The time machine DISAPPEARS...

           ...as we...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           TITLE CARD:

                            THE TIME TRAVELER’S LA RONDE

                                                            OVER BLACK:
           SILENCE... THEN:

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        If you stop for just a minute, you 
                        can hear the sounds of time.

           SOUND of FILM REELING through a projector.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Film reeling through a projector...

           Soft, out of focus colors splash onto the screen. Orange. 
           Yellow. Blue. Green. Fading in and out. Overlapping. Creating 
           new colors.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        The cracks of ice melting.

           SOUND of an ICE CUBE CRACKING. 

           BENEATH THAT: SOUND OF GLACIERS BREAKING...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Or the silence that exists between 
                        a question being asked, and a 
                        question being answered. Who are 
                        you? And when? Are you in the 
                        theater now? Are you happy? What do 
                        you regret? Who do you miss? 
                             (beat)
                        And what, exactly, is it that you 
                        want?

                                 CECILE (PRE-LAP)
                             (in French)
                        What do you want?

           INT. PARISIAN CAFE -  NIGHT

           We’re on a MAN, a dashing man (50’s). He looks like an elder 
           statesmen dressed for a white tie gala. We’ll refer to this 
           man as THE NARRATOR. The Narrator lifts a knowing smile 
           toward the waitress-- 

           CECILE (mid 30’s) tired, but content. 

                                 NARRATOR
                             (English)
                        I need a minute to look at the 
                        menu.

           We’re inside a busy cafe. It looks and feels like the 1960’s, 
           as though Jean Luc Godard might be beating out Breathless on 
           a typewriter at the corner table. Music is playing. People 
           are talking.
                                 CECILE
                             (sweetly)
                        Take your time.

           The Narrator watches Cecile go. And then-- looks at us:

                                 NARRATOR
                        Of course, you could ask me the 
                        same questions. Who am I? What do I 
                        want? What do I regret? All of that 
                        you’ll see. The important questions  
                        now are: Where, When, Why? The 
                        answers to which is this: The end 
                        of La Ronde.

           The Narrator gives us an I-know-you’re-confused-and-I-promise-
           that’s-okay smile. He looks toward the entrance of the cafe.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                             (pointing outside)
                        You see the couple there? 

           Outside, a couple comes toward the cafe.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        They’re about to come into this 
                        cafe. If I leave now, they’ll see 
                        an open table and take it. But we 
                        can’t have that. We’re about to 
                        create all sorts of mischief, you 
                        and I, in order to ensure that this 
                        table is available at precisely the 
                        right time, for precisely the right 
                        person.

           SOUND of CHIME! 

           The couple peer inside the cafe. We see them talking...

           It looks busy.

           Let’s try the place across the street.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Perfect. 

           The Narrator stands. Puts on his coat and gloves.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        It hasn’t been easy. We’ve lied; 
                        we’ve broken hearts; we’ve even 
                        watched someone pass...all to get 
                        here. Well not here, but...

           The Narrator reaches toward another table and picks up a 
           menu. 
                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                             (in french)
                        Do you mind?

                                 PATRON
                             (in french)
                        Not at all.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Merci.

           The Narrator uses the menu to hide his face from--

           SOUND of CHIME! 

           --Leonard, who’s just walked into the cafe.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                             (still to us)
                        Here.

           Leonard is no longer the scruffy looking winemaker we just 
           met. He’s cleaned up. He’s wearing a tuxedo. 

           Leonard unbuttons his coat, glances across the cafe, and 
           finds--

           Cecile. The waitress. She’s laughing with another customer. 

           Leonard freezes. He can’t catch his breath... It can’t be.

           And now, it’s Cecile’s turn to notice Leonard. She does a 
           double take. She stares too. A slow smile. Her eyes welling 
           with tears.

           It’s as though nothing else exists. They walk toward each 
           other, bumping into other customers and other waiters, but 
           never taking their eyes off one another. 

           Then, they arrive in the center of the cafe. They embrace, 
           their lips only inches away, as we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           The Narrator looks through the window. He watches Leonard and 
           Cecile.

           He watches for a long time, until finally:

                                 NARRATOR
                        There are emotions you feel in life 
                        for which no one has bothered to 
                        invent a word. 
                             (looking at us)
                        This is one.
           He begins to walk. He smiles.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        As for the other questions: I am 
                        the conductor of this carousel, La 
                        Ronde. I exist through an infinite 
                        and limited stretch of inter-
                        dimensional time. I am everywhere 
                        and nowhere, nudging and guiding 
                        our players, in order to fulfill an 
                        eternal quest of redemption. But, 
                        you’ll learn more about that 
                        soon... As for us, where are we? 

           He looks around.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        The twentieth century streets of 
                        Paris?

           The lights inside of shops, cafes, street lamps, and windows 
           begin to dim like a swarm of fireflies fading away.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        A soundstage in Los Angeles?

           The Narrator continues walking. The streets of Paris end. 
           We’re on an enormous sound stage. The lights in the stage 
           continue turning off, just as the street lamps had before, 
           until a single lamp silhouettes our narrator.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Or are we here?

           And then that final lamp goes black, and we’re...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        In the dark, as though our eyes 
                        were closed, like a children 
                        playing make believe. Where 
                        anything can be true, so long as it 
                        can be imagined. Yes. This is where 
                        we are. We’re here:

           EXT. NAPA VALLEY - STREET - DAWN

           SOUND OF A BICYCLE CLING CLING...

           A BICYCLE FLIES THROUGH FRAME and we WHIP PAN to FOLLOW IT.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Napa Valley. 1820. With our first 
                        and last player of La Ronde... 

           Riding the bike is CECILE. She’s five years younger now, and 
           not yet a waitress. 
           She rides down a rural road. Cecile is dressed in NURSES 
           SCRUBS that might resemble, but do not exactly match, 19th 
           century style.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Cecile: who’s currently in love 
                        with Leonard, the son of Marie, who 
                        had previously married Harvey...

           Now we’re ahead of Cecile as she turns onto a cobblestone 
           street.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...who became incapable of loving 
                        after sharing an unspoken affection 
                        for Eloise, who once spent the 
                        night with a woman named Nona, who 
                        became a man named Roland and had 
                        his heart broken by Antoine...

           Cecile turns onto a busier road and enters Napa’s small 
           metropolis.

           (If it happens you’re familiar with 1820’s Napa Valley, this 
           version won’t look familiar at all. The architecture is 
           limited to the style and technology of early 19th century, 
           but it is very much lived in, developed, and flourishing.)

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...who experienced love at first 
                        sight upon meeting Claire, who 
                        would later have an affair with 
                        Sanjay, who is about to be asked 
                        for a divorce by...

           INT. CECILE’S HOME - MORNING

           Cecile enters her apartment, wheeling her bike inside. 

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Cecile?

                                 CECILE
                        Sanjay?

           We follow Cecile as she unbuckles her helmet and walks down 
           the front hall.

           CARD: CECILE and SANJAY - MAY, 1820

           ULTIMATE DATE: OCTOBER, 494 AT

           Sanjay hollers from the kitchen.

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Hey! I’m sorry- I didn’t have time 
                        to make a proper breakfast.
                                 CECILE
                             (annoyed but hiding it)
                        That’s okay.

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        You want a bowl of oatmeal?

                                 CECILE
                        Nooo. It’s okay.

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        How was work?

                                 CECILE
                        It was... it was good.

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Yeah?

                                 CECILE
                        Yeah. My patient, Marie, you know?

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Uh-huh.

           Cecile sits on the couch and takes off her shoes. 

                                 CECILE
                        I realized that tomorrow will be 
                        one year since I started working 
                        with her. 

           Cecile waits for a response. Nothing.

                                 CECILE (CONT’D)
                        Sanj?

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Huh?

                                 CECILE
                        I said tomorrow will be one year 
                        since I started with her.

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Oh, yeah.

                                 CECILE
                        It’s unusual. 

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

                                 CECILE
                        Normally patients pass away after a 
                        few weeks at most, but here she is 
                        twelve months later.
                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Yeah?

                                 CECILE
                        She says- she tells her son- Her 
                        son comes in every night to read to 
                        her, you know? 
                             (beat)
                        Sanj?

                                 SANJAY
                        Yeah!

                                 CECILE
                        Her son comes in every night to 
                        read to her, you know?

                                 SANJAY
                        Yeah.

                                 CECILE
                        And she tells him- she tells him 
                        that she won’t die until he falls 
                        in love.
                             (to herself)
                        It’s funny. It’s sweet. 

           She says it’s sweet, but then we see a look of sadness.

                                 CECILE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. Here she still is. One year 
                        later.

           SANJAY (30’s) enters from the kitchen. He’s reading a letter. 
           He clearly hasn’t been listening.

                                 CECILE (CONT’D)
                        Sanjay?

                                 SANJAY
                        Yeah. 
                             (finally looking up)
                        Sorry, which patient is this? 
                        Alfonso?

           Cecile just looks at him. It’s heartbreaking how little he 
           cares.

                                 CECILE
                        No. Alonso. Not Alfonso. And no. 
                        Alonso passed away a while... a 
                        while ago. Nevermind. 

                                 SANJAY
                             (realizing)
                        I’m sorry. Cora’s people are asking 
                        to move the interview up again. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SANJAY (CONT'D)
                        It’s always these really polite 
                        letters like, ‘would it be okay 
                        if’... ‘hope it’s not a burden 
                        that’, as though I have any choice, 
                        you know?

                                 CECILE
                        Yeah.

                                 SANJAY
                        It’s okay. It just leaves me less 
                        time to prepare.

           She brushes passed him. Cold. 

                                 CECILE
                        Uh-huh.

           Sanjay-- clocking that.

           Cecile goes into the kitchen.

           Now we’re with Sanjay as Cecile hollers to him.

                                 SANJAY
                        You okay?

                                 CECILE (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

           She’s not. Sanjay knows it.

           He follows her...

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           She’s filling a TEA KETTLE.

                                 SANJAY
                        I’m sorry I didn’t make breakfast. 
                        I know that was part of the deal-

                                 CECILE
                        I don’t care about breakfast.

                                 SANJAY
                        I know, but that was part of the 
                        deal. It’s just I really have to 
                        prep.

                                 CECILE
                             (trying to be convincing)
                        It’s fine. Really. I don’t care 
                        about breakfast.

           She places the kettle on a grate over a small fire oven and 
           exits the kitchen.
                                 SANJAY
                        Really? Because it feels like you 
                        do.

           He follows her through the...

           LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 CECILE
                        I don’t. I mean, you’re right. That 
                        was part of the deal, but honestly 
                        I don’t care.

                                 SANJAY
                        I do it most days.

           ...and into the...

           BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cecile changes. It isn’t glamorous. Just another marital 
           dispute while one person changes their clothes without 
           fanfare.

                                 CECILE
                        I know.

                                 SANJAY
                        I just couldn’t today because-

                                 CECILE
                        I know, I know. 
                             (with subtle mocking)
                        You have to prep.

           Sanjay starts to look annoyed.

                                 SANJAY
                        What was that?

                                 CECILE
                        What?

                                 SANJAY
                        “You have to prep”.

                                 CECILE
                        You do!

                                 SANJAY
                        So why did you say it like that?

           She looks at him. Let’s be real...

                                 SANJAY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t think I have to prepare?
                                 CECILE
                        It’s an interview with a pop star 
                        for a 19th century teen magazine. 

                                 SANJAY
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 CECILE
                        It means you’re going to ask her, 
                        ‘What were you like in high 
                        school?’ and ‘What’s the best part 
                        of being famous?’ How much 
                        preparation could you possibly  
                        need?

                                 SANJAY
                        Yeah. I guess that’s true. 
                        Although, I suppose you might also 
                        consider that I’m interviewing a, 
                        you know, actual human being with 
                        an entire life’s worth of events 
                        that compile together, and give her 
                        a unique perspective of the world. 
                        But yeah, ‘What were you like in 
                        high school?’ I’ll be sure to write 
                        that down.

           Now, it’s his turn to leave.

           LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sanjay gathers his stuff to leave.

           Cecile follows him.

                                 CECILE
                        I was trying to tell you about my 
                        night. I was talking about work -- 
                        about my patient, who’s dying -- 
                        and I was trying to tell you about 
                        it, but you weren't even listening.

                                 SANJAY
                        I was listening.

                                 CECILE
                        No, you weren’t.

                                 SANJAY
                        You were talking about, whatever, 
                        Alonso! 

                                 CECILE
                        No. I wasn’t. I just told you a 
                        minute ago he passed away. He died. 
                        A guy I worked for died. People die 
                        in my line of work-
                                 SANJAY
                        Ohhh, no-

                                 CECILE
                        And you can’t be bothered to spare 
                        five minutes to hear about it.

                                 SANJAY
                        Is that what this is about? How you 
                        think your work is more important 
                        than mine?

                                 CECILE
                        My work is objectively more 
                        important than yours. But no...

                                 SANJAY
                        Okay. 

           Sanjay leaves again, down the hallway toward the front door.

           Cecile follows him. Gloves off.

                                 CECILE
                        ...that’s not what this is about. 
                        This, apparently, is about me 
                        cracking some facade where you’ve 
                        somehow convinced yourself that 
                        what you do is important at all.

           SUDDENLY -- the TEA KETTLE WHISTLES.

                                 SANJAY
                        Fuck you.

                                 CECILE
                        And it’s about fucking breakfast! 
                        Wake up earlier!  

           Cecile walks into the...

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           ...and turns off the kettle. Sanjay follows.

                                 SANJAY
                        You know what!? I’m sorry I didn’t 
                        live up to my potential. I’m sorry 
                        I didn’t become a Pulitzer Prize 
                        winning investigative journalist, I 
                        really am. I know you thought you 
                        were marrying Nellie Bly, but 
                        instead you married...
                             (unable to find an 
                              analogy)
                        Whatever. Whoever I am. For the 
                        teen magazine.
                                 CECILE
                             (mocking)
                        “Whatever. Whoever I am”. There’s 
                        that Pulitzer Prize winning 
                        potential, firing on all cylinders!

                                 SANJAY
                        God, Cecile!

                                 CECILE
                        Sanjay, the only person who cares 
                        that you didn’t live up to your 
                        potential by winning a Pulitzer 
                        Prize is you. And that, my love, is 
                        because the only person who thinks 
                        you had the potential to win a 
                        Pulitzer Prize in the first place 
                        is also you.

                                 SANJAY
                        God, Cecile, that’s- God. How is it 
                        when I do something wrong, you find 
                        some way to make me the victim.

                                 CECILE
                        You, the victim?! God! If you’re 
                        the victim, why am I the one who 
                        comes home to the smell of perfume 
                        that isn’t mine!

                                 SANJAY
                        Don’t- Don’t go down that road. I 
                        made one mistake, and it was 
                        terrible, but it’s... It isn’t fair 
                        for you to play it like a trump 
                        card every time we get into trivial 
                        arguments about me not making 
                        breakfast.

                                 CECILE
                        I don’t care about breakfast!

                                 SANJAY
                        You just said you did!

                                 CECILE
                        And, it wasn’t just one mistake. It 
                        was a decision...a decision by a 
                        selfish person, who’s incapable of 
                        making anyone - but himself - 
                        happy.

                                 SANJAY
                        That’s not true.

                                 CECILE
                        Oh, no?
                                 SANJAY
                        No. It’s only you I don’t make 
                        happy. And it isn’t that I’m 
                        incapable of it, it’s that I don’t 
                        give enough of a shit to try.

           That knocks Cecile back a little bit.

                                 CECILE
                        And why’s that?

                                 SANJAY
                        Because of how incredibly sad you 
                        make me.

           Sanjay grabs his briefcase. He piles the last of his things 
           into it. 

           We see Cecile. She looks miserable. She watches him. He looks 
           miserable, too.

                                 CECILE
                        Sanjay.

           She says it as though she’s about to apologize...

           He turns to her. 

           There’s a moment. They look at each other. It isn’t anger, or 
           sadness, it’s just exhausted apathy.

           And then:

                                 CECILE (CONT’D)
                        We have to get a divorce.

           ON SANJAY. Dumbstruck. FREEZE FRAME.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        You would be forgiven for assuming 
                        that, in this moment, Sanjay Patel 
                        was quietly replaying the entirety 
                        of his life with Cecile. The night 
                        they met.

           CECILE AND SANJAY MONTAGE:

           BAR - NIGHT

           Sanjay and Cecile make eye contact from across the bar.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Their first kiss.
           ELEVATED TRAIN - NIGHT

           The city train has clear walls making it look invisible. 
           Sanjay and Cecile stand on it. It almost looks like they’re 
           flying. They kiss.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Their first-

           BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: Cecile. Gasping.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Their first-

           PARK - DAY

           It’s a picnic. Sanjay, close to Cecile, whispering:

                                 SANJAY
                        I love you.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Their apartment is sleek with walls at varying degrees of 
           opacity and shifting color. They sit cuddled on the couch, 
           each reading from a different tablet.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        You would be forgiven for assuming, 
                        too, that Sanjay was recalling how 
                        their lust had faded, and their 
                        love grew. Through-

           BAR - NIGHT

           Sitting across from each other. Happy. Having a great 
           conversation. Laughing.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Through-

           BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sleeping in bed.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Through-
           BATHROOM - MORNING

           Sanjay brushing his teeth while Cecile pees.

                                 SANJAY
                             (through his toothpaste)
                        I love you.

           She laughs.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        How their love faded, and their 
                        apathy grew. After-

           BAR - NIGHT

           Cecile on her tablet. Sanjay resenting her.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        After-

           BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Boring emotionless sex that neither seems to enjoy.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        After-

           APARTMENT (THE 19TH CENTURY APARTMENT WE MET THEM IN) - NIGHT

           Sanjay rushing out the door.

                                 SANJAY
                        Gotta run.

                                 CECILE
                             (without looking)
                        Bye.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And their fights.

           APARTMENT - DAY

           Fighting.

                                 SANJAY
                        That’s bullshit. Ohhhh! That’s 
                        unfair!

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        All of their fights.
           APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cecile, screaming. Sanjay, crying.

                                 CECILE
                        How many times?! How many times 
                        were you with her-

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Their last fight.

           APARTMENT - MORNING

           We’ve seen this before.

                                 SANJAY
                        Because of how incredibly sad you 
                        make me.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           We’re back on the FROZEN FRAME of Sanjay’s dumbstruck face. 
           Cecile has just asked for a divorce.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        You would be forgiven for assuming 
                        all of this, but you would be 
                        wrong. Sanjay Patel, in this 
                        moment, was recalling a piece of 
                        advice he’d received seventeen 
                        years earlier.

           UNFREEZE:

                                 SANJAY
                             (mumbling to himself)
                        Make love for days... and kill 
                        yourself.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING 

           But, this isn’t the iconic New York City skyline we’re used 
           to. It is, believe it or not, even more massive.

           ULTIMATE DATE: JULY, 478 AT

           EXT. NEW YORK - STREET - DAY

           The Narrator walks toward a large building and speaks with 
           us:
                                 NARRATOR
                        Of course, we have some idea of 
                        what happens to Cecile after the 
                        divorce. But for now, we’re less 
                        concerned with where it is we’re 
                        going and more concerned with what 
                        it is that brings us there.

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - EVENING

           Sanjay -- NOW IN HIS EARLY TWENTIES -- sits at an assistant’s 
           desk outside of a large EXECUTIVE OFFICE. Three FLOATING 
           TRANSPARENT SCREENS sit before him, each with a different 
           video caller.

                                 SANJAY
                             (on the phone)
                        DuVous Publishing. Henri DuVous’ 
                        office. Please hold.

           Across from Sanjay sits the FIRST ASSISTANT. Male. 30’s. 

                                 SANJAY (CONT’D)
                        Yes, sir. No. No, that’s 
                        impossible, I think. Please hold. 
                        DuVous Publishing. Henri DuVous’ 
                        office. Please hold.

           SOUND of DING. An Elevator door opens, and from it emerges...

           The NARRATOR-- in character. Wearing a loud outfit with large 
           sunglasses.

                                 FIRST ASSISTANT
                             (to the Narrator)
                        Good evening. Is there something I 
                        can help you with?

                                 NARRATOR
                        Armando Clementine for Henri. 

                                 FIRST ASSISTANT
                             (who are you?)
                        I’m sorry. Mr. Duvous’s not in.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Then may I please have the package 
                        he left for me?

                                 FIRST ASSISTANT
                        The... I’m sorry, I don’t have a 
                        package.

                                 NARRATOR
                        You don’t have a package?
                                 FIRST ASSISTANT
                        I’m sorry, but-

                                 NARRATOR
                        Will you take a message for me to 
                        leave Mr. DuVous?

           The First Assistant is beginning to suspect that Mr. 
           Clementine is important.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                             (dictating)
                        Henri. Never mind the whole thing. 
                        Your assistant insisted you left me 
                        no package. Clearly you don’t care 
                        about this transaction...

                                 FIRST ASSISTANT
                        I’m sorry, Mr....?

                                 NARRATOR
                        Clementine!

                                 FIRST ASSISTANT
                        Clementine. Why don’t I check down 
                        the hall for that package?

                                 NARRATOR
                        Why don’t you? And why don’t you 
                        stay there until you have it, 
                        please?

           Sanjay, who’s been watching all this with wide eyes, 
           continues on the phone.

                                 SANJAY
                             (on the phone)
                        He’s booked that day. What does 
                        September look like?

           The first assistant leaves. 

           The Narrator turns to Sanjay.

                                 NARRATOR
                             (winking to Sanjay)
                        Have fun this evening.

           Sanjay looks confused but politely waves anyway.

                                 SANJAY
                        That should be fine, yes, and tell 
                        the Ambassador thank you again.

           The Narrator steps onto the elevator just as--

           HENRI DUVOUS (50’s)-- steps off.
           Henri is tall, broad, and powerful. Even through the screen, 
           we can smell the money on him.

                                 HENRI
                             (pointing toward the empty 
                              desk)
                        Where is he?

                                 SANJAY
                        I...?

                                 HENRI
                             (annoyed)
                        Nevermind. I’ll use you.

           Sanjay scurries up and follows DuVous into the office.

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Outside the office, we see flying cars and trains zooming 
           past.

                                 HENRI
                        I need you to make a delivery for 
                        me.

                                 SANJAY 
                        To the normal address?

                                 HENRI 
                        No. To my home. My wife won’t be in 
                        for two hours. I want you in and 
                        out before she arrives. Understand? 

           DuVous hands Sanjay an ENVELOPE and JEWELRY BOX.

                                 SANJAY
                        Yes, sir.

                                 HENRI
                        There’s a side table on the edge of 
                        our living room. You’ll see it from 
                        the entrance. Place the box and the 
                        card out for her there, and then 
                        leave.

                                 SANJAY
                        Yes, sir.

                                 HENRI
                        Don’t screw this up.

                                 SANJAY
                        Yes, sir.

                                 HENRI
                        Sandy?
                                 SANJAY
                        Sanjay, sir.

                                 HENRI
                        Do not screw this up, Sanjee.

           On Sanjay-- nervous. Nodding.

           INT. DUVOUS APARTMENT - DAY

           Sanjay unlocks the door and enters. 

           He looks around the apartment. It’s large and open with a 
           classic design. 

           Sanjay makes his way into the-

           LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He places the gift box on the side table, at the edge of the 
           living room, and leans the card against it. Then, he 
           hesitates. He looks around, no one is home... he opens the 
           card.

           CARD: (Hand written) Can’t make it tonight. So sorry. Brought 
           you something to wear on our next night out together. With 
           regard, H.

                                 SANJAY
                        With regard? 

           Sanjay shakes his head. Asshole.

           He looks at the box. Opens it. Inside is a DIAMOND NECKLACE.

           SOUND of CLANG in the distance. Sanjay looks up.

                                 SANJAY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           No answer. Sanjay swore he heard-

           SOUND of MUSIC.

           Someone is in the house.

           Sanjay makes his way down the hallway. Still holding the 
           necklace.

           A door is open to the...
           MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sanjay enters slowly. The music is louder. A FORMAL RED GOWN 
           lies on the bed. Lying flat against the wall with no visible 
           turn-table, a SINGLE RECORD SPINS.

           SOUND of a BLOW DRYER. Sanjay whips his head around--

           The door to the bathroom is cracked open, steam wafts out, 
           but through it we see the figure of... 

           A NAKED WOMAN. 

           Sanjay, mouth agape, drops the necklace.

           He breaths heavy. He looks backward, making sure no one else 
           is here, and then - he shouldn’t - he looks again. The steam 
           has cleared further, and we see glimpses of the woman’s hand 
           and hair coming into view. Her neck, her hip.

           CLOSE ON: The woman’s lips, her eyes, her neck, her hair.

           He watches as she slips on her lingerie and moves out of 
           frame.

           Sanjay shifts his position, trying to find her, when 
           suddenly:

           THE DOOR OPENS.

           Sanjay freezes.

           The woman stands at the door... but she isn’t looking at 
           Sanjay. She stares at herself in the mirror. A look of: Who 
           am I?

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           We see the woman fully now, CLAIRE DUVOUS (50’s). Elegant, 
           sad, lonesome. She stares at herself. How did I get here?

           She turns to her room and halts. We stay on her. She looks 
           surprised. She squints her eyes looking at...

           A NECKLACE on the ground...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sanjay makes his way quickly through the living room. He puts 
           the card back in the envelope and the necklace...  the 
           necklace! He looks up.

           The music starts again.

           Sanjay looks desperately for the necklace. He’s on all fours. 
           Searching, searching...
                                 CLAIRE (O.C.)
                        Hello.

           Sanjay looks up. Claire, wearing the red dress now, stands at 
           the edge of the living room.

           Rising:

                                 SANJAY
                        Ma’am. I’m- I’m so sorry. I didn’t 
                        know... I was told no one was home! 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh, well then... by all means.

                                 SANJAY
                        I’m sorry, no... My name’s-

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sandy... yes? 

                                 SANJAY
                        Sanjay.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sanjay. Of course. You’re the new 
                        errand boy for my husband.

                                 SANJAY
                        I... I’m his executive assist-

                                 CLAIRE
                        Executive assistant. Yes. He speaks 
                        highly of you.

           Claire makes her way across the living room toward the bar.

                                 SANJAY
                        Oh. And you as well. I’m sorry if I 
                        scared you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You didn’t, and he doesn’t. Though 
                        that was nice of you.

                                 SANJAY
                        I’m sorry?

                                 CLAIRE
                        My husband has not said a nice 
                        thing about me - to you, or anyone -
                        in years. But, it’s nice of you to 
                        lie.

                                 SANJAY
                        I wasn’t-

           Turning to him.
                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s more interesting is whether 
                        or not I was lying.

                                 SANJAY
                        Whether you were...?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Lying. Does he really speak highly 
                        of you?

                                 SANJAY
                        I-

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s very particular about his 
                        errand boys. You’re his third in 
                        two years. 

           She pours a drink.

                                 SANJAY
                        Executive assist-

                                 CLAIRE
                        And you already know I know your 
                        name, or at least I know what he 
                        thinks your name is, so it’s clear 
                        he’s talked about you... the 
                        question is... when he does... is 
                        it kind? 
                             (letting that question 
                              linger, then:)
                        What do you drink?

                                 SANJAY
                        What do I think?

                                 CLAIRE
                        What do you drink. Drink, darling.

                                 SANJAY
                        Oh... I’m just here-

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re just here to deliver a card 
                        that says my husband has to cancel 
                        our plans tonight. And, I’m sure, a 
                        gift... as a token of just how 
                        easily he seems to think my 
                        emotions can be bought and sold. 
                        No?

                                 SANJAY
                        I’m not sure exactly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Aren’t you?
           She smiles, like a cat delightedly playing with her mouse. 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        What were you doing on the floor 
                        just then?

                                 SANJAY
                        I dropped... 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes?

                                 SANJAY
                        ...my watch. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sanjay, you’ve told me enough lies 
                        tonight. Let’s see if we can’t get 
                        some truth out of you.

                                 SANJAY
                        I’m really-

                                 CLAIRE
                        What did you drop on the ground?

                                 SANJAY
                        A necklace.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And what does the card say?

                                 SANJAY
                        Mr. DuVous has to cancel your plans 
                        tonight.

           Claire knew of course, but can’t help but feel the sting of 
           hearing it out loud. She sighs. Then, forcing herself back 
           into character asks:

                                 CLAIRE
                        What do you drink, Sanjay?

                                 SANJAY
                        Ma’am-

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sanjay. 

                                 SANJAY
                        Mr. DuVous-

                                 CLAIRE
                        -isn’t here. I am. And, I’m in a 
                        dress. And, my hair is done. And, 
                        I’m having a drink.
                                 SANJAY
                        I don’t think he’d appreciate-

                                 CLAIRE
                        What? You losing my necklace? Or 
                        you spying on me in the shower?

                                 SANJAY
                             (panicking)
                        Ma’am, I am so-

           She waves his apology away before he can even sputter it out.

           She crosses to the couch, half the distance to Sanjay, with 
           her drink, a bottle, and a second glass.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He doesn’t like you. He thinks 
                        you’re an idiot who needs help 
                        tying his shoes.
                             (looking at him)
                        I only mention it because he’s 
                        going to fire you eventually. He 
                        thinks other peoples’ sadness is a 
                        measure of his worth. So really, 
                        what does it matter whether you get 
                        fired for losing the gift, or 
                        spying on his wife, or spending the 
                        night with her?

           Sanjay opens his mouth to respond, but...

           Spending the night with her?

           She holds out the necklace.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I won’t tell him that I caught you. 
                        He’ll spend the rest of his life 
                        thinking all of this went 
                        perfectly. He’ll be very pleased 
                        with you, I promise. I’ll even say 
                        how nicely it was set out.

           Sanjay looks relieved.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        But... 
                             (she pats the seat next to 
                              her)
                        ...have a drink with me and talk a 
                        while. 

           Sanjay concedes, moving toward the couch.

           She nods. Content. 

           She pours him a drink.
                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me... Are you a romantic, 
                        Sanjay?

                                 SANJAY
                        I’m not sure.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No?

                                 SANJAY
                        No.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well, let’s find out. Do you find 
                        women mysterious?

                                 SANJAY
                        Right now I do.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And, do you find them magical?

           Sanjay stares at her. 

                                 SANJAY
                        Yes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        When you’re with a woman, do you 
                        think of her pleasure or yours?

                                 SANJAY
                        I guess... I guess I think you need 
                        both to have either.

           Claire nods. Intrigued.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Do you have a girlfriend, Sanjay?

                                 SANJAY
                        No.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why not? You’re handsome. Why not a 
                        girlfriend?

                                 SANJAY
                        You’re asking the wrong person.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Unrequited love?

                                 SANJAY
                        If it’s possible to love someone 
                        who doesn’t care about you, then 
                        yes.
                                 CLAIRE
                        That is the question. What do you 
                        think?

                                 SANJAY
                        I don’t know. Are you in love with 
                        your husband?

           Claire stares at him. Surprised by his sudden confidence. We 
           see her vulnerable. Honest.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

                                 SANJAY
                        Were you ever in love?

                                 CLAIRE
                        With him? I don’t know. I don’t 
                        think so.

                                 SANJAY
                        But with someone?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes. And he loved me.

                                 SANJAY
                        What was that like?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (dreamily, to herself)
                        Like flying.

           Claire’s lost in a memory. She turns to Sanjay and moves 
           closer toward him.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        My advice, Sanjay? 

           She looks at him like this is the most important information 
           in the world.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Find someone you can’t live 
                        without, make love for days, and 
                        then jump off a bridge.

           And then, she kisses him.

           They fall onto the couch as:

           The camera floats out of the window...

           ...and La Ronde continues.

           The CAMERA continues out the window and TILTS DOWN to the...
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           But it’s a different time. A different place. In the 
           distance, SOUND of SIRENS approaching.

           CARD: CLAIRE and ANTOINE - APRIL, 1930 - NICE, FRANCE

           ULTIMATE DATE: MAY, 456 AT

           POLICE CARS come hurling into frame.

           STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           One officer, decorated, clearly in charge, forcefully gives 
           orders to his LIEUTENANTS. And then, we notice who it is...

           Our Narrator, dressed in a CAPTAINS UNIFORM.

           *THIS SEQUENCE IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN FRENCH*

                                 NARRATOR
                             (in French)
                        I want a perimeter set up for eight 
                        blocks in every direction. 
                             (to a Sergeant)
                        Have your men canvas the area.
                             (to one officer in 
                              particular)
                        You! Come here.

           ANTOINE, 20’s, a rather dopey looking officer, scurries over.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Go in the building and get 
                        statements from all the neighbors. 
                        Start with apartment six.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Apartment six? That’s in the middle 
                        of the-

                                 NARRATOR
                        Did I ask you for advice, officer?

                                 ANTOINE
                        No, sir!

                                 NARRATOR
                        Then what are you waiting for?

                                 ANTOINE
                        Yes, sir!

           Antoine turns and starts toward the apartment building.
           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           SOUND of BUZZ BUZZ.

           Claire lies on her couch reading a book. She’s younger now. 
           Maybe 25. She moves to get the door, but can’t tear her eyes 
           away from the page.

           SOUND of BUZZ BUZZ.

           Finally, she goes to the door and opens it.

           There, she finds Antoine, who takes one look at her and 
           immediately falls head over heels, once in a lifetime, in 
           love.

           He removes his cap like a nervous child.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Bonjour.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Bonjour.

           Antoine tries to shake some sense into himself.

                                 ANTOINE
                             (in French)
                        Uuummm... There was a robbery... 
                        Across the hall.

           Claire nods along.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        It was about thirty minutes ago. 
                        Did you see anything suspicious?

           Claire nods again.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        You did?! Oh Fantastic! Um... may I 
                        come in?

           Claire, responding to his gestures, moves out of his way and 
           let’s him into the apartment.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never actually interviewed a 
                        witness. They normally give me the 
                        most useless jobs because they 
                        think I’m useless.

           He laughs. She laughs, too.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Um, so...
                             (noticing her book)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Virginia Woolfe. Beautiful. So 
                        sad, and true, and wonderful.

           Claire nods.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        I was in a performance of this in 
                        University. I studied theater. I 
                        wanted to work on the stage.
                             (acting)
                        “and she muttered, dreamily half 
                        asleep, how we perish, each alone.”

           Claire smiles politely. 

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        And, you’re reading it in English? 
                        Good for you! You speak English?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oui.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Oui. 
                             (speaking in English now)
                        Yes! Today it is hot. And so must 
                        put powder on my body!

           Antoine looks at her, proud of himself.

           Claire fights from laughing at him. 

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                             (back to French)
                        You have a beautiful apartment. 
                        Large windows. It’s so important 
                        being able to see sunlight in your 
                        home, don’t you think?

           Claire smiles. Nods.

           Antoine looks through all of her bookshelves.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        It’s probably nice having the 
                        natural light for reading all these 
                        books. 

           Claire doesn’t answer. Antoine turns to her.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh. Yes.

           Antoine smiles.
                                 ANTOINE
                        Umm. So. About the criminal you 
                        saw...
                             (hesitates)
                        Do you have tea?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Tea?

                                 ANTOINE
                        Yes.

           Claire nods.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire and Antoine sit down for tea.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Merci. 
                             (continues in French)
                        So, describe for me exactly what 
                        you saw.

           Claire nods.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Whenever you’re ready.

           Claire shrugs.

           Antoine suddenly understands.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Oh- do you- do you not speak any 
                        French?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oui. Er... no.

                                 ANTOINE
                        But, did you- did you see the 
                        criminal?

           Claire shrugs.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Did you see...

           He points to her, points to his eyes like “see”, then thinks.

           Antoine, desperate now, stands up. He tip-toes like a cartoon 
           burglar and pantomimes nipping something and dropping it in 
           his bag.

           Claire smiles like he’s crazy, but finds it charming.
           Antoine, smiling, sinks with frustration. Then, an idea.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        One minute. One minute. Ah...
                             (in English)
                        What you name?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Claire.

                                 ANTOINE
                             (in English)
                        Ah. Claire. One minute, Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

           Antoine goes to the front window, opens it, and whistles.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Hey! Gerard! Come up here! Yes, 
                        come up here!

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Antoine meets his partner, GERARD, in the hallway. Gerard is 
           a squat, very by the book kind of officer. Socially, he has 
           the dynamic range of a metronome.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Gerard, you speak English don’t 
                        you?

                                 GERARD
                        Yes, I speak English quite well. 
                        Although, I should say I haven’t 
                        yet been approved for legal 
                        translation-

                                 ANTOINE
                        No, no, that’s fine.

           They enter the...

           APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                             (in English)
                        Claire. My police friend. Gerard. 
                        He translate.

           Gerard translates Antoine’s French into English.

                                 GERARD
                             (in English)
                        I heard your name is Claire. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GERARD (CONT'D)
                        You just heard my name is Gerard. 
                        It is very nice to meet you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nice to meet you, Gerard.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Yes, yes. Now...
                             (acting official)
                        Please describe exactly what you 
                        saw for us, Claire.

                                 GERARD
                        Can you describe what you 
                        witnessed?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh. I’m sorry. I didn’t see 
                        anything.

                                 GERARD
                        She didn’t see anything.

                                 ANTOINE
                        She? You? 

           He pantomimes the burglar again.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m not sure what that is.

                                 GERARD
                        Neither am I.
                             (to Antoine)
                        Neither of us know what you are 
                        doing there.

                                 ANTOINE
                             (to Gerard)
                        Of course you know what I’m doing, 
                        I’m describing the crime!

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry if there was any 
                        confusion; I must have 
                        misunderstood.

                                 GERARD
                             (to Antoine)
                        She didn’t see anything. She 
                        doesn’t know why we’re here.
                             (to Claire)
                        Sorry to have bothered you ma’am.

                                 ANTOINE
                        No, no, no. I have more questions.
                                 GERARD
                        What questions-

                                 ANTOINE
                        Just... ask!
                             (to Claire)
                        Claire, do you live alone here?

                                 GERARD
                        Do you live here alone?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No. This is my aunt’s flat. I’m 
                        only visiting.

                                 GERARD
                        She’s visiting her aunt.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Ah. And... do you have a boyfriend? 

                                 GERARD
                        Do you have a-
                             (turning to Antoine- in 
                              French
                        Why do you want to know-

           Antoine hits him.

                                 GERARD (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a boyfriend?

           Claire smiles at Antoine.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

                                 GERARD
                        She said-

                                 ANTOINE
                        Have you ever experienced love at 
                        first sight?

           Gerard looks at him like he’s crazy.

                                 GERARD
                        He asks, “Have you ever felt love 
                        at first sight?”

           Claire can’t believe this.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can’t say... I’ve never 
                        experienced it myself.

                                 GERARD
                        She doesn’t know.
                                 ANTOINE
                        I have. It’s like flying in a 
                        dream. The type of love that makes 
                        you want to ask every question and 
                        have every conversation until there 
                        are no words left unsaid, and all 
                        there is left to do is jump off a 
                        bridge together.

           Claire stairs at him.

           After a moment...

                                 GERARD
                             (to Antoine)
                        Why would you jump off a bridge?

           Antoine doesn’t answer. He takes a card out of his pocket and 
           hands it to Claire.

                                 ANTOINE
                             (to Claire)
                        If you remember...

           And then pantomimes the burglary again.

           She giggles. Antoine smiles, proud of himself for making her 
           laugh.

           He nods his head and leads Gerard toward the door.

                                 GERARD
                        I don’t think she understands that 
                        gesture. If you’d like to describe 
                        it to me...

                                 ANTOINE
                        It’s okay, Gerard.

           They get to the door. Claire panics. She can’t let him go...

           Gerard exits through the door, and Antoine follows close 
           behind. But, just before Antoine pulls the door completely 
           closes-- 

           Claire reaches through the frame and pulls him back in. And 
           they kiss.

           There’s a sudden uproar of cheering, as a CURTAIN FALLS OVER 
           FRAME, bringing us to the...

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           OVER THE CURTAIN:

           CARD: ANTOINE and ROLAND - JUNE, 1890 - NICE, FRANCE
           ULTIMATE DATE - JUNE, 448

           Actors scurry in front of us, positioning themselves for 
           their curtain call.

           The camera drifts toward the left wing where we find the 
           Narrator.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Of course, Antoine would later have 
                        his heart broken, as Claire chose 
                        over him a wealthy publisher from 
                        the future named Henri. But, he 
                        wasn’t destroyed by it. In fact, he 
                        considered it his debt to the 
                        scales of love, because although it 
                        did break his heart, he understood 
                        love as he understood the theater, 
                        the curtain comes up, the curtain 
                        comes down, and if you’re lucky 
                        there’s a call, where the energy of 
                        a performance still exists after 
                        the players break character, and 
                        for a moment everyone together can 
                        say, that was beautiful. That was 
                        fun.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           *THIS SEQUENCE, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, IS SPOKEN IN FRENCH*

           Antoine, on stage, bowing. The crowd erupts. He takes another 
           bow, devouring his adoration. The curtain is drawn. He takes 
           a deep breath. It opens again. He takes a third bow. 

           And then, in the theater, he sees someone. He’s taken aback. 

           Could it be?

           His eyes are forced back to the crowd, and now he’s acting 
           again, performing the role of an actor, basking in the 
           applause of his admirers, but his eyes keep glancing toward 
           one person, and we can sense a fluttering heart.

           BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Backstage is crowded.  Behind the curtain, Antoine makes his 
           way from one wing to the other. He’s moving toward someone 
           off screen. People stop him, congratulate him, compliment his 
           performance. 

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        Bravo, Antoine! Well done.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Thank you so much.
                                 CAST MEMBER
                        Great show.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Great show!

           He’s polite in thanking each of them, but is all the while 
           inching forward, keeping his eye on that one person off 
           screen. He makes his way toward the other end of the stage...

           And then he arrives. The camera pans as he takes the last 
           steps toward his destination, and entering frame is the 
           object of his focus...

           ROLAND (30’s) is a notably thin trans man wearing a three 
           piece suit, and carries himself as one who is - at most times 
           - confident, but is in this moment nervous and meek.

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Hello.

                                 ROLAND
                        Hello, Antoine.

           They stare at each other. There’s clearly an unresolved 
           romantic history.

                                 ANTOINE
                        How did you-

                                 ROLAND
                        Gabby told me.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Ah.

           Another cast member runs up.

                                 CAST MEMBER
                        Roland!

                                 ROLAND
                        Jackie.

                                 CAST MEMBER
                        What a surprise! Are you coming to 
                        the party?

                                 ROLAND
                        I can’t stay long.

                                 CAST MEMBER
                        I heard you were commissioned for a 
                        play in Paris.

                                 ROLAND
                        I was!
                                 CAST MEMBER
                        Well, that’s incredible! It’s nice 
                        to see you. Come to the party!
                             (to Antoine)
                        Good job, An!

           The cast member leaves.

           Antoine gives Roland an impressed look: 

                                 ANTOINE
                        Commissioned?

           Roland rolls his eyes. I don’t know.

           Antoine smiles. 

           The subtext is heavy. Steamy. Without breaking eye contact, 
           without even blinking:

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        I have to change...

                                 ROLAND
                        Yeah.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Do you...?

                                 ROLAND
                        Yeah.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           The door bursts open. First in is Roland, seemingly pushed by 
           Antoine. The door slams. They kiss passionately. Roland goes 
           for Antoine’s belt buckle. Loosens it. Unfastens the top 
           button of Antoine’s pants and pulls them down as we-

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: A Champagne bottle. POP!

           Yaaay! People cheer. They talk. The champaign is passed 
           around.

           It’s a cast and crew party. They sit around a long table. 
           Antoine next to Roland.

                                 CAST MEMBER 1
                             (in English)
                        Are you writing your play in 
                        English or French, Ro?
                                 ROLAND
                             (in English)
                        In English, of course.

           That gets a big reaction. Some people cheer; some people 
           groan.

                                 ROLAND (CONT’D)
                             (to Antoine back in 
                              french)
                        They were asking me if I was going 
                        to write my play in English, or in 
                        French-

                                 ANTOINE
                        Oui, oui. And you told them French, 
                        of course!

           People laugh.

                                 ROLAND
                             (to the crowd)
                        I can’t tell him. I can’t! It will 
                        break his heart!

           Antoine smiles.

                                 CAST MEMBER 2
                        What’s the story?

                                 ROLAND
                        Well, I can’t be sure, but probably 
                        sex, and sexuality, and...

                                 CAST MEMBER 3
                        Sex, and sex, and sex...

           They laugh.

                                 CAST MEMBER 2
                        Well, if you decide to write in 
                        French, and you’re looking for an 
                        actor to write for... You’ve seen 
                        my work.

                                 ROLAND
                        I’ll keep that in mind. But after 
                        tonight’s performance I’m thinking 
                        I’ll maybe write something for 
                        Antoine.

           Antoine doesn’t like that. 

                                 CAST MEMBER 1
                        Ah, of course, Antoine!

                                 CAST MEMBER 3
                        Writers loooove Antoine.
                                 ANTOINE
                        Ah, well. Too bad. I’m off to the 
                        Police Academy. Excuse me.

           Antoine stands and heads toward the bar. 

                                 CAST MEMBER 2
                        See there you go! So maybe write 
                        for me!

           Roland laughs, but gives Antoine a sideways glance.

           BAR - LATER

           At the table, Roland fake listens to a conversation while 
           glancing at the bar where...

           ...a WOMAN approaches Antoine. He’s affectionate with her. 
           Roland pretends he doesn’t care.

           Antoine grabs her hip and pulls her toward him.

           Roland, unable to hide from us his frustration, forces 
           himself to look away...

           EXT. BAR - NIGHT

           Carriages clop along the street. Antoine helps a friend into 
           one as he kisses her on the cheek.

                                 FRIEND
                        You were brilliant tonight! We’re 
                        going to miss you next year!

                                 ANTOINE
                        I love you. I’ll see you soon!

           Antoine watches as the carriage pulls away. He turns around. 
           Roland is on the street, too. 

                                 ANTOINE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for coming tonight. 

                                 ROLAND
                        I was serious, you know.

                                 ANTOINE
                        About what?

                                 ROLAND
                        You know about what.

           Antoine does. 

                                 ANTOINE
                        I’m not going to be an actor. 
                                 ROLAND
                        You are an actor!

                                 ANTOINE
                        I mean, I’m never going to be an 
                        actor! I’d never make it.

                                 ROLAND
                        If I wrote a part for you though-

                                 ANTOINE
                        Do you know how patronizing that 
                        is?

                                 ROLAND
                        An.

                                 ANTOINE
                        You saying in front of everyone 
                        that you would do me this great 
                        favor?

                                 ROLAND
                        An!

                                 ANTOINE
                        Which - let’s be clear - it would 
                        be an incredible favor.  I mean, 
                        you are infinitely more talented 
                        than I am, so it would be a huge 
                        favor. But to say in front of 
                        everyone that you would do that for 
                        me... That’s embarrassing.

                                 ROLAND
                        We made a plan.

                                 ANTOINE
                        We had a dream.

                                 ROLAND
                        We made a plan.

                                 ANTOINE
                        We had a dream. We had a day dream! 
                        A daydream. Something to think 
                        about to pass time while we were 
                        bored, but nothing that was meant 
                        to be taken seriously. We’ve had 
                        this conversation, Roland!

                                 ROLAND
                        While we were bored?

                                 ANTOINE
                        Why did you come here tonight?
                                 ROLAND
                        I wanted to see you.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Because you wanted to see me, or 
                        because you wanted to begin your 
                        life with me?

                                 ROLAND
                        I don’t understand how you could 
                        just sleep with me tonight-

                                 ANTOINE
                        Because you showed up! You came 
                        back stage! You looked at me the 
                        way you look at me. I didn’t think 
                        I was agreeing to a whole life-

                                 ROLAND
                        Why would you pass on this 
                        opportunity... 

                                 ANTOINE
                        Because I’d be using you! Is that 
                        what you’d want? For me to use you?

                                 ROLAND
                        I don’t know why you put it that 
                        way.

                                 ANTOINE
                        Because that’s what it would be! We 
                        were a fling. God. We’ve had this 
                        conversation. We were a fling.

                                 ROLAND
                        It was more than that to me.

                                 ANTOINE
                        And yet, it takes two people to 
                        define a relationship. Which is 
                        exactly what we talked about.

                                 ROLAND
                        I love you. 

           Antoine fumes. Quietly:

                                 ANTOINE
                        You love me, only to the extent a 
                        person can love someone who will 
                        never love them back.

           Silence.

           Roland. Heartbroken. Mad.

           A voice from off screen appears:
                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Antoine!

           Antoine turns. He holds up a finger. One minute.

                                 ANTOINE
                        I’m sorry to be so blunt, but we’ve 
                        talked about this... When you came 
                        here tonight- I... 
                             (God, isn’t it obvious)
                        I’m attracted to you, Roland.  
                        Obviously! But I don’t...

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        An, come in here!

           Antoine doesn’t know what to do...

                                 ANTOINE
                        I’m sorry...

           He walks away...

           We stay on Roland. Alone. Flabbergasted. What just happened? 

           He walks down the street. His whole life, poor fool, just 
           collapsed on him...

           A carriage pulls up...

                                 CARRIAGE DRIVER
                        You need a cab?

           Roland shakes him off... he walks away.

           Roland, still putting the pieces of his rejection back 
           together, turns a corner. 

           The carriage pulls up again...

           Roland looks at the carriage driver.

           It’s our Narrator.

           Roland thinks... I guess I do need a ride.

           He nods.

           INT. CARRIAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Roland, still baffled, sits in the moving carriage. He turns 
           his head toward the window as some enormous wave of melodrama 
           seems to wash over him.

           THUNDER CRASHES. And our frame SNAPS TO:

           BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE. 4:3 ASPECT RATIO. 
           Rain begins tapping lightly against the carriage window. as 
           Roland rests his forehead against it; shadows of water streak 
           against his face.

           *IN ENGLISH NOW*

                                 ROLAND
                        What purpose is there to mourn a 
                        love that was not merely missed, 
                        but, as now I know, never existed 
                        at all? What necessity, for a 
                        species that has walked on planets 
                        and traveled through time, do the 
                        haunting notes of heartbreak serve? 

           ANGLE ON: The Narrator, back in color, back in wide screen, 
           to us:

                                 NARRATOR
                        He’ll go on like this for hours; 
                        and, I can assure you, it’s really 
                        quite unbearable...

                                 ROLAND
                        -trapped inside a space smaller 
                        than my form. I am absolute 
                        despair. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And truthfully, this is where we 
                        leave Roland. We’ll be following 
                        him into the past, so where he goes 
                        from here does not affect La Ronde. 
                        But, before we do, if we can 
                        forgive him of his melodrama, he 
                        says something, I think, worth 
                        noting.

           BEAT. Something occurring to Roland.

                                 ROLAND
                        There is a romance, I suppose, in 
                        wallowing... In sadness. In 
                        heartache, and melancholy. It 
                        provides for us brief measures of 
                        time in which we are able to sense 
                        the true dynamic range of life. 
                        Happiness and pleasure are narrow 
                        lanes that blind us to life’s 
                        vastness. So, I suppose there is 
                        that. I suppose there is something 
                        redeeming to that. 

           The Narrator looks at us, nods, then turns back to Roland: 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Where are you going?
                                 ROLAND
                        I’m sorry?

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Narrator, driving a cab and turning toward...

           Roland.... Except it isn’t Roland. Not Yet. It’s Roland 
           before he became Roland. It’s Roland as a young woman. It’s 
           Nona (20) holding the paper with movie times. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Where are you going?

                                 NONA
                        I’m going to The Biograph. You took 
                        me to the Music Box.

                                 NARRATOR
                             (to us, with a wink)
                        Oh no...

                                 NONA
                        I just, I wasn’t paying attention.

                                 NARRATOR
                        I’m sorry, but I’m done for the 
                        night.

                                 NONA
                        What?

                                 NARRATOR
                        I’m done for the night. You’ll have 
                        to catch another cab. Or see 
                        something here.

                                 NONA
                        No! Come on, really?

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

           Outside the MUSIC BOX theater, Nona stands as the taxi pulls 
           away.

           CARD: NONA and ELOISE - AUGUST, 1960 - CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

           ULTIMATE DATE: JUNE, 440 AT

           Nona, trying to hail a cab. 

                                 NONA
                        Taxi! Taxi!
           No luck. Then, she sees ELOISE (18) crossing the street. It 
           isn’t an ‘oh my god’, love-at-first-sight moment. It’s just a 
           vague interest. 

           Nona goes to look for another cab. One is coming toward her, 
           but she hesitates. She looks at the -- 

           KIOSK: HOWARD HAWKS MARATHON

           She sees Eloise buying a ticket.

           Nona thinks.

           EXT. THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

           Nona stands in line. She looks at a movie poster. It’s GEORGE 
           CLOONEY holding a gun on a street corner. The text says: 
           George Clooney in ‘11th Avenue’ Directed by Howard Hawks. His 
           first film after time travel. 

           Nona looks into the theater lobby.

           There are a lot of people outside of ‘11th Avenue’, but 
           Eloise walks into a different theater. The theater playing... 
           Nona can’t see.

                                 TICKET SALSMEN
                        One for ‘11th Avenue’?

                                 NONA
                        No. What else is playing?

                                 TICKET SALSMEN
                        His Girl Friday?

                                 NONA
                        Okay. Yeah.

           FULL SCREEN: THEATER SCREEN

           We see the flickering projection of the opening credits to 
           ‘His Girl Friday’.

           Nona walks in with popcorn and a soda. 

           Only Eloise is in the theater. 

           Nona takes more notice of her now. There’s something 
           interesting about Eloise. She has a certain confidence... 
           like someone frustrated by the world not being as smart as 
           her. 

           Nona sits a few rows back.

           Eloise watches the movie. Nona watches Eloise.
           THEATER - LATER

           Nona is still watching Eloise. She’s compelled. Building 
           courage, Nona stands up and walks toward her.

                                 NONA
                        Excuse me?

           Eloise turns. 

                                 NONA (CONT’D)
                        Are you from the future?

                                 ELOISE
                        What?

                                 NONA
                        Are you from the future?

           She looks around.

                                 ELOISE
                        We’re in a movie theater.

                                 NONA
                        I know.

                                 ELOISE
                        So, you shouldn’t talk in a movie 
                        theater. You might distract some of 
                        the other customers.

           Nona looks around.

                                 NONA
                        We’re the only ones here.

                                 ELOISE
                        Well then, you’re distracting all 
                        of the other customers.

           Nona smiles. 

                                 NONA
                        You watch movies like you’re from 
                        the twentieth century.

           Eloise squints her eyes. She shouldn’t condone this, but it’s 
           an interesting thing to hear...

                                 ELOISE
                        How do people from the twentieth 
                        century watch movies?

                                 NONA
                        They devour them.
                             (beat)
                        Every time has their own art form.

                        Painting. Symphony. Theater. Film. 
                        Video Games. VR. Whatever it is 
                        people from the far future do.

                                 ELOISE
                        I’m from the twenty-third century.

                                 NONA
                        So, you know. What art form is from 
                        then?

                                 ELOISE
                        I don’t know. I like movies.

           Nona smiles.

                                 NONA
                        I’m Nona.

           Eloise gives a look of charmed suspicion.

                                 ELOISE
                        I’m Eloise.

           Nona smiles like, well alright then. 

           They both turn to the screen.

                                 ELOISE (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        I study film... 

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Eloise and Nona walk down the street.

                                 ELOISE
                        ...First generation filmmakers 
                        inside the new timeline.

                                 NONA
                        So, like Howard Hawks after time 
                        travel?

                                 ELOISE
                        Exactly. Although, he isn’t that 
                        interesting. 

                                 NONA
                        I like his post time travel movies: 
                        “Swiss Army Knife”, “Twelve Feet 
                        Deep”, “11th Avenue”

                                 ELOISE
                        Those are the only ones anyone ever 
                        brings up, and they weren’t new.

                                 ELOISE (CONT'D)
                        They were still just star-studded 
                        studio movies, only now in part 
                        made by computers.

                                 NONA
                        Who do you like then?

                                 ELOISE
                        Max Ophuls. Guys like that. 
                        Filmmakers who could embrace 
                        technologies from the future and 
                        innovate something new. Or Welles, 
                        obviously. Guys who had interesting 
                        things to say about that 
                        generation.

                                 NONA
                        None of Welles’ theories about the 
                        horrors of time travel were true, 
                        though. He got everything wrong.

                                 ELOISE
                        But, it reflects a certain fear 
                        that existed in that time. His 
                        films work as historical documents. 
                        They’re constantly cited in books 
                        about the era.

                                 NONA
                        Oh-ho boy, you are from the future.

                                 ELOISE
                        What does that mean?

                                 NONA
                        People from the future have this 
                        air about them. This need to 
                        explain things to everyone else.

                                 ELOISE
                        Oh, really? Are you sure that’s my 
                        future arrogance, or are you just 
                        sensitive because of your-

                                 NONA
                        Dooon’t!

                                 ELOISE
                        -because of your twentieth-century 
                        pride?

                                 NONA
                        People from the twentieth-century 
                        are not proud.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yes, you are! You think your 
                        Original History was the greatest 
                        century of all time.
                                 NONA
                        I mean...

           Nona shrugs like, it kind of is, right?

                                 ELOISE
                        You see!

                                 NONA
                        We went from carts and buggies to 
                        space travel. From telegrams to 
                        video conferences.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeeeaahh, and you went from muskets 
                        to atom bombs. You almost killed 
                        the planet in like nine different 
                        ways, and you created oppressive 
                        social policies that would lock 
                        entire nations into poverty for 
                        hundreds of years or, more 
                        precisely, until the great social 
                        revolution of the twenty-third 
                        century. Thank you very much.

                                 NONA
                        Yeah, well... we also had Max 
                        Ophuls and Orson Welles.

           Eloise smiles.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah, well... I’ll give you that.

           They continue walking.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           They continue on a different street. It’s later. Quieter.

                                 ELOISE
                        Suandella.

                                 NONA
                             (where have I heard that)
                        Suandella?

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah. That’s the art form people 
                        are really into. At least kids my 
                        age. In the twenty-third century.

                                 NONA
                        Right. I’ve heard of that. It’s 
                        like...
                                 ELOISE
                        It’s like... you basically create 
                        these movements that correlate to a 
                        sound, and people record themselves 
                        with holographic tech, and create 
                        melodies with their bodies.

                                 NONA
                        Yeeeaah. I’ve seen that.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah, so it’ll be like...

           She moves her arms around her body and sings a note.

                                 NONA
                        And then...

           She does a little glide step and sings a different note 
           higher.

                                 ELOISE
                        Then when you do them at the same 
                        time it’s like...

           She does both moves simultaneously and sings a third note.

                                 NONA
                        Right.

                                 ELOISE
                        It’s cool.

                                 NONA
                        It’s weird. I mean not, like, weird-

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah-

                                 NONA
                        Like interesting.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah. 

           They lay down on the grass. 

                                 ELOSIE
                        What’s your thing?

                                 NONA
                        I’m a writer. 

                                 ELOISE
                        Books or film or...

                                 NONA
                        Theater. I’m a playwright.
                                 ELOISE
                        Huh. What drew you to that?

                                 NONA
                             (beat, realizing it sounds 
                              stupid)
                        The smell.

                                 ELOISE
                             (laughing)
                        The smell?!

                                 NONA
                        Yeah. I know, but it’s like... in 
                        film, you know, everything is 
                        polished. Everything is perfect. 
                        But in the theater, it’s happening 
                        there. In the room. And you can 
                        smell the stage, and the paint, and 
                        the actors. It’s right there. It’s 
                        really happening. And, there’s just 
                        this energy... I had to be a part 
                        of it.

                                 ELOISE
                        Is there a lot of theater here?

                                 NONA
                        Um... yeah. It was really big 
                        during Original History’s twentieth 
                        century, but right now it’s mostly 
                        late 1800’s. That’s where the best 
                        theater is happening. That’s when I 
                        go to school.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah?

                                 NONA
                        Yeah. In France.

                                 ELOISE
                        Huh.

                                 NONA
                        What?

                                 ELOISE
                        Just, here I am. From the twenty-
                        third century in the twentieth. And 
                        here you are, from the twentieth 
                        century, studying in the 
                        nineteenth. I just... I wonder what 
                        that is. People being drawn toward 
                        times that aren’t there own? 

                                 NONA
                        Yeah.
                                 ELOISE
                        I guess it’s just, you like what 
                        you like. And, you look for places 
                        that foster those things. Whatever 
                        makes you happy.

                                 NONA
                        Yeah... happy.

           Nona sighs. She’s not content with just “happy”. She lies 
           back, looking up toward the sky. 

           Eloise watches her.

                                 NONA (CONT’D)
                        It’s not just happy, it’s...
                             (frustrated, she can’t 
                              find the words)
                        I think we all want very badly to 
                        understand ourselves. Like, we’re 
                        born with an identity, and we spend 
                        our lives trying to make sense of 
                        it. 

           Nona thinks. Eloise watches. We watch Eloise watching Nona...

                                 NONA (CONT’D)
                        And the way we do that is through 
                        connections like this one.. with 
                        people we feel connected to, and 
                        feel ourselves, for whatever 
                        reason, being authentic with. You 
                        know? Totally real, without 
                        pretention. And I think times, and 
                        I think places, they have 
                        character. They have personality. 
                        And so, the way we feel drawn 
                        toward people we have connections 
                        with, we’re also drawn toward times 
                        we feel ourselves in. I think 
                        that’s what makes us happy. And I 
                        think that’s why happiness is 
                        important... because it helps us to 
                        know ourselves.

           Eloise lies next to Nona. They’re face to face.

                                 ELOISE
                        When do you travel back in time?

                                 NONA
                        A few days.

           Eloise nods.

                                 ELOISE
                        Do you want to see a film I made?

           Nona smiles. Nods.
           EXT. STREET - DAWN

           Nona and Eloise stop in front of an apartment building. 
           Eloise takes out her keys. Unlocks the front door.

           INT. ELOISE’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           A string of small lanterns illuminate Eloise’s small bohemian 
           attic apartment. 

           She has posters of great films on her wall. Some of them we 
           recognize: BREATHLESS, THE 400 BLOWS, TOKYO STORY, VERTIGO. 
           Some of them we don’t: THE SHOTGUN BIBLE by Richard 
           Linklater, CAROLINA CAROLINE by Francois Truffaut.

           Purple dawn light hugs her small window.

                                 ELOISE
                        This isn’t anything special.

                                 NONA
                        Okay.

                                 ELOISE
                        I just had some film and a camera 
                        and shot. Nothing’s been edited.

                                 NONA
                        Yeah.

           Eloise loads a reel of film into her projector.

           ON SCREEN: flares of lights and colors and then...

           A MAN. Dancing. 

           Eloise and Nona watch the film from her small couch.

                                 NONA (CONT’D)
                        This is beautiful.

           Eloise turns to look at her. There is a moment... Eloise 
           knows better than to let it pass. She’s made that mistake 
           before... She goes to kiss Nona as we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

           We’re outside of an old BOARDING SCHOOL. At first, it looks 
           like we’re in the past; but then a HOVERING TRAM crosses 
           frame.

           CARD: ELOISE and HARVEY - MAY, 2219, KYOTO, JAPAN

           ULTIMATE DATE: FEBRUARY, 439 AT
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           We’re in a small lecture hall. On a floating screen, we see 
           silent video clips OF THREE DIFFERENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN’S at 
           three different ages. All meeting each other.

                                 TEACHER
                        Because of the overlapping 
                        dimensions that time travel 
                        created, it wasn’t uncommon for the 
                        first generation of time-travelers 
                        to meet themselves at different 
                        ages. Now, as you should know from 
                        your physics courses, we’re not 
                        able to meet earlier versions of 
                        ourselves, just as we’re not able 
                        to meet any of these historical 
                        figures.

           In the lecture hall, we find HARVEY (17) finishing a note on 
           what looks like a scrap of paper. He folds the four corner 
           toward the center and stamps his finger where they all meet 
           in the center. The loosely folded note tightens as though 
           glued shut by magic.

           He writes “Eloise” on the front, waits for the teacher to 
           look away and, resting the note in his palm, gently tosses it 
           into the air. 

           The note floats through the room...

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        So, someone who was, say, seventeen 
                        when time travel had been invented, 
                        and decided to travel twenty years 
                        into the future, that person could, 
                        in theory, meet their future self. 
                        They could see who their future 
                        self had become. They could see who 
                        their future self had married, and 
                        as such, who they would have 
                        married had their timeline 
                        continued without disruption. But 
                        of course, their timeline was 
                        disrupted. The invention of time 
                        travel disrupted everyone’s 
                        timeline during the original 
                        generation.

           We follow the note, until it lands on the desk of:

           ELOISE (17). The camera tilts up onto her as her glance 
           pivots from the note to the sender across the room.

           Harvey crosses his eyes and sticks his tongue out.

           Eloise holds back a laugh.

           TIGHT ON: THE NOTE.
           In changing color ink, the note says: “Eloise”. And just 
           beneath that: PASSWORD.

           She swipes her thumb across the word PASSWORD and a blank 
           space appears. She writes: PASSWORD.

           And the note, just as quickly as it seemed to glue itself 
           shut, loosens back to its original hand-folding.

           She opens the note. Drawn there is a little animation of wo 
           people watching a movie.

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        The events that took place between 
                        the ages of seventeen and thirty-
                        seven during that person’s future 
                        self’s life, might not, or rather 
                        more likely would not, take place 
                        during their life. Because in the 
                        thirty-seven year old’s timeline, 
                        time travel had not existed when 
                        they were seventeen.

           Eloise smiles. She turns the note over, and writes “!!!!”. 
           She tosses the note to Harvey. It floats in his direction 
           but, before it arrives, it’s captured in mid-air by the 
           teacher.

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Harvey! Explain to everyone the 
                        principles of timeline compression 
                        that prevented paradoxes during the 
                        original generation of time travel.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes. Um. Something. Something with 
                        the ultimate timeline!

                                 TEACHER
                        Something. Anything specific?

                                 HARVEY
                        Probably.

           The teacher whacks Harvey on the head with the note. 

                                 TEACHER
                        Pay attention.

           INT. MALL - LATER

           Harvey and Eloise walk through a department store in the 
           mall.

                                 HARVEY
                        When will I ever need to know that?
                                 ELOISE
                        People time travel every day.

                                 HARVEY
                        People walk around every day. It 
                        doesn’t mean they know how muscles 
                        and bones work.

           Eloise looks at a dress.

                                 ELOISE
                        What do you think of this?

                                 HARVEY
                             (desperate to leave)
                        It’s wonderful. Truly. Let’s go.

                                 ELOISE
                        Would you relax?

           Harvey sighs. Bored. He hates being here.

                                 HARVEY
                        What is it about malls that’s so 
                        sad?

                                 ELOISE
                        It’s feeling alone while being 
                        surrounded by other people.

           Harvey, thinking.

                                 HARVEY
                        God, that is it. I thought we’d 
                        talk about this for ten minutes, 
                        but you said it just like that. The 
                        whole conversation is over.

                                 ELOISE
                        How ‘bout this?

                                 HARVEY
                        Can we go, please?

                                 ELOISE
                        I need clothes for the twentieth 
                        century!

                                 HARVEY
                        What’s wrong with the clothes you 
                        have?

                                 ELOISE
                        They don’t wear this in the 
                        twentieth century.
                                 HARVEY
                        But they are allowed to, yes? They 
                        don’t still have those fascists 
                        Naza regimes where they dictate 
                        what people wear and think and 
                        believe, do they?

                                 ELOISE
                        Naza?

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah.

                                 ELOISE
                        Nazi!

                                 HARVEY
                        Zi?

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah.

                                 HARVEY
                        Not Za?

                                 ELOISE
                        Not Za.

                                 HARVEY
                        That’s what I said. Naza!

                                 ELOISE
                        Oh my god. I hate you.

                                 HARVEY
                        Who was that? Hitzler?

                                 ELOISE
                        Let’s go.

           INT. MOVIE LIBRARY - LATER

           This place is Eloise’s dream. A library with just about every 
           reel of film you can imagine. She and Harvey walk through the 
           aisles looking through the titles. She prompts him to do 
           parodies of her favorite genres.

                                 ELOISE
                        Italian.

                                 HARVEY
                        Mia Bella! Donde mia biccecleta!?

                                 ELOISE
                        Ha! French.

           Harvey fakes smoking a cigarette. Very serious.
                                 HARVEY
                        Jui le qua? Moi swey? No. No Moi 
                        Swey!

                                 ELOISE
                        German.

           Harvey goes to start but halts. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Hm. We don’t really watch enough 
                        German movies; I don’t know how to 
                        make fun of those.

                                 ELOISE
                        Okay. Ummm... Western.

                                 HARVEY
                             (fake holding a gun)
                        Now look... I’m not leavin’ here 
                        without the girl, so we can do this 
                        the hard way...
                             (fake holding a second 
                              gun)
                        ...or the harder way.

           Eloise loves it. 

           Harvey smiles.

           INT. ELOISE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           FULL SCREEN: PROJECTOR SCREEN.

           Francois Truffaut plays a filmmaker working with his film’s 
           star played by Marion Cotillard.

           Eloise is lying on the couch. Harvey is sitting.

           Eloise is falling asleep. Harvey watches her. 

           He reaches out, about to brush her hair... but stops. He 
           thinks about it. Brings his hand back.

           CLOSE ON: Eloise. Her eyes open. She takes a deep breath. 
           Disappointed? 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Eloise walks through an empty hallway. We hear what sounds 
           like a dance studio.
           INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The class is doing Suandella. Their movements create sound 
           and harmonize with each other. 

           Eloise looks in. She finds...

           HARVEY. He isn’t great, but he clearly loves it. Eloise is 
           charmed. He notices her. She waves. 

           He flips her off.

           She laughs. Flips him off.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           They’re on a floating train. Eloise plays what looks like 
           three dimensional Tetris.

                                 HARVEY
                        I got you a present.

           She wipes her hand over the game and the shapes disappear. 

                                 ELOISE
                        What?

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah.

                                 ELOISE
                        A birthday present?

                                 HARVEY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 ELOISE
                        What is it?

                                 HARVEY
                        What is it?! I’m not telling you!

                                 ELOISE
                        Well, where is it?

                                 HARVEY
                        Not here.

                                 ELOISE
                        What!? 

                                 HARVEY
                        It’s in my dorm.

                                 ELOISE
                        Ahhh! Why would you tell me? This 
                        is excruciating.
                                 HARVEY
                        That’s why I told you.

                                 ELOISE
                        What if I’m more excited than I 
                        should be?

                                 HARVEY
                        You can’t be too excited.

                                 ELOISE
                        I can’t be too excited??

                                 HARVEY
                        It’s a really really good gift.

                                 ELOISE
                        Whaaaat!? What is it?

           Harvey shrugs.

           Eloise suddenly frowns. Something dawns on her...

                                 ELOISE (CONT’D)
                        God, I just realized. I’m going to 
                        already be gone by your birthday.

                                 HARVEY
                        I know, I was thinking about that 
                        too actually.

           Eloise looks at him. Harvey nods with an expression of: Yup. 
           Sucks.

           Eloise nods, too. Yeah.

           INT. MOVIE LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

           At the check out desk, Eloise makes an exchange.

                                 HARVEY
                        Are you worried about living in the 
                        twentieth century?

                                 ELOISE
                             (to the librarian)
                        Returning this. And getting this.
                             (to Harvey)
                        No. Why would I be?

                                 HARVEY
                        I don’t know. It’s like a whole 
                        different culture in the past. 
                        Aren’t men like super aggressive 
                        then? Like whistling at women on 
                        the street and stuff?
                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah. I guess they’re more 
                        assertive in general.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        You’re all set.

                                 ELOISE
                             (to librarian)
                        Thank you.
                             (then to Harvey with 
                              subtext)
                        That’s not always a bad thing 
                        though.

           On Harvey, Gulp!

           INT. ELOISE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Eloise and Harvey sit, a bit awkwardly, watching the movie.

           Eloise is under a small blanket. Harvey is not. He rubs his 
           arms as though cold.

                                 ELOISE
                        Do you want some blanket?

                                 HARVEY
                        Oh god, no. Don’t worry about me.

           He starts chattering his teeth dramatically.

                                 ELOISE
                        Shut up! Here!

           She tosses some of the blanket over Harvey, but it isn’t 
           large enough; it only covers hald of him. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Perfect!

           She laughs. They both inch closer together in order to share 
           the blanket. Now they’re really close.

           They sit like this for a long moment. Both staring at the 
           screen; neither watching the movie.

           Eloise takes one of her arms out of the blanket and places it 
           over her leg so that it’s only inches from Harvey’s arm.

           Harvey’s hand twitches like he’s going to take hers, but 
           suddenly stops. She notices this. She looks disappointed. She 
           moves her hand toward his but...

           ...Harvey’s already off the couch.
                                 HARVEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna run to the bathroom real 
                        quick.

                                 ELOISE
                        Okay.

           CLOSE ON: ELOISE-- watching Harvey... 

           He makes it to the door. Stops, shakes his head, turns 
           around, and looks at her. What are we doing?

           He strides confidently toward her. She stands up.

                                 ELOISE (CONT’D)
                        Thank god.

           She jumps up, her legs around him... 

           and just before their lips meet --

           -- the door closes. 

           CLOSE ON: ELOISE-- Alone. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON: HARVEY-- splashing water on his face. He looks at 
           himself in the mirror:

                                 HARVEY
                        What are you doing? She wants this. 
                        She likes you! 

           He stops. Enough. 

           He strides confidently out of the bathroom into...

           ELOISE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He walks straight toward her.

                                 HARVEY
                        I can’t anymore.

           As he approaches, Eloise falls onto her back accepting him as 
           he lowers himself above her. He brings his lips toward hers 
           except--

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON: HARVEY-- staring at the closed door. Alone.
           INT. ELOISE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Harvey sits back down. They both stare at the screen. Neither 
           watching the film.

           INT. DORM COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s a party. Eloise is opening presents.

           She’s just received a “20th century dress”.

                                 ELOISE
                        Ohhh, this is cool!

           Harvey watches...

           LATER 

           Some GUY is flirting with Eloise. Some GIRL is flirting with 
           Harvey. They look at each other across the room. Harvey 
           crosses his eyes. She laughs and flips him off...

           LATER

           Harvey, alone. Looking out the window. From behind him he 
           hears:

                                 ELOISE (CONT’D)
                        I hope you don’t think I forgot 
                        about my gift.

           He smiles. Then he puts on a very serious face as he turns to 
           her.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’ve been meaning to tell you about 
                        that.

                                 ELOISE
                        What? What is it?

                                 HARVEY
                        See. I got into some trouble.

           Eloise cracks an understanding smile. She plays along.

                                 ELOISE
                        Oh, no!

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah.

                                 ELOISE
                        What kind of trouble?

                                 HARVEY
                        Gambling trouble.
                                 ELOISE
                        Gambling?

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah. I was gambling with these 
                        guys from the first century. Mean 
                        guys.

                                 ELOISE
                        What happened?

                                 HARVEY
                        Well, I was playing- you know- 
                        gambling cards.

                                 ELOISE
                        Poker.

                                 HARVEY
                        Poker! And they dealt me four aces - 
                        those slow rollin’ sons of bitches, 
                        they dealt me four aces - so I took 
                        out a loan to call.

                                 ELOISE
                        Well sure. Four aces.

                                 HARVEY
                        Exactly.

                                 ELOISE
                        What happened?

                                 HARVEY
                        They had the only hand that beats 
                        four aces.

                                 ELOISE
                        And, what’s that?

                                 HARVEY
                        Four... jokers.

                                 ELOISE
                        No!

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah. Four jokers. Right there.

                                 ELOISE
                        That’s the only thing that beats 
                        aces!

                                 HARVEY
                        I know! So I had to give them your 
                        gift to pay off the loan.
                                 ELOISE
                        No! It must have been a really 
                        expensive gift!

                                 HARVEY
                        Oh, super expensive.

                                 ELOISE
                        What was it?

                                 HARVEY
                        Jewels.

                                 ELOISE
                        No!

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah. Big jewels. Size of your 
                        head. Just beautiful.

                                 ELOISE
                        Well, so here’s the problem.

                                 HARVEY
                        What?

                                 ELOISE
                        Those guys from the first century? 
                        They were my cousins. 

                                 HARVEY
                        No!

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah. And see, I already told them 
                        you were getting me a gift; so, if 
                        they find out you didn’t...

                                 HARVEY
                        Oh, no.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah.

                                 HARVEY
                        That is a problem.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hm. Maybe I can muster something up 
                        in my room.

                                 ELOISE
                        Yeah. We better go take a look.

           Harvey smiles.
           EXT. PATHWAY - NIGHT

           Eloise and Harvey walk together. Laughing.

           INT. HARVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           They enter. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Let’s see what we got. Oh! Hey, 
                        this might do.

           Eloise smiles. Harvey brings her a wrapped package.

                                 ELOISE
                        What’s this?

           Harvey doesn’t answer.

           She opens it. 

           It’s a BOLEX H-16 16mm camera. It’s beautiful.

                                 HARVEY
                        It was made before the 60’s, so you 
                        don’t have to worry about Cultural 
                        Preservation Laws when you move.

                                 ELOISE
                        Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                        Happy birthday.

           Eloise is speechless. This gift is perfect.

           She hugs him. They hold each other.

           She pulls away and does an excited little jump and squeal.

                                 ELOISE
                        Eeee!! What should I film?

                                 HARVEY
                        Anything you want.

                                 ELOISE
                        How ‘bout you?

                                 ,HARVEY
                        Well not anything.

                                 ELOISE
                        Do suandella.

                                 HARVEY
                        Noooo.
                                 ELOISE
                        Come on.

                                 HARVEY
                        No. No.

                                 ELOISE
                        It’s my birthday.

           She looks at him. Please...

           Fine.

           MOMENTS LATER

           We hear the click of the camera and the sound of film 
           running.

           Harvey performs. We realize this is the film Eloise will 
           later show to Nona. 

           Eloise gets closer and closer to Harvey. 

           He finishes.

           She stops filming him. Lowers the camera.

           There’s a moment. It’s right there. They both stand, staring 
           at each other. This is it... Kiss! Kiss! Kiiiissss!!!

           The moment passes.

                                 ELOISE (CONT’D)
                        Well... thank you again.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah.

           She heads toward the door.

                                 ELOISE
                        I should-

                                 LEONARD
                        Yeah.

           Cecile nods.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There is no word to describe the 
                        influence one’s first love has over 
                        the rest of their life.

           The camera dips out of the window as we see Cecile leaving 
           Harvey’s room.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And in the case of Harvey... 
           We dip out farther and see his silhouette against the dark 
           building.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...it was not that he never fell 
                        out of love with Eloise, he did. It 
                        was that he wouldn’t allow himself 
                        to love again.

           We see Eloise exit the building, and we see Harvey’s 
           silhouette watching as she walks along the path outside. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And so this word that does not 
                        exist manifested itself in Harvey 
                        like this:

           Harvey’s bedroom light turns off.

           INT. UPSCALE JAZZ LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Harvey, looking a little older now and dressed in a dapper 
           suit, walks confidently along the perimeter of the bar until 
           he finds...

           A WOMAN (late 20’s) sitting alone. She looks bored. Wanting 
           to dance? Harvey gives a small crooked smile as he makes his 
           way over to her. The woman notices. She smiles.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hello.

           We cut to the reverse of the woman, but realize we’re no 
           longer in a jazz lounge. We’re...

           INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

           ...in an enormous ballroom. A WOMAN wearing an elegant black 
           gown smiles at Harvey.

                                 BALLROOM WOMAN
                        Hello.

                                 HARVEY
                        Would you like to dance?

                                 BALLROOM WOMAN
                        Excuse me?

           We stay on the woman as we hear Harvey:

                                 HARVEY (PRE-LAP)
                        I said...
           INT. VICTORIAN MANOR - NIGHT

           We’re inside of the great hall of a Victorian-era manor.

           Harvey leans in toward camera.

                                 HARVEY
                        ...would you give me the pleasure 
                        of sharing this dance with you?

           We CUT TO the reverse of a VICTORIAN WOMAN blushing.

                                 VICTORIAN WOMAN
                        The pleasure would be mine, sir.

           Harvey smiles. He takes her hand and leads her to the dance 
           floor. They start dancing, her dress swooping in front of the 
           lens as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Harvey glides across the ballroom with the woman in the black 
           gown. They move toward camera, the back of her dress 
           consuming the lens as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

           Harvey dances with the woman in the Jazz club. Her dress... 
           yes, consuming the lens as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           WESTERN BAR - NIGHT

           A NEW WOMAN -- in a plaid shirt, knotted at the waist, turns 
           from the lens and square dances with Harvey. They hop around 
           the dance floor, her back consuming the lens as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           WAREHOUSE RAVE - NIGHT

           Black. And then, there’s a flash of light. Then, there’s 
           another. HARVEY, dancing with a MAN. And then the light 
           strobes as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Harvey loved to be loved. Wanted to 
                        be wanted. Desired desire. But what 
                        he loved to receive, he became 
                        incapable of giving.

                        only finds while surrounded by

           INT. CASINO - NIGHT

           CARD: HARVEY and MARIE - DECEMBER, 1911, MONTE CARLO

           ULTIMATE DATE: DECEMBER, 447

           We find Harvey (30) at a roulette table as he extends his 
           hand to place A HUNDRED FRANC bet on BLACK. And as he does 
           so, we see enter frame-- 

           ANOTHER HAND, a woman’s hand, that’s reached in to place her 
           bet on RED.

           We follow her hand up and find--
           MARIE (28). Harvey notices her. The ROULETTE BALL goes in.

                        No more bets.

           The ball lands on... RED. Marie smiles. Harvey watches her 
           collect her winnings. 

           He doubles up on black. She does the same on red. They make 
           eye contact. Polite smiles. The ball drops...

           RED. Harvey swallows. He doubles up. 400 FRANCS. This time on 
           RED. Marie places her chips on BLACK.

           Ball.

           BLACK. Harvey looks up at Marie. She shrugs in a way that 
           suggests she’s really enjoying this. 

           Harvey’s growing annoyed. He waits for her to place her bet. 
           She seems to wait for him. He eyes to her go ahead. 

           She places her chips on red. Harvey places 800 on red, also.

           The ball drops when SUDDENLY--

           -- Marie SWITCHES her chips to BLACK. Harvey reaches to 
           change his but...

                        No more bets.

           ...too late.

           BLACK. Marie cracks up. 

                                 MARIE
                        Oh-hooo! Tre Bien!

           Harvey leers. Marie loves it. She nods. Okay okay. She puts 
           her chips on black. She nods, encouraging him.

           Harvey takes a deep breath. He puts his last 1,600 FRANCS 
           worth of chips on BLACK. He looks up at Marie. She nods. 
           Trust me.

           The ball drops. Harvey’s nervous. The ball jumps and skips 
           around the wheel. 

                                 HARVEY
                        God, let it be black. Let it be 
                        black...

                        No more bets!

           He closes his eyes. Marie watches, smiling. 

           The ball skips over the last few slots, landing on...

                                 HARVEY
                        Let it be black. Let it be black. 
                        Let it be...

                                 COURIER
                        Black 13!

                                 HARVEY
                        Ohhhhh!

           Relief floods over Harvey. He looks at Marie. 

           Marie reaches for her winnings. You’re welcome.

           Harvey takes a moment. He drops his head, almost prayer-like. 
           He looks up at Marie again, but...

           Marie’s gone. He looks down to the table... 

           So are his chips.

           Harvey, frantic, turns to find her. Nowhere. He turns again. 
           Gone. Everywhere he turns, nothing. 

           He walks through the casino floor, desperately trying to spot 
           her. He can’t. She’s gone. She robbed him. Just like that. 
           And then...

           ...there she is. She holds his chips and smiles 
           mischievously. 

           He’s relieved and furious. He walks toward her. 

           She smiles.

                                 MARIE
                        Come. I’ll buy you a drink.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Harvey and Marie sit at a bar. 

           Harvey finishes counting his chips.

                                 MARIE
                        Everything there?

           Harvey finishes. Satisfied.
                                 HARVEY
                        I never want you gambling near me 
                        again.

           She smiles.

                                 MARIE
                        So. Where are you visiting from?

           Harvey shrugs. All over.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                             (in French)
                        Do you speak French?

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m sorry?

                                 MARIE
                        Do you speak French?

                                 HARVEY
                        Oh. No.

                                 MARIE
                             (in French)
                        It’s too bad.
                             (back to English)
                        Are you from the future?

                                 HARVEY
                        Originally, no. Nineteenth century. 
                        But I went to boarding school in 
                        the future.

                                 MARIE
                        Yes. You see? No one from the 
                        future bothers to learn French.

           A waiter brings their drinks.

                                 HARVEY
                        Everyone from the future speaks 
                        English. Everyone from the past 
                        learns it. What’s the incentive?
                             (to the waiter)
                        Thank you.

                                 MARIE
                             (to the waiter with 
                              subtext)
                        Merci!
                             (back to Harvey)
                        Do you have food in the future?

                                 HARVEY
                        Do we have food?
                                 MARIE
                        Yes. Do you have food? Or do you 
                        all eat out of plastic tubes or 
                        something?

                                 HARVEY
                        Have you been to the future?

                                 MARIE
                        Do I look so undignified to you?

           Harvey chuckles.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes, we have food.

                                 MARIE
                        And, do you have cinema?

                                 HARVEY
                        A little. Yeah.

                                 MARIE
                        And, in the future, do people love?

           Harvey doesn’t answer.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Because if you truly want to 
                        understand food, love, or cinema... 
                        translate it into French.

           Harvey grins. As though trying to figure Marie out.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t believe me?

                                 HARVEY
                        You stole thirty-two hundred francs 
                        from me. I won’t believe anything 
                        you say, no matter what language 
                        it’s in.

                                 MARIE
                        You don’t think love is more 
                        beautifully described in French?

                                 HARVEY
                        I don’t think love is particularly 
                        beautiful at all.

                                 MARIE
                        Of course not. You speak the wrong 
                        language.

           Marie stands up. 
                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll show you.

                                 HARVEY
                        You’ll show me?

                                 MARIE
                             (making fun of his accent)
                        You’ll show me? Yes. I’ll show you.

           She starts to walk slowly around the table toward him.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                             (in French)
                        You see... when you speak the 
                        language of love...

           They lock eyes. She sits next to him.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                             (in French)
                        ...it doesn’t matter what you 
                        say... it will always sound 
                        romantic.

           She moves her face close enough to smell his aftershave. She 
           looks down, taking a deep and sensual breath.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering in French)
                        Your breath smells like an animal. 
                        Left on the road...
                             (pause)
                        ...and covered... in death.

           She looks at his eyes and then down to his lips. She sighs 
           sweetly before breaking character and going back to her seat.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        You see?

           Harvey stares at her. Transfixed.

                                 HARVEY
                        What did you say?

           Marie raises her eyebrows. My point exactly.

           A song plays.

                                 MARIE
                        I love this song.

           Harvey stares at her. We see on his face how reluctant he is, 
           how frightened.
                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                             (hinting)
                        It’s an excellent song to dance 
                        to...

           Everything Harvey’s been avoiding. All the vulnerability.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                             (in french, frustrated)
                        Oh, how obvious can I be?
                             (back to English)
                        I’m asking if you’d-

                                 HARVEY
                        I don’t want to dance.

           ON MARIE -- caught off guard. Understanding.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Harvey and Marie make love. We see his jacket on the ground.

           Her dress flies into frame.

           They look at each other. This is different. This is special.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Harvey sleeps while Marie lies awake looking anxious.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s funny what stories are able to 
                        do to us. 

           She quietly leaves.

           HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Harvey wakes. 

           He goes to grab Marie. She isn’t there. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        How they can change us and bend our 
                        principles without our realizing.

           He looks down at the ground. 

           His jacket is lying in the same place, but her dress is gone.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        For example, we’ve seen this story 
                        from Harvey’s perspective.

                        And probably without noticing, were 
                        able to forgive him for doing to 
                        others... 

           On Harvey, realizing what’s happened.

           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Marie hurries down the hotel corridor.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...what we now despise Marie for 
                        doing to him.

           The elevator door opens. She runs toward it-

           FREEZE: On Marie. Sad. Tormented. Frightened.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        So, let us go back.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Marie (7) and her parents (late 30’s) travel by car through a 
           winding road.

           Marie laughs in the back seat. She’s goofing off. She reaches 
           over the seat and covers her father’s eyes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Marie was orphaned at the age of 
                        seven.

                                 MOTHER
                             (in French)
                        No no, Marie. No!

                                 FATHER
                        Stop it. No!

           HEADLIGHTS FILL THE FRAME. They hit an approaching car.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           BLACKNESS.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There is no word to describe the 
                        influence one’s first love has over 
                        the rest of their life.
           EXT. HOSPITAL WINDOW - MORNING

           Through the window, we see a numb Marie (still 7) staring 
           blankly outside.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        In the case of Marie, it kept her 
                        from ever believing that she 
                        deserved love. 

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           Marie (13) sneaks out of an open window.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Afterward, any time she felt the 
                        creeping signs of adoration, of 
                        fondness, of love...

           She runs across the front lawn.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           A CON MAN (late 20’s) flirts with Marie (17).

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        At seventeen, she met a con man she 
                        knew would never love her.

           INT. CASINO - NIGHT

           Marie and the Con Man, at a casino chapel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And so she married him immediately.

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING)

           We’re in an older, Rat Pack era, Las Vegas.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They traveled the world’s casinos 
                        together...

           INT. CASINO - NIGHT

           Ball being dropped in a Roulette wheel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...conning men in Las Vegas...

           Marie, taking a load of chips.

           INT. DIFFERENT CASINO - NIGHT

           Ball being dropped in a Roulette wheel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...in Atlantic City.

                                 CON MAN (COURIER)
                        No more bets.

           Marie, taking a load of chips.

           INT. DIFFERENT CASINO - NIGHT

                        ...in Shanghai.

                                 CON MAN (COURIER)
                        No more bets.

           Marie, taking a load of chips.

           INT. DIFFERENT CASINO - NIGHT

           Ball being dropped in a Roulette wheel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...and in Monte Carlo.

                                 CON MAN (COURIER)
                        No more bets.

           Harvey watches.

           It lands on BLACK.

           We watch Marie watch Harvey. She smiles.

           Marie hesitates. Then, reluctantly, she takes the load of 
           chips and walks away. Looking back at Harvey looking for her. 
           What is it with this guy?

           CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie walks quickly through the casino floor. She turns a 
           corner, out of sight, and stops. Thinking.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There was something about Harvey 
                        that broke her heart. Something she 
                        wanted to know. Something she was 
                        drawn toward.

           She turns around and walks back onto the casino floor.

           There she sees Harvey, desperately looking for...

           Her. He finds her. He walks toward her. 

           She smiles.

                                 MARIE
                        Come on. I’ll buy you a-

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Marie wakes up. She leaves.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She felt that she could love him. 
                        Or worse, that he could love her. 
                        And so, she did what she’d always 
                        done. 

           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           OVER THE FROZEN IMAGE OF MARIE LEAVING. It starts moving 
           again. Marie enters the elevator. The door begins closing as 
           we glimpse Marie’s expression and see the disappointment she 
           seems to have for herself.

           The elevator doors close. 

                                 NARRATOR (O.S.)
                        But that wasn’t the end of their 
                        relationship, it was just the 
                        beginning. 

           The CAMERA PANS to find the Narrator in the hallway.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        And this is where everything begins 
                        to come together: Why it is I’m 
                        here. Who it is I am. Or, at least, 
                        used to be...

           Thinking. Then resolved.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Stories can be tricky. Sometimes 
                        it’s hard to know what to tell to 
                        whom, and when.

                        So, I’ll tell you what... let’s go 
                        back to the beginning--

           INT. TIME PORT - MORNING

           Leonard, our lonely wine maker from page 1, POPS into 1960’s 
           Paris.

           The time machine whirs to silence.

           INT. CAB - LATER

           Leonard jumps into a YELLOW TAXI. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Ministry of Health.

                                 CABBIE
                             (in french)
                        Which wing?

                                 LEONARD
                        The Research Facility.

           Leonard leans back. On the radio, we hear a french announcer 
           describing the same soccer game we saw projected as Leonard 
           left the future. We hear the crowd roar. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        Goal!

           Leonard stares out the window and watches 1960’s Paris pass 
           him. 

           He looks nervous.

           INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

           Leonard sits on a couch near the reception desk. The ward is 
           futuristic. Rooms are separated by clear glass walls so that 
           everything is transparent. However, some rooms are made 
           private with seemingly floating curtains. The trim of the 
           walls and threshold are a smooth, dark wood. It’s all very 
           elegant.

           DOCTOR ABNER (60’s) approaches.

                                 ABNER
                        Leonard?

                                 LEONARD
                        Yes?
                                 ABNER
                        I’m Doctor Abner. Thanks for coming 
                        in.

                                 LEONARD
                        Yeah. 

                                 ABNER
                        Follow me this way.

           They walk and talk.

                                 LEONARD
                        They said that nothing is wrong?

                                 ABNER
                        It’s a bit more complicated than 
                        that.

                                 LEONARD
                        Something is wrong?

                                 ABNER
                        Something is unusual.

                                 LEONARD
                        Okay.

                                 ABNER
                        I’ll show you. I was sorry to hear 
                        about your mother, by the way.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh. 

                                 ABNER
                        She was an incredibly kind woman.

                                 LEONARD
                        I didn’t know she visited.

           Abner stops in front of a room. It’s one of the rooms 
           separated by curtains.

                                 ABNER
                        She visited every week before she 
                        was sick.

                                 LEONARD
                        I didn’t realize...

           Abner nods.

                                 ABNER
                             (re: the room)
                        This is us.

           He opens the door to a patient’s room.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           From the perspective of the patient’s bed, we see Abner lead 
           Leonard into the room. Leonard stares at the patient. His 
           eyes well. Being here isn’t easy for him.

           Abner pushes a button on the wall and from the ground rises a 
           transparent desk with a computer interface on it.

                                 ABNER
                        Would you like a coffee or 
                        anything?

           Abner notices Leonard staring.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Leonard?

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh. Um. No. Thank you.

           Abner nods. 

                                 ABNER
                             (re: the computer desk)
                        Let me show you why I brought you 
                        in.

           Abner touches the desk interface and a holographic map 
           illuminates between him and Leonard. It almost looks like 
           images of neural pathways. Except here, the pathways begin at 
           one distinct place and then branch out.

                        So, as you know, blips on the map 
                        aren’t too note worthy, although 
                        they are rare. What’s unusual about 
                        this is-

                                 LEONARD
                        I’m sorry. What’s a blip represent 
                        exactly?

                                 ABNER
                        I...
                             (surprised)
                        Just a sudden glimpse of a 
                        patient’s consciousness.

                                 LEONARD
                        I see. 

                                 ABNER
                        Yes. Now the map, of course, is 
                        limited to the-

                                 LEONARD
                        And the map is?
                                 ABNER
                        The map? 

                                 LEONARD
                        Yes. What does the uh... map 
                        represent again?

                                 ABNER
                        I’m sorry, I assumed- Maybe I 
                        should begin...

           Abner thinks. This is obviously all basic information he 
           thought Leonard would understand.

                                 LEONARD
                        I didn’t know my dad very well. I 
                        mean I was only seven when- and I 
                        haven’t come in since because... He 
                        wasn’t the greatest guy. So I...

           Leonard trails off.

                                 ABNER
                        I understand.
                             (thinking)
                        Okay. Let me ask you this: how 
                        familiar are you with the physics 
                        of time travel in general?

                                 LEONARD
                        Just whatever’s still rattling 
                        around from high school.

                                 ABNER
                        Okay. Well, when we travel through 
                        time, we regulate exactly what 
                        dimension it is we travel inside 
                        of. That’s why when you travel from 
                        2500 to 1500, you don’t alter the 
                        past and create a paradox that 
                        would essentially change the course 
                        of events so that your parents 
                        would never meet and thus never 
                        have you and thus never afford you 
                        the opportunity to change the past 
                        in the first place. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Right...

                                 ABNER
                        The way we regulate that dimension 
                        is through timeline compression, 
                        and the way we avoid a paradox is 
                        by continuing on what we call the 
                        ultimate timeline.

                                 LEONARD
                        Yes...
                                 ABNER
                        It helps to imagine it visually. If 
                        we travel through time the way we 
                        might travel through a building - 
                        by taking an elevator up and down - 
                        Then the ultimate timeline would 
                        look like a moving sidewalk which 
                        our elevator sits on top of.

                                 LEONARD
                        Okay.

                                 ABNER
                        So even as we’re moving up and 
                        down, between the future and the 
                        past...

           He moves his hand up and down.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        ...we’re constantly also moving 
                        laterally.

           He moves his hand sideways.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        The ultimate timeline is 
                        essentially our dimension. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Yeah.

                                 ABNER
                        So, obviously, it’s important that 
                        when we travel through time, we 
                        stay in our dimension. What 
                        happened with your father, however, 
                        was a dimensional skip. It’s an 
                        anomaly that can occur during time 
                        travel which is incredibly rare, to 
                        the point where it’s actually only 
                        happened three times in the 500 
                        years since time travel was 
                        invented. And only once in the last 
                        three hundred years.

                                 LEONARD
                        Yeah, how rare it is I do remember.

                                 ABNER
                        Yes. The technology we use to keep 
                        everyone inside of the same 
                        dimension broke down, and so the 
                        time machine your father was in 
                        rubbed up against another dimension 
                        and jumped back into our own, so 
                        that his body remained with us, but 
                        his consciousness began jumping 
                        between dimensions.
                                 LEONARD
                        So his brain is skipping between 
                        here and the other dimension it 
                        touched when the accident occurred.

                                 ABNER
                        His brain is skipping in and out of 
                        every dimension that has come into 
                        existence since the accident 
                        occurred.

                                 LEONARD
                        How many of those are there?

           Abner gestures to the map. 

                                 ABNER
                        Infinity. This map is limited to 
                        every dimension that was created in 
                        the exact moment of the skip.

                                 LEONARD
                        And how many of those are there?

                                 ABNER
                        Infinity.

                                 LEONARD
                        But, I thought you said the map was 
                        limited.

                                 ABNER
                        It is. There are infinite 
                        infinities.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh, god.

           Leonard collapses his head into his hands.

                                 ABNER
                        Here’s what you need to know: it 
                        has always been assumed that 
                        consciousness couldn’t direct 
                        itself. Essentially, a 
                        consciousness didn’t have a 
                        consciousness. It couldn’t control 
                        which dimension to be in, so it 
                        blipped in and out, existing in one 
                        vessel only for fractions of a 
                        second before skipping on to some 
                        other. Which is why your father 
                        looks to be in a coma; he has no 
                        control over which dimension to 
                        occupy. If he, or one of the 
                        infinite versions of him lying in 
                        this room in other dimensions, 
                        could control his consciousness 
                        that would be...
                                 (MORE)
                                 ABNER (CONT'D)
                             (Abner has a look of child 
                              like wonder)
                        ...unimaginable.

           He smiles excitedly.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        The possibilities are-

                                 LEONARD
                        Infinite?

           Abner laughs.

                                 ABNER
                        Look here.

           Abner controls the map so it zooms in on two DIMENSIONS. We 
           see two BLIPS simultaneously.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Did you see that?

                                 LEONARD
                        What?

                                 ABNER
                        Look here. And here. I’ll go 
                        slower.

           He shows again. The two BLIPS. 

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        You see? 

           He shows again. Closer now. Slower.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Two blips. At the exact same time.

                                 LEONARD
                        So what, he’s in two dimensions at 
                        once?

                                 ABNER
                        He was. This is a playback from 
                        yesterday when we called you.

                                 LEONARD
                        And is this uncommon?

                                 ABNER
                        It’s unprecedented.

           Abner zooms the map out even more, so that those two 
           dimensions become practically indistinguishable.
                                 LEONARD
                        What’s happened since then?

                                 ABNER
                        This.

           We see the map. Thousands of blips appear. Hundreds of 
           thousands. Millions. 

           On Leonard witnessing the wonder of this map, staring at the 
           blips twinkling before him.

                                 ABNER (CONT’D)
                        Your father, I believe, has 
                        developed the ability to control 
                        his consciousness. He can choose 
                        which dimension to enter, and when 
                        to enter it. I believe he’s 
                        travelling through interdimensional 
                        time and space. With a purpose.

           Leonard looks at his father and we, for the first time, cut 
           to him, too. 

           There, in the hospital bed, looking to be asleep is the 
           NARRATOR.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           The Narrator, dressed as the BARTENDER, approaches--

           MARIE. We can tell by her dress, and her makeup, and her 
           demeanor, that this is only a few minutes after she left 
           Harvey in the hotel room. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Madam?

           She looks up.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        A gentlemen asked me to bring you-

                                 MARIE
                        I’ll buy my own drinks. Thank you.

                                 NARRATOR
                        It’s not a drink.

           The Narrator hands her A LETTER.

           She looks confused. 

                                 MARIE
                        Sorry. I...
                             (she accepts the letter)
                        Thank you.
           She begins to read it. A little startled.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Who is this from?

           She looks up-- but the Narrator is gone.

           She continues reading. She looks up again. Trying to find the 
           author. She goes back to reading. She’s moved. She places her 
           hand over her heart.

           She stands up looking... looking for... She finds him. Of 
           course... 

           HARVEY-- at the other end of the bar. Drinking alone.

           He stirs his drink. We see the liquid swirling around.

                                 MARIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Harvey.

           Harvey looks up. He looks surprised.

                                 HARVEY
                        Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        Listen.

           LONG BEAT.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I have a hard time with love.

           That deflates Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                             (somehow understanding)
                        So do I. 
                             (beat)
                        Maybe it’s something we can help 
                        each other with.

           She nods.

           He stands.

           They embrace. Marie still holds the LETTER as we hear...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Dear Marie. My Marie. There are 
                        emotions that no one has bothered 
                        to assign a word. 
           LETTER MONTAGE:

           (THE IMAGES HERE ARE PRESENTED IN 8MM SATURATED COLOR-- Like 
           an old home movie...)

           Harvey’s POV: Marie, in a small Parisian apartment, hanging 
           pictures.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Like the warmth one feels building 
                        a home.

           Marie, painting walls. Rearranging furniture.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Or the comfort one feels after a 
                        long conversation...

           Marie, lying on a blanket against a hilly landscape, her hair 
           moving with a gentle breeze, resting her head against her 
           hand, talking passionately. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The weight of worry we feel as we 
                        age, and begin to detect we might 
                        never achieve the dreams that for 
                        so long defined us.

           Harvey’s POV: A letter, if we can read it at all, which says, 
           “We regret to inform you that”... And Marie, holding Harvey’s 
           face, mouthing: “It’s okay. Hey... It’s okay”

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And this:

           Marie and Harvey... in a convertible driving, the wind 
           blowing her hair. 

           Marie and Harvey... dancing, arguing, laughing...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Marie, you and I loved together. We 
                        grew together. Changed together. 
                        You made me better.

           Marie and Harvey... on a walk, holding each other, making 
           each other laugh, playing in bed, dancing, singing, crying, 
           comforting...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But the ultimate timeline ticked 
                        on, and lust turned to complacence.

           Harvey, older (looking more like the Narrator), at his desk 
           going through papers as Marie tries to be silly with him.
                                 HARVEY
                        I need to work. 
                             (off her disappointment)
                        Hey!
                             (annoyed)
                        Don’t make me feel ba-

           Harvey, staring out the window.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There is no word for the anger you 
                        project onto someone for the 
                        disappointment you feel in 
                        yourself. 

           Harvey... rejecting Marie. Ignoring Marie. Alone. Drinking.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I took you for granted, Marie. I 
                        began to resent you because I was 
                        too proud to resent myself... And 
                        the ultimate timeline dripped on.

           Harvey flirting with a young woman in his office. She smiles. 
           He closes the door.

           Harvey smiling across the bar at another woman.

           Marie, alone. Pacing.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There is no word for the want a 
                        person has to know that something 
                        horrible is happening; simply so 
                        that they might stop wondering if 
                        it is.

           Marie on the phone:

                                 MARIE
                        I’m not sure when it is you’re 
                        supposed to be home, but I wanted 
                        to tell you-

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And no word to describe the 
                        desperate and agonizing desire we 
                        all have to reverse time. 

           The images we’ve seen begin to reverse.

           Harvey opens the door to his office. He doesn’t reject Marie. 
           He puts the letter back in the envelope. They drive backward, 
           they un-paint the walls...
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There is no word to describe the 
                        nostalgia one feels for unpleasant 
                        memories. The longing I feel for a 
                        sadness I can’t remember. What I 
                        wouldn’t do to go back, Marie. To 
                        be that sad, miserable man again. 
                        Just to kiss you one last time; to 
                        tell you that I loved you the whole 
                        time. 

           And then, we see the last sequence again but in reverse:

           Harvey and Marie in the bar, Harvey and Marie in the hotel, 
           Harvey and Marie in the casino...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But even more than that, I wish so 
                        badly I could rob myself of your   
                        love, to save you from mine. I wish 
                        I could have kept myself away from 
                        you. And I would have. I would have 
                        gone back and kept us from ever 
                        meeting, except...

           Marie (older)-- in labor

           Harvey (older too) enters frame. We fully recognize him as 
           the Narrator now. He looks at Marie.

           Harvey, holding his newborn son. Leonard.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s hard to know unless you are 
                        one, but all fathers of young 
                        children are human beings... 

           Harvey, a mess, trying to feed Leonard. He looks like he 
           hasn’t slept in days.

           Harvey, yelling at Leonard.

                                 HARVEY
                        We do not run away. You scared me. 
                        Do you underst-

           Harvey, alone. Even messier. Even more sad. Contemplating...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        With dreams and ambitions, all but 
                        forgotten, until they lie awake at 
                        night, filled with an emotion that 
                        does not have a word... 

           Now we see HARVEY AS A CHILD-- energetic, excited...

           OVERLAPPED WITH...
           HARVEY AS A TEENAGER-- flirting with girls, laughing with 
           Eloise... 

           OVERLAPPED WITH...

           HARVEY AS A YOUNG MAN-- on a train, romantically gazing off 
           into the distance, his future, seducing women, drinking...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...which describes the anxiety one 
                        feels when they are confronted with 
                        the fact that they are not the man 
                        they’d planned to be, and that the 
                        opportunity to become that man has 
                        passed; and inside that realization 
                        the sadness and loneliness that 
                        comes as a result of not knowing 
                        yourself, and you begin to wonder 
                        if you even like yourself...

           OVERLAPPED WITH...

           HARVRY AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER-- having affairs, unable to 
           look at himself, drinking 

           OVERLAPPED WITH...

           The Narrator, gazing down... as though at all of these 
           moments overlapped on top of each other. Able to understand 
           them all at once. Regretful, nostalgic...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Marie. What I wouldn’t give to 
                        return to that time. To feel that 
                        wordless emotion again. To let my 
                        temper get the better of me, to 
                        yell at him for being a child, 
                        while I am forced to be a man. To 
                        be with you, the moment you meet 
                        the woman he’ll one day marry. To 
                        be with you. To go back to that 
                        time, before I was gone...

           HARVEY-- hugging a young Leonard (7) in the front yard of 
           their home. 

                                 HARVEY
                        I’ll be home soon...

           TIME MACHINE - NIGHT

           Harvey’s time machine FALTERS, a barrier SHATTERS, he sees 
           himself looking away from himself, like inside of an infinity 
           mirror, and then his window BREAKS, he looks scared, the 
           MACHINE SHAKES and his head CRACKS against the “MIRROR”-

                                                                CUT TO:
           BLACK.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Life does not guarantee us 
                        happiness. And there is nothing 
                        wrong with a person who is sad, or 
                        worried. What I wouldn’t give to 
                        not understand that again, Marie, 
                        because when I didn’t, it was 
                        because I was with you. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Marie, outside of the hospital room. Reading the letter. 
           Crying.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Proving, all the time, how unworthy 
                        I always was...

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Marie walks into the waiting room and finds a confused 
           Leonard (still age 7).

           He doesn’t notice his mother. She stares at him.

                                 MARIE
                        Leonard?

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY 

           Leonard (now in his 30’s) sits in the same waiting room. He 
           wears the same worried expression. 

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Leonard.

           Leonard snaps his attention toward the sound of the voice. 
           It’s an elderly NURSE.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You can see her now.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Leonard enters to find Marie (now in her 80’s) lying in a 
           hospital bed.

           CARD: MARIE and LEONARD - MAY, 1819

           ULTIMATE DATE: OCTOBER, 493 AT
           Leonard walks over. Marie smiles.

                                 MARIE
                        Seems I’ve gotten myself into a bit 
                        of trouble, no?

           Leonard chuckles. He sits.

                                 LEONARD
                        I’ve been in that waiting room 
                        before.

                                 MARIE
                        I wondered if you remembered.

                                 LEONARD
                        After dad’s accident.

                                 MARIE
                        Have you visited him lately?

           Leonard forces a smile. Changing the subject:

                                 LEONARD
                        How’re you feeling?

                                 MARIE
                        Wonderful. They have me on 
                        something.

           There’s a twinkle in Marie’s eye.

                                 LEONARD
                        I’ve got some good news.

                                 MARIE
                        Hm?

                                 LEONARD
                        You can go home tomorrow.

                                 MARIE
                        Noo!

                                 LEONARD
                        Yeah.

                                 MARIE
                        Ohh, Lenny! 

                                 LEONARD
                        M.O.H. is going to put your bed in 
                        the living room. And they’ll have a 
                        full time health care worker there 
                        to make sure you’re comfortable.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, that’s wonderf-
           Marie begins coughing. It goes on a while. Leonard suppresses 
           how sad and worried it makes him. 

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be nice to be home.

                                 LEONARD
                        Do you need anything before then? 
                        Can I do anything for you?

           She looks at him. There’s clearly something very important 
           that she needs. But she’s worried about asking...

                                 MARIE
                        Well Maggie’s been watering the 
                        plants while I’ve away-

                                 LEONARD
                        Yeah. Of course. I’ll get her a 
                        bottle of something nice.

                                 MARIE
                        And John needs you to sign some 
                        things for the will.

                                 LEONARD
                        Sure. I’ll stop by his office 
                        tomorrow before I get you. Anything 
                        else?

                                 MARIE
                        Yes.

           She looks at him. This one is big...

           Leonard gets it. He leans in.

                                 LEONARD
                        What is it, Mom? What?

                                 MARIE
                        I would also like you to fall in 
                        love, please.

           Leonard takes that in. Surprised. Confused. Tickled.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        There was a letter.

                                 LEONARD
                             (gently)
                        Mom-

                                 MARIE
                        Just listen. There was a letter-

                                 LEONARD
                        Dad’s letter.
                                 MARIE
                        Yes. And he said-

                                 LEONARD
                        That wasn’t-

                                 MARIE
                        He said that I would meet the woman 
                        our son would marry.

           Leonard takes a deep breath.

                                 LEONARD
                        Mom, have the doctors talked to you 
                        about how much time you have?

                                 MARIE
                        The doctors don’t understand.

                                 LEONARD
                        Have they?

                                 MARIE
                        The letter-

                                 LEONARD
                        It was a love letter. Dad couldn’t- 
                        Mom... Dad couldn’t read the 
                        future. It was just romantic-

                                 MARIE
                        No.

                                 LEONARD
                        Mom, you know I would love- Of 
                        course I would, but... the doctors 
                        are saying you only have a few 
                        days.

                                 MARIE
                        They don’t understand.

                                 LEONARD
                        Understand what?

                                 MARIE
                        That I won’t die until you have 
                        someone, Leonard. I won’t do it.

                                 LEONARD
                        I just want you to manage your 
                        expectations. 

           Behind him, the door quietly opens; and through it - out of 
           focus - enters a NURSE.

                                 (MORE)
                                 LEONARD (CONT'D)
                        I mean, who do you imagine, over 
                        the next few days, is going to 
                        magically walk into my life...

           The nurse comes into clearer focus. She’s a young woman... we 
           get where this is going.

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        ...that I’ll suddenly fall so 
                        desperately in love with that-

                                 CECILE
                        Marie?

           Leonard turns to the voice and finds:

           CECILE-- who we of course remember divorcing Sanjay on page 

                                 CECILE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Cecile. 

                                 LEONARD
                             (to himself)
                        Right...

           SOUND OF A BICYCLE BELL CLING CLING...

           A BICYCLE flies through frame as we whip pan to follow it.

                        Of course, Marie didn’t die over 
                        the next few days, nor did she die 
                        over the next few weeks, nor the 
                        next few months.

           She passes a gate and enters...

           MARIE’S PROPERTY - CONTINUOUS

           She climbs off her bike as it wheels toward the front porch.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And over the course of a year, she 
                        and Leonard - along with her nurse, 
                        Cecile - developed a home together.
           INT. MARIE’S HOME - FRONT HALL

           Cecile enters the house. She’s holding flowers.

                                 CECILE
                        Hello!

           Leonard calls out:

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        Hi!

           He pops his head out of the kitchen. 

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        I’m making salmon. Are you hungry?

                                 CECILE
                        Starving!

           Marie calls out from the LIVING ROOM.

                                 MARIE
                        Cecile, those are beautiful!

                                 CECILE
                        Merci, Marie! I got them for you.

           She walks into the...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cecile and Marie admire the flowers together...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Every night the three of them 
                        shared dinner, and then Leonard 
                        would read to Marie.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Leonard reads to Marie.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was his favorite time of the 
                        day.

           Marie sits quietly, peering toward Leonard.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Marie’s favorite time came later, 
                        when she would interrupt her son to 
                        ask-

                                 MARIE
                        Did you fall in love today?
           Cecile sits in the corner, knitting. She grins.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Cecile cherished it all. She 
                        cherished Marie. And although she 
                        hardly admitted it to herself. She 
                        cherished Leonard also. She loved 
                        him. She loved the way he...

           CLOSE ON-- Leonard, running his hands through his hair...

                        The way he...

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Leonard, doing dishes. Humming to himself.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She loved how terribly he lied.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Leonard talks with Cecile.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh, yeah, yeah. I’ve seen that 
                        movie.

                                 CECILE
                             (smiling)
                        You haven’t, have you?

                                 LEONARD
                             (laughing)
                        No. No I haven’t. I just didn’t 
                        want to stop your story...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She loved the way he looked when he 
                        felt confused...
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Leonard, learning a card game, trying to understand the 
           rules...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And that he wrote down words he 
                        didn’t know...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Leonard reading.

                                 LEONARD
                        Hold on...

           Jotting down a word. 

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t know that one.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And she loved the way he loved her.

                        And Leonard did love her. He loved 
                        the way she...

           Cecile, asleep on a rocking chair, sighs deeply.

                        ...when she watched a movie. He 
                        loved the way, when she thought 
                        deeply about something, she...

           Cecile, thinking, taps her pencil against her lips.

           EXT. MARIE’S HOME - MORNING

           From a distance, we see Leonard talking with Cecile.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And Leonard loved that she was 
                        married, because it freed him from 
                        the overwhelming anxiety he’d feel 
                        in trying to court her if she 
                        wasn’t; and it absolved him of the 
                        disappointment he’d surely endure 
                        upon his failure. But more than 
                        anything, he loved that she was 
                        there. Simply there, every night, 
                        as he read...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Leonard is reading to Marie.

                                 LEONARD 
                        “About here she thought, dabbling 
                        her fingers in the water, a ship 
                        had sunk, and she muttered, 
                        dreamily half asleep, how we 
                        perish, each alone.”
                             (re: the passage)
                        God. This is really grim. Are you 
                        sure you want me reading this?

           Marie looks at him.

                                 MARIE
                        I’d have died yesterday if I knew 
                        you’d had someone. 

                                 LEONARD
                        Well, god. That’s even more grim.
           We find Cecile, tucked away in the corner of the living room, 
           preparing medications.

           She smiles over Marie’s melodrama.

                                 MARIE
                        I know exactly when it would have 
                        been. I was looking here...
                             (gesturing out the window)
                        ...and a cloud passed over the sun, 
                        and the wind blew, and then, for a 
                        moment, there was an incredible 
                        silence, and I thought...
                             (in French)
                        ...this would be a nice time to go.

                        But then I remembered how un-
                        married my son is, and so I 
                        wrenched myself back in.

                                 LEONARD
                        Well, I’m glad you did.

                                 MARIE
                        They gave me three days - week at 
                        the most - to live.

           Cecile approaches.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Three days, Cecile. A week at the 
                        most!

           Cecile shares a smile with Leonard.

                                 CECILE
                        And here you are.

                                 MARIE
                        And here I am.

                                 LEONARD
                        And here you are.

           Cecile approaches with Marie’s medication.

                                 MARIE
                        And you don’t feel bad about that?
                             (for Cecile)
                        Ahhhh.

           Cecile drops the medicine on Marie’s tongue.

                                 LEONARD
                        No, and even if it were true-

                                 MARIE
                        It is!
                                 LEONARD
                        Even if it were true that a person 
                        could avoid death for some abstract 
                        reason-

                                 MARIE
                        It is true!

                                 LEONARD
                        Even if it were! I still wouldn’t 
                        feel bad, you know why?

                                 MARIE
                        Why?

                                 LEONARD
                        Because here you are! And I don’t 
                        want you to die!

                                 MARIE
                        But I do Lenny! And of course it’s 
                        possible to avoid death for 
                        abstract reasons! People avoid life 
                        for abstract reasons all the time! 
                        You don’t think the opposite can be 
                        true? I’m in pain, Lenny.

                                 LEONARD
                        I know.

                                 MARIE
                        So maybe tomorrow? Maybe you’ll 
                        find someone tomorrow?

           Leonard takes a deep breath. Heartbroken:

                                 LEONARD
                        Maybe.

                                 MARIE
                        I can’t die until you have someone, 
                        Lenny. 

                                 LEONARD
                        I know.

                                 MARIE
                        I can’t do it.

           Cecile swallows listening to this. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was always at this moment, 
                        however, that Cecile would feel the 
                        sadness of reality re-envelope her.
           EXT. NAPA VALLEY - STREET - PRE DAWN

           Cecile rides her bike through the streets. The sky brightens 
           with each new shot.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Because love was not as simple as 
                        Marie seemed to imagine. It was a 
                        labyrinth you had to work, and 
                        solve, and try to beat. A labyrinth 
                        that, at present, Cecile and her 
                        husband Sanjay were losing very 
                        badly.

           INT. CECILE’S APARTMENT HALLWAY - MORNING

           Cecile enters.

           We stay outside the apartment. We hear from inside:

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Cecile?

                                 CECILE
                        Sanjay?

           The door closes.

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                             (muffled through door)
                        Hey! I’m sorry- I didn’t have time 
                        to make a proper breakfast.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           THE SAME SHOT. 

           SOUND OF MUFFLED YELLING.

           We hear:

                                 SANJAY (O.S.)
                        Because of how incredibly sad you 
                        make me.

           The door opens.

           We see, between the threshold and the door, Cecile’s 
           miserably exhausted face.

                                 CECILE
                        We need to get a divorce.

           We stay here a moment, remembering that we’ve seen this 
           exchange before...
           INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

           Cecile stares out of the window. She looks numb. She looks 
           down at her hand. No wedding band. 

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        Hi.

           Cecile turns to find Leonard.

                                 CECILE
                        Hi.

                                 LEONARD
                        You okay?

                                 CECILE
                        Yeah. Is she-

                                 LEONARD
                        Asleep.

                                 CECILE
                             (glancing at her tablet)
                        Oh.

                                 LEONARD
                        You sure you’re okay?

                                 CECILE
                        Yeah. I um...

           She rubs her wedding finger.

                                 CECILE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. I’m just off today.

           Leonard nods. I see. 

           He hesitates.

                                 LEONARD
                        I uh... I got you something.

           She looks at him. Eyes beginning to water.

           He walks over with a present.

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Just a, um, thank you. For the past 
                        year.

           He hands her a book with a little bow on it. It’s a FRENCH 
           PHRASE BOOK.

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        So you can keep practicing once...
           Cecile wipes a tear out of her eye.

                                 CECILE
                        Thank you.

           INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Cecile watches as Leonard exits the house and walks across 
           the front yard. 

           She looks at her ring-less finger again and takes a deep 
           breath.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Cecile enters. She looks at Marie sleeping. And then, loudly, 
           says:

                                 CECILE
                        Hello, Marie.

           Marie turns.

                                 MARIE
                        How did you know I wasn’t sleeping?

                                 CECILE
                             (re: the tablet)
                        I know everything!

                                 MARIE
                        Gah! The future! 
                             (in French)
                        You take all the mystery out of 
                        life!

           Cecile sits down and begins administering medications for 
           Marie.

                                 CECILE
                             (repeating in French)
                        You take all the mystery out of...

           She mumbles the last bit.

                                 MARIE
                             (in French)
                        Out. Of. Life.

                                 CECILE
                             (in French)
                        Out. Of. Life.

                                 MARIE
                        Tres bien.
           BEAT. Marie inspects Cecile.

                                 CECILE
                        How are you feeling?

                                 MARIE
                        Terrible.

                                 CECILE
                        Physically?

                                 MARIE
                        Physically, I’m fine. 

                                 CECILE
                        Emotionally?

                                 MARIE
                        Terrible.

           Cecile cracks a smile.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand. He told me in 
                        the letter.

                                 CECILE
                        What’s that?

                                 MARIE
                        He wrote it. “What I wouldn’t give 
                        to be with you, the moment you meet 
                        the woman he’ll one day marry.” He 
                        told me-

                                 CECILE
                        What are you-

                                 MARIE
                        I’m supposed to meet the woman he 
                        marries. I don’t die until I do.

                                 CECILE
                        I know.

                                 MARIE
                        So where is she?

                                 CECILE
                             (casually without 
                              thinking)
                        Maybe you have met her.

           Marie considers that. She looks at Cecile.

                                 MARIE
                        What?
                                 CECILE
                        Maybe you met her. It could have 
                        been years ago. Maybe you met her, 
                        it’s just no one realizes she’ll be 
                        married to Leonard one day.

                                 MARIE
                        Maybe I’ve met her...

           She stares at Cecile. 

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                             (realizing)
                        You’re not wearing your wedding 
                        ring.

                                 CECILE
                        Oh. No.

                                 MARIE
                        It’s you.

                                 CECILE
                        No, no, no.

                                 MARIE
                        Of course it is! What happened to 
                        your ring?

                                 CECILE
                        Well. We decided-

                                 MARIE
                        When?

                                 CECILE
                        Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        Come! I see the way you look at 
                        him. And the way he looks at you! 
                        Of course!

                                 CECILE
                        No. Marie. Really.

                                 MARIE
                        What? He’s handsome, no?

                                 CECILE
                        I-

                                 MARIE
                        And he’s kind?

                                 CECILE
                        Of course-
                                 MARIE
                        He’s handsome, he’s kind, why not 
                        try?

                                 CECILE
                        I-

                                 MARIE
                        Please, Cecile. Please.

           Marie looks so desperate, so vulnerable.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t go until he has someone. 

                                 CECILE
                        I know.

                                 MARIE
                        So won’t you? Won’t you try?

           Cecile taps her lips, concerned. She shouldn’t. 

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Please?

           Oh, dear. She is...

                                 CECILE
                        Well, you see... we have.

                                 MARIE
                             (in disbelief)
                        No!

                                 CECILE
                        But we didn’t want to tell you.

           Marie’s face lights up.

                                 MARIE
                        Tell me what?

                                 CECILE
                        Well, we’ve started to see each 
                        other.

                                 MARIE
                        No!

                                 CECILE
                        Yes.

                                 MARIE
                        Why- Wha- Why would you keep that a 
                        secret?!
                                 CECILE
                        We didn’t want to get your hopes up 
                        in case it didn’t work out.

                                 MARIE
                        How long has it been?!

                                 CECILE
                        A while. 

                                 MARIE
                        Really?

                                 CECILE
                        Oh yes. A long while.

                                 MARIE
                        And is he good to you?

                                 CECILE
                        Oh... yes. 

                                 MARIE
                        Tell me!

                                 CECILE
                        Well... He’s kind. He’s the kindest 
                        man I’ve ever known. And sweet. He 
                        brings me little things he finds 
                        that remind him of me. And he holds 
                        my hand. He makes me feel 
                        beautiful. All the things I don’t 
                        like about myself, when I’m with 
                        him, I somehow love. And he makes 
                        me laugh.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh yes. He’s very funny.

                                 CECILE
                        Yes, but it’s not just that. I find 
                        myself smiling even when he’s not 
                        being funny. Like when he looks 
                        concerned about finding parking, or 
                        deciding which movie to see.

                                 MARIE
                        So you’ve traveled even?

                                 CECILE
                        Oh, yes. We’ve traveled through the 
                        future and the past.

           Marie, eyes welling with tears, folds her hands and presses 
           them against her chest.

                                 MARIE
                        How did it begin?
                                 CECILE
                        Um... here. You had fallen asleep 
                        and we went on a walk together. He 
                        told me about his childhood. How 
                        much he cares for you. And how all 
                        he wanted was to be as good a 
                        husband to his wife as his father 
                        was to you. And how all he needed 
                        was to find a woman as wonderful 
                        for him as you were to his father. 
                        And I thought, even then, on that 
                        first night, it could be me. I 
                        wanted it to be me so much.

           Marie drifts off.

                                 MARIE
                        And do you think it is? 

                                 CECILE
                             (in French)
                        Yes. I do. 
                             (in English)
                        I really do.

           Marie, almost gone now, has one last burst of euphoria and 
           passes.

           Cecile is surprised.

                                 CECILE (CONT’D)
                        Marie?
                             (nervous)
                        Marie!?

           ON Cecile: What have I done?

           CRASH OF THUNDER.

           EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING

           Bird’s eye view of UMBRELLAS OPENING as rain begins to fall 
           upon on open grave.

           People file in line to throw dirt over Marie’s casket.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The funeral took place on a rainy 
                        morning a week later, on the date 
                        of Marie’s birth, in Paris, 1942. 

           We find the Narrator amongst those mourning.

                                 NARRATOR
                        I attended, of course. I always do. 
                        Leonard gave a moving speech. Marie 
                        was present, obviously. 
           We see a TIGHT SHOT of Marie’s casket.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        And Cecile. 

           We see Cecile. Crying.

           Cecile throws dirt over the grave. Leonard watches her.

           CEMETERY - LATER

           Mourners approach Leonard to offer condolences. 

                                 MOURNER 1
                        I’m so sorry, Lenny.

                                 LEONARD
                        Thank you.

                                 MOURNER 2
                        I’m sorry, Leonard.

                                 LEONARD
                        Thank you.

                                 CECILE
                        Leonard.

           Leonard turns to find Cecile. Relieved, he gasps:

                                 LEONARD
                        Cecile.

                                 CECILE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 LEONARD
                        Listen, I wanted to tell you-

                                 CECILE
                        No. I don’t- I told her...

                                 LEONARD
                        What? Cecile, what happened?

                                 CECILE
                        I don’t know why I did it. I told 
                        her- She was just so- because she 
                        wanted it to be true. And I...

           Leonard begins to understand.

                                 LEONARD
                        You told her-

                                 MOURNER 3
                        Leonard.
                                 LEONARD
                             (the mourner)
                        Yes, just...

                                 CECILE
                        I’m so sorry, Leonard.

                                 LEONARD
                             (distracted by the line of 
                              mourners)
                        Will you just give me one second.

                                 CECILE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 MOURNER 4
                        I’m sorry, Leonard. 

           Leonard turns to the mourner.

                                 LEONARD
                        Thank you. I-

                                 MOURNER 4
                        She was an incredible spirit.

                                 LEONARD
                        Thank you. If I could just- Just 
                        one second, I need to-

           He turns back to Cecile...

           ...but she’s gone.

           He looks around for her... She’s no where.

           INT. MINISTRY OF HEALTH BUILDING - DAY

           Leonard sits at the desk of an ADMINISTRATOR.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        What was her name?

                                 LEONARD
                        Cecile Patel. P-A-T-E-L. She was 
                        with my mom for the last year.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Yes. Here. It looks like Cecile 
                        left the Ministry of Health, 
                        though.

                                 LEONARD
                        She...? 
                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Left. Last week. I have her 
                        address, though.

           EXT. CECILE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Leonard talks with Sanjay outside of the apartment.

                                 SANJAY
                        I haven’t seen her since she asked 
                        for the divorce. 

                                 LEONARD
                        The divorce?

                                 SANJAY
                        Yeah. She just left. Out of 
                        nowhere.

                                 LEONARD
                        I see. I’m sorry.

                                 SANJAY
                        Who are you?

                                 LEONARD
                        I’m- She took care of my mom. I 
                        just... wanted to thank her.

                                 SANJAY
                        Yeah well, I’m sorry I can’t help 
                        you.

           Leonard nods, and goes to leave.

                                 LEONARD
                        Thanks.

                                 SANJAY
                        France maybe.

           Leonard turns back.

                                 SANJAY (CONT’D)
                        She talked a lot lately about 
                        wanting to learn French. I figure 
                        maybe there. Don’t know where or 
                        when though.

           Leonard nods. That helps.

                                 LEONARD
                        Thanks. 

                                 SANJAY
                        Yeah.
           Leonard jogs off. Sanjay watches him. Probably understanding.

           EXT. PARIS STREET - FAR FUTURE - DAY

           Leonard walks along the Seine-- looking.

           EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - FAR PAST - DAY

           Leonard walks the street-- Looking.

           EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY - DAY

           A mid 20th-century bus chugs along a French country road.

           INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Leonard stares out the window and watches the passing 
           scenery.

           EXT. PARIS STREET - MID 20TH CENTURY - NIGHT

           Leonard sits at a sidewalk cafe. He finishes a glass of wine.

           A WAITER approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        Another?

           Leonard thinks.

                                 LEONARD
                        No. No, I’m done.

           EXT. NAPA VALLEY VINEYARD - DAY

           Leonard looks out at the empty vineyard.

           It’s the vineyard we originally met him in.

           A “FOR SALE” sign is removed behind him.

           EXT. VINEYARD - DAY

           Leonard works the ground. Planting vines.

           Behind him, a small shed he’s built, next to the structure of 
           the house he’s building.
           EXT. VINEYARD - DAY

           Vines are growing.

           Leonard types into a holographic screen. Next to him lies a 
           WATERING DRONE. The DRONE JUMPS UP and begins hovering.

           Behind him, the house is nearly finished.

           EXT. VINEYARD - EVENING

           It’s our OPENING SCENE.

           Leonard walks through the vineyard. Checking his grapes. He 
           bends down, rubs his fingers through the dirt, touches the 
           leaves, smells the vine.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Leonard. In bed alone. Watching the holographic screen 
           projected at the foot of his bed.

                                 REPORTER
                        The Quintennial Cup continues 
                        tomorrow with the semi-final match. 
                        German Captain Rolf Mueller leads

           SOUND OF DING. 

           FULL SCREEN VIDEO 

           A quick PIANO INTRO accompanies the TEXT ON HIS SCREEN: 
           MINISTRY OF HEALTH with the voice over:

                                 VOICEOVER
                        This is a message from the Ministry 
                        of Health’s Inter-time Hospital and 
                        Research Facility.

           On Leonard’s face.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The hospital ward is empty.

           Leonard sits next to his father’s bed. He’s reading. 

           It’s dark except for the little lamp he has on.
           There’s the Narrator. Unconscious.

           Leonard puts the book on his lap. Closes his eyes. Nodding 
           off. Almost asleep.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Hello, son.

           Leonard wakes up.

           He looks at his father. Awake. 

           He breaks down. They hug.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Leonard pours two glasses of wine.

                                 NARRATOR
                        At first it was to change 
                        everything. With your mother. To be 
                        better for her. But that didn’t 
                        work because it adjusted our 
                        timeline so that we wouldn’t have 
                        you. Dozens of dimensions you 
                        originally existed in that now...

                                 LEONARD
                        God.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Yeah. Sorry.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Then it was just being a good 
                        father. I went into dimensions. 
                        Hundreds of thousands. And relived 
                        my life to be the perfect dad. I 
                        changed the past so that I never 
                        had my accident, and lived.

                                 LEONARD
                        But you stopped. Otherwise I 
                        wouldn’t be here now.

                                 NARRATOR
                        I stopped. Living the same life 
                        over and over, knowing exactly what 
                        to do and say to make everything 
                        perfect, makes nothing perfect. And 
                        I changed. I was no longer me. I 
                        was no longer a person. I just 
                        became this... craftsman of time. 
                        And I couldn't make you happy like 
                        that.
                                 LEONARD
                        An immortal being with god like 
                        control of time and space can’t 
                        make me happy. There isn’t much 
                        hope is there?

           The Narrator chuckles.

           One Leonard, realizing:

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        You’ve heard me make that joke 
                        before.

           The Narrator nods.

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        How many times?

                                 NARRATOR
                        Enough times to know it’s different 
                        every time. And the nuances still 
                        make me laugh.

                                 LEONARD
                        So then... what is all of this? 
                        What are you doing?

                                 NARRATOR
                        I conduct a carousel. And it leads 
                        to this moment. So that I can tell 
                        you one thing: 

           Leonard braces himself for the gravity of this...

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        You aren’t going to live happily 
                        ever after. It’s going to be hard. 
                        And you’re going to be sad. But it 
                        will be good.

           On Leonard -- As that washes over him.

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        I love you, son.

                                 LEONARD
                        I love you...

           Leonard tears up. 

           He looks down and wipes the tears from his eyes.

                                 LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Dad.

           He looks up.
           The Narrator, of course, is gone.

           Leonard looks around the room.

           By the door is a tuxedo and a small box.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        If you stop for just a minute. You 
                        can hear the sounds of time 
                        passing:

           Leonard opens the box. Inside, there is a note. “Why don’t 
           put on this wonderful suit and go to 38 Rue de Sèvres. Love, 
           Dad.”

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Film flickering through a 
                        projector...

           HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Leonard, clean shaven, tying his bow tie.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Keys unlocking a door before 
                        discovering who’s behind it.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Leonard, in his tuxedo, walking down the quiet Parisian 
           street.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Or the silence that exists between 
                        a question being asked, and a 
                        question being answered. Who are 
                        you? And where? When? Are you in 
                        the theater now? At home? Are you 
                        happy? What do you regret? Who do 
                        you miss? 

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Leonard approaches a cafe. It’s the cafe where we originally 
           met the Narrator. The cafe, we remember, where Leonard 
           found...

           Leonard walks toward the door, exiting frame.

           Inside, we see something that he does not: Cecile, waiting 
           tables.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And what, exactly, is it that you 
                        want?

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                 THE END
